            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE following Relations contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters very considerable and remarkable, cannot certainly be displeasing to any good natur'd Reader; for it may be some diversion to observe what Wonders are told of those once famous Places in and about <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and what New <hi>Legends</hi> are daily added, as it may stand with the Interest (that is to say, the profit) of the Priests.</p>
            <p>As to the Great Council in <hi>Hungaria,</hi> in 1650. and the strange Delusions wherewith the <hi>Jews</hi> were possest by a <hi>Counterfeit Messiah, or False Christ,</hi> in and about <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and many other Countries: Likewise their utter Extirpation out of the Kingdom and Dominions of the Emperour of <hi>Persia,</hi> in 1666. We may with our Author observe, how signally the hand of the Almighty has been stretcht out
<pb facs="tcp:35259:6"/>
against the <hi>Jews,</hi> so that if they were not under a <hi>Judicial hardness of heart,</hi> certainly these continued Tokens of Divine Vengeance would cause them to Reflect upon themselves, and by a serious Repentance and imbracing of the Doctrines of the Lord Iesus Christ, the <hi>True Messiah</hi> and <hi>Saviour of the World,</hi> to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to remove that Curse which their Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wished might fall upon themselves, and their children, when they Crucified the Son of God, and the Lord of Life and Glory, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they have so severely smarted in most Nations whither they have been scattered, for above these sixteen hundred years.</p>
            <p>As to the Reality of these brief Relations, they were all written by several <hi>Englishmen</hi> of undoubted Veracity and Credit, and who were upon the Places where these remarkable things were Transacted, and therefore need not beg, but may rather command Belief.</p>

            <head>A Brief Description of <hi>Palestine</hi> with an account of the Ancient and Modern State of those Countries.</head>
            <p>IN Former Ages, this was one of the most famous Provinces of <hi>Syria</hi>: Called, 1. The Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> from <hi>Canaan</hi> the Son of <hi>Cham,</hi> who by his often chasings, was driven to possess and inhabit the same. 2. It was called the <hi>Land of Promise,</hi> because God had promised it to the Patriarchs, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and their Seed. 3. <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> from <hi>Jacob,</hi> who was surnamed <hi>Israel.</hi> 4. <hi>Judea</hi> from the <hi>Jews,</hi> or People of the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> 5. <hi>Palestine,</hi> by <hi>Ptolomays</hi> and others, <hi>quasi Philistini</hi>: The Land of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> a potent Nation that dwelt there. 6. The Holy Land by the Christians, because herein was wrought by <hi>Christ</hi> the Work of our Salvation.</p>
            <p>This Country is situated in the midst of the World, between the Third and Fourth Climates, the longest day being 14 hours and a quarter, between the <hi>Midland Sea</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia,</hi> from which it is Bulwarked beyond <hi>Jordan</hi> with a continual Ridge of Mountains;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35259:7"/>
on the East lyes <hi>Celosyria</hi> and <hi>Arabia Petrea</hi>; on the South <hi>Idumea,</hi> the Wilderness of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi>; in the West a part of <hi>Pheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> and the rest hath the <hi>Mediterranean Sea</hi>; and on the North are the Mountains of <hi>Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and a part of <hi>Phenicia</hi>: It is distant from the Equinoctial 31 Degrees, extending to 33 so that in length from <hi>Dan</hi> unto <hi>Beesheba,</hi> it containeth not more than 400 Miles; and where it is broadest, not 50.</p>
            <p>This famous Land was once commended above all Countries under the Sun, for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubrity of the Air, being seated under a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Clime, where Winter is not too cold, nor Summer too hot; and for Fertility, a Land that flowed with Milk and Honey, adorned with Beautiful Mountains, and delightful Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys; the Rocks producing excellent Waters, and no part empty of delight or profit; for the Soil yields abundance of all fruits and increase.</p>
            <p>This Land aboundeth in sweet Springs, and Pleasant Pastures, where they feed a great many Flocks of Sheep, and Herds of Cattle, and Cows, which give excellent Milk, as is in any Country in the World: There is also brave Hunting and Hawking for Dear, Goats, Hares, Partridges, Quails and other Birds: they have all kind of Fowl; also there are Lions, Bears and Wolves, found in abundance.</p>
            <p>The Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was heretofore divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35259:7"/>
into 30 Kingdoms, and Kings, when the <hi>Israelites</hi> conquered it; most of the Ancient Inhabitants being for their sins by God exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Land, and put to the Sword by the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who Ruled this Land, about 400 Years, by Princes and Judges till the time of <hi>Samuel</hi>: These Princes or Judges, were not all of one Tribe, but the Best, Gravest, and Eldest, Selected and chosen out of every Tribe. Afterwards the <hi>Israelites</hi> growing weary of this Government, at their earnest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, the Lord appointed them a King, and so their Government was Changed into a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> which continued many Ages; but process of time, the <hi>Israelites</hi> endured many Miseries and Afflictions, till at last they saw the utter Ruine and subversion of their Kingdom.</p>
            <p>VVhat Alterations happened to this Nation and with how many several VVars they were Plagued either for their own stiff-neckedness, that they would not be Obedient to their own Prince, or brook any forreign Government, or that for their Rebellion and Sins, the VVrath of God was oftentimes Kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; or that Forreign Princes were Ambitious to Incorporate this happy Land, Holy VVrit and <hi>Historiographers</hi> VVitness the same at large, how many times were they subdued and brought into Bondage, because of their Sins, and that they did not behav-themselves

well; for sometimes their Neck, were brought under the Yoaks of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as the <hi>Egyptians, Chaldeans, Medes, Persians, Macedonians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi>; and yet they would never cease their Rebellions, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and Conspiracies, till they had brought their Government and Countrey to utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, by Persecuting, and putting to death, the Saints and Prophets, sent them from God; yea, and at last Crucifying the Son of God, the Lord of Glory, and the Saviour of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which accordingly soon after happened, to the utter Desolation of their Countrey, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> laying waste, and levelling to the Ground the Magnificent Structures and Buildings thereof, so that herein was verified the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of Christ while he was upon the Earth, <hi>That one Stone should not be left upon another.</hi> And as for the People, Divine Vengeance did continually pursue them till the most part were destroyed, and the rest Dispersed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out out the World, even to this Day.</p>
            <p>For first, the Inhabitants of <hi>Caesarea</hi> slew of the <hi>Jews</hi> in one Day, about 20000. and such as fled, were taken and Imprisoned by <hi>Florus</hi> the Lieutenant of <hi>Judea.</hi> To Revenge this Slaughter, the <hi>Jews</hi> set upon the <hi>Syrians</hi>;

            <p>This <hi>Vespasian,</hi> in the Seige of <hi>Aphaca,</hi> slew and took Prisoners Seventeen Thousand, one Hundred and Thirty Persons: in <hi>Samaria</hi> 11600, and in <hi>Iosepata</hi> 42200 Persons.

            <p>In the City of <hi>Tarichea,</hi> were Slain and made Captives, Forty five Thousand, besides those which were given to King <hi>Agrippa</hi>: In <hi>Gamala</hi> there perished Ninety Thousand, and none left alive but only two Women.

so much that 30 <hi>Jews</hi> were sold for a Penny.</p>
            <p>Now that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was able to contain such a number of People, is evident, in that when <hi>Cestius</hi> was Lieutenant of <hi>Jury,</hi> the High Priest at his Request, numbered the People which came to Eat of the <hi>Paschal</hi> Lamb, and found them to be two Millions, and Seven Hundred Thousand living Souls, all sound and Purified. And when <hi>Titus</hi> laid Siege to the City, it was at the Feast of the Passover, when most of the People were there assemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; God as it were thus Imprisoning them.</p>
            <p>All these Massacres, besides divers others O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and infinite Numbers slain in the Fields and Villages, which drowned themselves, and were privately made away, Amounting to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most two Millions of People, happened in the compass of four Years, beginning in the twelfth of <hi>Nero,</hi> and ending in the second of <hi>Vespasian.</hi>

            <p>Yet was not the whole Nation Rooted out till 136.

            <p>After this Desolation, the <hi>Jews</hi> were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed over the World, and especially in <hi>Spain,</hi> where <hi>Adrian</hi> Commanded many of them to dwell; yet found every where so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

            </p>
            <p>The first Christian Prince that expelled the <hi>Jews</hi> out of his Territories, was that Heroick King, <hi>Edward</hi> 1. who was such a sore Scourge also to the <hi>Scots</hi>; and it is thought divers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of those Banished <hi>Jews</hi> fled then to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where they have propagated since in great Numbers: Witness the Aversion this Nation hath above others to Hogs-Flesh.</p>
            <p>Nor was this their Extermination for their Religion, but for their notorious Crimes; as poisoning of Wells, Counterfeiting of Coins, falsifying of Seals, and Crucifying of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Children; with other Villanies. This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the Year 1291. And 16 Years after, <hi>France</hi> followed our Example.

            </p>

            <p>
               <hi>Asia</hi> is full of them, as <hi>Aleppo, Tripoly, Damas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, Rhodes,</hi> and indeed all places of commerce and traffique; There are numbers also in <hi>Persia, Arabia,</hi> and about <hi>Cranganor</hi> in <hi>India.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Africk,</hi> they have their Synagogues and Lumbards, as in <hi>Alexandria, Grand Cairo, Fesse, Trimesen,</hi> and divers places in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Morocco</hi>: there are about 100 Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies left in <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> But the place where they are most unmingled, is <hi>Tiberias,</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi> gave to <hi>Mendez</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> for some signal services; thither they oft bring or send the bones of their dead friends, who have left large Legacies, to be there interred from other places.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified by <hi>Elius Adrianus,</hi> and given to the Christians, from whom it was taken by <hi>Cosroes,</hi> and the <hi>Persians,</hi> in the Year 615. and from them forcibly wrested by <hi>Haumar,</hi> and the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens,</hi> in 637. Next it fell into the power of <hi>Cutlu Moses,</hi> and the <hi>Turks,</hi> in 1009. under whose oppressions, when it had long groaned, <hi>Peter</hi> the Hermite stirred up the <hi>Western</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to relieve the distressed Christians, whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs attained their wished effect, under the Banner of the Victorious Prince, <hi>Godfrey</hi> of

this River Springeth out of two Fountains, not far distant one from the other; the one called <hi>Jor,</hi> the other <hi>Dan,</hi> shooting out like two Horns, which meeting together, make the great River <hi>Jordan.</hi> The Chief Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in the Holy Land are Mount <hi>Hermon,</hi> lying in the East part thereof, and Mount <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor</hi> in the West, both of them being very Great and High, so that the other Hills about them, are but Arms and Branches of them: For the Mountains <hi>Ebal Betheron, Mispa</hi> or <hi>Mospoa,</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> are reckoned under Mount <hi>Hermon; Gilboa, Gerezin, Saron</hi> and <hi>Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Carmel</hi> by the Sea side, are counted under Mount <hi>Tabor.</hi>

            <p>In this Land, especially in and about <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> there were many Stately and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Buildings, as Namely, <hi>Mons Domus</hi> and the Castle of the <hi>Jebusites,</hi> into which King <hi>David</hi> brought the Ark of the Lord, where it remained till <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple was Finished. The remainder and ruines of these Buildings, are yet to be seen to this Day; yea, it is said, that in the very place, the Lord Christ Eat the <hi>Paschal</hi> Lamb with his Disciples: There are also the Sepulchres of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35259:13"/>
               <hi>David,</hi> and other Kings of <hi>Judah</hi>; and the House of <hi>David,</hi> which yet retaineth the Name of <hi>Davids</hi> Tower. Upon Mount <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah</hi> are to be seen some remainders of <hi>Mello.</hi> Above all, we must call to mind the most Excellent and Beautiful Temple of King <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> upon which One Hundred and Fifty Thousand Men wrought Seven Years con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually till it was Finished. The Glory and Magnificency thereof you may read in the Scripture. The Temple of the Sepulchre at the first Building was highly Reverenced by the Christians of those parts, and even until this Day it is much resorted to, both by Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims from all parts of the Romish Church and by divers Gentlemen of the Reformed Churches; partly for curiosity, and partly for Antiquity of the place. It is Farmed from the <hi>Turk</hi> and kept by the <hi>Popes</hi> Creatures; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is admitted to the sight of this Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, payeth nine Crowns to the <hi>Turkish</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers: so that this Tribute is worth to the Grand Seignior, Eight Thousand Ducats Yearly.</p>

thus from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> I salute you. You shall understand, that since my departure from <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> towards the Holy Land, I wrote you a letter from <hi>Rama</hi>; the place where the voice was heard of <hi>Rachel,</hi> weeping for her Children; wherein I certified you of all my proceedings from <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> to that place; I sent it with seven other Letters to <hi>Damasco</hi> in a Caravan, from thence to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to <hi>Constantinople</hi>: But doubting lest the said Packet is not as yet come to your hands, I thought good to write again to you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all my aforesaid proceedings; as also the rest of my voyage to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> with my imprisonment and troubles in the City, and what memorable Antiquities I saw there and else where, until my return back to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi>; First, you shall know, that I Depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from <hi>Grand Cairo</hi> the ninth of <hi>March,</hi> upon which day I came to the place where (it is said) the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> staid with our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ: So far was I accompanied by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Thorpe,</hi> and four others that went to <hi>Grand Cairo</hi> with me, but there left me and I with my fellow Traveller, Mr. <hi>John Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,</hi> both of us being in our Pilgrims habits, came that night to a Town called <hi>Canko,</hi> where we were glad to take up our lodging in a yard, having no other bed than the bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Greeks and Armenians, who purposed to Travel to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which made us glad of their company. At this Town named <hi>Philbits,</hi> we stayed two days and one night: in which time I went into a house where I saw a very strange secret of hatching of Chickens, by artificial heat, or warmth: the like I had seen before at <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> but not in such numbers as here: the manner as followeth. The Country people, four or five miles distant every way, bring their Eggs upon Asses or Camels, to this place; where there is an Oven, or Furnace, kept tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately warm, and the Furner or Master stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ready at a little door to receive the Eggs by tale; unless when the number rises so high (as to ten Camels loading or more) then he filleth a measure by tale, and after that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der measures all the rest. And I saw there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Furner Cook, or Baker, in one day by tale, and by measure, thirty five or forty thousand Eggs: and they told me, that for three days he doth nothing but still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in Eggs, and at twelve days end they come again to fetch Chickens, sometimes at ten, and sometimes (but not very often) at
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35259:15"/>
seven days, according as the weather falleth out. Perhaps two hundred persons are owners of one Raungeful, some having 2000. some one more or less. The Furner noteth the names and portions of every bringer; and if he have a hundred and fifty thousand, or two hundred thousand at one heat (as many times he hath) yet doth he mingle them all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not respecting to whom they severally belong. Then he lays them one by one upon his Raunge, so near as they can lye and touch each other; having first made a bed for them of Camels dung burnt; and the place whereon the ashes are, is of a very thin matter made of earth, but mixed with Camels and some Pid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons dung amongst it: yet herein consisteth not the secret only: for there is a concave or hollow place about 3 foot bredth under it, whereon is spread another layer of Camels dung, and under that is the place where the fire is made. Yet can I not rightly call it fire, because it appeareth to be nothing but embers: so I could not discern it but to be like ashes, yielding a temperate heat to the next concave, and the heat being resisted by the layer of dung next it (which dung being green, and laid upon pieces of withered trees, or rather boughs of old dead trees) sends forth an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary vapour, and that vapour entreth the hollow concave next under the Eggs,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35259:16"/>
where in time it pierceth the aforesaid mixed earth, which toucheth the ashes whereon the Eggs are laid, and so serveth as a necessary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle for all the heat coming from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath. This Artifical heat glyding through the embers whereon the Eggs lye, doth by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees warm through the shells, and so infuseth life by the same proportions of heat: thus in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, eight, nine, ten, or sometimes twelve days, life succeedeth by this artificial means. Now when the Furner perceiveth life to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and that the shells begin to break, then he begins to gather them: but of a hundred thousand, he hardly gathered threescore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, sometime but fifty thousand, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time (when the day is overcast) not twenty thousand: and if there chance any lightning, thunder, or rain, then of a thousand he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not one; for then they all miscarry and die. And this is to be remembred withal, that be the weather never so fair, the air pure, clear, and every thing as themselves can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and let the Chickens be hatched in the best manner that may be, yet have they either a Claw too much or too little: For some have five Claws, some six, some but two before and one behind, and seldom, very few or any in their right shape. When the people come to receive their Eggs, that before had brought them in, the Furner gives to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

one proportionably according as the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace yieldeth, reserving to himself the tenth for his labour. Thus have you the secret of hatching Eggs by heat artificially at the Town of <hi>Philbits</hi> in the Land of <hi>Gozan,</hi> which I think were in vain to be practised in <hi>England,</hi> because the air there is hardly ten days together clarified, neither is there any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels dung, though they have dung of other beasts every way as hot: therefore when the Sun is in <hi>Cancer, Leo,</hi> or <hi>Virgo,</hi> you may, if you please, try what may be done. Perhaps some will think this to be a fable, but I can urge their credence no further than my faith and truth can perswade them. And if they will not believe me, let them take pains to make their own eyes a witness, and when they have paid as dearly as I (for the sight of this and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things cost me 10<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But now, to my journey toward the desart of <hi>Arabia,</hi> which I was of necessity to pass before I could come to the Holy Land, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Town <hi>Philbits,</hi> travelling all night in company with the <hi>Caravan</hi> of <hi>Damasco,</hi> and the 14th at 9 of the clock we pitched our tents at <hi>Baharo</hi> in the land of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan.</hi> From thence we departed that night, and the 15 at night we pitched at <hi>Salbia,</hi> which is to the eastward of the land of <hi>Gozan,</hi> and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35259:18"/>
stands on the borders of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Desart; there we stayed two days for fear of the wild <hi>Arabes,</hi> and parted thence 17. We passed that night over a great bridg, under which the salt water standeth. This water comes out of the Sea from the parts of <hi>Damietta,</hi> and by mens hands was cut out of that place, some 150 miles into the main Land, by <hi>Ptolomoeus</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who purposed to join the Red sea and the Mediterranean: but when he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw, that if he had gone through, all his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try had been quite drowned, he gave it over, and built a bridge there to pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> over. This place parteth <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and no sooner had we past this bridg, but we were set upon by the wild <hi>Arabes,</hi> and notwithstanding we were more than 1000 persons, yet a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel laden with Callicoes was taken from us, 4 of our men hurt and one mortally wounded, and the <hi>Arabes</hi> ran away with the prey, we being unable to help it, because it was night. The next day we pitched by a well of brack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish water, But I forgot to tell you that my fellow Pilgrim, Mr. <hi>John Burrel,</hi> escaped very narrowly in the last nights bickering: there we rested our selves till 3 of the Clock in the afternoon, which they call <hi>Lasara</hi> for the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> divide the day into four parts: we departed the next morning to a Castle in the desart called <hi>Carga,</hi> which

               </gap>y pieces of silver of two pence a piece value, for each man or boy, and seventy six pieces for a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel laden, and fourteen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pt also by the Turks, in the said desarts, where our tax was but twenty pieces of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for each passenger, and thirty for a Camel. From thence we were guided by many Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the third Castle called <hi>Rachael,</hi> making one long Journey of 24 hours together: Here it is said that the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Judea,</hi> fought many great Battles: which to me seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very unlikely, because there is nothing to relieve an army withal, except sand and salt water.</p>
            <p>There we paid ten pieces every passenger, and 20 for a beast. So departing thence the 22. in the morning we came to <hi>Gaza</hi> in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting thence, the 23. in the morning, we pitched our Tents upon a Green close under the walls of <hi>Ramoth</hi> in <hi>Gilead</hi>: there I stayed all day, and wrote eight letters for <hi>England,</hi> by the <hi>Caravan</hi> which went for <hi>Damasco,</hi> to be conveyed to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and so for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> next day being the 24 in the morning, I with other Christians, set toward <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the great <hi>Caravan</hi> went for <hi>Damasco,</hi> but we pitched short that night at a place call'd in Arabian <hi>Cudechelanib,</hi> being 16 miles from <hi>Hebron,</hi> where the Sepulchre of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abraham</hi> is, and 5 little miles from <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi> From thence departing in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being our Lady day in Lent, and 9 before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, I saw the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> when kneeling down, and saying the Lords Prayer I gave God most hearty Thanks for conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me thither, to behold so holy a plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:35259:19"/>
till we came to the West Gate of the City, and there we stayed, because it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for a Christian to enter unadmitted. My companion advised me to say I was a <hi>Greek.</hi> only, to avoid going to Mass: but I not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue, refused so to do, telling him even at the entry of the Gate. that I would neither deny my Country nor Religion; whereupon being demanded who we were, Mr. <hi>Iohn Burrel</hi> (answering in the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue) told them that he was a <hi>Greek,</hi> And I an Englishman. This gave him admittance to the <hi>Greek</hi> Patriark, but I was seized on and cast into Prison, before I had stayed a full hour at the Gate, for the Turks absolutely denied, that they had ever heard either of my Queen or Country or that she paid them any Tribute. The <hi>Pater Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> who is the defender of all Christian Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims (and the principal procurer of my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, because I did not offer my self under his protection, but confidently stood to be rather protected under the Turk than the Pope) made the Turk so much my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, that I was reputed to be a spy, and so by no means could I be released from the Dungeon.</p>
            <p>Now give me leave to tell you how it pleased God that very day to deliver me and grant me pass as a Protestant, without
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35259:20"/>
yielding to any other ceremony, then carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Wax-candle onely, far beyond my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. Here let me remember you, that when I stayed at <hi>Ramoth</hi> in <hi>Gilead,</hi> where I wrote the 8 Letters for <hi>England,</hi> having leisure, I went to a Fountain to wash my foul linnen, and being earnest about my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, suddenly there came a Moor to me, who taking my cloaths out of my hand, and calling me by my name, said he would help me.</p>
            <p>You need not doubt but this was some amazement to me, to hear such a man call me by my name, and in a place so far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from my friends, country and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: which he perceiving, boldly thus spake in the Frank tongue, <hi>why Captain, I hope you have not forgotten me, for it is not yet</hi> 40 <hi>days since you set me, a-land at</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, <hi>with the rest of those passengers you brought from</hi> Argier, <hi>in your ship called the</hi> Trojan: <hi>aud here is another in this</hi> Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van, <hi>whom you likewise brought in company with me, that would not be a little glad to see you.</hi> I demanded of him if he dwelt there: he answered me no, saying, that he and his fellow were going in that <hi>Caravan</hi> to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masco</hi> (which place they call <hi>Sham</hi>) and from thence to <hi>Begdat,</hi> which we call <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Mecha</hi> to make
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35259:20"/>
a <hi>Hodge,</hi> for so they are called when they have been at <hi>Mecha</hi>: moreover, he told me, that he dwelt in the City of <hi>Fesse</hi> in <hi>Barbary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This man (in my mind) God sent to be the means of my immediate delivery: For after I had taken good notice of him, I well remembred that I saw him in my ship; though one man among 300 is not very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily known: for so many brought I from <hi>Argier</hi> into those parts, of different Nations: as Turks, Moors, Jews and Christians: I desired this man to bring me to the sight of his other companion, which having washed my Linnen) he did, and him I knew very readily. These two concluded, that one of them would depart thence with the <hi>Caravan,</hi> and the other go along with me to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was the Moor before mentioned; and such kind care had the Infidel of me, that he would not leave me unaccompanied in this strange Land: which I cannot but impute to Gods especial providence for my deliverance out of Prison, or else had I been left in a most miserable case.</p>
            <p>When this Moor saw me thus imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> my dungeon being right against the Sepulchre of Christ, although he wept, yet he bid me be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and went to the <hi>Basha</hi> of the City,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35259:21"/>
and to the <hi>Saniacke,</hi> before whom he took his oath, that I was a Mariner of a ship, who had brought two hundred and fifty, or 300 Turks and Moors into <hi>Egypt</hi> from <hi>Argier</hi> and <hi>Tunis,</hi> their journey being unto <hi>Mecha.</hi> This Moor (in regard he was a <hi>Mussel-man</hi>) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed so much with them, that returning with six Turks back to Prison he called me to the door, and there said unto me, that if I would go the house of the <hi>Pater Guardian,</hi> and yield my self under his Protection, I should be forced to no Religion but mine own, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were to carry a Candle: to the which I willingly condescended. So paying the charges of the Prison, I was presently deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and brought to the <hi>Guardians</hi> Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, where the <hi>Pater</hi> coming to me, took me by the hand, and bade me welcome, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling I would so much err from Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, as to put my self rather under the Turks, than his Protection: I told him, what I did was because that I would not go to Mass, but keep my Conscience to my self: He replyed, that many <hi>English-men</hi> had been there but (being Catholiques) went to Mass, telling the Turks at the Gates entrance that they were <hi>French-men,</hi> for the Turks know not what you mean by the word <hi>Englishman</hi>; advising me fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that when any of my country-men
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35259:21"/>
undertook the like travel, at the Gates of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> they should term themselves ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Frenchmen</hi> or <hi>Brittans,</hi> because they are well known to the Turks.</p>
            <p>He further asked me, how old our Queen was, and what was the reason she gave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the maintenance of the Holy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, as well as other Kings and Princes did: with divers other frivolous Questions: whereto I answered accordingly. This day being spent even to twilight, Mr. <hi>Iohn Burrel</hi> who passed as a <hi>Greek</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any trouble came in unto us, being nevertheless confin'd to this Monastery, or else he might not stay in the City; for such sway do the Papists carry there, that no Christian stranger can have admittance there, but he must be Protected under them, or not enter the City. Mr. <hi>Burrel</hi> and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together in the Court of the Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 12 fat fed Friers came forth unto us, each of them carrying a Wax candle burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and two spare Candles beside, one for Mr. <hi>Burrel,</hi> the other for me: Another Frier brought a great Bason of warm wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, mingled with Roses and other sweet Flowers, and a Carpet being spread on the ground, and Cushions in Chairs set orderly for us, the <hi>Pater Guardian</hi> came and set us down, giving each of us a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35259:22"/>
in our hands, then came a Friar and pull'd off our hose, and (setting the Bason on the Carpet washed our feet.</p>
            <p>When the Friar began to wash, the twelve Friars began to sing, continuing so till our feet were washed, which being done, they went along singing, and we with the <hi>Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> came to a Chappel in the Monastery, where one of them began an Oration in form of a Sermon, tending to prove how meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious it was for us to visit the holy Land, and see those sanctified places where our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours feet had trod. The sermon being ended, they brought us unto a chamber where our supper was prepared; there we fed somewhat fearfully, in regard that strange Victuals have as strange qualities: but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting our selves to God, and their outward appearing Christian kindness, we fell to heartily, supt very bountifully, and after (praising God) were lodged decently. Thus much for my first entertainment in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was the 25. of <hi>March,</hi> being our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy day in Lent. Now follows what the Friars afterward shewed me, being there to appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Pater Guardian.</hi> Early the next morning we arose, and having saluted the <hi>Pater Guardian,</hi> he appointed us seven Friars and a Trouchman: so forth we went to see all the holy places in the City which were to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35259:22"/>
be seen, except those in <hi>Sepulchra Sancta</hi>; for that required a whole days works, and at every place where we came we kneeled down, and said the Lords prayer.</p>
            <p>The first place of note was the Judicial next the house of <hi>Veronica Sancta</hi>: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding what Saint that was, they told me it was she that did wipe our saviours face, as he passed by in his Agony. Descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little lower in the same street, they shewed me the way which our Saviour Christ went to crucifying, called by them <hi>Via Dolorosa.</hi> Then on the Right Hand in the same street, I was shewn the house of the Rich Glutton, at whose Gate poor despised <hi>Lazarus</hi> lay. Holding on our way down this street we came to a turning Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage on the left hand, whence they told me <hi>Simon Sirenus</hi> was coming toward the <hi>Dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus way,</hi> when the Souldiers seeing him, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, and compelled him against his will, presently to help our Saviour to carry his Cross. Then they told me that in that same place the people wept, when Christ answering, said unto them, <hi>Oh Daughters of Ierusalem, weep not for me,</hi> &amp;c. Next they shewed the Church where the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> fell into an agony, when Christ passed by carrying his Cross. Afterward they brought me to <hi>Pilates</hi> Palace, which though it be all ruinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35259:23"/>
yet is there an old Arch of Stone, which is still maintained by the Christians, and standing full in the high way, we passed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it: upon that Arch, is a Gallery which admitteth passage (over our heads) from one side of the street to the other: for <hi>Pilates</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace extendeth over the high way on both sides, and <hi>Pilate</hi> had two great Windows in the same Gallery, to gaze out both ways in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the street. Into this Gallery was our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour brought when he was shewn unto the Jews, and they standing below in the street, heard the words, <hi>Ecce Homo,</hi> Behold the man. A little from this place, is the foot of the stairs where our Saviour did first take up his Cross. Then they brought me to the place where the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was Concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and born, which is the Church of St. <hi>Anna,</hi> and no Turkish Church. Next they shewed the Pool where Christ cleansed the Leapers, and then guiding me to St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi> Gate, a little within it upon the left hand, they shewed the stone wherewith St. <hi>Steven</hi> was stoned. From hence I saw the stairs going up to Port <hi>Area,</hi> at which Port there are divers Reliques to be seen; it was the East Gate of the Temple which <hi>Solomon</hi> built upon Mount <hi>Moria,</hi> in which Temple was the place of <hi>Sanctum Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> but now in that place is builded a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35259:23"/>
goodly great Church belonging to the Turks.</p>
            <p>Thus spent I the second day, being the 26. day of <hi>March,</hi> all within the Gates of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> except my going to see the stone wherewith Saint <hi>Steven</hi> was stoned. The next day being the 27. having done our Duty to God, and the <hi>Pater Guardian,</hi> we hired Asses for the Friars and the Trouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to ride on, and going forth the City Gates, we mounted and rode directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Bythinia.</hi> By the way as we rode, they shewed the place of the fruitless Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, which Christ cursed: next the Castle of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that <hi>Lazarus</hi> whom Christ loved so well: for his house or Castle was in <hi>Bythinia,</hi> but it was utterly ruinated, and nothing to be seen but the two sides of the Wall. In the same Town they shewed the House of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> but so ruinated, that nothing is left of it but a piece of a Wall: there I saw likewise <hi>Martha</hi>'s House, consisting of 3 pieces of Wall: and thence they brought me to the Stone where the two Sisters told Christ that <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead, from whence passing on, they shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the place where our Saviour raised <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> from death, after he had layen three days in the ground, and where he was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried afterward when he died. This place
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35259:24"/>
hath been notably kept from the beginning, and is repaired still by the Christians: but yet in poor and very bare sort: And this is all that I saw in <hi>Bythinia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence we rode to Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> and passing by <hi>Bethphage,</hi> they brought me to the place where our Saviour took the Ass and Colt when he rode to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> upon <hi>Palm Sunday.</hi> Riding from <hi>Bethphage,</hi> directly North, we came to the foot of Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> where they shewed the place <hi>Benedicta</hi> of the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> Annunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and ascending to the top of the mount we saw the place of our Saviours Ascensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: At the sight whereof we said our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and were commanded to say 5 <hi>Pater Nosters,</hi> and 5 <hi>Ave Maries,</hi> but we said the Lords Prayer, took notice of the place and departed. This is the highest part of Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> and hence may be discerned many notable places: as first, West from it is the prospect of the new City of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>: South-west the prospect of Mount <hi>Sion</hi> which is adjoyning to new <hi>Ierusalem</hi>: also in the valley between <hi>Sion</hi> and the Mount where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I stood, I saw the Brook <hi>Cedron,</hi> the Pool <hi>Silo,</hi> the Garden wherein our Saviour Prayed, the place where he was betrayed, and divers other notable things in this val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of <hi>Gethsemanie</hi>: as the Tomb of <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:35259:24"/>
King <hi>Davids</hi> son, the Tomb of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoshaphat,</hi> and others. Full South from Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> I could see the places we came last from, as all <hi>Bythinia</hi> and <hi>Bethphage</hi>: also East North-east from this Mount, may be seen the River of <hi>Iordan</hi> which is 15 Miles off, and <hi>Iericho,</hi> which is not far, because West-ward of <hi>Iordan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> East and East-South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>east, may be seen the Lake of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> which is some 100 Miles long, and 8 Miles over: all these places I set with the Compass, when I was on Mount <hi>Olivet</hi>: for I stayed on the top of it some two hours and a half, having a little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass about me. Descending hence toward the foot West-ward, we came to a place where the Friars told me, that a woman called St. <hi>Pelagia,</hi> did Pennance in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of a Friar: whereat I smiling, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding why I did so? I answered that to believe <hi>Pelagia,</hi> was a Saint, stood out of the Compass of the Creed: they told me, when I came home at night they would shew me sufficent Authors for it: but when I came home I had so much to do in writing my notes out of my table book, that I had not leisure to urge their Authors for St. <hi>Pelagia.</hi> By this time they brought us to the place where our Saviour did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35259:25"/>
the judgment, then where he made the <hi>Pater Noster</hi> or Lords Prayer, and then where the Apostles made the <hi>Creed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence we came to the place where Christ wept for <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and from thence to the place where the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> gave the Girdle to St. <hi>Thomas</hi>; and then where she Prayed for St. <hi>Steven.</hi> All these last were coming down Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> toward the Valley of <hi>Gethsemanie,</hi> where by the way we came to our Ladies Church, wherein is her Sepulchre, and the Sepulchre of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>Ioseph,</hi> with the Sepulchre of <hi>Anna,</hi> and many others. This Church standeth at the foot of Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> and was built (as they say) by <hi>Helena</hi> the mother of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the Great: Here the Friars went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> Sepulchre, and there either said Mass or Prayers while we in the mean time went to Dinner. In this Church is a Fountain of exceeding fine Water, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard we went down into a Vault, as it were it giveth a marvellous loud eccho or sound. Hence we came to the Cave whither <hi>Iudas</hi> came to betray Christ when he was at Prayer, and thence to the Garden where our Saviour left his Disciples, commanding them to Watch and Pray, but found them sleeping at his return: then they brought me to the Garden where Christ was taken: these last
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:35259:25"/>
three were in the Valley <hi>Gethsemanie.</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into the Town (whereof the Valley bears the Name) on the left hand I saw the before remembred Sepulchres of <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi> and <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> and on the right the Brook <hi>Cedron,</hi> which at my being there had not one drop of water in it, for indeed it is but a ditch to convey the water to Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> and Mount <hi>Sion</hi> when store of Rain falleth. And this ditch, or brook <hi>Cedron,</hi> is in the Valley between both those Hills. Hard by they shewed me a stone marked with the Feet and Elbows of Christ, in their throwing of him down when they took him, and ever since (say they) have those prints remained there.</p>
            <p>From thence we rode to the place where St. <hi>Iames</hi> the younger hid himself and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward was buried there: there also they shewed where <hi>Zechariah</hi> the Son of <hi>Barachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab</hi> was buried, and brought me to another place, where they say the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> used often to Pray. Then came we to the pool of <hi>Silo,</hi> wherein Mr. <hi>Burrel</hi> and I washed our selves, and hence we were shewn the place where the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> was sawn in pieces: thence they guided us to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding deep Well, where the Jews (as they say) hid the holy fire in the rime of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar.</hi> Here we ascended from the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:35259:26"/>
Valley to a hill side, which lyeth just South from Mount <hi>Sion</hi>; but there is a great Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley between, called <hi>Gehemion,</hi> and there they shewed the places where the Apostles hid themselves, being a Cave in a Rock. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending higher they brought me to the field, or rather to the Rock, where the common burial place is for strangers, being the very same as they say which was bought with the 30 pieces of silver, that <hi>Iudas</hi> received as the price of his Master, which place is called <hi>Aceldama,</hi> and is fashioned as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. It hath 3 holes above, and on the side there is a vent, at the upper holes they use to let down the dead bodies, to the depth of about some fifty foot. In this place I saw two bodies, new or very lately let down, and looking down (for by reason of the three great holes above, where the dead bodies lie, it is very light) I received such a savour into my head, as made me very sick, so that I entreated the Friars to go no further, but return home to the City.</p>
            <p>Then we went through the valley of <hi>Gehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mion,</hi> and at the foot of Mount <hi>Sion</hi> having a little bottle of water which I brought from the Pool <hi>Silo</hi> I drank, and rested an hour eating a few Raisins and Olives which we brought with us from <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> After I had rested and refreshed my self, we began
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:35259:26"/>
to ascend Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and a little way up the hill, they shewed me the place where <hi>Peter</hi> having denied Christ, and hearing the Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crow, went out and wept. Ascending higher, they shewed the house where the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> dwelt, which was near the Temple: then they brought me to the place where the Jews setting on the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi> to take her, she was conveyed away by miracle. Hence we went to the house of <hi>Cajaphas,</hi> which was somewhat higher upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and therein I saw the Prison wherein our Saviour was detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Passing on still higher, they guided me to a little Chappel which is kept by the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians</hi> whereinto entring, at the high Altar they shewed the Stone which was upon our Saviours Sepulchre (as they say) it is near the place where <hi>Peter</hi> denied Christ: for there they shewed me the Pillar whereon the Cock stood when he crowed. Hence was I brought to the place where our Saviour made his last Supper, and thence came where the Holy Ghost descended upon the Apostles: whence passing on, they shewed me the place where Christ appeared to his Disciples the eighth day after his Resurrection, where St. <hi>Thomas</hi> desired to see his wounds.</p>
            <p>Near this place upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> died, and hard by, they shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35259:27"/>
a place bought by the Pope of the Turks, for the burial of the <hi>European</hi> Christians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would not have them cast into <hi>Acelda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>: They told us the year before, five Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishmen were buried in that place, whether by the Fryars poysoning them, or how else it happened, but we thought it strange that all five should die in one week. Thence came we to the house of <hi>Annas</hi> the high Priest, now only two very old walls: at the side of one is an old Olive-tree, whereto they told me our Saviour was bound: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the reason, they said that when he was brought unto his house, <hi>Annas</hi> being asleep, his people would not awake him: so during their stay, they bound him to that Olive-tree, and when he awaked, then he was brought in and examined. Departing hence toward the South Gate of the City, which standeth likewise upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> we alighted from our Asses, and entring, I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it well: for I had seen three of the four Gates. And being desirous to see the North-Gate also, they brought me to the Church of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> which is within the Wall all ruinated: then to the Church of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> where <hi>Peter</hi> came being delivered out of Prison by the Angel that brake open the Gate. Then they shewed me the house of <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> whence we came to a place kept
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35259:27"/>
by the <hi>Abassines,</hi> and there ascending first by a dark way, led on by a line or Cord, we attained to a high place near to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchra Sancta,</hi> where I paid two pieces of silver to go in, and being entred I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what place it was; the same (quoth they) where <hi>Abraham</hi> would have sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his son <hi>Isaac.</hi> Thence went we to the Prison whence St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn</hi> were, being the next door to the prison wherein I was put before: which made me the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, that it was not my fortune to have gone into it, being so near it. Hence we came to the North-gate, being on Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> side, where having well viewed the Gate, and perceiving it grew late, we went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly home: this was my third days work, in and about <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> wearied not a little with often alighting to pray: for at each se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral place before recounted, we dismounted and said the Lords Prayer on our knees. On the morrow being the 28th day, early in the morning, we took our Asses, riding forth at the West Gate, through which I first entred, and passing South, we left mount <hi>Sion</hi> on the left hand: at the foot whereof they shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the house of <hi>Uriah,</hi> and the Fountain where <hi>Bathsheba</hi> washed her self when King <hi>David</hi> espied her out of his Turret. Thence went we to the place where the Angel took
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35259:28"/>
up <hi>Habakkuk</hi> by the hair of the head, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meat to <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lions Den. Next came we to the place where the wise men found the Star when it was lost, and then where the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> rested her self under a tree as she came from <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> which tree they still repair by setting another close to the root of it. Hence rode we to the house of <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet, where they shewed his usual place of sleeping, and his house standeth so upon a hill, as from thence I saw <hi>Bethlehem</hi> afar off.</p>
            <p>Thence we went to an old ruinated house, which they told me was <hi>Iacobs</hi>: which may the better appear to be so, for in the field thereto adjoining, is the tomb of <hi>Rachel, Iacobs</hi> Wife: and some two Miles from this tomb is a Town in the same field called <hi>Bethesula,</hi> the Inhabitants whereof are all Christians. In this great field (being between <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Bethlehem</hi>) did lie the camp of <hi>Senacherib</hi> when he besieged <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> From hence we rode to the field where the Angels brought Tydings of great joy to the Shepherds, which is two Miles from <hi>Bethlehem</hi>: and thence we rode to <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem</hi> to the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hence went we presently back to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> entring the gate at four a clock afternoon, and at five the Turks let us into the <hi>Sepulchra Sancta,</hi> each of us paying nine pieces of Gold for our entrance. No sooner were we in, but they locked the Gates; so there I stayed till 11 of the clock the next day, and then came we forth: Now follows what I saw in <hi>Sepulchra Sancta.</hi> First I observed hanging without the Gate, at least 100 lines or strings, and in the Gate is a great hole, whereat a little Child may easily creep in: whereof demanding the reason, they told me that the hole served to give victuals at, for them which lie within the Church, which are above 300 persons, men and women, all Christians, and there they live continually night and day, and can have no passage in or out, but when the Turks open the Gate for some Pilgrim: which happeneth not sometimes in 14 days: Wherefore these Christian Lodgers in the Church have their whole houshold there, and boarded lodgings built for them. The strings hanging at the Gate, have each one a Bell, fastned at the lodgings, and when their servants (which are without bring them any meat, each rings the Bell belonging to his houshold, and so come accordingly (each knowing hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> own Bell) for the receipt of his food. The
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:35259:29"/>
several sorts of Christians which I saw in this Church, I will in order describe. 1. The <hi>Romans</hi> who bear the greatest sway. 2. The <hi>Greeks,</hi> for they be next in number to the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet little better then slaves to the Turk. 3. The <hi>Armenians,</hi> who have been so long Servants to the Turk, that having forgot their own Language, they use all their Ceremonies in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Tongue. The 4th sort of Christians are <hi>Nestorians,</hi> who are likewise slaves to the Turk, and have no other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage than the <hi>Arabian.</hi> The 5th <hi>Abassines,</hi> being People of the Land of <hi>Prestor Iohn.</hi> The sixth <hi>Iacobites</hi> that are Circumcised Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, but slaves likewise to the Turk. All these (Christians in name) have bought their several places in the Church, and by-rooms for ease, being never fewer of all these six sorts than 250 or 300 continually there ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Praying after their manner. The places where they ordinarily go to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions are thus as the <hi>Roman</hi> Friars brought me to them. 1. The Pillar whereat our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was whipped. 2. The place where he was imprisoned, while they were preparing or making his Cross. 3. Where the Souldiers divided his Garments. 4. Where the Cross was found by Q. <hi>Helena,</hi> which is at the foot of Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> and hard by that is the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35259:30"/>
of the Queen. 5. The place where Chris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> was Crowned with Thorns: which I could not see till I give the <hi>Abassines</hi> that kept it two pieces of Silver. 6. The place where the Cross being laid on the ground, our Saviour was nailed unto it. 7. The place on the top of Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> where the Cross stood when he suffered. 8. The Rock that rent at his crucifying, which is worth observation, for it is slit like as if cleft with Wedges and Beetles, from the top to the two third parts downwards, as it were through the brow and breast of the Rocks: The rent is so great in some places, that a Man might hide himself in it, and grows downward less and less. 9. The place where the three <hi>Maries</hi> Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Christ after he was dead. 10. Where he appeared to <hi>Mary Magdelen</hi> like a Gardiner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And thence we came to the Sepulchre it self, which is the last place where they use Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.

These with my Companion Mr. <hi>Iohn Burrel,</hi> I left behind in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> departing thence to see other places in the Country of <hi>Palestine</hi>: But let me first tell what I observed in the Cities Situation, because I was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before I came, that it was all ruinated, though I found it otherwise, having a little Compass about me, to set such places as I could easily come by.</p>
            <p>The very heart of the old City was seated on Mount <hi>Sion</hi> and Mount <hi>Moria:</hi> On the North part whereof was Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> without the Gates of the old City, about a stones cast, and no further. But now I find this new City situated so far in the North part,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35259:31"/>
that it is almost quite off Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> but yet not off Mount <hi>Moria,</hi> which was between Mount <hi>Sion</hi> and Mount <hi>Calvary</hi>; so that now (undoubtedly) the South Wall of the City are plackd on the N. foot of the Hill of <hi>Sion.</hi> The East Walls which confronts Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> is a great part of the Ancient Wall from the S. E. angle North, a quarter of a mile behind Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> so that Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a stones cast without the City, and the appointed place for ordinary execution, I find <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o be now seated in the middle of the new City. This Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> is not so high as to be called a Mount, but rather a piked or spired Rock: For I noted the Situation, both when I was at the top, and when I came to the Sepulchre, being distant from the foot of it 173 foot, as I measured it: Whereupon I conclude, that the place of Burial, which <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> made for himself, was from the foot of Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> 173 foot West, in which place is the Sepulchre of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, which is two foot and a half high, eight foot in length, and four foot broad wanting three inches, covered with a fair white stone. Over the Sepulchre is a Chappel, the North Wall whereof is joyned close with the North side of the Sepulchre: And of like stone as the Sepulchre is, consisting of fifteen
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:35259:31"/>
foot in breadth, five and twenty foot in length, and above forty foot in height. In this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are always burning thirty or forty Lamps, but upon Festival days more, maintained by Gifts given at the death of Christians in <hi>Spain, Florence,</hi> and other parts, to be kept continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally burning, and the givers of these Lamps have their names ingraven about the upper edges of them, in Letters of Gold, standing in a band of Gold or Silver. This Chappel is inclosed with a Church, and yet not that only, but therewith is circled in all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named holy places, <hi>viz.</hi> where Christ was whipt: Where he was in Prison: Where his Garments were divided: Where the Cross was found: Where he was Crowned with Thorns: Where he was Nailed on the Cross: Where the Cross stood when he suffered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Where the Vail of the Temple rent: Where the three <hi>Maries</hi> Anointed him: Where he appeared to <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>: And in brief, all the notable things, either about Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> or <hi>Ios<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:35259:32"/>
I measured this Church within, and found it to be 422 Fathoms about: The one side of it likewise I found to be 130 Fathoms: Thus much for Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> now in the midst of the City.</p>
            <p>From the North-east angle, to the North-west is the shortest way of the City, and from the North-west angle, to the South-west, is as far as from the South-east, to the North-east: But from the South-west to the South-east, which is the South-wall that standeth on the foot of Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> I measured, and found it to be 3775 foot, which is about three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a mile. Upon this South side of the City, is a great Iron Gate, about which are laid 17 Pieces of Brass Ordinance: This Gate is as great as the West Gate of the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and exceeding strong, the Walls being very thick, and on the South side 50 or 60 foot high. The North Wall is not altogether so long, but much stronger, for on the North side it hath been often surprised, but on the South-side never: and on the East-side it is impregnable, by reason of the edge of the Hill which it standeth on, which is five times as high as the Wall. On the North side are 25 Pieces of Brass Ordinance near the Gate, which is of Iron also, but what are in other places, as at the corners or angles,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:35259:32"/>
I could not come to see, and inquire I durst not. The East Wall containing the Gate where St. <hi>Stephen</hi> was stoned a little without, and to this day called St. <hi>Stephens</hi> Gate, I saw but five Pieces of Ordinance there, and they were between the Gate and the ruins of Port <hi>Aurea,</hi> which is to the South, the West side of the City, at the Gate whereof I entred at my first Arrival, it is very strong likewise, and hath fifteen Pieces of Ordnance lying together, and all of Brass: This Gate is also of Iron, and this West Wall is as long as the East Wall; But standeth upon the higher ground: So that coming from the West to the West Wall, you can see nothing but the bare Wall, but upon Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> coming towards the City, from the East, you hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a very goodly prospect, by reason the City stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all on the edge of the Hill. To conclude, <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is the strongest of all the Cities that I have yet seen in my Journey, since I depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Grand Cairo</hi>: But the rest of the Country is very easy to be surprised: Yet in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> are three Christians for one Turk, and many Christians in the Country round about, who all live poorly under the Turk.</p>
            <p>Now how the Country about <hi>Ierusalem</hi> lyeth, for your more easy understanding, I will familiarly compare several places, with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:35259:33"/>
some of our Native English Towns and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, according to such true estimation as I have made of them. Imagine I begin with <hi>London,</hi> I mean about that distance. The City of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> where our Saviour was born, is from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as <hi>Wansworth</hi> is from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> I mean much that distance. The plain of <hi>Mamre</hi> is from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as <hi>Guilford</hi> is from <hi>London</hi>: In which place, or near to it, is the City of <hi>Hebron,</hi> where our Father <hi>Abraham</hi> lyeth buryed. <hi>Beersheba</hi> is from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as <hi>Alton</hi> is from <hi>London: Ramoth Gilead</hi> is from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as <hi>Reading</hi> is from <hi>London, Gaza,</hi> which is the South west part of <hi>Palestine,</hi> is from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as <hi>Salisbury</hi> is from <hi>London. Ascalon</hi> is from <hi>Gaza</hi> North-east. <hi>Ioppa</hi> is from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as <hi>Alisbury</hi> is from <hi>London. Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> is from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as <hi>Royston</hi> is from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> The City of <hi>Nazareth</hi> is from <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> as <hi>Norwich</hi> is from <hi>London.</hi> From <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth</hi> to Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> and <hi>Hermon</hi> is five Miles North-east: These two stand very near together, <hi>Tabor</hi> being the greater. From <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor</hi> to the Sea <hi>Tiberias,</hi> is eight Miles North-east. From <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to Mount <hi>Sania,</hi> is ten days Journey and North-east thence. These places last spoken of, beginning at <hi>Samaria,</hi> I was not in, but the other five <hi>Englishmen</hi> that met me in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> from <hi>Galilee,</hi> came
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:35259:33"/>
through them, of whom I had this Description: they received of me likewise the Description of my Journey through <hi>Palestine.</hi> The place where Christ fasted 40 days and 40 nights, called <hi>Quarranto,</hi> is from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as <hi>Chelmsford</hi> is from <hi>London,</hi> The River <hi>Iordan</hi> (the very nearest part thereof) is from <hi>Ierusalem as Ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi> is from <hi>London. Iericho,</hi> the nearest part of the plain thereof, is from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as <hi>Lowton</hi> Hall (Sr. <hi>Robert Wroths</hi> house) is from <hi>London.</hi> The Lake of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> is from <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> as <hi>Gravesend</hi> is from <hi>Lon-don.</hi> The Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Iordan</hi> runneth into the Lake, and there is swall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:35259:34"/>
have brought some with me from thence. This Lake is about eight or nine Miles broad, and about a 100 Miles long from the North, where the River <hi>Iordan</hi> falleth into it, to the South-ward, and hath no farther issue.</p>
            <p>The fields where the Angels brought Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to the Shepherds, lye from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as <hi>Greenwich</hi> from <hi>London.</hi> Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> lyeth from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as <hi>Bow</hi> from <hi>London.

Bethphage</hi> is from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as <hi>Mile-end</hi> from <hi>London.</hi> The Valley <hi>Gethsemany</hi> is from <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> as <hi>Ratcliff Fields</hi> lye from <hi>London.</hi> Brook <hi>Cedron</hi> is from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as the Ditch with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Algate</hi> from <hi>London.</hi> Mount <hi>Sion</hi> is near adjoyning to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as <hi>Southwark</hi> to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> Thus have I described the City of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> as it is now built, with all the notable places therein, and near the same, and the Country about it: By which comparisons you may well understand the situation of most places near it: And thereby you may perceive that it was but a small Country, and a very little plat of ground, which the <hi>Israelites</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and is now ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry barren: For within fifteen Miles from <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> it is wholly barren, full of Rocks, and stony: And unless it be about the Plain of <hi>Iericho,</hi> I know not any part of the Country
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:35259:34"/>
at present fruitful: What is hath been in time past, I refer you to the Holy Scriptures: My opinion is, that when it was fruitful, and a Land that flowed with Milk and Hony, in those days God Blessed it, and that then they followed his Commandments, but now being inhabited by Infidels (that prophane the name of Christ, and live in a filthy and beastly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) God cursed it, and it is made so barren that I could get no bread when I came near it: For one night as I lodged short of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> at a place called in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Tongue, <hi>Cuda Chenaleb,</hi> I sent my Moor to a house (not far from the place where we had pitched our Tents) to get some bread, and he brought word there was none to be had, and that the man of that house did never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at bread in all his life, but only dryed Dates, nor any of his houshold: whereby you may partly perceive the barrenness of the Country at this day, only as I suppose, by the curse that God laid upon the same: For they use the sin of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> very much in that Country, so that the poor Christians there are glad to marry their Daughters at twelve years of Age, unto Christians, lest the Turks should ravish them. And to conclude, there is not that sin in the World, but it is used amongst those Infidels who now inhabit therein, and yet it is called
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:35259:35"/>
               <hi>Terra Sancta,</hi> and in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Tongue <hi>Cuthea,</hi> which is the Holy Land, bearing the name only and no more: For all holiness is banished from thence by those Thieves, filthy Turks and Infidels that inhabit the same. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my Certificate sealed by the Quadrian and a Letter delivered me, to shew that I had washed my self in the River of <hi>Iordan,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in the company of the Moor that helpt to get me out of Prison, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Edward Abbot, Ieffery Kerbie, Iohn El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, Iasper Tymme</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedle</hi> the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whom I met there by chance, behind me in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and which grieved me most, the Gentleman of <hi>Middleborough,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Burrel,</hi> that I met with at <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> who had born me company thence to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> forsook me there, and stayed with the other five <hi>Englishmen,</hi> and so was I left alone to the mercy of my Moor that never left me till I came to <hi>Grand Cairo.</hi> Now what happened to me in my Travelling from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to <hi>Cairo,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where my ship lay, I will hereafter declare.</p>
            <p>Departing from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> we got safe to <hi>Rama,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Ascalon,</hi> and so to <hi>Gaza,</hi> which lyeth upon the Borders of the Desarts of <hi>Arabia</hi>: At one of those two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I hoped to have some passage by Water,

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:35259:36"/>
the Alforges (wherein we carryed our Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als) I went to the top of a sandy hill, not far from thence, to see if I could espy our two Thieves; I was no sooner upon the top of the Hill, but I saw four wild <hi>Arabians</hi> come running towards me, from the other side of the sandy Hill: which I perceiving, ran in great haste to my Moor, yet not so fast, but one of the Thieves was at my heels, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his Sword, bad my Moor deliver me, but the Moor bad him search me, for he knew I had nothing about me of worth, only my hair cloth Coat, and said farther to him, this <hi>Cuar</hi> (which is as much as <hi>unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever</hi>) is to be conducted to <hi>Cairo</hi> in four days, by two of your companions, whom he named, whereunto they all answered, that if it were true, they would do me no hurt, but if their companions came not again with their Dromedaries, then they would carry us away with them; but within two hours after in the night, my two <hi>Arabians</hi> came again with their Dromedaries, and then they were all fellow Thieves. And we gave them a few Raisins and a little water, and so depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the fourth day at night we came to a place where the <hi>Arabians</hi> had Tents, and there they gave me some Camels Milk, and beheld <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Dromedary is a beast like a Camel, but hath a lesser head, and a very small neck: but his leggs are as long, and there is no more diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a Camel and a Dromedary, then there is between a Mastiff-dog and a Grey-hound: these beasts eat little, and drink less, for they drank not while I was with them; and it is said that they will not drink in eight or ten days together, but cannot ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain so long from meat. And by this you see I went as far in 4 days, as in 12 before: I think a good horse will run as fast, but not continue it: their pace is a reaching trot, but very hard and quick.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:35259:41"/>
again admitted into the Convent, and still continuing to live a very strict Life, he at length dyed; and the Fathers coming ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Custom, to anoint the Body, found that he was a Woman; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they began to Cross themselves, and to beg Pardon for excommunicating her; and have built an altar in the Grot, and call it by the Name of St. <hi>Marrena,</hi> as they have also in several Grots thereabouts, in remembrance of the Religious Relicks of those that dwelt therein; and when they carry any Body to see them, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently fall down to prayers.</q>

            <p>About a League from the Convent, are two French men that live a Hermits Life, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Bread and Wine allowed them by the Patriark: Night coming on, we went to Supper with the Patriark, the B. of <hi>Aleppo</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and two other Bishops, with what the Place afforded; At Supper they brought out a great Glass, which held near two Quarts, with which the Old Man soon made himself merry, it being their custom to drink freely; He tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, that that Glass had belonged to the Convent more than one hundred Years, and that the <hi>Turks</hi> coming once to Ransack the Convent, seeing this Glass, told one of the <hi>Fratres,</hi> if he could drink off that full of pure Wine, he would save the Convent; which
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:35259:42"/>
one of them doing, the <hi>Turks</hi> went away, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring what sort of People they were. <hi>May</hi> 16.

            <p>We Returned to <hi>Trippoly</hi> to the Consuls House that Night, where after two days re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and having been extraordinary well Treated, we took our leave of the Consul <hi>May</hi> 18. about midnight, we set sail for <hi>Ioppa,</hi> with a good Wind; in the Morning we came in sight of <hi>Cape-Blanco,</hi> where the Wind proving contrary, we were forced to bear up and down for two days, before we could weather the Cape; the Wind coming good, we weather'd the Cape, and came in sight of <hi>Cape-Carmel,</hi> which Two Cape<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And three or four hours Sail further, we came in sight of <hi>Cesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> now Ruinate and Inhabited by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Savage <hi>Arabs. May</hi> 23. we Arrived
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:35259:42"/>
at <hi>Ioppa,</hi> which hath no Harbour to defend Ships from Storms, but hath very good Ground to Anchor in, about ten Fathom Water: It is a poor Town, and hath one Castle: to defend those Ships that come in close to the Shoar; the chief Trade thereof is Pot-ashes for Soap, Cottons, and Cotton-Yarn, which the <hi>Franks</hi> bring from thence. <hi>May</hi> 24, We arrived at <hi>Ramah,</hi> a pleasant Village; the Trade of the Inhabitants is in Fillado's; the People are poor, and the lively-hood of the Women is to Spin it: We were Treated there at the Convent, till a Messenger was dispatched to the Convent at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> for our Admittance to pass thither, because of some extravagant Stories that flew abroad, of the Plague raging in the place from whence we came; our Messenger returned back that night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 25. in the morning, we mounted to take our Journey for <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and baited at St. <hi>Ieroms</hi> Church about twelve of the Clock, to Eat what small provisions we had with us: and the heat of the Day being pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, we proceeded on our Journey; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four of the Clock in the afternoon we arrived at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> at <hi>Ioppa</hi> Gate; where we tarried till the Druggerman of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent went to the <hi>Caddy</hi> for Licence for us to enter the City; which having obtaine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and delivering up our Swords, and what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arms we had, to be carried to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; we entred the City on Foot, and were conducted by the Druggerman to the <hi>Latines</hi> Convent, with two or three Fathers; we found them at their Devotion, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all went into the Father <hi>Guardians</hi> Chamber, who imbraced, and bid us wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; We were carried to our Lodgings, and the Father Procurator came to us, and passed a Complement on us, bringing two or three bottles of the best Wine, and desiring us to call for what we wanted; this was our first entertainment. But I should have told you that our Druggerman, <hi>Mallanis Salley,</hi> who conducted us from <hi>Ioppa,</hi> through the Mountains up to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was formerly a Robber himself, and could therefore the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter carry us through the <hi>Arabs,</hi> who molest those Mountains and live all upon Purchase; he was a <hi>Greek</hi> by Nation and Religion.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:35259:43"/>
wash; and then entring the Hall, the Fathers stood all on one side near one another, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace in Latin, and then singing the Lords Prayer altogether; and afterwards bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the Picture of our Saviour at Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with his Apostles, which is placed over the <hi>Guardians</hi> Head, adorned with silver Crosses about it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Guardian</hi> hath his Table alone in the middle of the Room and two long Tables stand of each side, one for the Pilgrims, and the other for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; after they had kiss'd the ground, we all sate down, and had every one his allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment brought in a little dish, never wanting three or four Courses of several sorts of Meat: our Wine, Water, and Fruit, was set ready; the Wine about a Quart, the Water some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less, which was the allowance of two men, and had two Glasses belonging to it: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of Dinner, the <hi>Frater</hi> came, &amp; changed our Water, that it might drink the fresher. Dinner being ending, the Father <hi>Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> knocks, and the <hi>Fraters</hi> rise and kneel with their faces toward the Picture of our Saviour with his Disciples at Supper, and mumbling something to themselves, they kiss the Ground, and then begin to take away; one taking away the Dishes, another the Knives, every one having his appointment; and then give Thanks in the same manne
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:35259:44"/>
as before Dinner; then washing at the door, they go into the Church to Prayer, for a quarter of an hour; this they do daily, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing always early, and in the Night also, to go to Mass.</p>
            <p>At this time there were two or three Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians come from <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> whose art is to make the Figure of our Saviours Sepulchre, or what Holy Story you please, upon your Arm; they make it of a blew colour, and it is done by the continually pricking of your Arm with two Needles; they began present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to go to work on some of us, and having presented us the Patterns of abundance of Prints, every one took his Fancy.</p>
            <p>The next day, <hi>May</hi> 27. we all agreed to go into the Temple, and about four after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon we went: ten or twelve Fathers live there continually, and have their Church there: The door is sealed with the <hi>Caddys</hi> Seal, and when any man goes in, he pays fourteen Livers; we being entred the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Fathers came and saluted us, and conducted us to their Lodgings; where after we had been about an hour, they prepared to go in Procession to all the holy places, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting us every one a Book of Holy Songs, for every place in <hi>Latin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so we set out, the Fathers being dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

them with Cloth of Silver over his Surplice, with two more dressed in the like Garb to lead him: there was a great Silver Crucifix carried before him, and two men going on each side of it, with Incense Pots, to perfume every holy place, that we came to. And so we went to the places follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Pillar to which our Saviour was bound when he was scourged. 2. The Prison, wherein our Saviour was put. 3. The place where the Soldiers divided our Saviours Garments. 4. The place where St. <hi>Helena</hi> found our Saviours Cross. 5. The Pillar to which our Saviour was bound when he was Crowned with Thorns. 6. To Mount <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary,</hi> where he was Crucified. 7. The place where our Saviour was Nailed to the Cross. 8. To the place where he was Anointed. 9. To the Sepulchre of Christ. 10. The place where our Saviour appeared to <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> in the shape of a Gardiner. 11. The Chappel of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> where our Saviour first appeared to her after his Resurrection. I might give you a particular description of the Adornment of these places; but to be short, every one have Lamps burn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing at them; some are paved with Marble, others are hung with Pictures; the place where our Saviour was laid down to be nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:35259:45"/>
to the Cross, is paved with Marble also; but in the exact place where the Cross stood, the Marble is covered over with Silver, with Silver Lamps, and Wax candles continually burning; and our Saviour Crucified standing on it: the Sepulchre also is covered with Marble, with Silver Lamps continually burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it; so hath the Anointing Stone: you must go into the Sepulchre bare foot, as also on <hi>Mount Calvary.</hi>

These Religious People bear little respect one to another, speaking very basely each of other. After our Procession, we went to view all the places and Churches again; the <hi>Greeks</hi> have a place in the middle of their Church, which they say, is the middle of the World: they have another place by the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:35259:45"/>
Prison of Christ, with two holes to put the Feet in: there is also a Narrow Passage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Pillars, which is in imitation of the streightness of the Path to Heaven, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> Creep through.

In the same place is the Rent of the Rock which begins above, near the place where our Saviour was Crucified, and in that Rent they say, <hi>Adams</hi> Head was found, when our Saviour gave up the Ghost.

that lies level with the City, a little beyond <hi>Ieremiahs</hi> Tomb, we came to the Sepulchre of the Kings; the entrance into the first Room was so small and low, that we were forced to creep in, in which there were seven Sepulchres cut out of the Rock: in the second Room, were eight; and in the third Room twenty six; and many more in several other Rooms: One of the Rooms hath a Door of Stone, Cut out of the Rock, and shuts and opens as a Door with Hinges; this Door belongs to the Room, wherein <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saphat</hi> was Buried; his Coffin is of Stone with a Cover to it, and is very neatly Wrote on the sides with Flowers, as several of them are also in the first Room, but they know not what Kings they are; there is also one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Having seen what was Rare at <hi>Bethlehem, May</hi> 31. early in the Morning, we rose to proceed in our Journey, in which we saw these Places following. 1. The Grot where the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> hid her self, when she was warned to Fly into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and her Milk running out of her Breasts there made the Earth turn White; which Earth the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks do very much esteem. 2. <hi>Davids</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterns. 3. The Grot wherein the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Ioseph</hi> lived, before they could get a House. 4. The Tomb of <hi>Rachel, Iacobs</hi> Wife, which the <hi>Turks</hi> do also much esteem. 5. The Field of <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> where the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord slew in one Night, One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred eighty five thousand of the <hi>Syrians</hi>; in this Place is a Village, which is called <hi>Bote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle,</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:35259:49"/>
where the Fathers affirm no <hi>Turk</hi> can live. 6. The place where the Pillars of the Convent of <hi>Ramah</hi> were built. 7. The Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard whence the Spyes of the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> took the Cluster of Grapes, to shew the fruitfulness of it; also the Fountain where <hi>Philip</hi> Baptized the Q. of <hi>Sheba</hi>'s Eunuch. 8. The Desarts of <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi>; and after an hours Riding we came to <hi>Iohn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The place where <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was Born, now a Stable, but formerly a Church, where the Fathers upon <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> day carry their Organs thither, and Adorn the place for their Prayers. 12. The Tombs of the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees,</hi> which we saw at a distance, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruinated, appear as so many Arches. 13.

We passed by a Village, where the Men are all <hi>Turks,</hi> and the Women <hi>Christians</hi>; for the people being poor, the <hi>Turks</hi> were very severe with them for their <hi>Harach</hi>; who not being able to pay all at once, turned <hi>Turks,</hi> &amp;c. 14. We came to the Mountain <hi>Crupil,</hi> where part of the Wood whereof our Saviours Cross was made, was cut down, and over the place where they say the Tree stood, is a stately Church, in the possession of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the just place wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We lay still to recover our selves of our <hi>Bethlehem</hi> Journey, But Father <hi>Tomasa</hi> out of his Zeal, is very importunate with us to be walking to see other places, which is very

We began to search for the Holy places, which are these following. 1. The Immolation of <hi>Isaac</hi> near the Temple, called Mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> inlaid with Silver, and a dish set by for your Offering. 2. <hi>Peters</hi> Prison, still made a Prison by the <hi>Turks</hi>: at the end of which, is a hole in the Wall, where they say the Chain was fasten'd, with which St. <hi>Peter</hi> was Chained; little remembring, how oft <hi>Jerusalem</hi> hath been destroyed, and the stones of that Old Wall are now probably as far under Ground, as these are above. 3. The Monastery of the Knights of <hi>Malta</hi>; a very fair Building, one Room hath several Partitions for Beds, with a hole in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, that if any of them are Sick or Fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, they are laid there to which the water, being Bad and the Air unwholesome, doth very much incline them. 4. <hi>Solomons</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which, if any <hi>Christian</hi> go into, or but up the stairs, he must Turn <hi>Turk,</hi> or be burnt: The Rarity of which I shall give you an Account of, when I come to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect. 5. St. <hi>Hellen's</hi> Hospital where there are seven great Caldrons, in which she used

The <hi>Dolorous Way,</hi> which Christ went, when he went to be Crucified; and in the way is the House of St. <hi>Veronica,</hi> who gave our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour a Napkin to wipe his Face, as he passed by: there is also <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s House, and the House of the <hi>Rich Glutton</hi>; and the place where our Saviour Fainted (as they say) and <hi>Simon</hi> took up the Cross; and near that, is the Church, where the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> stood to see him pass by, and swounded with Grief; now called the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> Church. 8. <hi>Herods</hi> Palace, now ruinated, and is now the <hi>Bashah</hi>'s <hi>Seraglio</hi>; in one Room is the place where they Clothed our Saviour with Purple. 9. <hi>Pilates</hi> House, where they shew the place, where our Saviour was Crowned with Thorns, and the Pillar to which he was bound, which was brought from thence, and put into the Temple: next, we enter the Hall, where <hi>Pilate</hi> washed his Hands, and declared himself Innocent of our Saviours Blood: out of which place we had a fair Prospect of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple; which is built within the middle of a spacious Yard very well Paved; there are several

Ascending up the Mount vve came to the Tombs of <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Cajaphas,</hi> vvho vvere High Priests. 40. And near it is the place vvhere the Apostles hid themselves; vvhere entring a streight passage, vve came into a Room under Ground, out of vvhich there go several holes vvherein they say, the <hi>Apostles</hi> lay. 41. We then came to <hi>Aceldama,</hi> a Grot, novv held by the <hi>Armenians</hi> for a Burying place: it is said, the Earth thereof vvill consume the Body of a Man in Forty Eight Hours: there are several Vents on the Top to let out the smell: We vvent dovvn under a Rock, to a place vvhere vve could look into it, and there savv the form of a Man entire, they being only laid in, but not

            <p>Having seen all that was Remarkable in these Parts, we made toward the Convent, having got a great deal of Credit with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Tomaso</hi>; that we should be such Zealous Pilgrims as to walk from five a Clock in the morning till Mid-day; but he to encourage us, would still be foremost; and told us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, there was some place more worth our seeing, than any before; and though he was old, and the Weather hot, yet at the going up of a Hill, he would run, that he might be foremost: and gave all the good Words that could be, to encourage us Protestants who never hoped or thought, that we Merited any thing by it: but at length we came to the Convent again well weary, every one retiring to his Lodgings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iune</hi> 3. we reposed at the Convent; after Dinner, one of the Fathers came and told us, that the Father <hi>Guardian</hi> would wash our Feet; which Honour we accounted too great for us, and desired to be excused, but we were forced to comply with the Orders of the Convent; The Bason, which was as big as a Tub, was placed by a Chair, there were
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:35259:54"/>
Rose-Leaves and Herbs put into the Water; the Fathers all stood in a Row, Singing God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hymns; we sat down, and the Fath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Guardian</hi> wrapt a Towel about our Knees, to save our Clothes; then they began to scrub our Leggs and Feet, (being Masters of their Art;) there were two <hi>Fratres</hi> attending, one on one Leg, and another on the other; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first dryed the left Foot, the <hi>Frater</hi> kisses it, and puts on our Slipper; then he dryes the Right Foot, and wraps the Towel about the Sole of the Foot, and setting it on his Knee, covers the Toes with his Hand, and then come all the <hi>Fratres,</hi> and Kiss it; he gives us a little Candle, in taking which, we kiss his Hand, and so rise and stand by, till all our Company are Washed in like manner. Then went we in Procession, round their Chappel, they saying several Prayers, at their three Altars, and so we return'd to our Chambers. <hi>Iune</hi> 4. After Dinner we went into the Kitchen, where we found all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with Napkins before them, washing the Dishes, every one taking his part, even to the Father <hi>Guardian</hi> himself; some were cleaning, some handing away; but all the while with one consent, they say some Prayer; it seeming to be their endeavour, that all that they do, may be done to the Glory of God; this being done they go all
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:35259:54"/>
to Prayers, and you shall never see the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel without some of them; yea, and two or three times in the Night they Rise to Prayers. On <hi>Whitsunday</hi> the Chappel was Adorned something Extraordinarily, a very Rich Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy being set on the Right Hand of the high Altar, for the Father <hi>Guardian</hi> to sit under; when the Prayers began, the Father <hi>Guardian</hi> came into the Chappel, and sate under this Canopy: There were three or four Fathers Drest in Cloth of Silver, like Heralds, two whereof attend on each side of the <hi>Guardian,</hi> and two stand over against him. Then they began to dress the Father <hi>Guardian</hi> in his Festival Robes, and having read two or three Lines, put a piece of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen laced about his Neck, and then his Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, Reading still between every Robe that was put on. Then they cover him with a Garment of Rich Sattin, and Cloth of Silver; the two that stand over against him, bowing at some words. His body being thus drest, the two Fathers put a Myter on his head, with all the Respect Imaginable; after a short Prayer, they take the Father <hi>Guardian</hi> by the hand, and lead him to the Altar, he standing in the middle of the four Fathers, adorned as aforesaid; the other Fathers have their Surplices on, and the Organs go; then making a short Prayer at the Altar, they lead
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:35259:55"/>
the <hi>Guardian</hi> to his place again; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little reading they take off his Myter, and he sits bare till the Prayer be done: then they put on another Myter; the first was of Cloth of Silver, and the second of Cloth of Gold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> set full of Rubies, and Diamonds, and other sorts of Stones; they afterward took off that also, and put on a third Myter, of Cloth of Gold, differing in shape from the others. The Guardian being led to and from the Altar, a great while, at length, when they came to read where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Holy Ghost came down upon the Apostles assembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, a Father upon the Terrass, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to throw down a white Pidgeon drest up with Ribbons, in imitation of the Holy Ghost, but he met with some difficulty; for the Window was so fast shut that he could not open it a great while, so that we had like to have gone away without their Holy Ghost: but this difficulty overcome, he made the Dove descend among us, which being done, after a Prayer, they began to undress the Father <hi>Guardian</hi> again, reading all the while his Robes were taking off; and so that days service was done.</p>
            <p>Now we began to think of going to the Dead Seas, and the River <hi>Iordan,</hi> demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what our expence would be; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers say, 25 Livers, but we all agreed not

to give above 20. The Fathers sent our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to the <hi>Bassa,</hi> and he returned an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That if we would go, we should pay 22 Livers; and if we would not, he would have ten Livers a man; we thinking our selves under his command, were not willing to embroil the Convent, who bear all da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, as they have done for several; but thanks be to God, none happened in our time. We all resolved to go except Mr. <hi>T. H.</hi> and one Englishman more, and a Dutchman, not thinking the <hi>Bassa</hi> had been in earnest; but because they went not, they were forced to pay ten Livers for nothing; we then came to <hi>Bethany,</hi> now a small Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, where entring into a Grot under ground, we saw a Tomb; from whence they say our Saviour raised <hi>Lazarus,</hi> after he had been dead so many days; here we had the <hi>Bassa</hi>'s guard to wait upon us, for fear of the <hi>Arabs,</hi> who are on the other side <hi>Iordan</hi> in the Land of <hi>Moab,</hi> and often make Incursions, and have sharp disputes, at the end of the Lance, with those that live on this side, in the land of Promise; The <hi>Bassa</hi> pretended, he must send fifty men with us, but it proved but fourteen or sixteen. Having reposed a little on the ground, about Nine at night, we mounted our Horses, and passing through the turning and winding of the Mountains,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:35259:56"/>
came in the Morning to the foot of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantine</hi> Mountain, where we dismounted; and making the cold Earth our Bed, slept two or three hours, having our Horses made fast to our Hands; and the Sun rising, we rose also, and walked to <hi>Elisha</hi>'s Fountain, a stones thro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> off; and before the Sun was too hot, we mounted our Horses at the foot of the Mountain, and so began to ascend, it being very steep; having ascended a great height, we came to the place where they say our Saviour slept, when he fasted forty days; and from that the Mountain received its name; this place is near the height of the Mountain but the passage to the top is known only to the <hi>Arabs</hi>; here is a Church over this place, where some <hi>Fathers</hi> have lived, till they were murthered by the <hi>Arabs.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low are several Cisterns of water, and Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis pieces of Chappels, but the passage to them is cut off; as we were going up, the thoughts of the danger of descending, enters into our heads, and the E. of <hi>Germanies</hi> Drugger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for these Country Languages, being fearful, got two <hi>Turks</hi> to conduct him down, and so having all had a safe descent, we rode cheerfully back to <hi>Elisha</hi>'s Fountain, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly bitter; but he throwing in a handful of salt, the waters became sweet. Here we lay till four a Clock, and the heat of the Sun
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:35259:56"/>
being over, made for <hi>Iericho,</hi> arrived about five, where there are now only a few poor Cottages: we pitched by <hi>Zacheus</hi> Tree. The Inhabitants are most <hi>Arabians,</hi> and some few <hi>Greeks</hi>: here the Captain of the Village came to welcome our <hi>Bassa</hi> and his people mounted upon a Mare, valued at a Thousand Livers, Mares being only in esteem among them; here we reposed under a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hedge, till about four next morning, having little pleasure in our companions, the Gnats and other stinging creatures.</p>
            <p>We proceed for the River <hi>Iordan</hi> arriving by day light, and tarried about an hour to swim in the River; the stream is strong and rapid; and the force of a Man can scarce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist it; it runs into the Dead Sea. Our Guard were very hasty for us to be gone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afraid their Enemies should find them; therefore we all made ready and set forward for the Dead Sea; about two hours after in our way to the Sea we passed through a most cursed, barren place, not having so much as a green herb, or grass, and the face of the Earth was covered with Salt; and though it was dry, yet our Horses sunk up to the Knees. We come now to the Dead Sea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about seventy or eighty Miles in breadth, and about Eighteen over: There is no place Visible from whence the Water, which
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:35259:57"/>
comes into it, runs out again, except it be under the Earth; neither doth it seem to increase with the water of the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> and of several other Waters that run into it: It was once a fruitful Valley, and compared, for delight, unto Paradise, and called <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Our Eyes being satisfied with Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, and Rarities, we make what haste we can back to <hi>Jerusalem</hi>: The Ruins of one of the Cities, that were destroyed for Sodomy, now lyes good part out of the water, and is supposed to be <hi>Zeboim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Sun gets strength, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on the ground, makes the heat so violent, that our faces looked as if the skin were flead off, by riding in the Sun, from Morning till four afternoon; but the Fathers being accustomed, to meet with tender
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:35259:57"/>
faced Travellers, soon provided something to mitigate our pain, which was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, by the saltness of the water of the <hi>Dead Sea</hi>: this night we took little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in eating, but more in sleeping, having had but little in this Voyage. Having now visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the places in the Holy Land, which Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims usually do, we prepare for our return.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iune</hi> 9. We being resolved to set forward in the Morning, the Father <hi>Guardian</hi> came and gave us his blessing, and sprinkled us with Holy Water, desiring us to excuse our Bad Treatment, and that if at any time we had been distasted we would pass it over; but we knew it was a complement, for we had the Civilest Entertainment imaginable, and very far from disgusting us; for they were not only ready to be our servants, but our slaves, yea, my honest name sake Father <hi>Tomaso,</hi> never ceased from Morning to Night, from bringing us either Victuals or Drink, or asking us whether we wanted any thing; and now for this his fourteen days service, we were no ways capable to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence him; for they would take no money, but for our Victuals, and some other small ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; we therefore presented to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, thirty Livers a piece, and some that had servants more. The Father <hi>Procurator</hi> receiving it, they entred all our names in a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:35259:58"/>
Book, and the sums we gave: the Book where the names only were written we had a view of, and took a Copy of all the <hi>English-mens</hi> that were in it, from the year 1661. to this day, being 158 in number.</p>
            <p>Now taking our leaves of the Fathers, they all shewed great affection to us, weeping, and expressing their desires, to enjoy our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer; and our desires were as much to be nearer home, to have an Account of our Friends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iune</hi> 4. we departed, our <hi>Mulletteers</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provided us Horses; intending to take <hi>Emaus</hi> in our way, but night drawing on, we made St. <hi>Ieroms</hi> Church our sleeping place; formerly Fathers lived in it, but the <hi>Arabs</hi> came upon them in the night, and cut all their Throats; The Church is well built, and hath been adorned with Pictures on the Wall, of which some remain to this day. About two hours riding from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> we passed over the brook, out of which they say, <hi>David</hi> gathered the Pebble stones, to slay <hi>Goliah. Iune</hi> 5. we arrived at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in <hi>Ramah</hi> about ten in the Morning; where we tarried till mid-night, at which time there was a Ship to depart, and some of us intended to embarque; the rest took a Boat like a <hi>Gravesend</hi> Barge; we put our provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Bread and Wine aboard, and so put
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:35259:58"/>
to Sea, keeping always near the shore for fear of a Storm. After three days Sail, we arrived at <hi>Aerica,</hi> formerly called <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> always coming to Anchor at night; this place is famous for nothing but the ruins, the Road being so bad, that all the Art Captains have, can but keep their Cables together. The Commodities in this place are only <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, Pot-ashes,</hi> and some <hi>Filletto's.</hi> Two days after we arrived at <hi>Trippoly,</hi> where we made bold at our old House; the Consul receives us very gladly, and our design was to depart next day, but the Plague still rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> the Consul forced us to stay 12 or 14 days; all which time we were treated like Princes, and then by his leave we imbarqued on a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship for <hi>Scande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roon</hi>; the rest of our Company (whom we left at <hi>Aerica</hi> to go to see the Sea of <hi>Galilee</hi>) being arrived. <hi>Iune</hi> 26. we arrived at <hi>Scanderoon,</hi> where some were dead, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers dying, and one flying from another. We tarried upon the Mount and aboard the Ship for some time: and <hi>July</hi> 2d. we arrived at <hi>Aleppo</hi>: where there died at that time, Seventy or Eighty of a day of the Plague. And thus ended our Journey.</p>

            <head>A True Relation OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE GREAT COUNCIL OF THE JEWS, Assembled in the Plains of <hi>Ajayday,</hi> in <hi>Hungaria,</hi> about 30 Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from <hi>Buda</hi>; to examine the <hi>Scriptures</hi> concerning <hi>Christ.</hi> On the 12<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1650. By <hi>Samuel Brett</hi> (an English-man) there present.</head>
            <p>IT hath been much desired by many honest <hi>Christians,</hi> that this Relation of the <hi>Jews</hi> Council should be Published, which I did intend to Communicate only to my private <hi>Friends.</hi> The chief <hi>Argument</hi> which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:35259:59"/>
me to do it, was, because they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it to be a <hi>preparation, and hopeful sign of the</hi> Jews <hi>Conversion</hi>: And that will be glad-Tydings to the Church of Christ: therefore I yielded to satisfie their desires. And thus it was.</p>
            <p>At the place above-said, there assembled about 300 <hi>Rabbies</hi> (called <hi>Jews</hi>) from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of the World, to examine the <hi>Scriptures</hi> concerning <hi>Christ.</hi> It seems this place was thought most convenient for this Council, in regard, that part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is not much Inhabited, because of the continual Wars between the <hi>Turk,</hi> and the King of <hi>Hungaria.</hi> There they have Fought formerly two bloody Battels. Yet, both these Princes notwithstanding their own Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, did give leave to the <hi>Jews</hi> to hold their Council there. The <hi>Jews</hi> for their own Accommodation, made divers Tents for their repose, and had plenty of Provision brought them, from other parts of the Country, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of their sitting. The <hi>Jews</hi> making (as we said) divers Tents, they set up one Large Tent, only for the Council to sit in, being made almost four-square: the North and South, not altogether so large, as the East and West part. It had but one Door, and that opened to the Ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t. In the middle of the Tent there stood a Table, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35259:60"/>
a Stool for the <hi>Propounder</hi> to sit on, with his face towards the Door of the Tent. The <hi>Propounder</hi> was of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> named <hi>Zacharias.</hi> And within this Tent, round about, were placed Forms on which stood the rest of the Council. They were enclos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Rail, at a distance from them; to prevent all Strangers, and all such as could not prove themselves to be <hi>Iews</hi> by Record, or dispute in the <hi>Hebrew Tongue</hi>: which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had forgotten, that lived in such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where they were not allowed their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues: As in <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and those parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> that belong to the K. of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the K. of <hi>Naples</hi>; with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Apulia, Sicilia, Calabria,</hi> and <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia</hi>: In which places, if a <hi>Iew</hi> be found, and denies the <hi>Popish Religion,</hi> he is condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Executed for it: And yet Profit and Benefit allure them to dwell in those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, notwithstanding their fears and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: And, they are willing themselves to forget and neglect to teach their Children their Native Language, rather than lose their opportunity of Profit. And again, some of those <hi>Iews</hi> have burned the Ancient Records of their Tribes and Families, that they might not be discovered, by searching, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. And for this defect that they could not prove their Tribe and Family, they were
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:35259:60"/>
not permitted to come within the Rails, in the time of their Council; but commanded to remain with the Strangers that attended to see the Event of this Assembly. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the <hi>Number</hi> of the People that <hi>attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> to see the Issue of their Proceedings, were about <hi>Three Thousand</hi> Persons: the most part of them <hi>Germans, Almains, Dalmatians,</hi> with some <hi>Greeks,</hi> and a few <hi>Italians,</hi> but not one <hi>Englishman</hi> more than my self: For, I was informed that the K. of <hi>Hungary,</hi> not favouring the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> did give no no Encouragement to any <hi>Protestant</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, to send any Divines thither. But, he did allow there should be some Assistants sent from <hi>Rome</hi>; and, their coming thither prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great unhappiness to this hopeful Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly or Council.</p>
            <p>The FIRST <hi>Day,</hi> When the Assembly first met, they spent some time in mutual Salutations, and as their manner is, kissed one anothers Cheeks: expressing great joy for this their happy Meeting. And now, all things being prepared for their Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, they Considered of the <hi>Iews</hi> that were to be admitted for Members of this Council; For they only were admitted to be Members, that could, by Record, prove themselves to be Native <hi>Iews.</hi> And I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, there were about <hi>five hundred</hi> refused,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:35259:61"/>
and put by, though doubtless, they were true <hi>Iews</hi> yet they could not, by Record, prove themselves so to be. And, for this were not admitted to be Members of this Council, but commanded to abide without, among the Strangers that attended there. The number of them that could prove themselves <hi>Jews,</hi> by Record, were <hi>three hundred</hi>; who were accepted to sit in the Council. And this was all that was done the <hi>first day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The SECOND <hi>Day,</hi> the Assembly being full, the <hi>Propounder Zacharias,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> stood up, and made a Speech, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the End of their Meeting. And this (said he) is, <hi>To examine the Scriptures concerning Christ; whether he be already come; or, whether we are to expect his coming</hi>? In exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining this Question, they searched the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> with great Care, and Labour, most part of that day, to be resolved in the Truth; having many <hi>Bibles</hi> to that end. About which Point began a dispute, that lasted many hours; which, at last, drave to this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, <hi>That the Major part of this Assembly were of Opinion, That Christ was not Come.</hi> But, some others of the Assembly, having strictly Examined the Scriptures, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them so plain for his coming, were inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think that <hi>Christ</hi> was come. Being the rasher moved so to think, by the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:35259:61"/>
of the great Judgment that hath been upon them these 1600. years. By reason whereof, they have been as a Cast-off and Vagabond People: which consideration, pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vailed so far upon many others, as drave them not only to think, but to conclude, That <hi>Christ</hi> was come. I remember one of them in Conference with others, seemed to be very apprehensive of the great and long desolation of their Nation, ever since their Destruction by the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted their Afflictions to their Non-repenting of such a wickedness, as to kill the Lord from Heaven. And comparing their present, with other Judgments, which their Nation had suffered, he ingenuously confessed, he did believe it was for some wickedness that their Nation was guilty of. And that one of their great Sins he thought, was the spill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Blood of the Prophet sent from God to their Nation, and so many Massacres that have been committed by the several Sects, and Factions among them. For, said he, we are no Idolaters, nor are we guilty of Idolatry: And therefore I think, we have not had this heavy Judgment upon us for that; but, surely it is the spilling the Blood of <hi>Jesus,</hi> the Prophet sent from God, and for Massacring those that loved him. And this was the sum of what was Disputed the

               <hi>Second Day</hi> of their Meeting, and so they ceased until the next morning.</p>
            <p>The THIRD <hi>Day</hi> being Assembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether again, the Point chiefly agitated, was concerning the <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>Christs</hi> Coming. And that (they said) should be like a Mighty Prince, in the Power and Authority of a King: Yea, in greater power than ever King had, And that he will deliver their Nation out of the Power of their Adversaries; and restore them to their Kingdom again. And that the Nations should be of their Religion; and Worship God after their Manner. For they held, that the <hi>Messiah</hi> will not alter their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, whensoever he cometh. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore began to conclude, <hi>That Christ was not come.</hi> For <hi>Jesus</hi> (said they) the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, when he came, began to alter our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: therefore he was not the true <hi>Messiah.</hi> And farther, when <hi>Jesus</hi> came, whom some call the <hi>True Messiah,</hi> he began presently to pluck down our Religion, and set up his own: therefore he was not the <hi>True Messiah.</hi> Thus some of them concluded. But some did not. But they went from this Dispute to another, concerning his <hi>Parentage</hi>: They did all agree in this, <hi>That he shall be born of a Virgin,</hi> according to the Praedictions of the <hi>Prophets</hi> in the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> And in this also, <hi>That he should be born of a Virgin, of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:35259:63"/>
mean Note and Parentage,</hi> among their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as was the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that bare <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> the great Prophet from God. And, upon this, many of them seemed to incline to think that <hi>Christ</hi> was come: but left it to the next Day, when they should again Meet together.</p>
            <p>The FOURTH <hi>Day</hi>; The Assembly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing met, the <hi>Propounder</hi> demanded what they thought, Whether <hi>Christ</hi> was come, or no? They said, <hi>They thought he was come.</hi> But they Answered thus; That if he were come, he was no other than <hi>Elias</hi>: because, <hi>Elias</hi> came formerly in great power, and with great power he declared it, in slaying the Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> and for fulfilling the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> he was opposed by <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Iezebel.</hi> And so they esteemed this Man, whom they called <hi>Iesus,</hi> to be that same <hi>Elias.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, others said; That they thought he was <hi>more than a Mortal Man</hi> in that he so strangely <hi>Ascended</hi> up into Heaven, which some of our Fore-fathers saw; and this was all that was done on the Fourth Day.</p>
            <p>The FIFTH <hi>Day,</hi> The Assembly being Met, they went about the same Question that was Controverted the day before, and took it into Examination again to answer them, that said <hi>Elias</hi> was not the <hi>Messiah.</hi> They of the contrary Opinion, did argue the love
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:35259:64"/>
and care of <hi>Elias,</hi> for the good of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: That he left them <hi>Elisha</hi> his <hi>Disciple,</hi> to teach, and instruct the People: And this they took to be the care of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> These were their chief Arguments to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Opinion. The same day towards night, came into Question among them, what then he was, that said, <hi>He was the Son of God</hi>: and was <hi>Crucified by their Ancestours</hi>? But, because this was a Great Question a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them they deferred the farther Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration thereof until the next day.</p>
            <p>The SIXTH <hi>Day,</hi> there were some <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,</hi> that stood up, who were the great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of <hi>Christ,</hi> and said, they would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to answer the last Question: And would by no means yield, that he was <hi>The Christ.</hi> And these are the Reasons they gave for their Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Because he came into the World like an ordinary and inferior Man; not with his Scepter, and Royal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. For, they affirmed, That the coming of <hi>Christ</hi> would be Glorious. 2. <hi>Reason</hi> they pleaded against him, was the meanness of his Birth, in that his Father was a <hi>Carpenter,</hi> and this (they said) was a dishonour of which, when <hi>Christ</hi> comes, he will not be capable. 3. <hi>Reason</hi>; They accused him to be a <hi>False Christ,</hi> and an Enemy to <hi>Moses Law,</hi> in doing, and suffering his Disciples to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:35259:64"/>
do unlawful Works on the Sabbath Day. For, they believed (they said) that the <hi>True Messiah</hi> will exactly keep the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> Now, though it were replied, that the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> doth testifie of <hi>Christ,</hi> that he did fulfil the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>; yet they rejected that answer, because they did not believe, and own the Gospel. But these reasons did not satisfie the Council, there still remaining doubts in them concerning <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that, after the <hi>Pharisees</hi> had done speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there stood one up Rabbi <hi>Abraham,</hi> and objected against the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> The Miracles that <hi>Christ</hi> wrought, while he was upon the Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Raising of the Dead</hi> to life again; his making the <hi>Lame to walk</hi>; the <hi>Blind to see</hi>; the <hi>Dumb to speak</hi>; by what Power I pray you, my Brethren, did he them? With that the <hi>Pharisees</hi> arose, and desired to answer him; and this is the answer they returned before the Council: Perhaps, said they, this <hi>Iesus</hi> was an <hi>Impostor,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician,</hi> and so was enabled to do those Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. And for our parts, we believe, that all the Miracles he did, were done by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick and Charms, whereby they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to their former condition again. But, this answer gave little satisfaction to the Council: and especially to <hi>Abraham</hi>: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Abraham</hi> stood up, and replied, how
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:35259:65"/>
could this <hi>Christ</hi> Charm them <hi>Blind, Lame</hi> and <hi>Dumb,</hi> &amp;c. When they were so born, before <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> himself was born; as it appeared some of them were. This seemed a Paradox to the <hi>Pharisees.</hi> And truly, the prosecuting of this Argument, almost put the <hi>Pharisees</hi> to a <hi>Nonplus</hi>: But, at last they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to speak again, and gave this answer (though a weak and vile one) perhaps (say they) the said Impotent Persons were made so, by other Magicians, and conjured to be <hi>Lame, Blind,</hi> and <hi>Dumb,</hi> &amp;c. And though himself were not then born, when they were born with those evils, yet, this <hi>Iesus</hi> being a greater Dissembler, and more cunning than any Magician before him, Power was given him by the Devil, to remove those Charms which others had placed. But, there was one <hi>Pharisee</hi> among the rest, named <hi>Zebedee,</hi> who, among all the <hi>Pharisees</hi> there assembled, did most Opprobriously, and Blasphemously revile <hi>Christ</hi>; and vehemently urged those things to the Council, against him: But, I conceive not to the well liking of any that heard him, even of the Members of the Council, or of the <hi>Pharisees.</hi> And, as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> played their part against <hi>Christ,</hi> so did the <hi>Sadduces</hi> likewise: For, some of the Council were of that Sect, who did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to render <hi>Christ</hi> vile and odious to the the rest of the <hi>Iews.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:35259:65"/>I observed it to be with the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces,</hi> as once it was with <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>: Though these two could not agree at other times, yet they could agree together to Crucifie <hi>Christ.</hi> So, the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces,</hi> though they be much divided in Opinion, among themselves, yet did they, at this time, too too well agree to disgrace <hi>Christ,</hi> with their Lies, Clamours, and Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, For, the <hi>Sadduces</hi> as well as the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> accused him for a Grand Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, and Magician, in that, in his <hi>Gospel</hi> he taught the <hi>Resurrection from the Dead,</hi> which (say they) we deny. But, it is no Miracle to see Factions agree in some evil design a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst others, as I found by experience in 1650. (which was the year of their <hi>Iubile.</hi>) At which time there was a great Strife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> and the <hi>Friars</hi> of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of St. And though their Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion hath been, by the care and vigilancy of <hi>Pope,</hi> smothered over, that the World then took not much notice; yet this Fire broke out again into a Flame, greater (as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me) tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The SEVENTH <hi>Day.</hi> We are now come to the Seventh day of their meeting; on which this was the main Quaery, <hi>Whether if</hi> Christ <hi>were come, what Rules and Orders hath he left for his Church to walk by</hi>? This was a great Question among them, because they did not believe the <hi>New Testament,</hi> and so would not be guided by it: But demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some other Instructions, to Direct them in this Point. Whereupon six of the <hi>Roman Clergy,</hi> who were on purpose sent thither by the <hi>Pope,</hi> to Advise in the Council, (two of which were <hi>Iesuits,</hi> and four were <hi>Fryers,</hi> two of the Order of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and two of the Order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi>) being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Council, began to open to them the Doctrine, and Rules of the Holy Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; which they Magnified to them for the <hi>Holy Catholick Church of Christ</hi> and their <hi>Doctrines</hi> to be the Infallible Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Christ,</hi> and their <hi>Rules</hi> to be the <hi>Rules</hi> which the <hi>Apostles</hi> left to the <hi>Church,</hi> for ever to be observed. And that the <hi>Pope</hi> is the Holy <hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Successor of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> For Particulars, they affirmed the <hi>Real Presence</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>;

            <p>But, so soon as the Assembly of the <hi>Iews</hi>: heard these things from them, they were all exceedingly troubled thereat, and fell into high Clamours against them; crying out, No <hi>Christ,</hi> No <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> No <hi>Woman Gods,</hi> No <hi>Intercession of the Saints,</hi> No <hi>Holy Crosses,</hi> No Worshipping of <hi>Images,</hi> &amp;c.

            <head>A Brief Chronology Concerning the JEWS, <hi>From</hi> the Year of <hi>Christ</hi> 1650 to 1666.</head>
            <p>HAving evidently seen in the foregoing <hi>Relation,</hi> what was Solemnly Acted (not done in a Corner) in 1650, towards the <hi>Call</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi>; and how far many of the said Council were brought over to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>Messiah</hi>: And how much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>They</hi> and many <hi>Others</hi> of the Council, might have acknowledged <hi>Christ,</hi> had not the <hi>Jesuits</hi> and <hi>Friars</hi> given them an Irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable offence; pretending the Rubbish of the <hi>Popish</hi> Religion, and Idolatrous Worship, to be the Ordinances of <hi>Christ</hi>; there being not one <hi>Protestant Divine</hi> present to Balance against them.</p>
            <p>Ye have also heard what was Resolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of the same Nature, to be Acted in the year 1653. Of which though we cannot
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:35259:69"/>
give a Relation (not knowing whether Mr. <hi>Samuel Brett</hi> lived to that day, and had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to keep his Promise of being there; or if he lived, whether he Wrote the Relation of that years Meeting; or, whether the Man be yet alive) yet we have little cause to doubt but the said Meeting (so Publickly and Solemnly appointed, and of so a grand matter) was pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually Observed and Celebrated, according to the set Time and Place; though we so remotely distant from them have not heard thereof. Yet this we have heard, about that time, or presently after, That some ancient Rabbies Cautioned their Countreymen, <q>That, if their expected <hi>Messiah</hi> did not come in a few years, thence following, they should imbrace the <hi>Christian Messiah</hi> for the True <hi>Messiah.</hi>
               </q> And this also we can Affirm, that whatever came to pass about that time, in order to the <hi>Call</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> may well Comport with the Compute of 1290 years, (<hi>Dan.</hi> 12.) from the <hi>Ceasing</hi> of the <hi>Daily Sacrifice,</hi> if we place that utter Cessation of that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> (at the foot of the Accompt, whence to Commence) as Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Bucholcerus</hi> doth at the year 363.

            <p>In the year 1658 <hi>April</hi> 19. We received Letter from a Religious and Learned Hand,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:35259:70"/>
that one Rabbi <hi>Nathan Sephira,</hi> sent from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to the <hi>Christian Protestant Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> to receive their Free Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence towards the Relief of the <hi>Iews,</hi> then in distress, spake as followeth, <q>I Profess (saith he) that the 53. of <hi>Isaiah</hi> is meant of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> who bare our Sins ever since <hi>Adam.</hi> And for that of <hi>Christs Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> in the fifth, sixth, seventh, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Matthew,</hi> he said, I acknowledge it to be the Head of all Wisdom: And whoever walk according to it, are more Just than we. Of the Spirit of <hi>Messiah,</hi> he said, it hath appeared divers times, as in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> in <hi>Habakkuk</hi>; in our <hi>Iesus,</hi> whom our Fore-fathers wrongfully put to Death; and that Sin lies upon us to this day. And this profession (said he) I make, not only for my self, but for others at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> where the most Pious <hi>Iews</hi> are Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: who with Fastings, Watchings and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exercises of Penitency strive to Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile themselves and the whole Nation to God. Thus far <hi>R. Nathan Sephira.</hi> Now this, and whatsoever else happened about that year 1658, in order to the <hi>Iews</hi> Call, may also competently Comport with the Compute of the 1290 years (<hi>Dan.</hi> 12.) if we put (as Learned <hi>Alsted</hi> doth) the beginning of the said 1290 at the

year of <hi>Christ</hi> 367. His words are these, <hi>Anno</hi> 367, <hi>Terrae motus ingens totum fere,</hi> &amp;c. That is to say; <hi>In the</hi> 367 <hi>year an huge Earth-quake shook almost all the World. A Deluge destroys</hi> Nicaea, <hi>and many Islands.

            <p>If it be questioned, how Learned Men take this liberty, according to Truth, to put the <hi>Cessation of the Daily Sacrifice</hi> so variously, as aforesaid; and so make the Calculations, by the numbers added thereunto, to period so differently? We Answer: It may be, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the <hi>Cessation of the Daily Sacrifice,</hi> caused by the <hi>Prodigious Iudgments</hi> aforesaid, demolishing the <hi>New Buildings</hi> of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: both which must of necessity require a

Latitude of time, <hi>viz.</hi> A considerable time for the <hi>Re-building of the Temple</hi> so far, as that it was (among <hi>Historians</hi>) accompted a <hi>Re-building.</hi> And a considerable time is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for the <hi>fulfilling of those Judgments</hi>; as that <hi>consuming of the Timber-Work,</hi> the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning all the <hi>Stone-Work,</hi> and the <hi>making of the way inaccessible by many other prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgments</hi> (as <hi>Bucholcerus</hi> asserts) <hi>which ever and anon, at several times, detterred the Workmen from that Work.</hi> All which must measure out a long time, from the <hi>Beginning</hi> of that Cessation, since their Repulse at <hi>Mamre,</hi> and while preparing for, and Re-building that structure, till with the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <hi>thereof,</hi> their utmost <hi>hope</hi> ever to <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> there any more, was totally and finally destroyed. And upon this Accompt some may Calculate from the beginning of the Cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, others from the end thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April.</hi> 13. 1663, came a Letter to me, from a Pious and Learned Hand, that he had seen Letters from a Professor of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, in a Famous <hi>Protestant</hi> University: declaring, that certain Men of Note came to him, professing themselves to be <hi>Jews</hi> in Blood, Nation, and Religion; saving that they did <hi>acknowledge Jesus to be the Messiah</hi>: Asking Council of the said Professor, about taking upon them <hi>Circumcision</hi>; who advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

them, that his Nation (being <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>) would not suffer a <hi>Judaical Christian Religion</hi> among them: they departed, and went to another <hi>Protestant</hi> Nation, where such a mingled Religion is tolerated, though not approved.</p>
            <p>In the same year 1663. <hi>September</hi> the fourth I received a Letter from a Learned Man, who much converseth with many <hi>Jews</hi> and Rabbins; That how contemptible soever the <hi>Jews</hi> may seem to be in their present mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable condition, yet for all that, they are <hi>Witnesses</hi> unto the World, That there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a God; yea, and that there was a <hi>Christ,</hi> whom their <hi>Fore-Fathers Crucified.</hi> A Man that did great <hi>Miracles</hi>: And whom his Disciples held, was raised from the Dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the same year 1663, <hi>December</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a little Book, sent to me from the <hi>Mart</hi> at <hi>Franckfort,</hi> called <hi>Judaeorum Exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabulum Matutinum</hi>; containing much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Call of the <hi>Jews</hi> approaching, as the said Title shews.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 12. 1664. I received from a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Friend as followeth: A certain <hi>Jew</hi> a Rabbin, in whose company I was, doth from that place of <hi>Isaiah</hi> 34.8. <hi>It is the day of the Lords Vengeance, and the year of</hi> Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, <hi>for the controversie of Zion,</hi> infer,

that therein seems to be pointed out the Year wherein the Lord will begin to take in hand the cause of <hi>Zion</hi>; that he may render double to them who have hitherto afflicted her.

               <hi>Shillumim.</hi> It might have been sufficient to have said, <hi>This is the day of Vengeance</hi>; unless the Holy Spirit had had a mind, couchedly to Presignifie the year, <hi>viz.</hi> in what year of the <hi>Six Thousand,</hi> should begin the great Sabbatism. And this the Holy Spirit Presignifies while it adjoyneth to the word year, the word <hi>Shillumim</hi> the Numeral Letters of which word written in <hi>Hebrew</hi> make 426. The present year 1663, from the Creation, is numbred by the <hi>Jews</hi> to be 5424; to which, if ye add two years, ye have in the sixth Millenary 426. And if we number from the Birth of <hi>Christ,</hi> we have, after two years, the number of the <hi>Beast.</hi> viz. 666.

As for the present year 1665 (within 5 days now expiring) I have not medled with the occurrences thereof, because of them, Mens Pockets are full of <hi>Letters</hi>; their Hands full of <hi>Gazets</hi>; their Ears full of <hi>Reports</hi> and <hi>Tidings</hi>; and their Eyes suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently perceive the <hi>Jews</hi> cease Trading, pack up, and are marching.

               <p>AS by the preceding Account we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve what thoughts and expectations divers well meaning Christians had of the call and return of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the year 1666. and particularly of the noise that was made in the World by the pretended <hi>Messiah Sabatai Sevi,</hi> who just about that time impudently assumed to himself that title, and declared that he was come to deliver the <hi>Jews</hi> from slavery, and carry them to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> there to reign over them; so the following Relation gives a Clear and Impartial Account of the actions, and death of that vain Impostor, and the Scandal which the <hi>Jews</hi> brought upon themselves by their fond and easy Credulity, and it may likewise serve as a remembrance to all sober men that secret things belong only to God, and Revealed to man, that we may keep his Laws. The Author hereof is an <hi>English</hi> Gentleman of Quality, and a Person who was in that Station, as to be capable of throughly informing himself of the truth of all Particulars and it may therefore Challenge the Credit of the most Captious Reader.</p>

            <head>THE Counterfeit Messiah OR False Christ OF THE JEWS AT SMYRNA, In the year 1666. written by an English Person of Quality there Resident.</head>
            <p>ACcording to the Predictions of several <hi>Christian</hi> Writers, especially of such who Comment on the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> or Revelations, this Year 1666, was to prove a Year of Wonders, and strange Revolutions in the World, and particularly of Blessings to the <hi>Iews,</hi> either in respect of their Conversion to the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith, or of their Restoration to their Temporal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms: This Opinion was so dilated, and fixt in the Countreys of the Reformed Religion, as to the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and the greatness of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:35259:74"/>
the <hi>Iews,</hi> in so much, that this subtle People judged this Year the time to stir, and to fit their Motion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the season of the Modern Prophecies; whereupon strange Reports flew from place to place of the March of Multitudes of People from unknown parts into the remote Desarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> supposed to be the <hi>Ten Tribes</hi> and <hi>half,</hi> lost for so many Ages. That a Ship was arrived in the Northern parts of <hi>Scotland</hi> with her Sails and Cordage of Silk. Navigated by Mariners who spake nothing but <hi>Hebrew</hi>; with this Motto on their Sails, <hi>The Twelves Tribes of Israel.</hi> These Reports agreeing thus near to former Predictions, put the wild sort of the World into an expectation of strange Accidents, this year should produce in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Monarchy.</p>
            <p>In this manner Millions of People were possessed, when <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> first appear'd at <hi>Smyrna</hi> and publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself to the <hi>Iews</hi> for their <hi>Messiah,</hi> relating the greatness of their approaching Kingdom, the strong hand whereby God would free from bondage and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them from all parts of the World. It was strange to see how the fancy took, and how fast the report of <hi>Sabatai</hi> and his Doctrine flew through all parts where <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Iews</hi> inhabited, the latter of which were so deeply Possessed with a belief of their new Kingdom, and Riches, and many of them with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion to Offices of Government, Renown, and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that in all parts from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>Buda</hi> (which it was my fortune that year to Travel) I perceived a strange transport in the <hi>Iews,</hi> none of them attending to any business unless to wind up former negotiations, and to prepare themselves and Families for a Journey to <hi>Ierusalem</hi>: All their Discourses, their Dreams and disposal of their Affairs tended to no other Design but a re-establishment in the Land of Promise, to Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Glory, Wisdom, and Doctrine of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> whose Original, Birth, and Education are first to be recounted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:35259:74"/>
               <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> was Son of <hi>Mordechai Sevi</hi> an Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and Natural of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> who gained his Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood by being <hi>Broaker</hi> to an <hi>English</hi> Merchant in that place; a person who before his death was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit in his Body and full of the Gout, and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, but his Son <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> addicting himself to Study, became a notable Proficient in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Metaphysicks</hi>; and arrived to that point of <hi>Sophistry</hi> in <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> that he vented a New Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in their Law, drawing to the Profession of it so many Disciples as raised one day a Tumult in the <hi>Synagogue</hi>; for which afterwards he was by a Censure of the <hi>Chochams</hi> (who are Expounders of the Law) banished the City.</p>
            <p>During the time of his Exile, he Travelled to <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonica,</hi> now called <hi>Salonica,</hi> where he Married a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry handsome Woman; but either not having that part of Oeconomy as to govern a Wife, or being Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent towards Women, as was pretended, or that she found not favour in his Eyes, she was divorced from him: Again he took a second Wife, more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful than the former, but the same causes of discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent raising a difference between them, he obtained another Divorce from this VVife also. And being now free from the Incumbrances of a Family, his wandring head mov'd him to Travel through the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi> thence to <hi>Trippoly</hi> in <hi>Syria, Gaza,</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; and by the way picked up a <hi>Ligorness</hi> Lady, whom he made his third Wife, the Daughter of some <hi>Polonian</hi> or <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> her Original and Parentage not being very well known. And being now at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> he began to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and Abolish the <hi>Fast</hi> of <hi>Tamuz</hi> (which they keep in the Month of <hi>Iune</hi>) and there meeting with a certain <hi>Iew</hi> called <hi>Nathan,</hi> a proper Instrument to promote his Design, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to him his Condition, his Course of Life, and Intentions to Proclaim himself <hi>Messiah</hi> of the World, so long expected and desired by the <hi>Iews.</hi> This Design
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:35259:75"/>
took wonderfully with <hi>Nathan</hi>; and because it was thought necessary according to <hi>Scripture,</hi> and Ancient <hi>Prophesies,</hi> that <hi>Elias</hi> was to precede the <hi>Messiah,</hi> as St. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was the forerunner of <hi>Christ, Nathan</hi> thought no man so proper to Act the part of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> as himself; and so no sooner had <hi>Sabatai</hi> declared himself the <hi>Messiah,</hi> but <hi>Nathan</hi> discovers himself to be his Prophet, forbidding all the Fasts of the <hi>Iews</hi> in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and declaring, that the Bridegroom being come, nothing but Joy, and Triumph ought to dwell in their Habitations: Writing to all the Assemblies of the <hi>Iews,</hi> to perswade them to the same belief.</p>
            <p>And now the Schism being begun, and many <hi>Iews</hi> really believing what they so much desired, <hi>Nathan</hi> took the courage and boldness to Prophesie, That one Year from the 27th of <hi>Kisleu,</hi> (which is the month of <hi>Iune</hi>) the <hi>Messiah</hi> shall appear before the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and take from him his Crown, and lead him in Chains like a Captive.</p>
            <p>

               </hi> Preached Repentance to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and Obedience to himself and Doctrine, for that the coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi> was at hand: which Novelties so affected the <hi>Iewish</hi> Inhabitants of those parts, that they gave up themselves wholly to their Prayers, Alms, and Devotions; and to confirm this belief the more, it happened, that at the same time News hereof, with all particulars were dispatched from <hi>Gaza,</hi> to acquaint the Brethren in Forreign Parts: The Rumour of the <hi>Messiah</hi> was flown so swift, and gained such reception, that intelligence came from all Parts and Countreys where the <hi>Iews</hi> inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Letters to <hi>Gaza,</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Congratulating the happiness of their Deliverance, and expiration of the time of their Servitude, by the Appearance of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> To which they adjoyned other Prophesies, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to that Dominion the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to have over all the World: that for 9 Months after he was to disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; during which time th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And here I leave you to consider, how strangely this deceived People was Amused, when these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, and vain Reports, and Dreams of Power, and Kingdoms, had wholly transported them from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary course of their Trade, and Interest.</p>
            <p>This noise and rumour of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to fill all places; <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> resolved to Travel towards <hi>Smyrna,</hi> the Country of his Nativity; and thence to <hi>Constantinople</hi> the Capital <hi>City,</hi> where the principal Work of Preaching was to have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: <hi>Nathan</hi> thought it not fit to belong after him, and therefore Travels by the way of <hi>Damascus,</hi> where resolving to continue some time for better Propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this new Doctrine; in the mean while Writes the following Letter to <hi>Sabatai Sevi.</hi>

full of Assurance that the Restoration of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the accomplishment of the time for the coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi> was at hand, judged themselves obliged to double their Devotions, and Purifie their Consciences from all Sins and Enormities which might be obvious to the scrutiny of him who was now come to Penetrate into the very Thoughts and Imaginations of Mankind: In which Work certain <hi>Chochams</hi> or Priests were appointed to direct the People how to Regulate their Prayers, Fasts, and other Acts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. But so forward was every one now in his Acts of Pennance, that they stay'd not for the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the <hi>Chocham,</hi> or prescription of any Rules, but apply'd themselves immediately to Fasting: And some in that manner beyond the abilities of Nature, that having for the space of seven days taken no suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, were famished to death. Others buried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their Gardens, covering their naked Bodies with Earth, their heads only excepted, remained in their Beds of dirt until their Bodies were stiffned with the cold and moisture: others would endure to have mel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the most common way of Mortification was first to prick their Backs and Sides with Thorns, and then to give themselves thirty nine Lashes. All busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was laid aside, none wrought, or opened Shop, unless to clear his Warehouse of Merchandize at any Price: who had superfluity in Housholdstuff, sold it for what he could; but yet not to <hi>Iews,</hi> for they were Interdicted from Bargains or Sales on the pain of Excommunication, Pecuniary Mulcts, or Corporal Punishments; all Business and Imployment was esteemed for the Test, and Touchstone of their Faith. It being the general Tenent, that in the days that the <hi>Messiah</hi> appears, the <hi>Iews</hi> shall become Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Estates and Inheritance of <hi>Infidels</hi>; until
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:35259:77"/>
when they are to content themselves with matters only necessary to maintain and support Life; but because every one was not Master of so much Fortune and Provision, as to live without daily Labour, therefore to quiet the Clamours of the Poor, and prevent the Enormous lives of some, who upon these occasions would become Vagabonds, and desert their <hi>Cities,</hi> due order was taken to make Collections, which were so liberally bestowed that in <hi>Thessalonica</hi> only, 400 Poor were supported by the meer Charity of the Richer. And as they indeavour'd to purge their <hi>Consciences</hi> of Sin, and to apply themselves to good Works, that the <hi>Messiah</hi> might find the City prepared for his Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; so lest he should accuse them of any omission in the Law, and particularly in their neglect of that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Precept of Increase and Multiply; they married together Children of ten years of age, and some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, without respect to Riches, or Poverty, Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Quality: But, being promiscuously joined to the number of 6 or 700 Couple, upon better and cooler thoughts, after the deceipt of the false <hi>Messiah</hi> was discover'd, or the expectation of his Coming grew cold, were Divorced, or by Consent separated from each other.</p>
            <p>In the heat of all this Talk and Rumour comes <hi>Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tai Sevi</hi> to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> the City of his Nativity, infinitely desired there by the common <hi>Iews</hi>; but by the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chams,</hi> or <hi>Doctors</hi> of their <hi>Law,</hi> who gave little or no credence to what he pretended, was ill received, not knowing what mischief or ruine this Doctrine and Prophesie of a New Kingdom might produce. Yet <hi>Sabatai</hi> bringing with him testimonials of his Sanctity, Holy Life, Wisdom and gift of Prophesie, so deeply fixed himself in the heart of the Generality, both as being Holy and Wise, that thereupon he took courage and boldness to enter into Dispute with the Grand <hi>Chocham</hi> (who is the head, and Chief Expositor of the <hi>Law</hi> and super-intendent of their Will and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:35259:78"/>
between whom the Arguments grew so high, and Language so hot, that the <hi>Iews</hi> who favoured the Doctrine of <hi>Sabatai,</hi> and feared the Authority of the <hi>Chochams,</hi> doubtful what might be the issue of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, appeared in great numbers before the <hi>Cadi</hi> of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> in justification of their New Prophet, before so much as any Accusation came against him. The <hi>Cadi</hi> (according to the Custom of the <hi>Turks,</hi>) swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Money on both sides, and afterwards remits them to determination of their own Justice. In this manner <hi>Sabatai</hi> gains ground daily; and the Grand <hi>Chocham</hi> with his Party, losing both the affection and obedience of his People, is displaced from his Office, and another Constituted, more affectionate, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ness, that no Comedy could equal the mock-shews they represented; and though none durst openly profess any scruple, or doubt of this common received belief, yet for confirmation of the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Faith, and astonishment of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> it was judged no less than necessary that <hi>Sabatai</hi> should shew some miracles whereby to evince to all the World that he was the true <hi>Messiah</hi>: and as the present occasion seemed to require an evidence infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this truth, so it was daily expected by the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, with an impatience sutable to humours disposed to Novelty; who out of every action and motion of their Prophet began to fancy something extraordinary and supernatural. <hi>Sabatai</hi> was now horribly puzzled for a Miracle, though the imagination of the people was so vitiated that any <hi>Legerdemain</hi> or slight of hand

such who would press to follow him, should endanger him in the Eyes of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who already began to be scandalized at the reports and Prophesies concerning his person. But though <hi>Sabatai</hi> took few into the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel to him, yet a multitude of <hi>Iews</hi> travelled over land to meet him again at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> on whom all their Eyes and Expectations were intent. The Wind proving Northernly, as commonly it is in the <hi>Helles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont</hi> and <hi>Propontis; Sabatai</hi> was thirty nine days in his Voyage, and yet the Vessel not arriv'd, so little power had this <hi>Messiah</hi> over the Sea and Winds, in which time news being come to <hi>Constantinople</hi> that the <hi>Iews Messiah</hi> was near, all that people prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him with the same Joy and Impatience as was exprest in other parts where he arrived; the great <hi>Vizier</hi> (then also at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> being not yet depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his expedition for <hi>Candia</hi>) having heard some rumours of this man, and the disorder and madness he had raised amongst the <hi>Iews</hi>; sent two Boats, whilst the <hi>Saick</hi> was detained by contrary winds, with commands to bring him up Prisoner to the Port, where accordingly <hi>Sabatai</hi> being come, was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the most loathsome and darkest Dungeon in in the Town, there to remain in farther expectation of the <hi>Viziers</hi> sentence, The <hi>Iews</hi> were not at all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged at this ill treatment of their Prophet, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed in their belief of him, as being the accomplishment of the prophesie of those things which ought to precede his glory and dominion; which consideration induc'd the chiefest persons amongst the <hi>Iews</hi> to make their visits and addresses to him with the same ceremony and respect in the Dungeon as they would have done had he then sat exalted on the throne of <hi>Israel</hi>: several of them, with one <hi>Anacago,</hi> by name, a man of great esteem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> attended a whole day be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Constantinople</hi> were now become as mad and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted as they were in other places, all trade and traffique forbidden, and those who owed money, in no manner careful how to satisfie it: amongst which wild crew some were indebted to our Merchants at <hi>Galata,</hi> who not knowing the way to receive their money, partly for their interest, and partly for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity thought fit to visit this <hi>Sabatai</hi> complaining that such particular <hi>Iews,</hi> upon his coming, took upon them the boldness to defraud them of their right, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired he would signifie to these his Subjects, his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to have satisfaction given: whereupon <hi>Sabatai</hi> with much affectation took Pen and Paper, and wrote to this effect.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In this manner <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> remained a Prisoner at <hi>Constantinople</hi> for the space of two Months; at the end of which the <hi>Vizier</hi> having designed his expedition for <hi>Candia</hi>; and considering the rumor and disturbance the presence of <hi>Sabatai</hi> had made already at <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thought it not secure to suffer him to remain in the Imperial City, whil'st both the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> and himself were absent: and therefore changes his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to the <hi>Dardanelli,</hi> otherwise called the <hi>Castle</hi> of <hi>Aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos,</hi> being on the <hi>Europe</hi> side of the <hi>Hellespont</hi> opposite

to <hi>Sestos,</hi> places famous in <hi>Greek</hi> Poetry.

This freedom of the <hi>Chocham</hi> so enraged and scandalized the <hi>Jews</hi> that they judged no Condemnation or Punishment too severe against such an Offender and Blasphemer of their Law, and Holiness of the <hi>Messiah</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with Money and Presents to the <hi>Cadi,</hi> accusing him as disobedient in a Capital nature to their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, obtained sentence against him, to have his Beard shaved, and to be condemned to the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</hi> There wanted nothing now to the appearance of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and the solemnity of his coming, but the presence of <hi>Elias,</hi> whom the <hi>Jews</hi> began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect hourly; and with that intention and earnestness, that every Dream or Phantasm to a weak head was judged to be <hi>Elias</hi>; it being taught, and averred, that he was seen in divers forms and shapes, not to be certainly discovered or known, before the coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi>; for this superstition is so far fixed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, that generally in their Families they spread a Table for <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet, to which they
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:35259:85"/>
make an Invitation of Poor People, leaving the chief place for the Lord <hi>Elias,</hi> whom they believe to be invisibly present at the entertainment, and there to Eat and Drink, without diminution, either of the Dishes, or of the Cup. One person amongst the <hi>Jews</hi> commanded his Wife after a supper of this kind, to leave the Cup filled with Wine, and the Meat stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all night, for <hi>Elias</hi> to Feast, and Rejoyce alone; And in the morning arising early, affirmed, that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> took his Banquet so kindly, that in token of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and acceptance, he had replenished the Cup with Oyl, in stead of Wine. It is a certain Custom among the <hi>Jews</hi> on the Evening of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> to repeat certain Praises of God (called <hi>Havaila</hi>) which signifies a distinction, or separation of the Sabbath from the prophane days (as they call them) which praises they observe to perform in this manner; One takes a Cup filled with Wine, and drops it through the whole House, saying, <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet, come quickly to us with the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and <hi>David</hi>; and this they affirm to be so acceptable to <hi>Elias,</hi> that he never fails to preserve that family, so devoted to him, and augment it with the blessings of Increase. Many other things the <hi>Jews</hi> avouch of <hi>Elias,</hi> so ridiculous, as are not fit to be declar'd, amongst which this one is not far from our purpose that at the Circumcision there is always a Chair set for <hi>Elias,</hi> and <hi>Sabatai Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi</hi> being once Invited at <hi>Smyrna</hi> to the Circumcision of the First-born Son of one <hi>Abraham Gutiere,</hi> a Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Sabatai,</hi> and all things ready for the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> exhorted the Parents of the Child to expect a while until his farther Order: After a good half hour, <hi>Sabatai</hi> order'd them to proceed and cut the <hi>Prepuce</hi> of the Child, which was instantly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd with all joy and satisfaction to the Parents: and being afterwards demanded the reason why he retarded the performance of that Function, his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:35259:85"/>
was, That <hi>Elias</hi> had not as yet taken his Seat, whom assoon as he saw placed, he ordered them to proceed; and that now shortly <hi>Elias</hi> would discover himself openly, and proclaim the news of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Redemption.</p>
            <p>This being the common Opinion amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> being become an Article of Faith, it was not hard to perswade them, that <hi>Elias</hi> was come already, that they met him in their Dishes, in the dark, in their Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or any where else invisible, in the same manner as our common People in <hi>England</hi> believe of <hi>Hobgob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins and Fairies.</hi> For so it was, when <hi>Solomon Cremona,</hi> an Inhabitant of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> making a great Feast, to which the Principal <hi>Jews</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> were Invited, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had eaten and drank freely, one starts from his Seat, and avouches that he saw <hi>Elias</hi> upon the Wall, and with that bows to him, and Complements him with all Reverence and Humility: Some others having in like manner their Fancies prepossessed, and their Eyes with the fume of Wine ill prepared to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish shadows, immediately agreed upon the Object, &amp; then there was not one in the Company who would say he did not see him: at which surprize every one was struck with reverence and awe; and the most Eloquent amongst them, having their Tongues loosed with Joy, and Wine, directed <hi>Orations, Encomiums,</hi> and acts of Thankfulness to <hi>Elias,</hi> courting and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementing him, as distracted Lovers do the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed presence of their Mistresses.

            <p>The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> having by this time received di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers informations of the madness of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the pretences of <hi>Sabatai,</hi> grew big with desire and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation to see him: so that he no sooner arrived at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> but the same hour he was brought before the <hi>Grand Signior: Sabatai</hi> appeared much dejected, and failing of that courage which he shewed in the <hi>Synagogue</hi>; and being demanded several Questions in <hi>Turkish</hi> by the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> he would not trust so far to the vertue of his <hi>Messiah-ship,</hi> as to deliver himself in the <hi>Turkish Language</hi>; but desired a <hi>Doctor</hi> of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,</hi> (who had from a <hi>Jew</hi> turned <hi>Turk,</hi>) to be his

But now <hi>Sabatai</hi> not having faith enough to stand to so sharp a trial, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all his title to Kingdoms and Governments, alledging that he was an ordinary <hi>Chocham,</hi> and a poor <hi>Jew,</hi> as others were, and had nothing of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or Vertue above the rest. The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> notwithstanding, not wholly satisfied with this plain confession, declared, that having given publique scandal to the Professors of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, and done dishonour to his Soveraign authority, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to draw such a considerable portion from him, as the Land of <hi>Palestine</hi>; his Treason and Crime was not to be expiated by any other means then by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to the <hi>Mahum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now the <hi>Reader</hi> may be pleased to pause a while, and contemplate the strange point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation, shame, and silence to which the <hi>Jews</hi> were reduc't, when they understood how speedily their hopes were vanished, and how poorly and ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously all their fancies and promises of a new Kingdom, their <hi>Pageantry,</hi> and Offices of Devotion, were past like a tale, or a midnights Dream: And all this was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and the <hi>Jews</hi> sunk on a sudden, and fallen flat in their hopes, without so much as a line of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, or excuse from <hi>Sabatai,</hi> more than in general, to all the brethren: That now they should apply themselves to their Callings and Services of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as formerly, for that matters relating unto him were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished and the sentence past.

And yet most of them affirm that <hi>Sabatai</hi> is not turned <hi>Turk,</hi> but his shadow only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains on earth, and walks with a white head, and in the habit of a <hi>Mahumetan</hi>: but that his natural Body and Soul are taken into Heaven, there to reside untill the time appointed for accomplishment of these won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and this opinion began so commonly to take place, as if this people resolved never to be undeceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, using the Forms and Rules for Devotion prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them by their <hi>Mahumetan Messiah:</hi> Insomuch that the <hi>Chochams</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> fearing the danger of

Messengers immediately to die, upon which other <hi>Ianizaries</hi> being again sent, they all fell dead with a word only from his mouth; and being desired to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive them again, he immediately recall'd them to life; but of them only such who were true <hi>Turks,</hi> and not those who had denied that faith in which they were born, and had profest. After this they added, that he went voluntarily to Prison, and though the gates were barred and shut with strong looks of Iron, yet that <hi>Sabatai</hi> was seen to walk through the streets with a numerous attendance, and when they said Shackles on his neck and feet, they not only fell from him, but were converted into Gold, with which he gratified his true and faithful believers and disciples. Some Miracles also were reported of <hi>Nathan,</hi> that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at reading the name of any particular man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he would immediately recount the story of his, or her life, their sins or defaults, and accordingly impose just correction and penance for them. These strong reports coming thus confidently into <hi>Italy</hi> and all parts, the <hi>Iews</hi> of <hi>Casel di Montserrato</hi> resolved to send three persons in behalf of their society, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of extraordinary <hi>Legates</hi> to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity after the truth of all these rumours, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly arrived in <hi>Smyrna,</hi> full of expectation and hopes, intending to present themselves with great Humility and Submission before their <hi>Messiah</hi> and his Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> were entertain'd with the sad news, that <hi>Sabatai</hi> was turned <hi>Turk,</hi> by which information the Character of their <hi>Embassy</hi> in a manner ceasing, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them laying aside the formality of his functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, endeavoured to lodge himself best to his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience. But that they might return to their brethren at home, with the certain particulars of the success of these affairs, they made a visit to the brother of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batai</hi>; who still continued to perswade them, that <hi>Sabatai</hi> was notwithstanding the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> that it was not he who had taken on him the habit and sorm

With this only hope of <hi>Nathan,</hi> these <hi>Legates</hi> were a little comforted, resolving to attend his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, in regard they had a Letter to consign into his hands, and according to their instructions, were to demand of him the grounds he had for his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, and what assurance he had, that he was divinely inspir'd, and how these things were reveal'd unto him, which he had committed to Paper, and dispersed to all parts of the World. At length <hi>Nathan</hi> arrives near <hi>Smyrna,</hi> on <hi>Friday</hi> the third of <hi>March,</hi> towards the Evening, and on <hi>Sunday</hi> these <hi>Legates</hi> made their visit to him: But <hi>Nathan,</hi> upon news of the success of his beloved <hi>Messiah,</hi> began to grow sullen and reserved; so that the <hi>Legates</hi> could scarce procure admittance to him; all that they could do was to inform him, that they had a Letter to him from the brother-hood of <hi>Italy</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and commission to confer with him concerning the foundation and authority he had for his prophesies; but <hi>Nathan</hi> refused to take the Letter, ordering <hi>Kain Abol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

grievously diseased in body, and judged incurable by the skill of men, hearing the renowned fame of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and the wonderful works that he wrought in all places he petitioned to him by Letters, humbly desiring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from his disease, <hi>Iesus</hi> (though not Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) yielding to his Petition vouchsafed to answer him by an Epistle, that he would shortly send one of his Disciples who should cure his malady, and not only his but all that belonged to him, which promise he in a short time performed; for after his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the dead and ascension into Heaven, <hi>Thomas</hi> one of the Twelve Apostles sent his Brother <hi>Thaddeus</hi> (who was reckoned among the seventy Disciples of Christ) by Divine Inspiration unto the City of <hi>Edessa,</hi> to be a Preacher and Evangelist of the Doctrine of Christ by whom all things which concerned the promise of our Saviour were performed; and for the further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation hereof, the Letters themselves are recorded in the Monuments of the Princely City of <hi>Edessa,</hi> and inrolled in the Publick Registry there among things of Antiquity acted about the time of King <hi>Agbarus,</hi> and Preserved unto this day; and I know no reason why we may not give you the very Letters themselves, as they were copied out of the Registry; and translated by us out of the <hi>Syrian</hi> Tongue.</p>

            <p>These Epistles <hi>Eusebius</hi> affirms he translated out of the Records of <hi>Edessa</hi> written in the <hi>Syrian</hi> Tongue, in which Records it afterwards followed; that when <hi>Iesus</hi> was taken up, <hi>Iudas</hi> who is also called <hi>Thomas,</hi> sent unto him <hi>Thaddeus</hi> the Apostle, one of the seventy, who when he arrived remained with one <hi>Tobias</hi> the Son of <hi>Tobias</hi>; when the fame of him was spread abroad, and that he was made manifest by the Miracles which he wrought, it was signified to <hi>Agbarus,</hi> that <hi>Thaddeus</hi> the Apostle of <hi>Iesus,</hi> of whom he wrot in his Epistle was come, and that this <hi>Thaddeus</hi> through the power of God began to cure every disease and malady, so that all men greatly marvelled; <hi>Agbarus</hi> hearing of the mighty and wonderful works which he wrought, and that he healed in the name and power of <hi>Iesus,</hi> was confirmed that this was he of whom <hi>Iesus</hi> had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:35259:97"/>
saying, <hi>after my Ascension I will send one of my Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples unto thee who shall Cure thy Malady.</hi> He then sent for <hi>Tobias</hi> where <hi>Thaddeus</hi> lodged, and said unto him, I hear say that a certain mighty man who came from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> so journeth with thee, and cureth many in the name of <hi>Iesus; Tobias</hi> replied, yea my Lord, there came a certain Stranger and lodged at my house who hath done many Wonderful things; to whom the King said, bring him unto me. <hi>Tobias</hi> returning to <hi>Thaddeus</hi> said unto him, <hi>Agbarus</hi> the Governor sent for me, and commanded me to bring thee unto him, that thou maist cure his Disease; <hi>Thaddeus</hi> answered I go, for it is for his sake that I am sent thus mightily to work; <hi>Tobias</hi> rising betimes the next day went with him to <hi>Agbarus.</hi> As he came in even upon his entrance, the countenance of <hi>Thaddeus</hi> appeared very glorious to <hi>Agbarus,</hi> in the presence of his Chief men, upon which the King gave him so much reverence that all there present marvelled thereat, for none of them saw the glory save <hi>Agbarus</hi> only, who discoursed with <hi>Thaddeus,</hi> and said, Art thou of a truth a Disciple of <hi>Iesus</hi> the Son of God, who made me this promise, <hi>I will send unto thee one of my Disciples who shall cure thy Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, and shew Life unto thee and all thine?</hi> To whom <hi>Thad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus</hi> answered, because thou hast greatly believed in the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> that sent me, therefore am I sent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and if thou still continue to believe in him, thou shalt obtain thy hearty Petitions according to thy Faith; <hi>Agbarus</hi> replied, I have so firmly believed in him that I could have found in my heart utterly to have Destroyed the <hi>Iews</hi> who Crucified him, were not the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire an hindrance to my design, <hi>Thaddeus</hi> said.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:35259:97"/>
forthwith cured him of his Malady, and delivered him from the pain wherewith he was sore afflicted; <hi>Agbarus</hi> was hereat astonished, and that as it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to have of Jesus, so he now found it true by his Disciple and Apostle <hi>Thaddeus</hi>; that he was cured without the Virtue of Herbs or Medicines, and not only he, but also <hi>Abdus</hi> the Son of <hi>Abdus</hi> grieved with the Gout, who falling at the feet of <hi>Thaddeus</hi> recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his former Health by the laying on of hands? he likewise cured many more of his Fellow Citizens, and wrought sundry miraculous things, preaching the Word of God.</p>
