            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE REVOLTER.  A Trage-Comedy.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Hind</hi> and the <hi>Panther—</hi>Certainly the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Poem, deſerves to be reckon'd in the number of the Heathen Gods; For he has out-done all <hi>Natales Comes</hi>'s Deities, and has made new Metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes's to make a ſecond <hi>Ovid</hi> more work, far more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then thoſe of the Ancient Pagan Divinities. For he has chang'd the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> into a <hi>Hind,</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> into a <hi>Panther,</hi> the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> into <hi>Wolves,</hi> the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi> into <hi>Bears,</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> into <hi>Hares, Libertines</hi> into <hi>Apes,</hi> the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> into <hi>Boares,</hi> the <hi>Socinians</hi> into <hi>Foxes.</hi> And now the Beaſts begin to talk and parley together again, and the <hi>Hind</hi> and the <hi>Panther</hi> enter into a long and ſerious Debate, as in the Days of <hi>Aeſop;</hi> only with this difference, that <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Beaſts were all <hi>Moraliſts,</hi> but theſe Poetical <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> are all Chriſtians, and diſpute and contend about things of a higher Nature. Truly, one would think the <hi>Author</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:153287:4"/>
might have bethought himſelf of Alluſions much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for his purpoſe than ſuch Beaſtial <hi>Proſopopeia's</hi> as theſe; now altogether Antiquated, notwithſtanding his idle Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for what he has done, and his miſerable Preſident of Mother <hi>Hubbard,</hi> as much out of faſhion, as <hi>Hellen</hi> of <hi>Troys</hi> Wardrobe, or his Eye-ſore of Q. <hi>Eliſabeth</hi>'s Fardingale. Nor do we find that ever Chriſt, who ſpoke ſo much in Learned Parables, ever inſpir'd the Brutes with Language to colour his Inſtructions. But the Poet's over-haſty, which made it the more Officious Malice, having engag'd him to turn all the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> into <hi>Beaſts;</hi> and not being able to purſue his Allegory, unleſs he made Beaſts of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> likewiſe, has reſolv'd to ſtrain a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement with both; and rather than loſe the pleaſing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of his Brain, like a compaſſionate <hi>Numen,</hi> to change the one into a <hi>Hind;</hi> and like an irritated <hi>Daemon,</hi> to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the other into a <hi>Panther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But while he ſate thus in his Poetical Throne, or rather acting upon the Stage of Fable and Pagan Muthologie, and transfiguring into Beaſts almoſt all Mankind but <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> that were out of his Road, he never conſider'd what a <hi>Monſter</hi> he was himſelf; a ſecond <hi>Geryon</hi> with three Heads: for each of which he had a particular Employment; with the one to fawn upon the moſt <hi>infamous</hi> of <hi>Uſurpers;</hi> with the other, at one time to lick the Beneficent Hands of his <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Mother;</hi> and by and by to court the Charity of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick <hi>Mamma;</hi> while with the third, he bark'd and ſnarl'd, not only at his firſt deſerted Female Parent, but alſo at all other differing Sentiments and Opinions, which his Soveraign had ſo graciouſly and generouſly indulg'd.</p>

For the Scene of the Perſecution is <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> a part of the World which never bred <hi>Panthers</hi> ſince the Creation of the Univerſe.

A Character which ſhews him to have a ſtrange miſt before his Eyes when he reads Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory. And then ſaies he,

Which is another Blunder; <hi>cujus Coutrarium verum eſt,</hi> For if Beauty, Strength and Courage advance the value of the ſeveral parts of the Creation, without Queſtion the <hi>Panther</hi> is far to be preferred before the <hi>Hind,</hi> a poor ſilly timorous ill-ſhap'd, bob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd Creature, of which a Score will hardly purchaſe the Skin of a true <hi>Panther.</hi> Had he lookd a little farther, <hi>Ludolphus</hi> would have furniſh'd him with a <hi>Zecora,</hi> the moſt beautiful of all the Four-footed Creatures in the World, to have <note place="margin">

                  <l>And learn from <hi>Sweden</hi> to prevent ſuch Crimes;</l>
                  <l>Unman the Fryer, and leave the Holy Drone,</l>
                  <l>To hum in his forſaken Hive alone:</l>
                  <l>He'l work no Honey, when his ſting is gone.</l>
                  <l>Your Wives and Daughters ſoon will leave the Cells,</l>

            <p>Now that you may ſee his Friend and he were both agreed, you ſhall find the Author himſelf concluding his ſecond Act of his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fryer to the ſame tune, where he brings in the tempted <hi>Elvira,</hi> commending the Fryer for managing his buſineſs ſo well in theſe words.

<q>

                     <p>This Fryer is a comfortable Man, he will know nothing of the buſineſs, but does it all:
        <q>
                           <l>Pray Wives and Virgins at your time of need,</l>
                           <l>For a true Guide, of my good Fathers breed.</l>
                        </q>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And in the very firſt Scene of the third Act, the ſame Lady cries out,

<q>
                  <sp>
                     <p>Well, if I prove frail,—never Woman had ſuch an Husband

to provoke her, ſuch a Lover to allure her, or ſuch a Confeſſor to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve her.</p>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And a little farther, ſays <hi>Gomez,</hi> the jealous Husband,

         <q>
                  <sp>
                     <p>—When a ſwinging Sin is to be committed, nothing will cover it ſo cloſe as a Fryers Hood, for there the Devil plays at Bo-peep; puts out his Horns to do miſcheif, and then ſhrinks 'em back for ſafety, like a Snale into her ſhell.</p>
                  </sp>
               </q>

The ſence of the Epilogue all along: And enough to ſhew how ſoon a Gentleman may alter his Opinion in point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
