            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Have ever had so little Faith for Apologies, that I rather believ'd they did more hurt than good; and for the most part, left things in a worse condition than they found them: The sense of this, made me pass some late cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures in silence; and perhaps, might have oblig'd me to the same still, had I not found a dust rais'd, and believ'd it my concern to blow it off, at least, endeavour it:—To come to the matter; This Comedy was lately Acted, and (as it fares with things of this nature) variously receiv'd; Nor could I well have expected other; It were too much fondness (not to say worse) to tax that freedom in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which I should think hard, to be deny'd my self:—No—this is nothing of the point; All that I take notice of, is this, How justly it may have deserv'd all that has been said upon't; unless People would have it dealt with like <hi>Don Quixot's</hi> Library, some burnt for the Curate's sake, other for the Barber's, and not the least for the good Womans:—Not to detain you longer in the Porch, I have at present, but this short re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, That it may speak for it self:—And first, (to take the parts as they lye) I shall begin with <hi>Bilboe,</hi> and <hi>Titere Tu;</hi> the one, usurping the name of a Major, the other, of a Captain, whereas in truth (and as may be gather'd from their discourse) they never were either, or scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, any thing like it:—A humour that can be no wise strange, to any man that knew this Town, between the years 46, and 50, and being so
<pb facs="tcp:63964:3"/>
understood; will be as unlikely to prove an occasion of scandal, to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Honour; For if I have shewn the odd practices of two vain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, pretending to what they were not, I think I have sufficiently justifi'd the Brave man, even by this Reason, That the Exception proves the Rule:—And further, if there be any thing in their language, that may seem loose, be pleased to consider who they are that speak it; and then I hope you'll thus far absolve me, as to say, I had as ill brought 'um in, with a pair of Beads at their Girdle, as my Puritan Constable, with a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in's Cap:—But secondly, for the Second Scene, I am confident I may passe it, and come to the Third, where (and in other parts of the Play) if you meet with a small pretender to Astrology, Physick, the Rosy-crucian humour, Fortune-telling, and I know not what; or in the fifth Act, <hi>Qualiacunque voles vendentem somnia,—</hi>I shall, instead of plea to it, only enlarge my request, That you would but run over the late Adventures of that kind, the sad effects of which, may be well fear'd to live among the people, when the persons that writ'um, may be either dead, or forgotten:—Nor do I think I ought to ask pardon, that I have taken a Levite, to this Teraphim, since whoever shall give himself the trouble of enquiry, will (without the least force upon the Text) easily find, that both alike have spoken vanity:—But fourthly, for what concerns <hi>Runter,</hi> though I think I might have let that pass too, yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I would not be mis-understood, give me leave to believe, That no wise man can conceive either Profession, <hi>viz.</hi> Common, or Civil Law, could be intended in it:—For as to the first, those that know my way of education, will be ready to excuse me thus far, That had I design'd that, I must necessarily have laid it another way, and perhaps too, might have been able to have don't;—Or if I had struck at the latter, That I was not so altogether a stranger to it, as not to have run it higher;—Let this suffice to both, That I made use of no more, than what serv'd to my purpose, and so I leave it to a favourable interpretation, and come to the fifth Scene, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Scruple,</hi> where, if any man shall say, I have trod too near upon Religion, I hope, upon his second thoughts, I may trust my cause with him; when, if he shall rightly understand it, he will easily perceive, That I have only shewn how that venerable Name has been abus'd, and that best Thing, made Bawd to the worst actions:—Lastly, to any man that shall say, such or such humours have either been in the Town before, or formerly writ upon, give me leave to offer this to
<pb facs="tcp:63964:3"/>
the first, That Comedy, either is, or should be, the true Picture of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or Vice; yet so drawn, as to shew a man how to follow the one, and avoid the other; in doing which, if I had fram'd any thing that was not, I had not only bely'd the Town, but wrong'd my self:—Doth not <hi>Martial</hi> say of his Epigrams, <hi>Dictavit au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor?</hi> And was not <hi>Quicquid agant homines—</hi>Horace's <hi>farrago?—</hi>As to the second, If it has been said so long since, That there is nothing which has not been before, I hope (if I may have border'd upon any one that has gone before) I am thus far excusable, that I have purposely declin'd both his matter, and his way:—To which, if the contrary shall chance to be objected, I think it enough at present to say, That I am in Possession, and a bare <hi>They say,</hi> without shewing, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the place, will not be sufficient to evict me out of it:—To be short, were there nothing more, even this were enough, That there is hardly any thing left to write upon, but what ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Antients or Moderns have some way or other touch'd on;—Did not <hi>Apulejus</hi> take the rise of his <hi>Golden Asse,</hi> from <hi>Lucian</hi>'s <hi>Lucius?</hi> and <hi>Erasmus,</hi> his <hi>Alcumistica,</hi> from <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer's Canons Yeomans Tale?</hi> and <hi>Ben.

Even like Bawds, and Medlars, never Ripe, till Rotten; That is to say, seldom or never get money, till they are past the use of 't; And then (perhaps) what with a little favour, and a great deal of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, they may chance to arrive at last to the height of sleeping out a Cause.</p>

you an instance in a Gentleman, a friend of mine, a great Master of this way of pleading:—A Gentleman with a long comely beard, demurrs to his Clients Bill; My friend, takes him at first hop, and demurrs to his beard; calls it a Vow-beard, and that he had made an Oath not to cut it till the King came in; And heark you, had he had Twenty Arguments, he might have better spar'd the other Nineteen, than that One:—I could tell you of as good a one of my own, and upon as great a Person as any this day in <hi>Europe</hi>—(Ah! how I firk't him up, with—a Chip of the old Block, and Twenty as good—) But enough of this now—The thing is sufficiently known, and it ill becomes a man to set out his own Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;—But try this, and do it boldly, and never doubt of Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents:—A modest Lawyer!—A silent Woman!—A Paradox in Nature.</p>

Most abominable, it ushers in Revels, and May-poles:—What then?—Why trulie I agree with the Assembly—Bag-pipes;—A harmless, innocent Musick, and most agreeable, to the Discipline, and practice, of our Bretheren of the Kirk:—Besides, it has (as the Learned observe) a specifick qualitie, to mollifie, and soften the most brutal natures—Witness, the Bears—<hi>Emollit mores nec sinit esse feros.</hi>—But secondly, for Dancing—Why trulie, that may be lawful too—But here too, the point will be the same;—What Dancing?—Countrey Dances; they are <hi>Pagan;</hi>—French Dances; Fye, Fye, Antick;—Our ordinarie dancing; villanous; 'tis mixt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuous, a verie Nicolait<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
