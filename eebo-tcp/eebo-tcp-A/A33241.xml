         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

With <hi>one particular</hi> I have here dealt, and done you and the Nation (I hope) ſome good ſervice in it: and (by the good band of God aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me) the reſt ſhall ſpeedily follow. For it would be a great ſhame and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to the <hi>well affected partie,</hi> if they ſhould not manifeſt as much zeal to God, thankfulneſſe and love towards you, by letting the people ſee the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your Adminiſtrations: as ill men, and diſaffected, are ſtudious and diligent to make You and your well-deſerving ſervices odious and diſtaſtfull to the Nation. The truth is, the deſire of the upright and meek ones every where, and their fervent prayer daily poured forth to God, is, that ſeeing many do <hi>watch for your halting,</hi> the Lord in mercy will be pleaſed, ſo to direct, guide and counſell You, as You may <hi>cut off occaſion from them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire occaſion,</hi> and <hi>all iniquitie may ſtop her mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Nationall Covenant</hi> which is the ſubject of this Diſcourſe: I have onely one requeſt to move unto You about it. How You are traduced and vilely abuſed by ſome mens looſe tongues and pens, for not advancing it more, and more preſſing the keeping, in their ſenſe, I need not ſpeak of it, You know it too well: And therefore I humbly conceive ſeeing it is here manifeſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the <hi>Oath</hi> was unlawfully given and taken, and ſo not binding the Conſcience, neither to be kept, there is great cauſe and reaſon that the whole Kingdom from your Houſe ſhould publickly underſtand ſo much: For ſo doing, God ſhall have much glory by mens repenting of it, You cleared from many foul aſperſions, many treacherous and dangerous deſignes prevented, and ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Nothing,</hi> every ſide juſtifies it ſelf, and chargeth the other with a breach: And without doubt the contention about this <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> will continue, yea I fear riſe higher, and break out into a greater flame, if the right way be not wiſely taken: for ſo long as the lawfulneſſe of the Oath is not queſtioned, but rather a pleading for the keeping of it, the differences can never be reconciled or taken up: But if the other way (which is Gods way and ſo to follow him) be practiſed, there is reaſon to hope that a bleſſing and much good will ſpeedily follow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53074:3"/>
I am the more encouraged to ſpeak thus unto you, becauſe among other abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes reformed, You have <note n="a" place="margin">In the Oath mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni ſtred to the preſent Lord Mayor.</note>lately (and very well) done ſome thing this way; But under favour this <hi>Oath</hi> being <hi>National<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Bakewell</hi> word for word. I marvell how any man could imagine, that this <hi>Oath</hi> was for peace, or that the preſent differences and ſtrife between partie and partie; could be ended by it, but rather neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily continued and increaſed. I have read ſome where, about <hi>Heraclea</hi> in <hi>Pontus,</hi> there ſhould grow a tree over the Tomb of <hi>Amycus</hi> King of the <hi>Bebrycians,</hi> the Natives call'd it the <hi>raging or mad Lawrel,</hi> and for this cauſe, for if a branch or twig thereof (never ſo little) ſhould be caſt into a ſhip,

all the Mariners and paſſengers would brawl and quarrell each with other, neither would there be any quietneſſe and peace in the veſſell till that <hi>mad wood</hi> was thrown over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board. Whether this <hi>Covenant</hi> be not like that <hi>raging and mad tree,</hi> let the Reader judge, having duly weighed theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is an Apoſtolicall precept, that <note n="m" place="margin">Philip. 3. 16</note>

But there is nothing in the <hi>Covenant</hi> that looks this way: The difference between partie and partie (though brethren in the faith) is referred there to the Sword, and no recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, but the extirpation of one, or both.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the Oath comprehendeth many things of ſeverall kinds, (and divers of them unknown what they are) which makes it both <note n="o" place="margin">Mr. <hi>John Ley</hi> Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive doubting. pag. 11.</note>
               <hi>ſuperfluous</hi> and <hi>perillous:</hi> ſo it hath this for an accommodation to the taker, that he is left to take it in his own ſenſe, and having ſo taken it, now he muſt fight: but againſt whom?

And howſoever the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a proper intereſt in the Oath, as if the ſame ſtood for them, and their deſigne and cauſe alone: nevertheleſſe the truth is, others may claim as much as they, and though they make not the like noiſe, crying, <hi>The Covenant, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> yet from the Covenant have as much to ſay for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and againſt them: and why the Magiſtrate ſhould tolerate and countenance their Church, miniſterie, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and government, I ſay from the <hi>Oath</hi> may as fairly claim the approbation of the State, and the extirpation of them, as they can clearly gather any thing out of it againſt the other.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It cannot with truth be denyed, but this <hi>Covenant</hi> hath been a principall cauſe to hinder union and peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Congregationall and Presbyterian Churches: and if a full reconciliation touching their differences could not have been made, yet ſuch an accommodation and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification eaſily ſetled, as both parties might have well ſatisfied, and brotherly love continued between them: but

            <p>It adds much to the unlawfulneſſe of this Oath, that men were compelled to take it: for if it had been left to every mans choiſe and libertie, whether he would have ſworn to the particulars, or not, there had been more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for that, and leſſe danger in it.

            <p n="3">3.

He cauſeth them not to ſtand unto any thing, but what before they had cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted and promiſed to do: and therefore here was no <hi>new Oath,</hi> or properly any <hi>making of a Covenant,</hi> but a renewing rather of their Covenant: no ſolemn League and Oath to bring in, and eſtabliſh amongſt them, a new worſhip, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and Church Government, but a publick engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to continue in ſuch a religion to which they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſubmitted.</p>
            <p>Now Reader wipe thine eyes, that thou mayeſt ſee, how <hi>Joſiahs Covenant,</hi> and <hi>ours,</hi> do look in the face one like the other.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Joſiah</hi> reads the words of the Law to the people, and to this onely would have them promiſe obedience: Our <hi>Covenant</hi> requires ſome thing againſt the Law of God, as that a murderer, traitor, tyrant, &amp;c. if a King, ſhall not be put to death: ſo the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> expound one clauſe of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Joſiah</hi> obligeth them by Covenant, onely to ſtand, for and to ſuch things, as they knew what they were, and to be lawfull: for there was nothing propounded to them but the very Word of God.

what is meant by it, but alſo what is apparently diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Word of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is nothing in <hi>Joſiahs Covenant</hi> as tying the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the practice of, I ſay not any one particular thing, but what before they had promiſed to do: our Covenant requires an oath to endeavour the preſervation of the <hi>Scots worſhip, diſcipline, Church government,</hi> &amp;c. and (ſome ſay) to ſettle <hi>Presbyterie</hi> tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Joſiah</hi> did not cauſe the people to ſwear againſt a former Oath, but obliged them to keep the oath which formerly they had made.

            <p>To theſe conſiderations let this be added, that when <hi>David</hi> the famous King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and a man acquainted with the minde of God, had ſubdued the Nations round about him, and made them <note n="d" place="margin">2 Sam 7. 1, 2, 3, 6.</note>

            <p n="1">1. This is a naturall principle, <hi>Quod tibi jus fieri, hoc alteri fac; &amp; quod nolis tibi fieri, alteri ne facias.</hi> Now who is there, making it his own cauſe, would willingly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to take an Oath, in a matter which he thinks is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther falſe, or doubts of the truth of it; or if true in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, yet makes queſtion whether he have any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or ground to ſwear: and yet muſt either ſwear or ſuffer. But ſo it was here in many mens caſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Pure reaſon teacheth a man ſo to conſider his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as not onely not to caſt him down; or if fallen, not onely help to recover him, but to keep him up what he can, that ſo he fall not. <hi>Baſil</hi> (as <note n="k" place="margin">Baron.

               <hi>Councell of Challons</hi> inhibited and diſcharged the Clergie from a certain Oath which formerly they had been compelled to take, <hi>in regard it was perillous:</hi> how pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous this <hi>Covenant</hi> is, we have ſhewed already in many particulars: ſo that to ſpeak the truth, there was no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſhould be taken at all; but leſſe reaſon that any man ſhould be forc'd to take it: this was not the way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our brothers falling, but rather with both hands to throw him down.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is no reaſon that a man ſhould accuſe himſelf, the Word of God requireth <hi>two or three witneſſes</hi> unto every lawfull eviction and condemnation. Which Mr. <hi>Lambert</hi> ſtood upon when he was examined about the <hi>Oath ex of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio,</hi> whether he thought it lawfull or no: <note n="m" place="margin">Act: and Mon. p. 1021. 1022.</note>
               <hi>It is not lawfull</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for a man to ſwear when a man knoweth not what they will demand of him, or whether it be lawfull to ſhew them the truth of their demands or no, or whether the matter will bear an Oath, or if it will, whether there be no other means left to bowlt out the truth. If the Judge require an Oath in lawfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient manner, as in controverſies which cannot otherwiſe be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:53074:21"/>
               <hi>betwixt neighbour and neighbour, I think my ſelf bound to ſwear: but if he put me to my oath to bewray my ſelf, or to bewray any other, this being contrary unto charity, I count it expedient to hold me ſtill.</hi> If a man have acted contrary to the things contained in the Covenant, though his minde gives him he hath done well in it, yet being by Oath obliged to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſo much, how can he diſpence with his Oath in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing it? and if not, how can he fulfill that Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which requires him, not to deſtroy, but to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Thus he fals into a ſnare, and either neceſſarily muſt break his Oath, or Gods Law.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If a Magiſtrate be to impoſe an oath which may be diverſly accepted, and what is truly intended cannot be known, unleſſe the proper ſenſe be plainly given, there is no reaſon that a man ſhould take it, till he directly know in what acceptation or ſenſe he ſhall take it; and therfore to be compell'd to take it before he knows ſo much is very unreaſonable.</p>
            <p>If there were nothing but this to be objected againſt the Oath, it were ſufficient to manifeſt the unlawfulneſſe of it, and to prove that it wanted the eſſentiall part and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a true Covenant, and ſo binds not any mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to keep it. I ſhall not here make repetition of things before ſpoken; this onely I adde, that the Covenant is ſuch a ſtrange thing, as when a man keeps it he breaks it, and breaking it he keeps it. I could multiply inſtances here, to let men ſee the weakneſſe, abſurditie, contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. of it in this particular, but it is not worth the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and time.</p>
            <p>It is a queſtion diſputed by Divines, and Lawyers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be lawfull to impoſe an oath, to be taken by ſuch an one, as we think making no conſcience of it, will not ſtick to forſwear himſelf, if he be put to it: And it is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered by diſtinction, that for a private man to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon ſuch a man an Oath for his gain and private reſpect, it is altogether unlawfull; becauſe we are bound to prefer the glory of God which by ſuch an oath is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached, and the ſalvation of our neighbours ſoul which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53074:21"/>
hereby is indangered, before any gain and advantage. And conſequently we ought rather to loſe any worldly benefit, then that by ſuch an Oath we ſhould ſuffer God to be diſhonoured, and our neighbour loſe himſelf.</p>
            <p>Again, howſoever it be granted, that the Magiſtrate may lawfully put ſuch an one to his oath; yet ſo: <note n="n" place="margin">Thomas 22. Quaeſt. 8.
