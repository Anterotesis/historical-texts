            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> A Learned <hi>Foreigner</hi> that Writes againſt
<hi>ROBERT BARCLAY</hi> doth acknowledge, <q>
                  <hi>Se cum
ſuis Doctrinas, &amp; Mores ſuos libentiſſime Examini
earum (S. Scripturarum) concedere,</hi> &amp;c. That he,
with thoſe of his Religion, are willing their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
ſhould be <hi>Try'd</hi> by the Holy Scriptures,
and to admit as a poſitive, and certain Maxim,
that whatſoever any do, pretending to be led by
the Spirit, which is contrary to the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 90. <q>He comes, p. 27. to a material Point in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
where it is objected againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> That
they hold the <hi>Light</hi> within Every Man that comes
into the World, Sufficient to <hi>Salvation,</hi> without
<hi>Something elſe,</hi> that is, without the <hi>outward Chriſt,
to Suffer, and Dye outwardly</hi> for Us. Which makes
Chriſt's coming into the World, of no Neceſſity at
all to our <hi>Salvation.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I deſire the Candid Reader to take a Review of
<hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s Words: <q>The firſt part is not true:
We are not offended at <hi>G. K</hi>'s Preaching Chriſt,
or his Suffering, and Dying without us, truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109240:3"/>
But, 2. at his undervaluing the Light
within, <hi>as not Sufficient to Salvation,</hi> or not Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
without ſomething elſe, ſeeing <hi>G. K.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth,
<hi>That the Light within, in a true ſenſe, is
God, and Chriſt, the Eternal, and Eſſential Word,</hi>
as in his <hi>Antichriſts, and Sadduces,</hi> p. 23. Surely
Chriſt within, and Chriſt without, are not two
Chriſts; Chriſt without, is not another Chriſt,
than Chriſt, within, tho' his being without, and
within, was in different manners. By the Light
within, being Sufficient to Salvation, or to bring
Salvation, we mean, <hi>able to Save,</hi> as the ingrafted
Word is able to ſave the Soul.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>truly Conſidered,</hi> I doubt not but G. <hi>W.</hi> means,
Conſider'd with a due Regard to the Obligation to
<hi>Holineſs,</hi> which Our HOLY ONE has <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> upon
All Men, and a Power to become <hi>Holy,</hi> which He
Offers to All, in the Suffering and Death of Chriſt.
The <hi>Outward Chriſt,</hi> which this Author uſes ſo
frequently, is a Term moſt Intolerably <hi>Scandalous;</hi>
For it ſeems to import that the Same <hi>Perſon,</hi> who
is (the <hi>Light of the World) The Light within,</hi> is
not HE that was <hi>Crucified at Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 103. <q>The <hi>Quakers</hi> expect no Juſtification,
but only by their own Works, wrought <hi>In</hi> them
By the Spirit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Works wrought In us, By the Spirit,
are not <hi>Our own Works,</hi> but the <hi>Works of GOD,</hi> and
<hi>the Righteouſneſs which is of FAITH.</hi> I do again
and again, Requeſt this Learned Man, to Attempt
the Refutation of what I have written, againſt <hi>G.
Keith</hi>'s moſt impious Saying, that <hi>The Light within
is not Sufficient to Salvation without ſomething elſe.</hi>

having a Light from <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who is not of

he is lighted withal, he is turned to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
from whence it Comes—Every one with the

<hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt may be known in the midſt of you,

Know <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is the <hi>Subſtance of all the Types,

            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 175. <q>The True Freedom is in the Son, who
Suffered and Dyed, and is Riſen again.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 492. <q>Chriſt Suffered in the Fleſh, and Dyed,
and was Crucified as he was Man, not as he was
God, the Word, which was in the Beginning; but
as he was Man, who bore the Sins and Iniquities
of all Mankind; and was an Offering for the Sins
of the whole World, who Taſted Death for Every
Man; All being in Death in <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo that they
might have Life through Chriſt, the <hi>Second Adam:</hi>
So I ſay again, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not Dye, as he
was GOD, but as Man: He was Crucified,
and Buried, and Roſe again the Third Day,
and Aſcended, and is at the Right Hand of
GOD.</q>
