            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Written by <hi>John Crook,</hi> who had perfect knowledge of him from the beginning.</p>
            <p>With an Exhortation unto all the Righteous, to be watchful, to take due notice of all the dealings of the Lord, eſpecially of his taking away (of late) ſo many faithful La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in his Work; and to you principally in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Bedfordſhire,</hi> (where his outward dwelling was) <hi>Bucks, Hertford, Cambridge, Huntington, Ely,</hi> and <hi>Northampton,</hi> is this Teſtimony ſent, who have partaked of his Miniſtry, and been refreſhed with the ſtreams of Life, that often run through him among you, to whom my Soul ſendeth Gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and wiſheth unto you all Love, Life, Mercy, and Peace. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head>A True and Faithful Teſtimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>John Samm,</hi> the Servant of the Lord, who finiſhed his Courſe, by laying down his life in <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Goal, for the Truth of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the 26. of the 1ſt. <hi>Month,</hi> 1664.</head>
            <p>DEarly Beloved of the Lord, although many of you are not ignorant of the departure of <hi>John Samm,</hi> out of the body, and for what cauſe he was in outward bonds, (which was for meeting with the ſervants of the Lord) and what his Life and Converſation was, together with the Miniſtry committed to him by the Lord, as well as his faithful diſcharge thereof, is well known unto you; and I might be ſilent if this were the only end, to tell you of theſe things; for is there ſuch a ſtranger in Iſrael, among you all, as knows them not: But notwithſtanding, I have a Teſtimony in my heart from the Lord on this behalf, and do deſire it may find acceptance with you, to ſtirre up your pure minds, to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of all the Lords dealings with you in your own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and alſo of his providences and diſpoſings of thoſe, that are near and dear unto you all, as I know this Servant of the Lord <hi>J. S.</hi> was, unto all that throughly knew him, and had inward acquaintance with him.</p>
            <p>For his Education, it is well known in <hi>Bedfordſhire</hi> where he dwelt; as alſo his Converſation, which was juſt and honeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, before he was convinced of the Truth; for the ſake of which he ſuffered five or ſix times Impriſonment ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times together, for bearing teſtimony to the ſame Truth which at laſt he ſealed with his life in <hi>Northampton</hi> Goal,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44443:3"/>
where he firſt ſuffered Impriſonment, about the year 1656. in which priſon he ended his dayes, as he foretold, ſaying, <hi>Northampton</hi> was the firſt, and will be the laſt.</p>
            <p>For his Life and Converſation, <hi>I</hi> can ſpeak to it, for I was perfectly acquainted with him, both outwardly as a man, and inwardly as a Chriſtian; as a man, he was endowed with a competent meaſure of underſtanding, and did improve it, unto that end (in the managing of the Creation) for which it was given him; being diſcrete, ſober, and of good report among men, and his carriage courteous and loving unto all; much more might be ſaid of this nature which <hi>I</hi> omit.</p>
            <p>And as a Chriſtian, he was holy and harmleſs, patient and meek, valiant and bold, contending earneſtly for the faith which was once delivered to the Saints, and in which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a Saint, did walk, live and dye: Chriſtianity to him, was not a talk, but a life; for rather then he would deny it, he ſuffered loſs of Eſtate, Liberty, and Life it ſelf, as he did: Witneſs his often Impriſonment, and his laying down his life at laſt for the ſame Cauſe.</p>
            <p>As a Miniſter, he had a diſpenſation of the Goſpel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto him, in which he was a faithful labourer in the work thereof, with great zeal and fervency of Spirit, taking all opportunities and occaſions in the wiſdom of the Lord, (as moved by him) to deliver his meſſage unto all people, of all eſtates and degrees, that he might be free from the blood of all men.</p>
            <p>His gift was large, his utterance plain to be underſtood, his words ſavoury and powerful, not painted with mans wiſdom, but as given him of the Lord, being often ſpoken with great Majeſty, and in much Authority, cutting deep to the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the wicked one in man, and eaſing of the poor and needy priſoner, being often mindful of the Captive Daughter of <hi>Sion,</hi> as of the pure Seed in deep Captivity, that he might reach it help; and when his words began to reach it, he was as one tranſported with joy; and when it was once raiſed and come forth of the priſon houſe, the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and of the Lamb was in his mouth, with much joy and great gladneſs of heart, unto the aſtoniſhment of the wicked, and filling the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44443:3"/>
hearts of the righteous with great joy, through the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings of his Cup, and ſuperaboundings of Gods love in his heart; ſometimes as one taken out of the body; in which ſtate his eyes would ſparkle, and his face be full of dread, as one having authority, and not as the Scribes: Beſides the melody of his voice, ſometimes ſounding out the high praiſes of the God of <hi>Iſr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>el,</hi> and at other times the bleſſed ſtate of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, as they ſtood in Union with the living God, and one with another. Oh how have <hi>I</hi> ſeen him make the earth to tremble, and the hearts of the upright to overflow with joy and gladneſs, through that abundance of life that hath run through his Veſſel unto the forcing of water out of the Rocks, and tears out of the eyes of the Saints, unto great abundance: His Hymnes and Sounds, ſometimes were as flames of fire, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the droſſy matter, and at other times as Swords and Spears, cutting down, and thruſting through the tall Cedars, and lofty Oaks, and wild Beaſts of the wilderneſs: Procuring an Eccho to the true Seed in the living babes, which often made ſweet melody in their Aſſemblies, when but few words were ſpoken by him:

Lord? And is there a time when the true Embaſſador of Peace may weep bitterly? Oh can it be more ſeaſonable at any time, then when the Lord takes away the Righteous from the evil to come? And hath he not done ſo to many Valiants of late, whoſe Trumpets Alarm'd the World, and made many dead to ariſe at the ſound thereof? What was the cauſe, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord hath done it, becomes every one to make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiery in their own hearts; and the rather, becauſe there is need, yea great need, of Valiants in this day, the Harveſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great, and the Labourers few.

He will raiſe up, and lay a ſide at pleaſure; for he will have no Idols of jealouſie in this his day, leaſt it come to paſs, as when he made the brazen Serpent, a <hi>Nehuſhtan:</hi> Neither will he have his work neglected, nor his Servants ſlighted, whom he ſends forth in Life and Power; He would have his People to wait upon him, in their own mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, every one as they have received, in it to keep cloſe unto him, that they all may be taught of him, and have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings in themſelves, and not in another: And the Lord will yet raiſe up Inſtruments to fulfil his purpoſe, for his work ſhall proſper; and by all theſe wayes and dealings of his, he would have his Childrens Hearts made looſe to all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun, with their Lamps burning, and lights ſhining, having the loyns of their minds girt about with the Girdle of Truth; keeping cloſe unto the Lord with a pure heart, that he may yet further make known unto them his mind and will; for although you are now become the Sons of God, it doth not yet appear what ye ſhall be; but this know, the more and oftner ye ſee him, the liker to him ye ſhall be; and let this be

out of the worlds wayes and worſhips, and brought him to Truth in the inward parts, which truth he knew to be power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, which ſet him free from much which did entangle him, and feeling the power of it, the Lord choſe him to bear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in words unto it, which he received not of man, nor by man, but of the free gift from the Lord, and when he had received it, to wit, the Truth in the inward parts, and his mind to it turned, then did he feel the ſweet ſtreams of the Lords love to his thirſty ſoul, by which his heart was often filled with joy and great rejoycing; and alſo the Lord in the ſtrength of his Love, and in the ſenſe of the living vertue of his life, did open his mouth in praiſes to the Lord, to the great refreſhment and comfort of his children, who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by the ſame word of power unto the feeling of the life by which he was filled; many times as a Cup that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowes: and a good underſtanding had the Lord given him of the myſteries of his Kingdom, and of thoſe things which he had heard, learned, and received of the Lord in the light of his Son, that did he faithfully communicate unto others, in the demonſtration of the Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
