            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>A Brief Diſcovery of ſome of the Blaſphemous and Seditious,

Offered to the Conſideration of the King and both Houſes

            </head>
            <p>UPon ſight whereof I was curious to peruſe a Book
that carried ſo rare and extraordinary a Title: And
to be brief in my Obſervation thereupon, ſhall
only conſider their firſt Paragraph, and therein ſhew how
Egregiouſly theſe Scholars and Divines ſtumbles at the
Threſhould: And that I may be juſt to them, take the
Paragraph at large; a Juſtice they have not obſerved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

the <hi>Quakers;</hi> They ſay, <q>
                  <hi>George Fox,</hi> the firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and great Apoſtle of this Sect, <hi>Great Myſtery,</hi> Pag. 209.
ſaith againſt his Opponent thus, This Light, that doth
enlighten every one that cometh into the World, which
he (<hi>viz. G. F</hi>'s Opponent) calls <hi>Conſcience,</hi> is not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
And in Pag. 331. (<hi>G. F.</hi> further faith.). The
Light which every one that cometh into the World is
enlightned withal, is <hi>Not</hi> Conſcience; for the Light was
<hi>before any thing was made, or Conſcience named.</hi>
               </q> And again,
to aggravate the ſuppoſed Blaſphemy upon them, they make
this Marginal Note, <hi>viz. The</hi> Quakers <hi>teach, that the Light
within, by which they are guided is not Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now this being in the Front of their Book, to be ſure
it was not intended for one of the leaſt of the</hi> Quakers <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies;
though they might as well have called it Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(the other Crime they lay to their Charge) as to make
it Blaſphemy, to ſay, That the Light within is</hi> not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
<hi>But if this be Blaſphemy, pray let us hear how
the Scripture will Read after their new way of Tranſlating</hi>
Conſcience <hi>for</hi> Light, <hi>which the</hi> Quakers, <hi>according to the
Holy Evangeliſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>call Chriſt, and they call Conſcience.</hi>
John 1. 4, 9. In him (<hi>meaning the Divine Word</hi>) was Life,
and the Life was the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of Men: And the <hi>Conſcience</hi>
ſhineth in Darkneſs, and the Darkneſs comprehendeth it not.
There was a Man ſent from God, whoſe Name was <hi>John,</hi> the
ſame came for a Witneſs, to bear witneſs of the <hi>Conſcience,</hi>
that all Men through him might believe. He was not that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi>
but was ſent to bear witneſs of that <hi>Conſcience:</hi> That
was the true <hi>Conſcience,</hi> that lighteth every Man that cometh
into the World. <hi>John</hi> 8. 12. I am the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of the
World, he that followeth me, ſhall not walk in Darkneſs,
but ſhall have the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of Life. <hi>And alſo,</hi> 1 John 1.
2. 5, 6, 7, 8. This then is the Meſſage which we have heard of
Him, and declare unto you, That God is <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and in
him is no Darkneſs at all: If we ſay we have fellowſhip with him,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33526:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 5 -->
and walk in Darkneſs, we Lye, and do not the Truth; but if
we walk in the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> as he is in the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> we have
fellowſhip one with another, and the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his
Son cleanſeth us from all Sin. <hi>Again,</hi> Rom. 13. 12. Put on
the Armour of <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Leſt the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of the Glorious
Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c. 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 4. God, who commanded the <hi>Conſcience</hi>
to ſhine out of Darkneſs, hath ſhined in our Hearts, to give us
the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of the Knowledge, <hi>&amp;c 2 Cor. 4. 6. Laſtly,</hi> The
Nations of them that are ſaved ſhall walk in the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of
the Lamb.</p>
            <p>But to read thoſe Scripture Quotations truly, leave out
the word <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and read the word <hi>Light</hi> inſtead
thereof.</p>
            <p>It is to be lamented, that Men that wear ſo Religious
a Character, and would paſs for the <hi>Key</hi> and <hi>Keepers</hi> of
the Holy Scripture to the People, ſhould be ſo much too
hard for themſelves, by letting their Miſtake of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
Principles carry them into ſo great an abuſe of the
Scriptures, as to be guilty of the Crime they would faſten
upon them; as certainly they all are, who degrade the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Light</hi> of Chriſt, in alledging it to be <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which
may as well be <hi>Blind</hi> and <hi>Defiled,</hi> as <hi>Knowing</hi> and <hi>Pure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, it is to be admired, that theſe Three <hi>Clergy-Men,</hi>
who by vertue of their Function, are obliged frequently to
read the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> ſhould be ignorant of a Principle
ſo Emphatically Expreſt therein, as may be read in that
Book, <hi>viz. The Goſpel on Chriſtmas Day. The Collect. on</hi> John
<hi>the Evangeliſt, and the Epiſtle on the ſame Day, with the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
on Whitſunday and Munday;</hi> and many other places,
too tedious to mention, conſidering my intended Brevity.
And why they ſhould Brand the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that agree with
the <hi>Church of England</hi> in ſo great a Principle, I know not,
unleſs in Reallity they are not what their Character be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaks
them to be.</p>
