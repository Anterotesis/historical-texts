            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and his armes pinnioned: Soone after there
<pb facs="tcp:16918:3"/>
came thether the right honourable the Lord
Chamberlayne, the Earle of <hi>Wormewood,</hi> sir
<hi>George Carew</hi> knight Marshall of England,
with Maister <hi>Popham</hi> the Queens Attourney
generall, and other of her Maiesties Iustices
for Middlesex and Surrey: who being orderly
placed, proclamation was made for the people
to be silent, after that a substantiall quest of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie
was calde and impannelled, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
their charge giuen them by her maiesties
Attourney generall to enquire if any wilfull
murders, rowts or riots &amp;c. were latelie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in the verdge of the Queens Maiesties
housholde: by vertue of which enquirye, they
found this matter of wilfull murder.</p>
            <p>That doone, the Prisoner was commaunded
to hold vp his hand at the barte, and then the
Clarke of the peace read the bill of inditement
with alowde voice, which contained in effect
that the saide <hi>Arnold Cosbye</hi> contrarye to the
peace of our Soueraigne Lady the Queene:
vpon the 14. day of Ianuary last past, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the feare of God before his eyes, did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably
set vpon Iohn Lord <hi>Burke</hi> in the Town
of <hi>Wanswoorth</hi> in a close: and there vpon a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelishe
and most malitious intent did wilfully
murder him, then &amp; there giuing him one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
and deadly wound with a rapier, contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning one
inche wide, and 10. inches depe, by
meanes of which greeuous and deadly wound,
<pb facs="tcp:16918:3"/>
the said Lord <hi>Burke</hi> fell downe, and after that
the saide <hi>Arnold Cosbye</hi> with a Dagger price
two shillinges, gaue vnto the said <hi>Iohn</hi> Lord
<hi>Burke</hi> xxj. greeuous &amp; seuerall wounds more:
of which said great and deep wound, the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Lord <hi>Burke</hi> died within two houres after.
Wherupon the prisoner being demaunded if he
were guiltye of the murder for which hee was
accused? he answered &amp; pleaded to the same not
guiltye, and for triall put himselfe to God and
the Cuntry: wherupon there was a sufficient
Iewrie chosen for his triall, before whom the
Prisoner stood to heare what might be aleaged
against him, for proofe of the fact which before
he had denyed. Then the Court did commaund
proclamation to be made for all such to come in
&amp; make their appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as could say any thing
against the prisoner concerning the fact: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he stood vpon his discharge: whereupon
the Queenes Attourney generall first shewed
and openly commaunded to be read, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
&amp; examination of the saide <hi>Arnold Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bye</hi>
taken the 16. of Ianuarye before maister
<hi>VVilliam Fleetwood</hi> Sargiant at Lawe,
and Recorder of the Cittie of London, which
saide examination contained, that about a
twelue moneth before the said Lord <hi>Burke</hi> and
the prisoner, fell out and fought together at
Greenewich, and that afterward they were
made freends; neuerthelesse it appeared there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="tcp:16918:4"/>
by that <hi>Cosbye</hi> gaue vnto the said Lord <hi>Burke</hi>
sundry very base tearmes &amp; vnsomely woords
with other such great abuses, as no noble Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
would haue put vp at the handes of so
meane a man as <hi>Arnold Cosbye</hi> was, and the
same alway iustified by the partie, who from
time to time did discouer them to my Lord,
whome the prisoner in his examination afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
charged to doo it of malice: and in conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
euen in the scope and course of his saide exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
it euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly appeared that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wilfully pretended the murder of the saide
Lord <hi>Burke,</hi> and in most shamefull sorte effected
it as aforesaid: as Maister Atturney generall
did learnedly lay it open. And in the saide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
the said <hi>Cosbye</hi> declared, that the Lord
<hi>Burke</hi> and he rode together from the Courte,
where the said examinate desired him to crosse
the riuer vpon the common way to London, to
the ende (as he saide) if it were his chaunce to
endanger him, he might the more easily escape
by means of his frends, which my L. refused.</p>
            <p>After that there was a letter openly shewed
and read, sent from <hi>Cosbye</hi> the night before the
Lord <hi>Burke</hi> died, containing very <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
tearmes, far vnmeet for so meane a man to send
to so noble a personage, in which he did threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
a sharpe reuenge to the saide Lord and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him therein by the bare name of <hi>Burke,</hi> so
<pb facs="tcp:16918:4"/>
that by the saide letter it appeered that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
a sharpe reuenge vpon the Lord <hi>Burke,</hi>
and then his own confession aforesaid: proued
that the next day following he committed wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
murder vpon him. Neuertheles for further
proof, witnesses were called in to declare what
they could saye touching the same, whereupon
one Maister <hi>Powell</hi> of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>answoorth shewed,
that being moued by the Lord <hi>Burkes</hi> foot man
to make search for the saide Lord, by reason he
was ridden foorth with Captaine <hi>Cosbye</hi> to
fight: spared neither hedge nor ditche, vntill he
came to the place where the L. <hi>Burke</hi> laye sore
wounded ready to giue vp the Ghoste, finding
with him at his comming a woman that did
comfort him so much as she might, by casting
hir freeze safegarde on him, and had laboured
to stop the woundes with clothes, such as she
might conueniently come by. M. <hi>Powell</hi> so soon
as he came to the L. <hi>Burke,</hi> being in what gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
estate he stood, ready to quake and quiuer
with the blood which cooled and bled inwardly
in his bodye: he first threw his cloke vpon the
L. <hi>Burke,</hi> and then demaunded of him how he
came so sore hurte. Whervpon euen in the very
agony of death, hauing supped vp two or three
dishfulls of new milke, oh said he, <hi>Cosbye</hi> hath
villanously wounded me to death, I neuer stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
blow nor giuing thrust, but whilst I was
<pb facs="tcp:16918:5"/>
stooping to vnbuckle one of my spurres, hauing
vnbuckled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other before through his perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
saying they would be some trouble vnto
me, he most cowardly thrust me in at the top of
the shoulder, which ran farre into the body, yet
if I had striken but two blowes with him, it
would neuer haue greeued me, had he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullye
slaine me in fight. Whereupon the said
<hi>Powell</hi> demaunded if his Lordship could go or
ride, but seeing hee could doo neither, hee was
constrained to put him into a carte, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
vnder him, which one had before brought
into the feelde for Cattell, and so conueyed him
to his house, in which his honor dyed, whose
house was at Wanswoorth: Maister <hi>Powell</hi>
hauing made an ende of his speeche, <hi>Cosbies</hi>
Swoord was shewed openlye before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords
and Iustices, which was all to be smeared
with the blood of the Lord <hi>Burke,</hi> at the least
sixteene inches deepe. And the same Maister
<hi>Powell</hi> being demaunded how many wounds
he told on the body of the Lord <hi>Burke</hi> (he being
before sworne to what he should speak) answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that he tolde one and twentye woundes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the fore parte of the bodye of the murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Lord after hee was dead, but the Lord
Chamberlayne affirmed there was foure and
twentye at the least, beside the great wound
of which he died.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16918:5"/>many of which smaller woundes were in his
handes, some in his armes, some in the face,
breast &amp; sides, the rest in his thighs and legs,
and some so low as to his anckles. Which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
crueltie shewed a most bloudie mind
in the man, and that he neither respected the
commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, who forbiddeth mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
neither did he regard the displeasure of
the queenes most excellent maiestie, by whom
he had his maintenance, neither did he respect
the towardlinesse of the said Lorde Boorke,
nor his owne credit in the Court, where hee
was well beloued, but in all cowardize and
rigor as appeareth, executed his bloudthir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
and cruell minde as is aforesaid, all which
the said Cosby seemed to deny, and to colour
his shamefull and vnnaturall act, he woulde
haue perswaded the Lordes &amp; Iustices there,
that he meant no quarrell nor hurt to the L.
Boorke, but said that he perswaded the Lord
Boorke being in the fielde to breake the point
of his sworde, and then to returne againe to
the Court, &amp; there to acknowledge that they
had fought, that the Lord Boorke had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the said Arnold Cosby, and that the Lord
Boorkes life lay in Cosbies handes at what
time they fought, this should the Lord Boork
haue done, as the said Cosbie affirmed, and
why? Forsooth, because Cosbie (as he said
at the barre) stoode vpon his reputation, and
<pb facs="tcp:16918:6"/>
yet it is doubtfull, whether he euer made my
Lord Boorke that offer or not, no man testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
it but him selfe. And if he had offered it
yet it had bene a matter of great disgrace vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the said Lorde to haue perfourmed it: or to
any other of his degree to haue stouped so
lowe to so meane a man, being in his highest
degree and estate, but a captaine by her maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
commission, preferred to that place by
those that were of honourable estimation, and
doutlesse such was the courage of that noble
man, that before he woulde haue done him
selfe, so great a dishonour he would first man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
haue died in the fielde at Cosbies feete,
neither is it to bee supposed that the Lorde
Boorke did offer that disgrace as Cosby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged
at the barre, which was that he pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him by the nose the night before they
fought, whereas none can come in and iustly
make report thereof, but Cosbie him selfe, yea
it is a matter manifest and plaine that the
Lord Boorke was a man of courage, that
he bore an vndaunted mind, that he was val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and a hardy man at armes, he was cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
milde, and liberall, and had beene suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
tried, with better men than euer
Cosbye durste to encounter with hande to
hand: and therefore as the Lordes said vnto
Cosbie, so it seemed to fall out, that it was
onely the cowardize of Cosbie and not his
<pb facs="tcp:16918:6"/>
courage that caused him so cruelly to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so towardly and courteous a Lorde.
Whereupon after that Captaine Moston had
deliuered to the Lords &amp; Iustices there as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled,
the trueth of all that had passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the Lord Boorke and the said Cosby
iustifying that the Lorde Boorke neuer gaue
him any iust occasion of malice or inwarde
grudge: and therewithall hauing besides
shewed sandrie pointes of cowardize in the
said Cosbie, as well towardes the said Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston
as also towards diuerse others, iustified
by the honourable on the benche, the Iurie
went together and stayed awaye some short
space: in which time the right honourable
Lorde Chamberlaine vttered vnto the priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
a speeche of great effect and deepe consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration:
which was in maner and
effect as foloweth.</p>

            <head>The speech of the right Honorable the
Lord Chamberlaine.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Osbie, giue eare
what I saie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
my speech,
looke into thy
selfe, and behold
the iust iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of God
vppon thee in
this action, first
it is most eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that thou hauing in a most shamefull
sort murthered y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> noble Gentleman, for whose
death thou art here araigned, thou thoughtest
to saue thy self by flight: &amp; hauing of thy own
as good a hunting nag as anie is within this
Towne, thou diddest suspect that he woulde
hardly serue thy turne, and therfore thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
refuse him. Then thou tookest the Lorde
Boorkes gelding, and supposing to ride away
vpon him, hee sodainely broke from thee, and
would at no hande bee taken by thee, to carrie
thee from the place where thou didst commit
the murther. Secondly, note how thy owne
nag
<pb facs="tcp:16918:7"/>
serued thee, that when thou wert vppon
him, thou couldest hardly get him to carrie
thee to the wood where thou diddest hide thy
selfe. When thou camest into the wood neere
Wimbleton, there thou staiedst most parte of
all the daie, there thou hadst time, space, and
sufficient meanes to haue fled farre inough,
and to haue staide there long inough, yet thou
hadst not the power to doe it, there thou lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geredst
all the daie long, and durst neither
passe one waie or other, the fact being commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
about eight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> clock in the morning, thou
hadst no power to depart before euening, and
then note the iudgements of God vpon thee,
whether didst thou flie? Thou hadst no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to passe an<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e waie, but euen to the place
where the man saie whom thou murtheredst,
and comming on the backe side of the house,
thou sawest my son, but he sawe not thee, and
then to hide thy self, thou fledst behind y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> house
where the dead corpes laie, at which time all
the woundes in the Lord Boorkes bodie did
bleede afresh, and the better to shadowe thee
from the iust iudgementes of God, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
thee to come againe to that place wher
thou committedst murther, thou didst de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of a b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie which was the waie to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
as though thou knewest not the way to
London, being an ordinarie man &amp; fauored in
the court, but this was Gods doing to shewe
<pb facs="tcp:16918:8"/>
his wonderous workes vpon thee, and a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
that God would not suffer thee to flie, nor
thy fact to go vnpunished: yea the very beasts
did shunne, &amp; seemed vnwilling to carrie thee
from the place where thou committedst the
murther, thy best friends fled from thee when
thou hadst done it, and for dooing it, they dyd
abhorre thee. Thou knowest that thou wast
well beloued in the Court, as well of noble
men as other, but this thy foule and odious
fact, maketh euery one of them to despise thee.
Well, now call vpon God and bee sorie for thy
offences, for it is some notable and grieuous
offence which thou hast in time past commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
against God, that causeth the iust iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of God to followe thee euen at thy
heeles, and hath neuer lefte thee till thou
camest to this place.</p>
            <p>This speech ended, the Iewrie came to giue
vp their verdit, whereupon the prisoner was
set forth to heare the same, but when hee sawe
that hee was iustly condemned in the case of
wilfull murther, hee saide nothing, nor neuer
changed countenance therat, neuertheles be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
iudgment was pronounced against him,
he fearing least he should haue some grieuous
death for his horrible offence, he humbly cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the fauour of the Court, that rather than
he should be hanged, he desired to be shotte to
death with bullets, but the right worshipfull
<pb facs="tcp:16918:8"/>
sir George Carey, knight marshall of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
tolde him that the law would not allow
it, but of necessitie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fact being odious, it must
be punished according to the laws of the land.
Then hee made another motion, &amp; desired the
honorable and worshipful of the bench, that he
might not bee executed that present daie, but
that he might haue that daies respite, and a
Preacher appointed to comfort him to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
seeing hee was nowe no man of this
world: which they all granted because it was
a Christian motion. Thereuppon master At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney
proceeded to iudgement, and first she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
him the odiousnes of the fact &amp; murther
committed, the shortnes of his life, &amp; that now
he was to looke for nothing but death, and
therefore willed him to comfort himself with
hope of the ioyes in the life to come, willing
him to aske God mercy, for (saith he) God hath
promised that no sinne shall be vnpardonable
with him, but onely the sinne against the holy
Ghost, which he hath sayd shall neuer bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen.
And therefore trust in the mercies of
God, for in him now onely resteth your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
Wherfore according to the lawe, the court
doth award you to goe from this place vnto
the Marshalsey, &amp; from thence to be conuaied
to Wansworth, to some conuenient place nere
about where the fact was committed, &amp; there
to be hanged till you be dead, and so the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:16918:9"/>
haue mercie vpon your soule, and afterward
to be hanged in chaines, for example sake to
al other that shal attempt to do the like. Then
the right honorable the Lorde Chamberlaine
did in fauour of his first motion grant him his
life vntil the wednesdaie morning following,
so that he had one day granted more vnto him
then he desired. Wherevpon the Court brake
vp and departed, and the prisoner accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
was committed to the
Marshalsey.</p>
