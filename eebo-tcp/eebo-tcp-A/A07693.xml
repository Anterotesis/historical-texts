         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Then vppon the letter rayse they many greate errours, and saye the scripture is playne vppon theyr syde. And thys say not onely Luther, Tyndale, and Swynglius with frere Huskyn and hys felowes, agaynst the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyon of all holy doctours and sayntes, and the comen fayth of all trewe crysten people .xv. hundred yere before them: but eche of them selfe also agaynst other amonge them selfe saye and swere that the scrypture is playne for theyr parte.</p>

And therfore is yt false that yf oylynge and shauynge be no parte of the presthed, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prest is no preste for lakke of prestely vertues. For the holy sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of order is gyuen hym by the imposycyon of the bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes handes vppon hym, in such wyse as the chyrche of Cryste vseth and euer hath vsed synnys the deth of Cryste vnto these dayes.</p>
                  <p>And that the grace by god appoynted vnto holy orders <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is geuen wyth that puttyng vppon of the handes / is twyes declared by saynt Paule in his pystles to Tymothe / &amp; that so playnely that yt greueth Tyndales herte to here thereof, and maketh hym to make a mokke thereat, and saye it was but lyke as a man layeth his hande on a boyes hed when he calleth hym good sonne.</p>
                  <p>But the place is for all that so playne / that when Tyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale so playeth therwyth and so lawgheth thereat: he law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheth but from the lyppes forwarde, and gyrneth as a dog doth when one porreth hym in the teeth wyth a stykke. And thus haue I proued the consequency to be false, which Tyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dale graunteth for trew. Now to thet other parte, that is to wyt the consequente whych he graunteth for trew also, I saye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yt is false also. For lyke wyse as he graunteth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that a preste is no preste at all for lakke of prestely condycy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: so myght he saye as well that a crysten man is not cry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>styned at all, for lakke of crysten condycyons. And bycause Tyndale wyll haue a preste nothyng but an offycer: yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his owne false and fonde fashyon he sholde not graunte yt for trew. For then muste he saye that euery euyll offycer, mayre, baylye, constable, or shyryffe yf he mysse vse hym self in his offyce, were forthwyth out of offyce. And thus ye se that the consequente is false, whyche Tyndale also graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to be trew.</p>
                  <p>But all this bysenesse maketh he for hatered and dyspyte that he bereth to presthed, and to the dyuyne seruice that the prestes say, wherof hym self sayth none at all / &amp; for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyce

For these be the wordes that I wolde haue wysshed hym to say.

The fyrste is that it is playne false that Tyndale taketh for a playne truth / that is to wyt that the trewe prechers coude haue no thynge to confounde the false prophetes that sholde come wyth false myracles, but yf all the trouth were wryten in scrypture autentyque amonge the people. And that yf it so were / then the trewe precheours had inough wythout trew myracles to confounde the false prophetes bryngynge false myracles. The seconde thynge that I answere hym wyth is thys / that yf it were trewe that he sayeth, that wythout myracles nothynge wolde suffycyently serue in suche case, excepte that euery necessary thynge were wryten in auten,+tyque <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> scrypture: yet syth hym selfe confesseth that trewe myracles myghte in suche case suffycyently serue the trewe precheour, and confounde the false, and saue the fayth vp ryghte / and that he can not saye but that god is able to do them when so euer he lyste, and wyll neuer leue hys chyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che destytute of helpe and comforte necessary, and therfore in suche necessyte wyll not fayle to do them: Tyndale must nedes agre (be he neuer so lothe to comme to it) that god hath no necessyte for auoydynge of suche parell, to prouy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de that hys chyrche sholde haue euery necessary thynge delyuered vnto them, and euer more kepte wyth them in autentyke scrypture / whyle hym selfe by hys promyse wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de euer dwelle wyth them, and hadde for the profe of theyr fayth agaynste false prophetes and theyr false myracles,

                  <p>This secunde answere is open and playne inough in yt selfe. And for as mych as the fyrste appereth not peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture so fully playne at the fyrste syght / I shall make yt cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. when Tyndale sayth that excepte all were wryten that we be bounden to byleue or to do, there were ellys nothyng saue miracles to confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de false prophetes that sholde come with false miracles: ye perceyue well that he prosupposeth that yf euery such thyng be wryten in autentique scripture, then wythout myracles the mater is saue inough / and the trew preachers able inough to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founde the false by the scri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> alone. For but yf he saye so, he sayth no more for the alledgyng of scrypture then for the alledgynge of the fayth wythout scrypture.</p>
                  <p>Now Tyndale tellynge vs thus / we muste fyrst wyt of hym whych false ꝓphetes he meaneth, Paynyms, Turkes, or heretikes. If he meane Panynyms or Turkes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goeth he very farre wyde / for the trew preachers can not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founde them wyth our autentyke scrypture / for yt is not autentyke amonge them, but they saye that yt is false. If he meane he<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>retykes, he goth almoste as farre wyde / for they wyll also when they lyste denye for holy scrypture any parte of holy scrypture that proueth agaynste theyr purpose / as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye the boke of Machabees, bycause yt proueth purgatory and prayours for them that are dede / and denye the pystle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of saynte Iamys, bycause yt reproueth a bare fayth wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good workes.</p>

                  <p>Now when he speketh of confoundynge them: we must wyt of hym what he meaneth by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>foundyng them. whether he meane that the trewe preacher shall make the false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete ashamed / or that he shall make the people perceyue theyr doctryne for false.

For though god hadde neuer geuen warnyng by Moyses, that there sholde come a nother prophete: yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte god had expressely sayd that he wolde neuer sende mo (whyche he sayed not) what sholde let Cryste to be byleued commynge wyth miracles / and though he wolde teache in the bylyefe, not contrary artycles to those that were byfore taught, but other reuelacyons farther that were not taught byfore, and in workes make what chaunge that god lyste to commaunde. Goddes worde when yt was brought vnto the people by Moyses / was yt byleued for goddes sake or for Moyses?

For theruppon as he deduced afore that women <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> may synge masse, and muste in tyme of nede: so he deduceth now that the apostles were by the same cheryte dreuen by theyr wrytynge, to prouyde agaynste heresyes whyche they saw sholde come / and that coulde they not suffycyently do, but yf they prouyded a lyke agaynste all heresyes, ergo they wrote euery necessary trouth. This argument is god wote full pore, syke, and sore / &amp; myght syt at saynte Sauyons a beggynge wyth a dyshe and a clapper, for any thynge that yt can helpe yt selfe / yt is so blynde and lame &amp; lakketh so many lymmes / &amp; yet hath it one the mo for me that Tyndale forgate to sette in. But yet lakketh he bothe hys legges for all that, and his yien, and his handes, and his brayne to. For he muste sette in, that they whych wrote, knew well eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry heresye, that euer shold spryng after theyr days, and this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> muste he proue by scrypture.</p>
                  <p>He muste also sette in, that no mo of the apostles knewe that poynte but onely those that wrote: or ellys that the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coulde not wryte nor god coulde not teache them / or fy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nally that eache of them redde others wrytynge, and so saw that all was writen by theyr felowes / &amp; then caried all theyr felowes writynge wyth them into the countres where them selfe preched, and lefte yt there. And this muste he proue me by scrypture / for ellys he saueth not vpperyght the cheryte of saynte Andrew nor saynte Bartlemew, that wrote no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge at all nor of saynt Peter in wrytyng lesse then saynt Poule / nor of saynt Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for leuynge out the consecracion at Crystes maundye.</p>
                  <p>He must also put in that they saw that wythout wrytyng

god coude not kepe the poyntes of fayth amonge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people / for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ellys the cheryte strayned them not of necessyte so sore to put all togyther in wrytynge.</p>
                  <p>He muste also put in, that all theyr wrytynge is kepte &amp; reserued saufe, and euer shall tyll the daye of dome / for ellys he seeth what foloweth. And then knoweth he well that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syde corrupcyon of bokes, myche therof is lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And then must he proue me that by scrypture ere I beleue hym. And ouer thys must he put in, that they haue wryten all thynge as clere as they myghte haue done to answere all heretykes wythall / for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thynge longed to cheryte to, yf of cheryte theyr purpose was to wryte agaynste all heresyes.</p>
                  <p>And yet whyche I had almost forgoten, he muste put in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to, thys argument also, that they haue gyuen vs warnynge that they haue wryten all togyther that eyther than neded, or at any tyme after shold nede to be byleued or done, vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> payne of dedely synne. For thys is one of the very chyefe poyntes of all / &amp; therfore thys muste he proue by scrypture. For ellys they lefte vs in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger to byleue some other thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges mo then they wryte / namely synnys y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> some wrote not so mych as theyr felowes, sum confesse that they taught by mouth more then they wrote / and some wrote nothynge at all / and of that the other wrote, good parte loste / and of that wrytynge that remayneth, some corrupted by writers, some by prenters, and mych so hard that no man vnderstandeth.</p>
                  <p>And fynally muste he put in to thys argument also, that after theyr dayes Cryste wolde neuer shewe nor reuele any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> thynge to hys chyrche more / nor byd any of them any other thynge byleue or do then was put in wrytynge all redy by hys apostles / or ellys that though he wolde byd them any forther thynge at any tyme after eyther byleue or do: yet wolde he neuer be angry wyth them though they wold ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther byleue that he told them, nor do that he bode them / but tell hym well and playnely to hys teth, that yf he wolde be byleued or obayd, he shold haue made his apostles wryte it. Thys poynt specyally muste Tyndale amonge other proue me by playne and euydent scrypture. For ellys were it ye wote well a great parell for any man to saye nay to goddys specyall byddynge / though that specyall byddyng were not specyfyed in scrypture / but yf god haue playnely spoken in

                  <p>Now se you good readers how syke, how sore and how feble his argument is / by whyche he wolde proue vs that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cheryte of the apostles droue them to put all necessary thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in wrytynge.

                  <p>For where he sayeth that euery new questyon that maye aryse, we shall determyne by scripture: ye se your selfe very well he speketh of an vngracyouse purpose / wyllynge to bryng in his poysened heresyes vnder that <abbr>ptexte</abbr>, syth that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he knoweth that the scrypture proueth not the perpetuall virgynyte of our lady, whyche he wolde haue no man boun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>den to byleue / and also concernynge the sacrament hym self sayth is but brede, and that there ought none honour to be done thereto / and falsely defendeth the tone by the wordes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thys is a substancyall reason of Tyndale be ye sure.

                  <p>Now these wordes of Criste, if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chirch, take hym for an hethen: euery man well wotech that thys is manifestly spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not of the apostles onely for theyr tyme, but of the chirch as longe as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world shall laste.

                  <p>And thus as I say these heretyques laye forth for theyre parte hard textes and doutefull, as Barns doth here / which texte in the place where yt standeth, the beste lerned men are in dowte how to constre yt.

                  <p>Tyndale saw well also that any thynge that his mayster Marten Luther layde and lashed oute agaynste the kynges hyghnes, concernynge this purpose, or spekynge agaynste the tradycyons of men / serue to no purpose in this mater a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste the sacramentes, or any poynte of the catholyque fayth, whyche we saye be the tradycyons of god. wherof as Tyndale well knoweth / nothynge that Luther layed, any thynge proue the contrary, nor any thynge touche the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to proue that all the necessarye poyntes of the crysten fayth were by Crystes apostles putte in wrytyng.

For Tyndale at last after longe lokyng on it / espyed well y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yt wold nothyng serue for hys mater. For he saw well that saynt Poule ment none other, but that an angell were not to be byleued, yf he taught a contrarye gospell / and ment not that none angell were to be byleued, yf god sent hym both to conferme that, and also shew somwhat that god wolde haue done farther.</p>
                  <p>Tyndale saw also that that texte sayeth not that saynte Poule hath wryten all hys owne gospell, nor that all hys fe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lowes hadde wryten yt amonge them all / whyche he wyste well was the poynte that muste be proued.
