            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Almost of a Triangular forme sauing that many bays &amp; Inlets making incroachment haue disfigured the face therof with Scars, eating into the land into 40 leagues space on the South part where we haue searched 30 as good Harbours as the world affords.

There is at this present of 3. yeares old of my sowing, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Rosemary, Fenell, Sweete marierim, Bassell, Purselyn, Lettise, and all other Herbes &amp; Rootes: as torneps, Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nepes, Caretts, and Radishes we haue found to growe well there in the Sommer season. The common wild herbes of the Countrie are Angelica, Violets, Mints, Scabius, Yarrow, Ferne, Salsaparilla, with diuers other sorts whereof I am ignorant; But suppose would for variety and rariety compose another Herball; of these kinds wee haue only made vse of certain great green leaues ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifully growing in the woods, and a great Roote growing in fresh water ponds, both good against the Skiruye, and an other prettie Roote with a blew stalke and leaues of the nature of a Skirret growing in a dry Beachy ground, good meate boyled: The Countrie fruites wild, are cherries small, whole groaues of them, Filberds good, a small pleasant fruite, called a Peare, Damaske Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses single very sweet, excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Straberries, and Hartleberries with aboundance of Rasberries, and Gooseberries somewhat better than ours in <hi>England,</hi> all which replanted would be much inlarged. There is also a kinde of wild Coranies, wild Pease or Feetches in many places which we haue both found good meat and medecine for the Skiruy; The Land of the North parts most mountanye &amp; woodye very thick of Firre trees, Spruce, Pine Lereckhout, Aspe, Hasill, a kinde of stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wood, the three formest goodly Timber and most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for Building.

The
<pb facs="tcp:10466:5"/>
Spring beginneth in the end of Aprill, &amp; Haruest continueth while Nouember, I haue seene September and October much more pleasant than in <hi>England;</hi> The South part is not so mountanous nor so woodie, for being a little passed vp from the Sea coast the continent hath champion ground for 40. miles together in North and South extent of the like nature of the former, hauing pretty Groues and many fresh laks replenished with Eeles &amp; Salmon-Troutes great, and in great plentie. The Beastes are Ellans, Follow-deare, Hares, Beares harmeles, Wolues, Foxes, Beauers, Catnaghenes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, Otteres, and a small beast like a Ferret whose excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Muske, And the Plantations haue prettie stoare of Swine and Goates. The Fowles are Eagles, Falcons, Tas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sills, Marlins, a great Owle much deformed, a lesser Owle, Bussards, Gripes, Osprayes which diue for Fishes into the Water, Rauens, Crowes, wild Geese, Snipes, Teales, Twil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lockes, excellent wilde Duckes of diuers sorts and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, some whereof rare and not to be found in Europe, Their particulars too tedious to relate, all good meate, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triches white in Winter, and gray in Summer, greater tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ours, Butters, blacke Birds with redd breastes, Phillidas, Wrens, Swallowes, Iayes, with other small Birds, and 2. or 3. excellent kinds of Beach Birds very fat and sweet, &amp; at the pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tations English Pigeons.

But of all, the most admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is the Sea, so diuersified with seuerall sorts of Fishes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding therein, the consideration whereof is readie to swallow vp and drowne my senses not being able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend or expresse the riches therof. For could one acre ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be inclosed with the Creatures therein in the monthes of Iune, Iulie, and August, it would exceed one thousand acres of the best Pasture with the stocke thereon which we haue in <hi>England.</hi> May hath Herings on equall to 2. of ours, Lants
<pb facs="tcp:10466:5"/>
and Cods in good qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tity, Iune hath Capline a fish much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling Smeltes in forme and eating, and such aboundance dry on Shoare as to lade Carts, in some partes pretty store of Salmond, and Cods so thicke by the shoare that we heard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie haue beene able to row a Boate through them, I haue kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of them with a Pike; Of these, three men to Sea in a Boate with some on Shoare to dresse and dry them in 30, dayes will kill commonlie betwixt 25. and thirty thousand worth with the Oyle arising from them 100 or 120. pound. And the fish and Traine in one Harbour called Sainct Iohns is yearly in the Sommer worth 17, or 18. thousand pounds. Iulie, and so till Nouember, hath Macrill in aboundance: one thereof as great as two of ours, August hath great large Cods but not in such aboundance as the smaller, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth with some little decreasing till December; What should I speake of a kinde of Whales called Gibberts, Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish, Porposes, Hering-Hogges, Squides a rare kinde of fish, at his mouth squirting matterefor th like Inke, Flownders, Crabbes, Cunners, Catfish, Millers, thunnes &amp;c. Of al which there are innumerable in the Summer season; Likewise of Lobsters plentie, and this last yeare stoare of Smelts not hauing beene knowne there before. I haue also seene Tonnie fish in Newland; now of shell fish there is Scalupes, Musseles, Vrsenas, Hens, Periwinkles &amp;c. Here we see the chiefe fishing with his great commoditie expressed, which falleth so fitly in the Summer season betwixt seed-time and Haruest that it cannot be any hinderance to either. I haue heard some countries commended for their two fowld Haruest, which heare thou hast, although in a different kinde, yet both as profitable, I (dare say) as theirs so much extolled, if the right course be taken; &amp; well fareth, that country say I, which in one months time with reasonable paines, wil pay both land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords rent, seruants wages, and all Houshold charges. But peraduenture some squeaysie stomake will say, Fishing is a beastly trade &amp; vnseeming a Gentleman, to whom I answere <hi>(Bonus odor luti cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lucro)</hi> &amp; let them propound the Holanders
<pb facs="tcp:10466:6"/>
to themselues for example whose Countrie is so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, by it; others say the Countrie is barren, but they are deceiued, for <hi>Terra quae tegit seipsam tegit Dominum,</hi> and the great aboundance of Woodes and wilde Fruites which excedingly florish there proue the contrary. And what thogh the fertility of the soyle and temperature of the Climate be inferiour to <hi>Virginia,</hi> yet for foure maine reasons to be laid downe it is to be parallelled to it, if not preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, the which we will heare propound.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The first reason is the nearenes to our owne home, which naturally we are so much addicted vnto, being but the halfe of the way to <hi>Virginia,</hi> hauing a conuenient passage for three seasonable Monthes, March, Aprill and May, which alwayes accomodate faire windes to passe thether, sometime in 14. or 20. dayes, seldome in thirtie dayes. Likewise the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious returne in Iune, Iulie, August, September, Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and Nouember, sometimes in 12. 16. 20. and now and then in thirtie dayes.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The great intercourse of trade by our Nation these threescore years and vpwards, in no small numbers frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the New-found land, and daylie increasing, with the likelinesse thereof to continue, fish being a staple commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie with vs, and so sellable in other countries yearlie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying 3000. thousand Sea-men and breeding new daylie, also fraighting three hundreth Ships in that voyage, and releuing of 20000. people moe here in <hi>England</hi> (for most of these fishers are maried and haue a charge of Children, and liue by this meanes not being able to gaine halfe so much by another labour) furthermore the reuenew that groueth to the. King by the customes of <hi>French Spanish</hi> and Straights goods imported, from the proceede of this fish trade suppose at the least to the value of ten thousand pounds yearely.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The conueniency of transporting plantors thether at the old rate, ten shillings the man, and twentie shillings to find him victual thether, likewise other commodities by shippes
<pb facs="tcp:10466:6"/>
that goe sackes at ten shilling per tunne out, and thirtie shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings home, whereas <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Birmooda</hi> fraightes, are fiue pound the man and three pound the tunne.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Fourthly and lastly, Securitie from foraine and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticke enemies, there being but few Saluages in the north, and none in the south parts of the Countrie; by whom the planters as yet neuer suffered damage, against whom (if they should seeke to trouble vs, a small fortification will serue being but few in number, and those onely Bow men. Also if any Warres should happen betwixt vs and other Nations, wee neede not feare rooting out. For the Yce is a Bulwarke all Aprill commonlie and after that during the whole Summer wee haue a garison of 9. or 10. 1000 of our owne Nation with many good and warlike Shippes, who of necessitie must defend the fishing season for their liuings sake, as they alwayes formerlie haue done in the Warres with <hi>Spaine.</hi> And afterwards in the monthes of Haruest and Winter the winds are our friends and will hardlie suffer any to approch vs, the which if they should, the cold opposite to the nature of the Spainard will giue him but cold Intertainement; neither will the Plantours be altogether puffed vp with carelesse securitie but fortifie in some measure knowing that <hi>Non sunt securi qui dant sua Colla securi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe hauing formerly layed downe the temperature of the Aire and disposition of the Weather in the Winter sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be cold and consequently differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from other places of the same situation vnder the same Parallel in Europe, and by experience answerable to 59. or 60. degrees thereof. It will be expected that I should shew some reasons concerning the same which according to mine opinion (submitting my selfe to better Iudgements) I will set downe; It being a generall rule approued through <hi>America</hi> that any place vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same Parallel of another place in Europe is as cold as those places which are situate in 12. or 13. degrees to the North wards therof, and the same rule holdeth a like on
<pb facs="tcp:10466:7"/>
either side of the Equinoctiall. For example, the straights of <hi>Magelan</hi> in 54. to the South of the Equinoctiall, are more cold, snowie and boysterous than any part of Europe in 65, Likewise on this side the Line, the Country about the Riuer <hi>Orenoaque</hi> and <hi>Trinidade</hi> in 9. or ten degrees is fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d as temperate as <hi>Gualata</hi> vnder 23. degrees of more nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlie latitude in <hi>Africa.</hi> So likewise Sainct <hi>Augustine</hi> in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida</hi> vnder 31. degrees is anserable to <hi>Valadulid</hi> in 42. degrees in <hi>Spaine,</hi> also the plantations vnder 37. degrees in <hi>Virginia</hi> are correspondent in the Winter to the temperature of <hi>Deuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> or <hi>Cornewell</hi> vnder 50. degrees heare in <hi>England,</hi> and although their Summer bee some what hotter in regard of the nearenes of the Sunne, being then in <hi>Cancer</hi> within 15. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of their Zenith, the Radius therof then striking neare at a right Angle, causing a strange reflection, yet would it be much hotter if the Sun in his passage ouer the great <hi>Oceane</hi> 3000. miles broad vnder that Paralel, betwixt Europe &amp; <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> by the exhalation of waterish vapours &amp; much moisture thereout, into the middle region of the Aire, did not coole the same, which being made more grosse &amp; thick with misty Clouds, his Beames cannot pearce through with their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre vigor and force, to heate the Earth; To this cooling of the Sunnes heate helpeth also all those great fresh ponds and lakes so abounding in <hi>America.</hi> Fresh waters being more naturally cold than salt, and both colder than the Earth, of like qualitie also are the marish and Boggie groundes, the Lands not manured and therefore more naturally cold, the Country slenderly peopled, voide of Townes and Cities, whereof Europe is full; the smoake whereof and heate of fires much qualifieth the coldnesse of the Aire. Lastly the chiefest reason of the coldnesse in New-found-land in the VVinter season is the Yce which beeing congealed into great firme Lands, Euen from the North Pole, all alongst the Coast of <hi>Gronland, Grenland,</hi> The North-west passage <hi>Terra de laberador</hi> &amp; so towardes the Grandbay, all that tract hauing many Inlets and broken Lands apt as vnnaturali
<pb facs="tcp:10466:7"/>
wombes to breede and bring foorth such Monsters, which being nursed in their ruder armes, till the VVinter season past, are turnde foorth of doores in the Spring to shift for themselues, and being weary of their imprisonments in those angrie Climes with one accord as if they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with winde and streame take Ferrie into Newfound-land, which immuring vs in the months of Febru. &amp; March, both which are subject to northeast winds &amp; blowing from this Yce causeth it very cold. The currant stil setting it south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as a Iaylor to bring it before the Iudge, neuer leaueth it till with the helpe of the outset of Sainct <hi>Lawrence</hi> Gulfe it be presented nearer the Sun to be broild by his scorching Beames and consumed. I cannot deny but in some VVinters betwixt Christmas and March, Yce is bred in the Harbors and bayes of New-foundland, by reason of the calmenesse of the winds there incident, And the want of streames not caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing motion in the Waters, and when it is so frozen, it is none otherwise then the Texsell or Inner Seas in Holand of 15. or 18. Inches thicknesse, and breakes and consumes in the Spring; all fresh Lakes frozen opens in the end of March or the beginning of Aprill, which brings with it many showers to wash away Snow, and bare the ground; and in the midle of the Month many Ships arriue of the <hi>English,</hi> some <hi>French,</hi> and in the midest of May some Portingalls. All which as so many Reapers come to the Haruest, gathering in aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance the wonderfull blessings of the Lord.</p>
            <p>I might heare further discourse of our discoueries, confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the Saluages by Master <hi>Iohn Gye</hi> their maner of life. Likewise of the managinge our businesse in our planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the descriptions of their situations in 2. places 16. miles distant from other on the northside the bay of concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the manner charge and benefite of our fishings with the seuerall strange formes, and natures of Fishes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for making Yron, Salt, Pitch, Tarre, Tirpintine, Frank-Incense, Furres, Hope of trade with Saluages and such like, with many accidents and occurences in the time of
<pb facs="tcp:10466:8"/>
my gouerment there, but these may suffice as <hi>Verbum sapienti;</hi> being of sufficient trueth to remoue errours of conceiuing the Countrie more pleasant by reason of his naturall sight in the Spheare, then it is indeede, also to convince and take away malicious and scandelous speeches of maligne persons, who out of enuy to GOD and good Actions (instructed by their father the Deuill) haue sought to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poile it of the dewe, and blamish the good name thereof. And lastlie to induce thee, gentle Reader, to the true consideration thereof as a thing of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence to our Nation not only at present, but like to bee much more benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all when the plaintations there shall increase, which God grant to his owne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and the good of our Common-Wealth.</p>
