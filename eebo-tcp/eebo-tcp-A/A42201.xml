            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This, although we have in ſome meaſure endeavour'd in our former Diſcourſes, (becauſe the demonſtration of Truth contains the refutation of Errour:) Nevertheleſs, ſeeing every ſort of Religion, oppoſite to the Chriſtians (<hi>viz.</hi> Paganiſm, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm,

               <p>And firſt, againſt the Pagans we ſay, if they put more Gods eternal and equal, that's ſufficiently refuted already in our firſt Diſcourſe, where we demonſtrated the only one God, the cauſe of all things. But if by the name of Gods they call created Minds or Intelligences, ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to Man; they are either good or evil. If they ſay Good, they ought to be ſure of it, leſt they fall perhaps into a dangerous Errour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving enemies for friends, fugitives for meſſengers. Beſides, reaſon requires, that ſome evident difference of Worſhip be made between the Higheſt God and theſe Intelligences. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it ſhould be known, what order is among them, what good may be expected from every one, and what honour the Greateſt King is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

All which being wanting in their Religion, it is hence apparent enough, how nothing of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty is therein; and how much more ſafe a way twere for them, to betake themſelves to the Worſhip and Service of the one Supreme God (which alſo <hi>Plato</hi> hath affirmed to be the duty of a Wiſe man:) and ſo much the rather, becauſe good Spirits being the Miniſters of the Supreme God, they cannot chuſe but be very ſerviceable to ſuch as live in Gods favour.</p>

               </head>
               <p>But we have weighty Arguments to prove the Spirits which the Pagans worſhipped were not Good, but Evil Spirits. Firſt, becauſe they remitted not their ſervants to the Worſhip of the Higheſt God: yea, as much as they could they took away that Worſhip, or at leaſt, by all means would therein make themſelves equal to him. Secondly, becauſe they procured very grievous Perſecutions of the Worſhippers of the Supreme God, ſtirring up the Magiſtrates and people againſt them.

                  <hi>VII.</hi> How <hi>Jeſus</hi> obſerved the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and what he aboliſhed.</head>
               <p>Here by the way we are to note, (to evince the iniquity of the <hi>Jews</hi> contemporary with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,) that Jeſus was dealt with by them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ill, and expoſed to puniſhment, when no offence of his againſt the Law could be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. He was <note n="a" place="margin">Luc. <hi>2.21.</hi>
                  </note> Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, he uſed <note n="b" place="margin">Gal. <hi>4.4.</hi>

                  </note> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel; he ſent them to the <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. <hi>8.4.</hi>
                  </note> Prieſts that were cleanſed of the Leproſie: the <note n="e" place="margin">Luc. <hi>2.41.</hi> Job. <hi>7.2.</hi>
                  </note> Paſſover, and other Holy dayes he Religiouſly obſerved. If he healed any on the Sabbath, he ſhewed that ſuch works are not forhidden, not only out of the Law, <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.5.11.</note> but alſo the received opinions. And then firſt he began to promulge the abrogation <note n="g" place="margin">Act. <hi>10.</hi> Col. <hi>2.14.</hi>
                  </note> of ſome Laws, when having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come death, and aſcended into Heaven, he had furniſhed his Apoſtles with conſpicuous indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100314:20"/>and thereby declared himſelf to be ſtated in his <note n="h" place="margin">Act. <hi>2.36.</hi> Apoc. <hi>1.5.</hi>
                  </note> regal power, wherein is contained the authority of <note n="i" place="margin">lac. <hi>1.25.</hi>
                  </note> making Laws: and that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophecy, who had foretold it ſhould come to paſs, that after the deſtruction of the Kingdoms of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> (the latter happened under <hi>Auguſtus</hi>) God would give the Kingdom to a man, <note n="k" place="margin">Dan. <hi>7.13.</hi> Filius ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis Hebrais vilitatem quandam ſignificat.</note> a deſpiſed one, over all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, an everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Now, that part of the Law, which was diſſolved by Chriſt, contained nothing good in its own nature, but conſiſted of things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves indifferent, of a middle Nature, and therefore not immutable. For if thoſe things had any value by themſelves for which they ſhould be done, God would have preſcribed them to all Nations, <note n="l" place="margin">Maimon. ad Deut. <hi>33.</hi>
                  </note> not to one; and from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, not after man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind had lived above Two thouſand years. <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah, Melchizedek, Job, Abraham, iſaac, Jacob,</hi> all Pious men, and exceeding dear to God, were ignorant of this part of the Laws, either all or well nigh all: Nevertheleſs, they received Teſtimony both of their Faith in God,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100314:21"/>and of Gods Love to them. Neither did <hi>Moſes</hi> exhort his Father in Law <hi>Fethro</hi> to undertake theſe rites, nor <hi>Jonas</hi> the <hi>Ninivites;</hi> nor do other Prophets reprehend the <hi>Chaldeans, Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Sidonians, Tyrians, Idumeans, Moabites,</hi> unto whom they write, for not admitting theſe Ordinances, and yet they reckon up their ſins exactly enough. Wherefore theſe were pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar precepts, introduced either for the ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſome evil, <note n="m" place="margin">Adidololatriam pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Ezech. <hi>16.</hi>
                  </note> to which the <hi>Jews</hi> were prone, or for trial of their Obedience, or to ſignifie things to come. It is not therefore more to be admired, that they ſhould be aboliſhed, then if a certain King ſhould take away ſome mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal Statutes, to the end he might bring the whole Kingdom to an uniformity of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If you object, that theſe are ſtiled per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual precepts; men alſo douſe the ſame <note n="n" place="margin">L. hac in perpet. cod. de diverſ, prad. <hi>1.

               <p>The firſt, and that which is moſt obvious to our eyes, are the Sacrifices, of which many <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> think, they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by the wit of men <note n="a" place="margin">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100314:22"/>But when their poſterity too much eſteemed theſe things, as of themſelves to God acceptable, and a part of true Piety, they were reprehended by the Prophers. <hi>I will not</hi> (ſaith God <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.) <hi>ſpeak aword with thee for Sacrifices,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thinkeſt thou, that I will eat the Fat of Beaſts, or drink the Blood of Goats? Offer unto God Thanksgiving, and pay thy Vows.</hi> There are among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that affirm this is ſaid, becauſe the offerers were of an impure heart and life. But the alledged Words inform us, of how ſmall regard the thing it ſelf was in the ſight of God. If you conſider the whole ſeries of this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> God ſpeaks there to the Godly. For he had ſaid, <hi>Gather my Saints together unto me:</hi> and then, <hi>Hear O my People.</hi> Theſe are the Words of a Teacher. After hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended the forementioned Speech, he turns (as 'tis uſual) to the ungodly: <hi>But ta the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſaith God,</hi> &amp;c. Other places do ſhew the ſame ſenſe, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>Thou deſireſt not that I ſhould give thee Sacrifice, nor art thou delighted with burnt Offerings: But the Sacrifice truly pleaſing unto thee, is a broken Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Feſtival days were generally inſtituted in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the benefit received from God, when they were delivered from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and then brought along into the Land of promiſe. But now, the Prophet <hi>Ieremy c.</hi> 16. and 23. ſaith, the time will come, wherein new and far greater benefits ſhall ſo obſcure the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of that benefit, that ſcarce any mention ſhall be made thereof. Moreover, what was lately ſaid of Sacrifices, is true of Feſtivals: that the people began to rely upon them, as if theſe being well obſerved, their offences in other points were of ſmall account, whereupon <hi>c.</hi> 1. of <hi>Eſay,</hi> God ſaith, he loaths the new Moons and Feaſt days, they are a burden to him, and he cannot abide them. Touching the Sabbath particularly, 'tis objected: That the precept is univerſal and perpetual, as being given, not to one people, but in the beginning of the World, to <hi>Adam</hi> the Parent of all. I anſwer, the moſt Learned of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> aſſenting; The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Sabbath was twofold, the Command of remembring it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.8. and the Command of obſerving it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.13. The
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100314:25"/>precept of remembring, is fulfilled by a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous memory of the Creation; the precept of obſerving is placed in the exact abſtinence from every other work. That firſt Command was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the beginning, and without doubt the Pious Men <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>From whom alſo to the</hi> Grecians <hi>ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ncration of the ſeventh day was derived.</hi> Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens.</note> before the Law obeyed it, <hi>Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob:</hi> of which laſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we read many peregrinations, yet no where find we, that they reſted or intermitted any journey <note n="b" place="margin">

                  </note> for the Sabbath day, which after the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth out of <hi>Egypt</hi> you ſhall meet with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. For, after that the people being brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happily paſſed over the Red Sea, the firſt day of ſafety kept a Sabbath, and therein Sang an Epinicion; ſince that time, that exact reſt of the Sabbath was Commanded, whereof the fiſt mention is in the gathering of <hi>Manna, Exod.</hi> 35.2. and <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.3. And in this ſenſe, the cauſe of the Law of the Sabbath is rendred, the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of <hi>Egypt, Deut.</hi> 5.21. and withal, by this Law, proviſion is made for Servants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Maſters hardneſs, indulging them
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100314:26"/>no reſpiration from their labors, as appears in the places cited. True it is, that the ſtrangers alſo were obliged by this Law: the reaſon was, th t the face of the Commonwealth. while they reſted together, might be but one. But, that this Law of exact reſt was not impoſed upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, appears hence: becauſe in ſundry places, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.13.16. 'tis called a ſign, and a ſpecial Covenant between God and <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Now, that things ordained in memory of the deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> were not ſuch, as never to ceaſe, we have ſhewed afore from the promiſe of much greater mercies. Beſides, if the Law requiring reſt on the Sabbath, had been made in the beginning, and in that ſenſe, as never to be cancell'd; certainly that Law, in the conflict with other Laws would have prevailed: Which now is otherwiſe. For 'tis evident, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are lawfully Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed <note n="c" place="margin">

Before the coming of <hi>Mahumet,</hi> there was no cauſe of change, for none could know what <hi>Mahumet</hi> would teach. Yea, if the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of <hi>Mahumet</hi> had nothing contrary to the Doctrin of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Chriſtians would not have been more difficult in receiving his Books, than they were in the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Prophets.

                  <hi>VII.</hi> The manner of propagation of both.</head>
               <p>Next, let us ſhew the manner, how both Religions Were propagawted. Of the Chriſtian we have already ſaid, the increaſe of it was from miracles, not of Chriſt only, but of his Diſciples and their ſucceſſors, and alſo from their patience of adverſities and Perſecutions. But the Teachers of <hi>Mahumetiſm</hi> wrought no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, they ſuffered no grievous troubles, no cruel deaths for that profeſſion. That Religion, whither their Arms lead the way, follows, and is an occaſion of their Victory. Nor do the Maſters themſelves bring other Arguments for it, but the ſucceſs of their Wars, and the greatneſs of their Empire; then which nothing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100314:46"/>is, in this affair more fallacious. Themſelves condemn the <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion; and yet we know, how great were the Victories of <hi>Perſians, Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians, Romans,</hi> and how large their Empires. Nor have the <hi>Mahumetiſts</hi> always proſpered in their Wars. Notable overthrows have they received in many places, both by Sea and Land: Out of <hi>Spain</hi> they were totally expelled. A thing of ſo uncertain event, and common to good and bad, cannot be a certain note of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: So much the leſs here, becauſe their Arms are unjuſt, being often raiſed againſt Nations, not troubleſome unto them, not known by any injury; ſo that they an pretend no cauſe of War, but Religion alone, which is moſt of War, but Religion alone, which is moſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious. For the worſhip of God is no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, unleſs it proceed from a willing mind. And the will is drawn by inſtruction and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, not by threats and violence. He that is compelled to believe, does not believe, but only makes a ſhow, that he may eſcape pain. And he that by ſenſe or fear of puniſhment would extort aſſent, thereby ſhews his diſtruſt of Arguments. But again, themſelves deſtroy this very pretence of Religion, when they allow thoſe whom they have ſubdued, to uſe what Religion they will; yea, and ſome times openly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that Chriſtians may be ſaved in their own Religion.</p>

               <p>Compare we now the precepts together. On the one ſide patience is commanded, and benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity even to enemies; on the other ſide, revenge, on this ſide perpetual fidelity of Marriage, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual toleration of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: on that licenſe of <note n="a" place="margin">Vide Euthymium.</note> departing.

                     <hi>Azoara</hi> 3.8, 9.</note> after women, new provocations unto Luſt. Here, Religion is called inward to the heart, that being cheriſht therein, it may bring forth Fruits profitable to mankind: there it ſpends almoſt all its virtue in <note n="c" place="margin">Vide Barth.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100314:47"/>moderation. That ſuch weak Rudinients, as 'twere for Children, preceded the moſt perfect Law, ſuch as is Chrifts, we do not wonder: but to ſucceed after it, and for us now to return to types and ſhadows is prepoſterous: nor can any cauſe be given, why another Religion, after the Chriſtian, which is far the beſt of all, ſhould be now produced.</p>
