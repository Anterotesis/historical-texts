         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>'TIS sad to consider, that, as we owe
all our Vnsettlements to our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
so we our selves are so
settled upon the Lees in these our
Divisions, that he that endeavours to remove
us, does but put us upon a new Fermentation,
and an exercise of Passion. The charming
name of Peace it self is now become an Alarm,
and entertain'd by most as unwelcom news; and
<pb facs="tcp:105963:3"/>
they, that bring any tidings of it, lookt upon,
as Enemies, and Ill-affected. The reason of
this 'tis no hard matter to find out: for seeing
many People have engaged themselves into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
out of a wrong apprehension of <hi>Interest;</hi> as
long as that prejudice lies in the way, there is no
hope of doing any good; or ever reconciling them
to that, which seems to dis-interest them. Let
the best Oratour in the world go to perswade any
man against his <hi>Interest,</hi> he shall but lose his
own labour, and the others good opinion to boot.
Wherefore I have in this Discourse endeavour'd
to und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ceive people b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> evincing, That the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
interests of us all, as we are <hi>Brethren and
Companions,</hi> are involv'd in the <hi>Churches</hi>
Prosperity; and that her <hi>Peace,</hi> by which the
whole and every part, (the Government, and
every Person under the Government) is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>cur'd,
is, at least ought to be, the Center of all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.
If <hi>Jerusalem</hi> miscarry, if the things of
her peace be hid from her eyes; none of her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
what-ever their Zeal or their Wealth,
their Religion or their Interest may be, must hope
to escape. I do again confidently say, that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
<hi>Interest</hi> is the main ground and principle
<pb facs="tcp:105963:3"/>
of our present Divisions: because, had they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
out of pure Conscience, that's a more treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
thing, and is willing (if it be a good
conscience) to be inform'd; whereas now the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of most is, to run after things without any
examination, and to cry up one thing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
another, many times, which they have
little or no knowledge of, the one or the other.
Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> to apply to thee; whether thou
art for the <hi>Church,</hi> or against the <hi>Church,</hi> this
discourse will be serviceable and useful to thee,
upon this meer account, as thou art an <hi>honest
English-man,</hi> and wishest thy self well and thy
Countrey no harm. If thou art a Friend to the
<hi>Church;</hi> here thou wilt find some Arguments
to confirm thy judgment, and to inable thee in
debating with others, that are not Friends. If
thou separatest from the <hi>Church;</hi> then thou
must know, that 'tis mainly for thy sake, that
this comes abroad, to find thee out: because such
discourses cannot meet with thee, where they are
deliver'd. What-ever thy <hi>Opinion</hi> be, and
whether it were <hi>Conscience</hi> or <hi>Interest,</hi> that
made thee take it up (which thou art best able to
resolve thy self) do not prejudge me, but weigh
<pb facs="tcp:105963:4"/>
impartially the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> of things. I
desire not to be credited any farther, then I have
them on my side. If thou findest the Language
any where harsh and severe, do not presently be
offended: 'tis the nature of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> so
to express themselves; and I do assure thee, my
design is only to convince thy understanding,
without any intention of breaking thy head.</p>
            <p>One thing, for thy further satisfaction, I must
not conceal from thee, which, besides the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of some Friends and others worthy
Citizens, which heard me that day, was in part a
reason of this Publication; that some while, after
I had Penn'd this Discourse, I met with a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
in Print of <hi>Doctor Reynolds,</hi> the present
<hi>Lord Bishop</hi> of <hi>Norwich,</hi> Preached in the
<hi>Parliament-House, Jan.</hi> 9. in the Year, 1656.
upon this very subject, Intituled, <hi>The Peace of
Jerusalem:</hi> wherein he has, over and above
his pious inlargements upon the latter part of this
<hi>Psalm</hi> (for he takes all the four last verses for his
Text) in his Exhortation to those then in Power,
so Learnedly and Solidly, as his manner is, by
several strenuous Arguments prov'd, that <hi>The
<pb facs="tcp:105963:4"/>
Christian Magistrate has a coercive power
in matters of Religion;</hi> (Page 23.) shewing
plainly, 'tis but a trick and <hi>a design in those
that cry it down;</hi> (Page 22.) and that <hi>the
difference of dispensations in the Jewish and
Christian Church, doth not a whit alter the
case;</hi> (Page 26.) nor <hi>Christian Liberty pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
or exempt men from that Power:</hi>
(Page 29.) That with me, and I think with
any indifferent Reader, he leaves no place of
doubt. I was glad to see that the <hi>Church</hi> even
then, when her Friends were under hatches, was
not in so hopeless and desperate a Condition, but
that her cause was fairly pleaded with accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
before her <hi>Adversaries:</hi> and This it was
encouraged me to entertain some hopes, if not of
the like acceptation of my weak performance, yet
of a ready excuse for my dutiful endeavour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those, that have been always, and, I hope,
ever will be the <hi>Churches Friends.</hi> For though
that were at such a time, when our Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was laid aside (which yet that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Person,</hi> I make no question, did even
then, out of his great Learning, in his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
approve and wish restor'd) and therefore out
<pb facs="tcp:105963:5"/>
of prudence the main Controversie (which is
with the Authors of the division, those that made
the first breach) seem to be wav'd, and his style
particularly directed against those <hi>Sects,</hi> which
improving the Schism into Heresie, have depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Foundation: yet those weighty <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,</hi>
he brings, are generally applicable to
all, and are apparently of force against the most
specious <hi>Sect,</hi> we have amongst us; and that
upon this ground, <hi>(Page 31.)</hi> that <hi>divisions and
sub-divisions in the Church do exceedingly
tend to weaken, to distract; to betray it.</hi> To
make good this, I shall apply one of his <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
which alone is enough to carry the
<hi>Churches</hi> cause; (Page 28.) <hi>Whatever things
are,</hi> per se, <hi>subversive and dangerous to the
prosperity of States and Nations, come under
the proper cognizance of the Civil Magistrate
to prevent; But Heresies, Blasphemies, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries,
Impieties against God</hi> (and <hi>Schisms</hi>
too, say I, and so the <hi>Reverend Author</hi> himself
joyns them, <hi>(Page 8.) Blasphemies, Heresies,
Schisms, Idolatry, Superstition) do as well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
the Prosperity of States as sins against
the second Table. 1. Because God is as much
<pb facs="tcp:105963:5"/>
provoked by the one as by the other. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
such sins do more exceedingly divide
and unty the bonds of Love and Amity, then
other Civil differences do, and so loosen the
hearts of men from one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Instances,</hi> wherein He would have the
Magistrate exsert his power, are these;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(Page 32, 33.)</hi> To encourage Orthodox
<hi>Ministers,</hi> and the <hi>Schools of Learning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To take care that all who own Christian
Religion amongst us be required to attend
upon the Ministry.</p>
            <p>To endeavour to reconcile dissenting bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
that we may unite against the Common
Adversary.</p>
            <p>To secure <hi>Fundamental Doctrines,</hi> and for
that purpose to take care for <hi>Catechising,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I thought fit to give thee this Intimation, that,
if thou think'st my answers not full enough to
those Objections (which the streights of time
would not give leave for in the Pulpit) thou
may'st know whither to have recourse (as <hi>I</hi> said)
for thy better satisfaction. I shall conclude with
the same profession, as that <hi>Reverend Author</hi>
does, <hi>(Page 34.)</hi> that <hi>I have not pressed this
<pb facs="tcp:105963:6"/>
Doctrine of the Peace of the Church to the
straightning or grieving of any, who love our
Lord Jesus in sincerity.</hi> Only I wish, that they,
who made the earliest departure from the <hi>English
Church</hi> in these late times, would (as <hi>He</hi> does
for many of them) reflect upon themselves and
apply that of <hi>Hazael;</hi> whether they could some
years since have been perswaded to believe, that
they should have lived to see such a trail of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and mischiefs break in upon <hi>Church</hi> and
<hi>State,</hi> upon the advantage of their (perhaps at
first not ill-meaning) discontents. And let thee
and me and every honest English-man pray for
the <hi>Peace</hi> of our <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> in <hi>His</hi> Paraphrase;
(Page 8.) <hi>That God would protect his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
and maintain his Truth; that he would
prosper Fundamental Laws, the beauty and
stability of Religious Government,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that
the</hi> Tabernacle <hi>and the</hi> Tribunals, Religion <hi>and</hi>
Policy <hi>may jointly flourish, they being the
foundations of publick happiness, and which
usually stand and fall together.</hi>

well suit with our <hi>Meridian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole <hi>Psalm</hi> is an <hi>Elogy</hi> or <hi>Panegyrick</hi> Description of the
<hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Iudea,</hi> the City of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> and that not only nor so
much upon the <hi>Civil</hi> account, that <hi>there are set Thrones of Iudgment,
the Thrones of the House of David. Vers.</hi> 5. That 'twas the Imperial Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
where the King kept Court, whence Laws were issued, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
derived for the Government of the rest of the people. There
sate the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> the great Council of the Nation; and there the
supream Courts of Judicature, which received Appeals from all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Districts: But also and much more upon the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
this City being the Residence of the great King, the <hi>Lord</hi>
himself, who had set his Name there, and chose the Temple for his
dwelling-place. <hi>Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto
the testimony of Israel,</hi> (or, more exactly to the Original, <hi>according to
the testimony for Israel) to give thanks unto the Name of the Lord.</hi> This
City then was the appointed place of Gods publick and solemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
whither all the people of that Country were thrice a year, at
the three great Festivals, obliged to come up to present themselves
before the Lord in the Temple, <hi>according to the testimony of Israel, i<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> e.</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:105963:7"/>
by a perpetual Statute and standing Ordinance to that people: the
Laws of God being usually in Scripture-language styled <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that there was by this <hi>Testimony</hi> or Statute for the Tribes
coming up to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> designed a strict Uniformity in that peoples
Exercise of their Religion, is of it self clear in the very History; for
the Tribes did not every one bring up a several Form of Worship
along with them, but all as one man made a solemn appearance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
at the Temple in one joynt acknowledgment and regular Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
And Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> tells us as much, that God appointed one Temple
and one Altar on purpose for the whole Nations use; <hi>nè populus in
varias superstitiones difflueret,</hi> that the people might not, by being left
to their own liberty in the Worship of God, run loose into a world
of wild opinions and practices about matters of Religion. And
that further by <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> whose <hi>Peace</hi> we are here to pray for, is
to be understood the <hi>Church,</hi> as it is the appointed place of Gods
publick Worship, appears by the very context of the <hi>Psalm</hi> it self,
which begins and ends with this Notion, <hi>vers. 1. I was glad when
they said unto me, let us go into the house of the Lord:</hi> and then in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to this 'tis said, <hi>vers. 2. Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O
Ierusalem,</hi> that being the ready way to the Temple: and in the last
verse again he concludes, <hi>Because of the house of the Lord our God, I
will seek thy good, i.e.</hi> the good of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in its Ecclesiastical
State; as the House of God, the Temple, the place of solemn Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
belonged to it. And thus <hi>Calvin</hi> expounds that of the third
verse, <hi>Ierusalem is built as a City, that is compact together;</hi> or, as the
common Translation has it, <hi>As a City, that is at unity in it self:</hi> not
for the uniformity of the building, but, says he, <hi>propter civium con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensum,</hi>
for the unanimity and mutual agreement of its Citizens in
the Worship of God and in the Exercise of Religion.</p>
            <p>And that the people should all thus joyn their affectionate good
wishes and most earnest endeavours for the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> thus
considered, to seek the prosperity, and to promote the welfare of
the <hi>Church,</hi> in a fair compliance with publick Order, and in a quiet
regular Exercise of the National Religion, the <hi>Psalmist</hi> here in the
close of the Psalm, bring no less than three Arguments.</p>
            <p>1. From every mans personal concern in the Churches safety.
<hi>Pray for the peace of Ierusalem; they shall prosper,</hi> or, <hi>they shall be
quiet</hi> and at ease, <hi>that love thee, i.e.</hi> God will bless such persons with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105963:7"/>
a quiet and a happy life, that love the <hi>Church,</hi> and wish her well, and
pay a regular obedience to her Orders and Government. And this
upon a meer <hi>Natural</hi> Principle of self-love implanted in every mans
breast, and of that charity, which, we use to say, begins at home;
the parts being all safe in the preservation of the whole; every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
mans Cabin secure, while the Ship of Government steers right:
whereas those, that by wilful disobedience contrive publick distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances,
manifestly hazard their own prosperity in the general Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and at long run do themselves no less mischief than they design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Church,</hi> drowning for company in the miscarriage of the
Vessel.</p>
            <p>2. For that which ought to be every honest mans next considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for the good of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Community: for a Heathen could say, <hi>Non
nobis solùm nati sumus,</hi> &amp;c. we are not born only for our selves,
but our Country, our kindred, our friends, our <hi>brethren and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi>
challenge a great share in us: so that, if a man cast up his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
aright, he ought not so much to live to himself, as to the
Publick; and this much more upon the score of Christianity, where
Self-denial is the main Principle, and Charity the grand Duty.
And this Argument is represented in the Text. <hi>For my brethren and
companions sakes,</hi> for my Friends and Country-men, for my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and Relations; <hi>I will say, Peace be within thee,</hi> or, as in the
reading Psalms, <hi>I will wish thee prosperity.</hi> And this is upon a <hi>Civil</hi>
account; the <hi>Peace</hi> and prosperity of the <hi>Church</hi> being likely to
procure the settlement of good order and the establishment of peace
in the Civil State: whereas quarrels about Religion seldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
end there, till they have involved the Government and Policy of
a Nation into dangerous consequents.</p>
            <p>3. From that, which, though set last, ought to be considered and
resolved on in the first place by all pious men, that have any sense of
Gods Honour, any zeal to his Name and Service, any love or kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to his House and Ordinances; from the Worship and Respect
due to God from his people: <hi>Because of the house of the Lord our God,
I will seek thy good.</hi> And this upon a <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Religious</hi> account;
to love the <hi>Church</hi> for the Churches sake, and to do it all the good
we can for the honour of <hi>God,</hi> as well as for the benefit of our <hi>brethren
and companions,</hi> that so we may <hi>under our King live quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
lives in all godliness and honesty,</hi> as our <hi>Church</hi> has taught us to
pray.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:105963:8"/>
Being to speak before this <hi>Honourable Assembly,</hi> with whom the
Care and Government of our <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> this once famous City, is
intrusted; I have made choice of the <hi>second</hi> of these <hi>Arguments,</hi>
which shews how <hi>Civil Society</hi> is concerned in a quiet Exercise of the
<hi>National Religion:</hi> wherein the <hi>Psalmist</hi> makes it his resolution, and
recommends it to us all, <hi>to pray for the Churches peace,</hi> and to wish
her prosperity, <hi>for our brethren and companions sake,</hi> in the behalf of
our Friends and Country-men; as we wish well to our King and
Country, and stand well affected to the Government and the Laws;
as we hope to see the Nation thrive, Trade flourish, the City rebuilt,
and all our friends and acquaintance in a prosperous condition: the
<hi>peace of the Church</hi> and the peoples agreement in the Service of God,
being the only probable means of securing and ascertaining our <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Interests</hi> and Publick tranquillity. <hi>For my brethren and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee; I will wish thee
prosperity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the words we have two things fall under our Consideration.</p>
            <p>1. A Duty recommended to us in <hi>Davids</hi> Example and Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
which is to wish <hi>the Churches peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. A strong Motive to inforce this Duty: <hi>for our brethren and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
sakes;</hi> out of that love and affection, we bear to the Publick
and to our native Country.</p>
            <p>The Resolution of <hi>Duty</hi> exprest in the latter Clause of the Verse;
<hi>I will now say, Peace be within thee:</hi> where, though our <hi>English</hi>
render it as the common form of Salutation used amongst that people,
when they met or parted with one another: as our Saviour ordered
his Disciples, when he sent them forth, <hi>Luke 10. 5. Into whatsoever
house they entred, first to say, Peace be to this house:</hi> and thus our
<hi>Church</hi> has in her <hi>Offices</hi> for the <hi>Visitation of the sick</hi> after our Saviours
Example ordered, that the <hi>Priest</hi> entring into the sick persons house,
shall say, <hi>Peace be to this house and to all that dwell in it:</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
when ever we address our selves to Gods House, <hi>the House of
Prayer,</hi> 'tis very comely and most meet, that we should all of us sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
her in this Form, <hi>Peace be within thee.</hi> Yet this I take to be
too narrow a sense; for the Form of Salutation was somewhat dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from this; and it should have been said, if that had been all
intended, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Peace be to thee;</hi> not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Peace be
in thee.</hi> Therefore the rest of the <hi>Interpreters</hi> take it in a wider sense
by a plainer construction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:105963:8"/>
               <hi>I will speak peace,</hi> say they, <hi>in thee:</hi> and thus it may be the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates</hi>
part to speak peace with Authority, to command it, and to
see it kept.</p>
            <p>Say others, <hi>I will speak peace for thee,</hi> in thy behalf; and that
belongs to the <hi>Minister,</hi> to preach up the peace of the Church, even
with that earnestness as to quarrel for it: though with <hi>Ieremy</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>a man of contentions,</hi> in a perverse and froward generation,
while he does so, and when he speaks of peace, others make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
ready for battel.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Septuagint</hi> and <hi>Vulgar</hi> read it thus, <hi>I will speak peace of thee,</hi>
or, <hi>concerning thee, i.e.</hi> to speak kindly of it, and to wish it well;
and thus it will concern all the <hi>People,</hi> the generality, every man in
the Nation. And I am afraid there is but too much need, that both
<hi>Magistrate,</hi> and <hi>Minister,</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> and all, should all of us bestir
our selves, and contribute our utmost endeavours for the <hi>Churches
peace</hi> and welfare, if we will but do what we ought to do, and that
out of <hi>Interest</hi> as well as <hi>Duty,</hi> for our own and our Countries sake;
for that's</p>
            <p>The <hi>Motive</hi> and Reason, with which this Duty is back'd, indeed
faced and put forward with, in the beginning of the verse; <hi>for
my brethren and companions sakes;</hi> whose good, will they nill they,
be they the Churches friends or foes, is to be sought in the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church: for as the <hi>Churches peace</hi> depends upon the union
and agreement of these <hi>brethren and companions,</hi> so on the other hand
in her peace and prosperity, is comprehended the happiness and
nearest concerns of us all.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Brethren</hi> is meant Kindred and Relations, the <hi>charitates natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rales,</hi>
in a strict sense; but according to the larger acception of the
word in the Hebrew language all our <hi>Country-men</hi> from one end of
the Nation to the other, all that live under the same Laws and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
especially those that are of the same houshold of faith,
and profess the same Gospel of Peace.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Companions</hi> or <hi>Friends</hi> are to be understood those of a stricter
and closer Alliance, with whom we have contracted nearer and
dearer familiarities; above all, those that agree with us in the same
Orthodox Judgment, and walk regularly and lovingly with us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the same Rules and Institutions of Gods publick Worship,
whose concerns are more immediately united in the Churches wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare:
which we are in that manner to preserve and promote for
both their sakes, as not to exclude either.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:105963:9"/>
And thus much for the <hi>coherence</hi> and <hi>explication,</hi> which I have the
longer insisted upon, to gain your full assent to these two things.
1. That by <hi>Ierusalem</hi> here is meant the <hi>Church.</hi> And 2. That by
her <hi>peace</hi> is to be understood our <hi>agreement in religion;</hi> since with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this agreement there is no probability, no likelihood of her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
peace.</p>
            <p>I shall now crave leave to gather up all I have to say into one <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;</hi>
and such a proposition, as the words do naturally without
any force put upon them afford us. And 'tis this, in the words of
the Text, <hi>That we ought for our Brethren and Companions sakes to
wish and endeavour the Churches peace.</hi> Which in a brief <hi>Paraphrase</hi>
speaks thus; That 'tis the duty of every Man amongst us, whether
<hi>Magistrate</hi> or other, as he is the <hi>Governour</hi> or <hi>Member</hi> of a <hi>Society,</hi>
upon a meer <hi>civil</hi> account, our affection to our Native Countrey,
and the good of community in our several places and stations, hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to wish, and vigorously to endeavour the <hi>peace</hi> and prosperity of
the <hi>Church,</hi> in the uniform exercise of <hi>Religion</hi> and God's publick
worship.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>Proposition</hi> I shall make good by three <hi>Arguments,</hi>
taken</p>
            <p>1. From the ground of a Peoples happiness, <hi>Divine favour</hi> and
protection; and that favour not to be procur'd, but by keeping up
God's publick honour amongst us; and that honour no way to be
secur'd, but by our unanimous agreement in his publick worship.</p>
            <p>2. From that influence, which <hi>Religion</hi> is apt to have upon the
minds of Men, both in <hi>awing</hi> them and <hi>uniting</hi> them: which <hi>aw</hi> and
<hi>union</hi> both without the uniformity of worship, if People be left to
their own liberty to worship God publickly how they please, will
infallibly utterly be lost; and when Religion shall once be brought
into a publick contempt, and made the ground of an universal quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel;
when the candlestick is once removing out of the <hi>Church,</hi> 'tis
easie to foresee what danger the <hi>State</hi> will then be in, and what
will in a short time become of such a People.</p>
            <p>3. From the particular constitution of our Laws and Government,
wherein the concerns of <hi>State</hi> are so intimately and closely link'd
with the <hi>Peace</hi> and prosperity of the <hi>Church,</hi> that they must needs
stand or fall together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> then for the first <hi>Argument,</hi> that the <hi>Peace of the Church,</hi> that
is, our agreement in the service of God, is the only way of keeping
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105963:9"/>
up God's publick honour amongst us, and consequently of after-taiming
to us the favour and blessing of God, which is the main and
only ground of National prosperity and happiness, the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
of all our <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Companions.</hi> Wherein I have three things
to make out.</p>
            <p>1. That the Divine favour is the main and only prop of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
happiness.</p>
            <p>2. That the setting up Gods honour in publick amongst us is the
only means of procuring and ascertaining his favour. And</p>
            <p>3. That our agreement in the service of God is the only way of
keeping up his publick honour.</p>
            <p>I say first, <hi>That the favour of God is the grand support and alone
foundation of any peoples prosperity and happy estate.</hi> This is the <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
of the Government; <hi>ancile imperii,</hi> the buckler of State; when,
as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> expresses it, <hi>God encompasseth us with his favour, as
with a shield;</hi> whereupon it is, that by vertue of this divine influence
upon his Vice-gerents the Magistrates, they themselves are also
term'd <hi>the shields of the earth.</hi> A learned <hi>Frenchman</hi> tells us, that
the Eastern people were wont, at the building of any City, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the positions of Heaven at that time, by rules of <hi>Astrology</hi>
and other <hi>Magical</hi> observations, to make Artificial Sculptures upon
Brass, which they call'd <hi>Talismans,</hi> and to consecrate them to the
auspicious beginnings and fortunate success of that City: which
they fancied, as long as those <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> were preserv'd, would
never miscarry by fire of water, war or plague. And of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and design he takes <hi>Laban</hi>'s <hi>Teraphim</hi> to have been, which
his daughter <hi>Rachel</hi> stole away; and those of <hi>Micah,</hi> which the
boisterous <hi>Danites</hi> plunder'd him of: as the pledges of good fortune
to those Families, who were therefore both much concern'd in the
loss of them. To the same purpose the <hi>Grecians</hi> and others (indeed
who not) had their <hi>Tutelar Gods,</hi> as the guardians of each City:
so that the first thing enemies did, that came to besiege a Town, was
to call away their God, either by inchantments inticing him, or by
extraordinary respects out-bidding the Inhabitants, and proffering
the Deity better terms, if he would come over to their side: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> when <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Army beleaguer'd
them, upon such an apprehension of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s leaving them, tyed
him fast with a Golden Chain to <hi>Hercules</hi> his Altar, that he
might not stir. And 'twas a great part of policy among
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105963:10"/>
these Heathens, to conceal these their strengths, and keep them close,
as the <hi>arcana imperii,</hi> that in time of danger they might be sure of
them. From these and the like superstitious usages, this serious
truth at least may be learnt, that very Infidels and Strangers to the
Common-wealth of <hi>Israel</hi> had, from the instincts of Nature, that
sense of a Deity and an over-ruling Power, that they trusted not to the
situation and strength of their Cities, to the number or valour and
wealth of the Inhabitants, for the defence of them; but wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
their safety to divine protection. And this much more to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by us, to whom God has made himself so well known in
his Word, with whom he has entred into Covenant, whom he has
admitted unto so endearing nearnesses to himself. Our <hi>Royal
Author</hi> is every where full of these acknowledgments in this
his Book of Publick Devotions, calling God <hi>a Sun and a Shield,</hi>
his <hi>strong Rock, and Tower of Defence, and mighty Deliverer;</hi> ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
all his deliverances and preservations to the <hi>light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi>
and <hi>the saving strength of his right hand.</hi> Particularly in <hi>Psal.
144.</hi> where he does <hi>ex professo</hi> handle this Argument, he says, 'tis
<hi>he that gives Victory unto Kings;</hi> and then having recited the several
instances of a peoples outward prosperity, <hi>That our sons grow up as
young plants, and our daughters as the polished corners of the Temple;
that our garners be full and plenteous with all manner of store; that our
sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets; that our
oxen be strong to labour and in good plight; that there be no invasion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, no leading into captivity, and no complaining in our streets;</hi> he
closes this account with an acclamation, wherin he resolves the sum of
all into divine favour, as the ground and original of all these blessings
and advantages: <hi>Happy are the people that are in such a case: happy,</hi>
I say, <hi>are the people which have the Lord for their God.</hi> But yet more
closely to your purpose in <hi>Psal.</hi> 127. he tells you; <hi>Except the Lord
build your houses, they labour in vain that build them.</hi> If God be not
the Master-builder the great Undertaker of the Work, you do but
<hi>aedificare in ruinam,</hi> build up your ruines to farther ruines: And then
too, <hi>unless he keep the City,</hi> when 'tis built, <hi>the watchman waketh but in
vain.</hi> May he build your houses for you, to be habitations of peace,
and preserve your City; make it beautiful for situation, and the joy
of the whole Land: may God be well known in her Palaces for a
Refuge; may he love her Gates, and may the most High establish her,
and raise up his own Tabernacle in the midst of her: may he make
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105963:10"/>
it the City of God, and the Mountain of his Holiness. God does,
that I may with reverence speak it, by the very inclinations of his
own nature, peculiarly affect man; and then further he that said,
<hi>It is not good for man to be alone,</hi> he has a more then ordinary care
and regard for societies of men. Well govern'd Cities and well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
States are the special objects of Almighty Gods singular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
And as he has this care for our good in community; so it
must be our care to keep up his <hi>honour</hi> in publick: since, which is
our next,</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The setting up Gods honour amongst us in publick is the only means
of procuring and ascertaining his favour.</hi> The condition of his covenant
with all Nations, as well as his own people, is, <hi>I will be their God,
and they shall be my People;</hi> when we cease to be his <hi>people,</hi> we must
not hope that he will continue to be our <hi>God.</hi> All just govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are influenced and supported by him; but, if we abuse those
influences and neglect those supports, 'tis just for him in displeasure
to withdraw the light of his countenance and the saving strength of
his right hand, and to leave us in the dark to the weakness of our
own counsels and undertakings. <hi>He will honour them that honour
him;</hi> 'twas a pitiful request of <hi>Saul,</hi> to desire to be honour'd before
the people, when he himself had dishonour'd God before them.
When Governours are like God, and act all to his glory, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
does; then blessings are showr'd down upon them, and from
them to the whole community. This was <hi>Christ's</hi> own case: <hi>Thou
lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness; therefore God thy God hath
anointed thee with the oyl of gladness above thy fellows,</hi> Psalm 45. 7.
'Tis not the Crown and Scepter, the Purple and the Mace, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
the Magistrate from a common man; but the <hi>oil of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
the divine benediction upon his doing righteous things. Then
<hi>all his Garments smell of Myrrhe, Aloes, and Cassia, out of his ivory
palaces;</hi> when the fragrancy of publick example commands at once
the veneration and imitation of all that are about them: whereas
upon wicked Nations that forget God, and such families as call not
upon his name, he pours out his severest indignation. This the very
<hi>Poet</hi> could observe to his Countrymen the <hi>Romans,</hi>
               <q>Dîs te minorem quòd geris, imperas;</q>
Says he: that they ow'd their success to their piety, and were made
commanders of the world for their obedience to their Gods. Nor
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105963:11"/>
is it strange, that God should, even in false Religions, bless people
with outward prosperity and temporal success, for that honour
they did him under wrong names and mis-apprehensions; since at
bottom of all their vain conceits and idolatrous practises there lay
<hi>metus numinis,</hi> the awe and reverence of a supreme infinite power,
wherein the notion of Religion in general consists. And he goes
on, and tells them, that all their miscarriages, and all the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that had of late befaln that City and State, were to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their neglect of Religion. How much more happy should
<hi>we</hi> be, that have the truth of Religion amongst us, if we would but
be true to it our selves? And if a pretended zeal for God's honour
has, in our remembrance, made <hi>Vsurpation</hi> thrive, and heap'd
Palms and Laurels upon an unrighteous <hi>Cause:</hi> what advantage
would real devotion do to the establishing of a just <hi>Government?</hi>
And on the other hand, how much more miserable and improsperous
must we expect to be, then any wicked <hi>Heathens</hi> or backsliding <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders,</hi>
if we, having such advantages and such reasons both of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
<hi>God's honour</hi> amongst us, fail in our duty, and do not, as
we ought to do, <hi>for our brethren and companions sake,</hi> with one
common consent and mutual agreement, praise God for his mercies,
and fear him for his judgments, which he hath shewn in the midst
of us. That's the last thing of this head.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>That our agreement in God's service is the only way of keeping-up
his publick honour amongst us.</hi> When Cities and Societies here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
look like the <hi>Sedes beatorum,</hi> the blessed company of Saints and
Angels above, wherewith the Heavenly Throne is inviron'd, all
serving God the same way in perfect harmony of worship: This is
doing, that the Apostle bids us, <hi>having our conversation in Heaven,</hi>
by bringing Heaven down to us, and being <hi>all of one mind,</hi> as we
shall be there. For <hi>brethren</hi> thus <hi>to dwell together in</hi> the <hi>unity of</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and practice, is, as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> compares it, <hi>like the</hi> conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating
<hi>oyl upon</hi> Aaron<hi>'s head, that ran down to the skirts of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
that is, all over from the head to the foot; the meanest person
of the Nation equally sharing with the highest in the advantages of
the Priesthood and one common service. This is that <hi>dew of Sion,</hi>
the Church, <hi>where God commanded the blessing,</hi> the blessing of peace
and plenty. A Church, as ours now is, without this unanimity, is
but like the Ship, where <hi>Ionas</hi> was, toss'd and tumbled with winds
of doctrine and waves of faction; till, at the upshot of all, when
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105963:11"/>
they all apply themselves to their several gods, in their several ways
of Worship, the <hi>Ionas,</hi> the only true Religion amongst them, is to
be flung over-board. God is a <hi>God of order and peace,</hi> and accounts
himself highly dishonoured by our confusions. 'Twas <hi>Baal,</hi> that
delighted to be served with loud crys and furious slashings. It was
the <hi>Devil</hi> with his forked foot, first brought in <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Schism;</hi>
that, by multiplying Religions, he might make the world believe,
there was no such thing; and if there were, that people might not
trouble themselves about a thing, where it would be so difficult not
to mistake in the choice. Thus, when this enemy of God and man
saw, that the <hi>crucifying Christ</hi> would not be sufficient for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing
of Religion; he fell presently, even in the Apostles times, to
<hi>divide</hi> him, for the puzzling of it. It has been observed, that <hi>Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi>
that have been abroad, and seen Religion in its various dresses
and forms, in the several Countries, where they have been, and in
what different manners they serve God, are apt at last to turn
<hi>Scepticks,</hi> arrive at a quiet indifference, and think it a matter of no
great concern, what Religion they are of, or whether they be of any
at all. But alas! we have now in this <hi>Church</hi> that disadvantage,
without travelling for it. Our people stay at home, and see fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and some (as Travellers use to put on the habit and garb of
each Country, they go through) have appeared in all shapes, taken
up all <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Forms,</hi> and done exercise in them all; till at last
they have taken the degree of <hi>Doctors</hi> in the <hi>Scorners Chair,</hi> and have
turned profest <hi>Atheists.</hi> How do the <hi>Romanists</hi> triumph in our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensions,
make Bonfires out of our flames, and daily get ground of
the <hi>Protestant</hi> Cause; whilst we <hi>Protestants</hi> our selves do their work
for them, by unnatural quarrels destroying our common Mother the
<hi>Church?</hi> How do prophane persons make themselves merry at the
miscarriages of the <hi>Church,</hi> and harden themselves in their <hi>Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Reasonings against God himself; when they see so much ado
made, such zeal and heat shown on all sides, about Forms of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and the Circumstances of Religion: when the mean while the
great Duties of <hi>Christianity,</hi> wherein the life and power of Religion
lyes, are by most of us of all perswasions neglected? and how can they
chuse but think <hi>Religion</hi> it self a trifle, if that be it, that makes us so
earnest about trifles, and yet so regardless in those things, which the
worst of <hi>Atheists</hi> themselves confess are necessary for the preservation
of men, whether singly in their own persons, or joyntly in Society:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105963:12"/>
such as are <hi>Iustice, Temperance, Charity,</hi> and the like? What can
<hi>Neighbour-States</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> abroad think of us, that, after God had
so wonderfully restored us, to the astonishment of the world, we have
so strangely and with no less astonishment, to the dishonour of God
and our own shame, lost the <hi>Miracle</hi> and let it fall to the ground, and
given up the <hi>Cause</hi> in a manner, to which <hi>God</hi> by his extraordinary
Providences and his Anointed our late Soveraign the <hi>blessed Martyr</hi>
by his unparallel'd sufferings gave such testimony? And at last what
can we our selves look for now, that God will yet work more Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
for our preservation, who have, by our divisions in his Worship
and our Spiritual fornications, not only forfeited his protection, but
procured his displeasure, and at once both disobliged his mercy and
provoked his Justice? To me, to speak what I apprehend freely, it
appears, in the posture we now stand in, a very shrewd symptom and
a dangerous indication, that <hi>God</hi> himself and <hi>Religion</hi> and all are
now about to take their solemn leave of the <hi>Country,</hi> together with
the <hi>Churches peace.</hi> And then what will become of our <hi>brethren and
companions,</hi> for whose sake we are to endeavour the <hi>Churches peace;</hi>
when God has once forsaken the Land? And thus I have done with
the first <hi>Argument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second is, that <hi>the peace of the Church</hi> in the uniform Worship
of God is a necessary expedient, to make <hi>Religion</hi> the happy instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Government,</hi> by securing that influence it has upon the minds
of men, in <hi>awing</hi> Subjects to <hi>obedience,</hi> and <hi>uniting</hi> our <hi>brethren and
companions</hi> in love: without which <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that any people should hold together, and prosper; since, where
discontents and divisions prevail, a Society must needs of it self na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
tend to dissolution. A <hi>House,</hi> a <hi>City,</hi> a <hi>Kingdom, divided
against it self, cannot stand;</hi> is a <hi>State-Aphorism,</hi> we have from the
mouth of Truth it self. So then, whether 'twere <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>love,</hi> was
the Principle, which gathered mankind into Nations and Common-wealths,
and brought them to live in Community under the same
Laws and Priviledges, we find them both in <hi>Religion.</hi> Whereupon 'tis
the remark of a <hi>Roman</hi> Historian, that, as <hi>Romulus</hi> founded the City
by Arms, so <hi>Numa</hi> setled it by Religion, and then came <hi>Ancus</hi> and
found leisure to adorn it with Temples and publick Buildings. Thus
<hi>Religion</hi> secured the acquists of the <hi>Sword</hi> on one hand, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the design for the <hi>Truel</hi> on the other. And till <hi>Religion</hi> be in a
better condition amongst you, then for ought I see 'tis now in, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105963:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not tell, what you may think of your <hi>Building.</hi> 'Tis true; it seems
to me, in our present divisions, that, much what like the <hi>Iews</hi> after
their return, we rebuild our City with a <hi>Sword</hi> in one hand, and a
<hi>Truel</hi> in the other: but so, as if that Sword were to be used against
our selves, not against an Enemy, as theirs was. I wish heartily,
that the <hi>peace</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> may be so setled amongst us, and the
rubbish of our late ruines there removed, that you may lay your
Foundations upon fair even ground, and raise the Superstructures
with comfort and honour; that, when you have built up your Walls
and your Palaces, <hi>Peace may be within your walls, and plenteousness
within your palaces:</hi> which would then most certainly be, when, as
you are obliged to an <hi>Vniformity of building</hi> the City, so the Citizens
themselves would joyn all in an uniform Exercise of <hi>Religion;</hi> whose
first Character it is, that</p>
            <p>1. It <hi>aws</hi> the consciences of men, and binds them up to their good
behaviour, in a strict attendance upon the duties of every one in his
place, and a careful obedience to the Law in common. And thus
<hi>Machiavil</hi> himself tutours his <hi>Prince,</hi> that he will put on the shew
at least of Religion, to make his Government dreadful; though he
hold it dangerous to his interest to be <hi>bigotted</hi> into it, and would
have him take up no more of it, then will serve his turn. But if the
mask and vizard, the bare appearance of Religion be, in the esteem
of carnal worldly Policy, so considerable a help to Government:
how serene and awful would it be in its genuine native countenance?
with what rays of Divinity would the truth and power of it cloath
the Magistrate; that the people would behold him as an Angel of
God? For since all Government derives its power from God, the
more of God it shews, the more powerful it must needs be. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if once <hi>Religion</hi> grow mean amongst a people, no wonder, if
they grow familiar and sawcy with the <hi>Government,</hi> and, having got
the reins of conscience upon their neck, run away with their Rider,
and 'tis well if not dismount him too. When men are suffered to
set their mouths wide open against Heaven, to blaspheme God and
deny him in a breath, and to droll in Scripture-language, and jeer
at sacred things; how can it be expected, that earthly Majesty
should preserve its reverence with the people, but that God will
suffer some to be as bold with their Governors, as they have suffered
others to be with him: that by way of <hi>Reprisal</hi> he may recover his
lost Honour, and those, that have slighted him, may be meanly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105963:13"/>
esteemed. For, as <hi>God</hi> subdues the people under their lawful <hi>Prince,</hi>
so it must be the <hi>Princes</hi> care to subdue the people to <hi>God,</hi> by keeping
up the <hi>aw</hi> and port of Religion.</p>
            <p>And this is done in the uniform and unanimous Exercise of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Then the <hi>Church</hi> shews like <hi>an army with banners;</hi> For the
<hi>Church triumphant,</hi> no body doubts but 'tis so: but this is spoken of
the <hi>Church militant;</hi> it should be so; a well ordered and discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
body of men. Without discipline and good order and unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of Exercise, it may be a tumult, a mutiny, a crowd or throng
of men, but not an <hi>Army:</hi> or if an Army, 'tis but a broken routed
one, and needs rally and recruit. And such an <hi>Army</hi> must I call our
<hi>Church,</hi> with her broken Ranks; when so many flye daily from her
Banners, and repair to other Standards; when some are so hardy
to make themselves Commission-officers, and appoint <hi>Rendez-vous,</hi>
and make Musters in private corners; indeed, in publick Assemblies,
to the defiance of the Church and Civil Authority at once. Truth
is; Our divisions have made Religion a ridiculous thing; whilst
every <hi>Party</hi> priding, it self in the glare of its own spiritual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
looks upon the rest with contempt. The <hi>Sects</hi> wonder at us,
that we stick where we do, and not come up after them: we as much
wonder at their unkindness in leaving us, and their confidence in
going so far. And the wonder goes round: for they all admire and
pity one anothers ignorance. All of them see a great light in the
way they walk in, and conclude they are got into <hi>Goshen;</hi> when all
the rest of the world, as they fancy, are still sitting in <hi>Egyptian</hi> dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Thus we censure, one another, and, when we have hoodwinkt
our selves with our own form, think our selves the only seeing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and all else, that are not as we are, blind-fold; to the merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of by-standers, but withal to some peril, lest from these giddy
reflections, we make upon one another, they conclude, we have no
light at all amongst us in the English Church, but that we are now
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> more then ever we were. What pastime and advantage
our divisions give <hi>Atheists</hi> and <hi>Papists,</hi> I shewed before: I am now
speaking of us amongst our selves. Nor do these differences only
stir the <hi>spleen,</hi> but the <hi>choler</hi> too, and fill all Parties, as with spiritual
disdain of one anothers <hi>ways,</hi> so with zealous passion too against one
anothers <hi>persons.</hi> The <hi>Sectaries</hi> are scandalized at <hi>Church-musick,</hi>
and look upon our decent Rites and Ceremonies as trumpery, and
reckon our Solemnities of Worship contemptible things. The
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105963:13"/>
               <hi>Orthodox</hi> on the other hand are justly offended at their slovenly
familiarities with sacred things, and indeed with God himself. So
that 'tis clear, by dividing from one another, <hi>Religion</hi> has lost all
its <hi>awe</hi> amongst us, every sort of it being lookt on, as mean and
despicable, by all those that are of any other sort. Nor must the
<hi>National Religion</hi> think to find better treatment, then the rest, but
rather worse; as lying under this peculiar disadvantage, that those,
who adhere to that, though never so conscientiously, lay themselves
open to a general censure of all <hi>dissenters,</hi> that they, in that they
side with the Government, are <hi>pleasers of men,</hi> and <hi>time-servers.</hi>
Besides, this is that, they all in strict judgment account to be to
them <hi>Antichrist,</hi> that which <hi>holds back</hi> and hinders, that no one of
them can get up in to absolute power. And certainly they must be
so good-natur'd, as to pity the <hi>Governour</hi> himself, if his conscience
be not of their model: I, and should he be but half so severe in the
maintenance of his way, as they are zealous in theirs, perhaps hate
him too, at least have but little kindness for him, who, as they
fancy, keeps <hi>Christ</hi> out of his Throne. Thus we see, if <hi>Religion</hi> be not
tyed up to rules, if it grow lawless, it will quickly become awless
too, loose all its respects, and not be able to assist the Government,
in the protection of our <hi>brethren and companions,</hi> whose concerns
lie bound up in the <hi>Churches peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor Secondly, Will <hi>Religion</hi> avail in its <hi>second property,</hi> which is
to <hi>Vnite;</hi> unless God's worship amongst us be uniformly exercised.
<hi>Religio à religando;</hi> Religion has its name from <hi>binding</hi> up men,
not only in themselves, binding up their spirits so as to restrain them
from publick disorders; but as to one another too, binding their
hearts together in mutual offices of love and kindness. And thus,
when we can walk together, as <hi>brethren and companions,</hi> to the house
of God, and there take sweet counsel together; this is a kindly
<hi>Vnion:</hi> when all the members of the <hi>civil</hi> society are guided and
governed by the same spirit of the <hi>mystical</hi> body, and <hi>hold the faith
in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life.</hi>
This is the true <hi>cement,</hi> which conjoins neighbours and friends closer,
then any legal priviledges and obligations can do. Without this,
you build your City with <hi>untemper'd mortar:</hi> nor will it well
bear the weather, when the flouds shall beat, unless it be thus <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
together,</hi> and be <hi>at unity in it self.</hi> And how can it rationally
be expected, that <hi>Religion</hi> should bind us together, if it self be left
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105963:14"/>
loose and tyed to no rules and orders? I confess, the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the
<hi>Catholick Church</hi> may consist, without the <hi>uniformity</hi> of <hi>particular
Churches</hi> among themselves; and thus, notwithstanding some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
they have in ordering their own affairs prudently to their
best convenience, and accommodating themselves to the necessities
of time and place, still holding to the <hi>Analogy</hi> of Faith, and sound
Doctrine, and the rule of God's Word: I say, notwithstanding
these differences in <hi>externals,</hi> we do own the <hi>communion of Saints,</hi>
as an <hi>Article</hi> of our Faith. But to say, that every <hi>particular person</hi>
or <hi>party,</hi> in the same <hi>Church,</hi> has, by vertue of his Christianity a
<hi>liberty</hi> to disobey the publick orders of that Church, whereof he
is a member; and to serve God, as shall, notwithstanding those or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
seem good to that party or person; (for, as the <hi>party</hi> breaks,
it will come to <hi>persons</hi> at last:) to take <hi>liberty</hi> in this notion is to
make it but another name for confusion. Wherefore, what they say,
is not true, being applyed to fellow-members of the same particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Church; that, according to our <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> and that <hi>lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi>
God has left things in, if the Church would leave them so too,
and not bind, where he has not bound, this would prove the best
expedient of <hi>peace,</hi> and unity: for the way would be wide enough
for every one to walk in; we should not need justle one another;
but though we used not all <hi>one form</hi> in our serving of God, we
might be all of <hi>one mind,</hi> as to our civil concerns at least. It were
well, if <hi>dissents in judgment</hi> could be so managed, as not to beget
<hi>distances of affection;</hi> but this is a thing rather to be wished, then
hoped for. For, whilest every <hi>party</hi> thinks it self obliged in <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
to advance it self, even to the prejudice and ruine of the rest;
<hi>Conscience</hi> being a principle of that violence, that, right or wrong,
it acts, like nature, <hi>ad extremum virium,</hi> to the utmost of its
strength and opportunity: hence it comes to pass, that <hi>odia religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
acerbissima,</hi> those heats and animosities, which are grounded
upon the cause of <hi>Religion,</hi> are the most dangerous and irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
by reason <hi>Conscience</hi> is ingaged in the quarrel, whose tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of apprehension is worse then the jealousies of <hi>love</hi> or <hi>power,</hi>
which will admit of no rival, cannot indure any competitor. Thus
it was betwixt the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans,</hi> that did, upon the score
of their Religions, so abominate one the other, that they would not
so much as eat and drink together, or buy and sell, or converse in
the ordinary civilities of <hi>Good morrow</hi> or <hi>Good even.</hi> So nice and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105963:14"/>
squeamish distasted <hi>conscience</hi> is, out of fear of partaking with others
sins, and fancying it can never be at distance enough from what it
conceives a dislike to.</p>
            <p>Nor is that a sufficient <hi>Salvo,</hi> to keep up <hi>Vnity</hi> amongst us, that
<hi>we agree in Fundamentals;</hi> (I wish we all did that) and that <hi>we differ
only in some things of smaller allay;</hi> the more to blame they, that fall
out about such things, and to the hazard of publick <hi>Peace,</hi> make end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<hi>differences</hi> and quarrels about things <hi>indifferent.</hi> I must com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the generous <hi>Charity</hi> of some, that profess to <hi>love all that have
faith in Christ Iesus, whatever their Form be:</hi> and I am of their mind,
that our Charity is not to be confin'd to a Party, but to be extended
to the whole Community, the Body of the <hi>Church.</hi> But then 'tis a
gross mistake, to think the <hi>Church</hi> it self, in its establishments, a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
in these our divisions; who is to be lookt on, what S. <hi>Paul</hi> says
of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> here, as <hi>the common Mother of us all:</hi> and herein lies the
main of our <hi>Charity,</hi> to seek and secure the <hi>Churches peace,</hi> in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to appease divisions, and to reconcile her disobedient Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
This, I say, is right <hi>Catholick Charity.</hi> As to those persons,
who are seduced and live in errour, the greatest <hi>Charity</hi> can be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them, is to reclaim them, or at least, if that may not be, <hi>for
our brethren and companions sakes,</hi> to keep them quiet. For to see
the humor of <hi>Schism,</hi> after it has once broke off from the <hi>Church,</hi>
how restless a thing it is, and how quarrel is apt to beget quarrel,
till it have brought all into confusion. The <hi>Sects,</hi> we have amongst
us, do no more disagree from the <hi>Church,</hi> then they do from one
another: 'tis <hi>Ephraim</hi> against <hi>Manasses,</hi> and <hi>Manasses</hi> against
<hi>Ephraim,</hi> as well as both against <hi>Iudah.</hi> And though they all agreed,
time was, too well against the <hi>Church,</hi> as a <hi>common Enemy;</hi> and,
whilst her ruine was contriving, held together: yet no sooner had
they obtained that, which was the common design of them all, but
they fell out among themselves about their particular ends: and
when they had pulled down that, which they maliciously termed
<hi>Babylon,</hi> the English <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> their language was so divided, that
they could none of them build up a <hi>Babel</hi> of their own. For the
same Arguments, which the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Party had fiercely used
against the <hi>Bishops,</hi> were by the <hi>Independents</hi> unanswerably ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
against themselves: and then there succeeded more subdivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
the <hi>Baptized Churches</hi> got up and bore sway; the <hi>Fift-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi>-men
made a bustle for the Rule; then at last arose the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:105963:15"/>
a spreading Party, and feared by all the rest. What should I
speak for <hi>Free-willers, Ranters, Bedel's</hi> Followers and <hi>Naylor's</hi> crew?
it shames me thus to discover the nakedness of my Country; but it
grieves me more, to think, these pretences are still on foot, and most
of the Parties still owning themselves in their distinctions: who,
though, in the general, as <hi>Sects,</hi> and equally obnoxious to the Laws,
do by a kind of <hi>Syncretism</hi> unite; yet, had any one of them power
in their hand, would be far enough from looking on the rest, that
dissent from them, as <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Companions,</hi> or shewing that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to any of them all, as the <hi>Church of England</hi> does now to them
all together. And so the case stood with their Fore-fathers at
<hi>Frankfort, Amsterdam,</hi> &amp;c. where, in opposition to our <hi>Liturgie</hi> and
<hi>Discipline,</hi> setting up purer <hi>Forms</hi> of their own, they could not agree;
but were so zealous in their divisions (though it highly concern'd
them, for credit of their new-found way and comfort of their exile,
to have held together) till at last the Son excommunicated the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and one Brother the other. So giddy and lost a thing <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
is, when 'tis once stept aside, and gone out of its way. I
could wish, the moderate and sober men amongst them would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
this; that, if God should, in his just Judgment to the Nation,
give them an opportunity of another tryal, they may easily, if not
blinded with self-conceit, fore-see the event, and in publick ruines
read afore-hand their own disappointments. But, they say, they
have no such designs; they are quiet and peaceable men, desire only
to <hi>seek</hi> and to <hi>serve</hi> God; but that some of unquiet fierce Spirits
amongst us will not let them alone: they intend no disturbance to
the <hi>Government,</hi> but the Government disturbs them, in their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Exercises and Meetings. The same Plea will serve for the worst
of Malefactors; that, if the <hi>Law</hi> would let them alone, they an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> very
quiet men: but, pray, who breaks the peace? he that looks after
the execution of the <hi>Laws,</hi> or he that disobeys them? he that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeys,
certainly is the <hi>Aggressor.</hi> I cannot say but <hi>Ishmael</hi> and his
Mother were hardly dealt with, and did suffer a kind of persecution;
and yet the Apostle tells us, that <hi>Ishmaels</hi> self was the <hi>Persecutor,</hi> for
but mocking of <hi>Isaac:</hi> but this, were it sport or contempt, reflecting
on the Heir of the Family, the Son of a Princess, (who in the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
is <hi>Ierusalem</hi> here) is interpreted <hi>Persecution;</hi> while the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of <hi>Ishmael</hi> is own'd as just punishment. And in like manner
'tis the <hi>Sects</hi> persecute the <hi>Church,</hi> by derisions and contempts; not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105963:15"/>
the <hi>Church,</hi> that persecutes them. But if they are so well inclin'd to
Peace, why then do they not do what they acknowledge may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
be done, and submit in those things, where their Conscience
may give them leave; <hi>i.e.</hi> in such things as God in his Word has
not forbidden? The Magistrate has bid them come to their <hi>Parish-Church;</hi>
bid men of my Order renounce the <hi>Covenant:</hi> God hath
no where commanded to the contrary. Why should not they come?
why should not we renounce? There can be no scruple in the case:
for in things, where God himself has given no order, we are to
obey the Magistrate, <hi>not only for Fear,</hi> but for <hi>Conscience sake.</hi> We
read, that our Saviour himself, kept the Feast of the <hi>Dedication,</hi>
though no where appointed by God himself, no where mention'd in
the Old Testament (an <hi>Apochryphal Feast)</hi> and taught daily in
the Temple and in their Synagogues; and that some of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
after the Ceremonies were dead and buried, came up to the
Temple still at the <hi>hour of Prayer:</hi> to set us an example, that in such
things, where there is no express command of God against them,
though there be no express command for them, we are to comply
with publick order and decent custom. If they would but do
thus ingenuously, there would be some likelihood of Peace. But
they would have the <hi>Church</hi> submit to them; and then all should
be well. Which of them? for they cannot all be comply'd with;
that's impossible: for to take in one, and leave out another, will be
the ground of further discontents; and to gather all at a cast into
the <hi>comprehension,</hi> would possibly be to please none of them, at least
to displease the better half. If they would but once agree among
themselves and say what they would have; they would then have
some fair pretence to be consider'd. But here's the misery on't:
'tis very hard for them themselves to define what will satisfie <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:</hi>
because that, being not engag'd upon certain Rules, may to
morrow judge that necessary, the necessity whereof to day it doth
not fore-see; and if any mens Consciences are to be satisfied thus
at random, the <hi>Church</hi> will never know, when it has done, but be
still to seek upon new emergencies. Whereas would they come to
some certainty of demands, wherein the whole party, in all its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisions,
would agree, they might the better be treated with:
there would be some hope in time of a good understanding. But
if their meaning is to be left to such a <hi>latitude,</hi> to do whatsoever
they shall upon occasion find agreeable to their <hi>Conscience, i.e.</hi> possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105963:16"/>
sometimes to their <hi>interest</hi> or <hi>humour</hi> to do: there's no body so
void of reason, but must needs see of how dangerous a consequence
it is to any Government, to leave any sort of men (whatsoever their
Principles be, be they never so honest) to such a <hi>Liberty.</hi> And such
a <hi>Liberty,</hi> if they had it, would be so far from composing differences;
that those everlasting quarrels and irreconcileable animosities, they
have purely out of Conscience taken up one against another (which
are now, partly in kindness to the common cause they are engag'd
in, for the reputation of <hi>Schism;</hi> and partly for fear of the <hi>Laws,</hi>
smother'd and kept in) would then instantly break out with violence
into open flames: whilst some, sticking rigidly to those measures,
they have already attain'd, and comparing themselves with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
severely censure those, that, upon pretence of greater light
and more plentiful effusions of the Spirit, walk beyond their line
and rule: And those on the other hand priding themselves in their
Spiritual Priviledges, and the purity of Ordinances, despise their
Brethren, as carnal and narrow-spirited men, that still keep close to
outward forms, and walk according to the flesh, and the will of man,
in the beggerly rudiments of the world. Thus you see, if we do
not come to an agreement, as I do not see, how we ever shall (unless
authority interpose) in the exercise of <hi>Religion,</hi> the hearts of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish-men
are never like to be <hi>united,</hi> either in brotherly love to one
another, or in common affection to our Countrey: but that, the <hi>awe</hi>
and <hi>union</hi> of Religion being lost, the hazard of the <hi>Churches Peace</hi>
threatens disturbances <hi>also</hi> to the <hi>Civil State;</hi> which is our <hi>third</hi>
and last <hi>Argument,</hi> Taken from the particular constitution of our
<hi>Government,</hi> wherein the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> State are so nearly
united, that, like <hi>Hippocrates twins,</hi> they are both well or ill toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and run the same hazard of health, and must take share of the
same fortune: so that, who wishes well to the Government, to the
concerns of our <hi>Brethren and Companions,</hi> must by unavoidable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
favour the prosperity of the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prove this, I shall not pretend to the <hi>Law</hi> (though however
unkind <hi>Lawyers</hi> may be to the Churches interest in its <hi>Iurisdiction)</hi>
there's enough in the Law it self to this purpose; nor shall I quote
<hi>King Iames</hi> his Apophthegm, though he must be acknowledg'd a wise
man, and one that well understood the nature of Government; nor
shall I tell you out of our own Stories, that men of this Robe have
usually undergone the greatest Offices of State, and publick imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105963:16"/>
which 'tis very uncharitable wholly to impute to Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
ambition, and to allow nothing of merit in the case, upon
which those preferments and publick trusts were grounded; nor
what great benefactures some of them left behind them to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
from those secular advantages, they were assisted with; nor yet
shall I insist upon our own experience (an irrefragable proof) in the
late times; when the design seemed levell'd only at the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi>
but was carried on to the ruine of <hi>Monarchy</hi> it self, and the overthrow
of <hi>Prelacy</hi> was so zealously prosecuted, that they brought all <hi>Orders</hi>
into confusion, and <hi>Mar-prelate</hi> proved the <hi>Mar-all</hi> of the Nation.
And if we did not buy wit then, at a rate dear enough, we may, if
we please, make farther tryal to our greater cost.</p>
            <p>I shall only make a general Propose. That <hi>Magistracy</hi> and <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry</hi>
are the two <hi>Pillars</hi> and supports of <hi>Society,</hi> there's no body, I
think will deny; and if either of these <hi>Pillars</hi> fail, the whole Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
is in danger of falling: nor can publick order be secur'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the two Swords, the <hi>Sword of Iustice,</hi> and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Sword of the
Spirit,</hi> assist each the other in the administration of affairs, and in
the execution of their several off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s. Now for any man to take
upon him to be a <hi>Minister,</hi> or, if he be one, to exercise that Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
without the approbation and against the plain sense of the Law,
is as irrational and irregular a misdemeanour, and must needs be
of as dangerous a consequence to the publick, as for any man to
create himself a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> or to execute the office of a <hi>Magistrate</hi>
without Law. I say, for one, that has no Commission, or has been
put out of the <hi>Commission of Peace,</hi> to act notwithstanding, as a
<hi>Iustice</hi> (let him be as wise and as honest a man as he will) is sure a
high crime: I know not how the <hi>Law</hi> may call it. And it is the
very same, or worse, in the <hi>Ministry;</hi> because this office has a more
immediate influence on the <hi>Consciences</hi> of men, the most busie and
sturdy principle in humane Nature. 'Tis confest on all hands,
that a man cannot exercise the office of a <hi>Minister</hi> without a <hi>Call.</hi>
Let me ask then, whether theirs be an ordinary or extraordinary
<hi>Call?</hi> If <hi>extraordinary</hi> (by the way, 'tis <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> to say so) let
them make it appear by Miracles and Languages. If <hi>Ordinary,</hi>
certainly they knew afore-hand, before they came into <hi>Orders</hi> (for
to such I speak) what the legal constitution requires of them, is
their <hi>Canonical Obedience;</hi> if they did know this, and yet came with
a resolution to disobey; this is manifest <hi>prevarication:</hi> if they did
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105963:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not know, and their <hi>ignorance</hi> betray'd them into a snare; the
men are to be pitied, but their <hi>ignorance</hi> is by no means to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused:
if they knew it before, and were then satisfied, but have
been inlightned since, and changed their mind; they must know
too, that that power, which gives men in <hi>publick</hi> place leave to
<hi>act;</hi> may upon publick inconvenience suspend their acting; and if
then they do <hi>act,</hi> 'tis an unjustifiable <hi>disobedience.</hi> Nor is it with
them as it was with Saint <hi>Paul; Wo be unto me if I preach not the
Gospel:</hi> he had another kind of <hi>Call,</hi> but for these there's a <hi>Wo</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to them, if they do. 'Tis otherwise too, now the <hi>Church</hi>
is setled under <hi>Christian Magistrates,</hi> and govern'd by <hi>Christian
Laws,</hi> then at that time, when it was to be planted under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Heathen Emperours.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> now, with all her
subordinations and dependencies, in all her jurisdictions and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
owns the <hi>King</hi> her <hi>Supreme.</hi> She challenges nothing to her
self, but what the favour of her <hi>Prince,</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi> of the land
have allow'd her. Thus <hi>Bishops,</hi> as to the execution of their Office,
are sent by the <hi>King</hi> as Supreme, and act in their <hi>Courts</hi> by the
<hi>Kings</hi> power, as <hi>Civil Courts</hi> do: the <hi>King</hi> deputing <hi>Arch-Bishops,</hi>
and <hi>Bishops,</hi> to be Judges under him in causes <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and in his
name to govern the <hi>Ecclesiastical State;</hi> as he makes <hi>Lord Keepers,
Chief Iustices,</hi> and other <hi>Iudges</hi> of the Land. For had the <hi>Church</hi>
any power in it self in <hi>Civil affairs,</hi> besides what the <hi>Laws</hi> give her;
I dare say, there's ne're a <hi>Bishop</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> but would speedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
those scandals and grievances, possibly brought into their
Courts by <hi>Lay-Officers,</hi> which people so much clamour against. But
now what can they do? they are ty'd up by <hi>Law.</hi> All of us, that
are of the <hi>Clergy</hi> own the <hi>Civil Power,</hi> pay the same obedience to
the Laws, as any of you do; and in <hi>First-fruits, Tenths,</hi> and <hi>Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
make as chargable acknowledgments, as any of the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy.</p>
            <p>I know, 'tis said though; what need of such a pompous costly
Religion, of a <hi>Church</hi> with so great an allowance of means? This
ample Revenue exhausts and weakens the <hi>State:</hi> smaller <hi>stipends</hi>
would serve turn very well. But can any one, with any shew of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,
fairly reason against the encouragements of <hi>Learning,</hi> and
the rewards of desert? Let it be consider'd that several of this <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
had they gone another way, might (with submission I speak it)
have sate in <hi>your</hi> Seats, and been clad with <hi>your</hi> Purple. After all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105963:17"/>
our pains, and time, and strength, and charges too, spent in stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
do not think that what the <hi>Law</hi> allows us, we have by doing
nothing for it. These things are propos'd publickly as the Acquists
of Industry, and may be got and injoy'd, as legally, as any of your
Estates. And is it not fit, do you think, a <hi>National Church,</hi> wherein the
honour and reputation of Religion is to be kept up, should be secur'd
from poverty, and that contempt, which always accompanies
meanness? It were to be wish'd that, as <hi>Kings</hi> are to be the <hi>Nursing
Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> so <hi>Princes</hi> and the Sons of Nobles would fit
themselves for her dignities: that they might bear up the honour
of Religion with their personal attendence. It has been so hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when the two great Offices were united in the same person;
<hi>Melchisedek</hi> King of <hi>Salem,</hi> and Priest of the living God: and
they were kept pretty near in the persons of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
and the <hi>Priest</hi> elder brother to the <hi>Prince.</hi> And hence the

to shew too, that a Christian Magistrate, as such, has power to
order religious affairs, in the Service of God. This I say, has been, and
'twere well, if it could be so with us: however, must the Church alone
be held up by a precarious dependence? Is it not this, that makes
Religion a Prostitute to the humors of the people? when men of
mean spirits and parts shall, out of fear, comply, for a paltry live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood,
to preach things that may please; and others of ambitious
minds, and voluble tongues, to serve an interest, shall lead the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to their own hurt. But some will say; what would you have
men do, that are not otherwise considered? since there is that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
distribution of Church-favours, that some go away with all,
and others get little or nothing. Judge in your own case, whether
this be a reasonable ground of quarrel. Shall the inequality of
Estates amongst you make the meaner Citizens quarrel the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>City,</hi> because they have not all the wealth of <hi>Aldermen?</hi>
Shall I, or any of my <hi>brethren and companions,</hi> because we have not
that place and esteem in the <hi>Church,</hi> as we, out of the pride of our
own hearts may think we deserve, go in a sullen arrogance, and set
up for our selves in a distinct interest from the <hi>Church;</hi> and flye in
the face of our Mother, and put undutiful affronts upon her, for not
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105963:18"/>
being so kind, as we would have her? No. <hi>Gen. 49. 6. O my soul,
come not thou into such mens secret; unto their private assemblies, mine
honour, be not thou united. Let them</hi> for me <hi>be divided in Iacob, and
scattered in Israel;</hi> that, in their <hi>anger</hi> and <hi>self-will,</hi> practise such
things. To go on, I know it has been seriously discoursed, and
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inted too, that the largeness of the <hi>Church-revenue</hi> in any Nation
impoverishes the <hi>State,</hi> sets the people behind-hand, and puts them
out of a thriving condition: and no less then demonstration offered,
that, if it were retrenched, Trade would flourish, Manufactures and
growths receive wonderful improvements, and the people generally
grow rich apace. But to Answer that <hi>Author;</hi> those <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,</hi>
he speaks of, and ours are not alike, in the constitution and
nature of the Government; and God forbid, they ever should. But
it may be ones wonder, why our people cannot now, with much more
case, make those improvements; since the <hi>Church</hi> keeps little in her
own hands, and for the most part lets easie penny-worths: nor can
it be any reason, that the <hi>Church</hi> drains the peoples money; since,
if the <hi>Church</hi> had not what she has, some body else would in the
<hi>Churches</hi> right; nor would the people be much the better. How
our <hi>Neighbour-States</hi> order their <hi>Church</hi> affairs, I suppose, ought to
be no precedent of Policy to us: though they, to keep up a <hi>National
Religion,</hi> by which those, they admit into publick trust, are brought
to test; and, for the securing publick peace, amidst the differences
of Religion, maintain a <hi>standing Army;</hi> Further, why our dissenters
should not, upon their own bottoms, be <hi>comprehended</hi> within the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
settlement of the <hi>Church,</hi> they themselves give a very just occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
for the very best Party amongst them have such Principles of
Policy and Government, as are utterly inconsistent and incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
not only with any other <hi>Form,</hi> but with <hi>Monarchy</hi> it self; as hath
been clearly evidenced from their own writings and practices: and
others there are, that do, in effect, loosen the bands of all <hi>Society,</hi> by
excusing that duty, <hi>Servants</hi> owe to their <hi>Masters, Children</hi> to their
<hi>Parents, Wives</hi> to their <hi>Husbands,</hi> under a pretence of <hi>seeking God,</hi>
justifie disobedience by the <hi>Corban</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> and for any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of their Superiors, they like not, have a ready answer, that
they are <hi>to obey God rather than man:</hi> whereas, on the contrary, there
is no one thing, that the <hi>English Church</hi> does in her <hi>Doctrine</hi> more
positively affirm, or in her <hi>Offices</hi> more zealously express, then obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to Governors, and her duty to her <hi>Soveraign.</hi> To draw to an
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105963:18"/>
end in this Argument; some there are, that fear not to charge the
<hi>Church</hi> it self with <hi>Sacriledge;</hi> and truly I must grant, that Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
may be guilty, by imbezilling and mis-imploying Church-reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
which sure enough was mainly design'd for Pious Uses: but may
not a man, that faithfully serves the Publick in his place, have some
regard to himself too, in fair provisions for his own Family? The
Apostle tells us, that <hi>he, that does not, is worse then an Infidel.</hi> To
shut up all, and to drive this nail to the head; <hi>I do freely acknowledge,
that the</hi> Church <hi>never flourish'd more under</hi> Pagan <hi>Governments, then
when it was in the poorest condition for it's temporals; when it lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Pressures and Afflictions, and had the</hi> Heathen-State <hi>its Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But shall any <hi>Christian Magistrate</hi> now design the Perscution and
Ruine of the <hi>Church</hi> therefore? This were to Argue with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
<hi>Iulian,</hi> to strip Bishops and Priests of their lively-hood, and
to turn them out of all they have; that they may be poor in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their master's <hi>Example,</hi> and in obdedience to his <hi>command</hi> may
learn to contemn the World. But, thanked be God, we live not
now under <hi>Heathen Emperours</hi> and <hi>Pagan Governours:</hi> though, if we
did, it were our duty to pray for them, and to thank God for then
too, and to obey them in all lawful commands, and where we can
not safely obey, chearfully suffer for a good Conscience. Neither
is, nor ought the <hi>Church</hi> to be so now, as it was in the <hi>Primitive</hi>
times, before it was setled under Christian <hi>Magistrates;</hi> though then
too there was fair liberal allowance; and there's no Minister, we
have, but would be contented to Preach at the <hi>Primitive rates,</hi> were
our Auditors as free and open-handed, as they were then. In the
close of all, these sacred Morsels, though they may seem sweet, yet
leave gravel behind them: and this I dare boldly say, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the disrepute of Religion, amongst any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
is a certain token, and an infallible character of that People's
approaching Ruine;

Before I make an end, I think it necessary to take notice of an
<hi>Objection</hi> or two, which may seem to overthrow the purpose and
design of this whole Discourse. For though it hath already been
clear'd out of the Context, that by <hi>Ierusalem</hi> here must be meant the
<hi>Church;</hi> and that the <hi>Churches Peace,</hi> which for his <hi>Brethren</hi> and
<hi>Companions</hi> sakes <hi>David</hi> resolves to wish and endeavour, did consist
in that People's uniform Worship of God: as appears further by
that Churches sad experience, when <hi>Ieroboam</hi> drew off the <hi>Ten
Tribes</hi> from their Allegiance, and (which is reckon'd his great <hi>sin,
which he made the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>to sin)</hi> had, by setting up new
forms of Worship, made their return, as well to the Thrones of
<hi>David</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as to the Temple, impossible, and, by a subtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
of an establish'd <hi>Schism</hi> to render his <hi>Rebellion</hi> perpetually
successful, divided them from their brethren in <hi>Religion,</hi> and made
the breach irreconcileable; then by degrees the poor <hi>Samaritans</hi>
fell off into all kinds of Superstitions and Idolatries, <hi>the Statutes of
Omri and Ahab,</hi> and I know not what else gallymawfreys of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
and all this grounded on the fair pretence of that Precise
Sect, the <hi>Karaei,</hi> who would admit of nothing, in the Worship of
God, but what they found expresly commanded in the Law of
<hi>Moses.</hi> I say, though thus it stood with the <hi>Iewish Church;</hi> I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
an <hi>Objection</hi> may be made, that our case is much different from
theirs: for first, Theirs was but a <hi>Typical Ceremonial Service,</hi> which
in the <hi>Gospel state</hi> has no place; since our Worship now must be <hi>in
Spirit and in Truth:</hi> and then again, for these very <hi>Types</hi> and
<hi>Ceremonies</hi> they had a Divine <hi>Command,</hi> and were by strict precept
oblig'd to that uniform attendance upon the Temple; whereas such
a precept or <hi>command</hi> now we have none, to tye us up in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to any one form of Worship.</p>
            <p>To the first part of the <hi>Objection,</hi> that that was a <hi>Typical Service</hi>
in the <hi>Iewish Church;</hi> but that the Holy <hi>Iesus</hi> has to the <hi>Christian
Church</hi> brought <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> which do not tye us up to such
severe observances in external things, but have instated us into a
<hi>Liberty,</hi> wherein we are commanded <hi>to stand fast;</hi> and therefore we
are not to part with it upon any terms; I answer, that, though the
<hi>Ceremonies</hi> of that Religion be abolished, yet the <hi>substance</hi> of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
still in the <hi>Christian Church:</hi> for the <hi>shadow</hi> and the <hi>truth</hi>
were to answer one another; and those <hi>Types</hi> and representations
are therefore now to be made out answerably by us in real perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105963:19"/>
so that the <hi>Vniformity of Worship</hi> is as agreeable, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
more necessary, now to the <hi>Substance,</hi> as 'twas then to the <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dow;</hi>
and the obligation proportionably the same upon us, as upon
them. For though God did, by the death of his Son, rent the
vail of the Temple, and break down the <hi>Partition-wall,</hi> and so has
brought us <hi>Gentiles</hi> into the Fellowship of the <hi>Church;</hi> it was, that
we should in the same orderly manner serve him in <hi>substance,</hi> as
they did in <hi>Germony,</hi> and in suitable methods accomplish their
<hi>Types</hi> with the <hi>Truth</hi> of our services. They brought their Calves
and their Lambs to the <hi>Priest,</hi> and had them by his hand offered
in the Temple: <hi>Christian</hi> Religion has, for their <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi>
distinct orders likewise of <hi>Bishops, Priests,</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> and instead
of a <hi>Temple, Churches,</hi> where the People, by the Ministration of the
Priesthood, are to offer up their <hi>Prayers</hi> and their <hi>Praises,</hi> which are
our <hi>morning</hi> and <hi>evening Sacrifices.</hi> And thus for their <hi>Temple,</hi>
their <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> their <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> their <hi>Priesthood,</hi> and almost all consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<hi>Instances</hi> of their <hi>Worship,</hi> there is a perpetual uniform <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legy</hi>
throughout betwixt them and us. Only their Worship was
perform'd in the <hi>shadow</hi> of the <hi>Law;</hi> ours in the <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel:</hi>
and if this <hi>light</hi> proves to us <hi>darkness,</hi> how great will our <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
be? For alas! that <hi>liberty</hi> they talk of, and that <hi>light,</hi> which
so dazzles their eyes, that they cannot see their way, is quite mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by them. That <hi>light</hi> was indeed design'd, to lead them out of
the <hi>shadow;</hi> but not to lead them into the <hi>fire;</hi> for of that nature
all <hi>Schism</hi> and division is: and that <hi>liberty</hi> as it releas'd them from
the bondage of the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> so it doth not at all disoblige
them from the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> but rather engages them to it with
faster ties of gratitude. Now, as I take it, the <hi>Fifth Commandment,</hi>
which enjoyns obedience to the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> was never lookt upon
as a part of the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> but always accounted to have a
<hi>Moral</hi> and a perpetual indispensible obligation in it. And I must
assure them, that disobedience to a lawful Governour, in things not
simply in their own nature unlawful (as most of them confess our
<hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Rites</hi> to be) is a great sin and of dangerous consequence,
to their own Souls, as well as to the Peace of the <hi>Church.</hi> So
that that answer, they make the <hi>Magistrate</hi> in this case, is not
proper; that they are not <hi>free</hi> to obey him: for they are by
all Laws both of God and Man <hi>Free</hi> nay more, <hi>obliged</hi> and
bound to obey. Only let them, I advise, take heed of making
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105963:20"/>
that <hi>Liberty</hi> they pretend to, <hi>a Cloak of Maliciousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, as to what they say, that the <hi>Iews</hi> had a peremptory
<hi>command</hi> from God himself for their <hi>Vniformity;</hi> but we can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
no such for ours. I grant them, nor am I so fond to say, we
have an express <hi>command,</hi> set down in God's Word, for every rite
and usage, our <hi>Church</hi> has thought fit, for Decency and good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
to retain. Nor is it at all necessary, it should be so. No, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had they for all theirs; as appears by <hi>David</hi>'s and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
ordering the <hi>Quire</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> in the course of the Singers, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
forms of devotion, and prescribing them for publick use, and
instituting several other things, as occasion required, in that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
And the like may be said of <hi>Asa</hi> and <hi>Iosias</hi> their <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
And this those godly and wise Governours thought, they
might with a safe Conscience do, even in that service, which God
himself had appointed; and that Church was never in a more
flourishing condition, then it was then. And are they able now
to produce any reason, why we should not believe, the Governours
of our Church (of whom we own the <hi>King</hi> as Supreme) to have
the same power now, as they had then, upon the like occasions;
and that the People stand equally obliged to accept the Proposals
of publick Authority, in things of the same nature, that concern
the Worship of God. Especially, since <hi>Christ</hi> at his promulgation of
the Gospel, in his own person, took care only for the weightier
things, and left those of lesser alloy, which tend only to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
and beauty of the Church, not to the Essence of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to the care and prudence of the Apostles, and so from them to
others, their Successors, Governours of the Church; to order the
Affairs of each Church, as would be most expedient for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of each Church in its Plantation. And some of these <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
sure, if I understand any thing, have left not only <hi>commands,</hi>
but <hi>Examples</hi> behind them too, which reach our case. For what
means that, which is said of the Primitive Christians, that <hi>they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
together, and were all of one mind?</hi> They were not sure met,
some in one place, and some in another, in different forms to
exercise their Religion: one part kneeling, another standing, a
third sitting at the breaking of the bread. Let not such unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
thoughts enter into our hearts. What means the Apostle, when
he chides some, that <hi>sunk and withdrew from the Publick Assemblies,</hi>
as the manner of some was? but that he would have them keep
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105963:20"/>
close to an uniform Worship, and not separate, and set up for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in new fangle ways of their own. Indeed what mean those
many vehement perswasions to <hi>like-mindedness</hi> and <hi>brotherly love,</hi>
which we meet with every where in the Apostles writings; but
agreement in Religion? Since that love can be no way so well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest,
as in such an agreement; and upon tryal 'twill be found im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
it should be maintained and preserved amongst us other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
In a word, if that <hi>general Rule,</hi> the Apostle doth authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
set down, have not in it the force and purport of a <hi>Command;</hi>
I am to seek, what a <hi>Command</hi> is; <hi>Let every thing be done decently
and in order.</hi> And how in the same Church every one might have
<hi>liberty</hi> of his own Methods to serve God by, and yet the <hi>Decorum</hi> of
<hi>Religion,</hi> and the good <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> be nevertheless kept up;
I must confess, I am still further to seek for my understanding. In a
word; let them talk of <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> as they please: that cannot
reasonably by pretended, to justifie publick disorders in any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
State. This may be rational to suppose, that the several
<hi>Churches,</hi> according to the nature of their several constitutions, in
several Countries, were left to a liberty, upon prudential reasons,
to order their own affairs, to their own convenience, in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
whether in matters of Government, or Worship, or Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline:
keeping still to the Analogy of faith and sound doctrine, and
to the Rule of Gods Word. And hereupon it was, that the <hi>English
Church,</hi> when it threw off the tyrannous yoke of Popery as it did,
with prudent Zeal, and by publick Authority, reform the abuses and
corruptions of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and abolish all superstitious and idle <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;</hi>
so of them what were found not contrary to Scripture-rule,
and agreeable to primitive practice, it thought fit to retain, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and good order, in her <hi>Liturgie</hi> and <hi>Publick Service.</hi> And
though some were even then discontented, that no more was done;
and called for a farther <hi>Reformation;</hi> yet this was but according to
the <hi>British</hi> Proverb, which tells us, that <hi>the Saissons</hi> (so they call us)
<hi>never know, when a thing is well;</hi> but will be mending still, till they
mar all: as our late times plainly shew; when, under pretence of
reforming <hi>Religion,</hi> we had put our selves into the ready way of
losing it quite, and had scarce the face of a <hi>Church</hi> left amongst us.
Upon this ground <hi>Calvin</hi> himself (as judicious Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> tells us)
erected his Model at <hi>Geneva,</hi> applying himself to the exigents of that
time, and those people, he had to do with: though others since, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105963:21"/>
his first intention, have, with violent zeal, endeavoured to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that Form upon other Churches also, as matter of <hi>Conscience;</hi>
which was designed by him, meerly out of <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>convenience.</hi>
And no question, but <hi>Calvin</hi> might look upon <hi>Government,</hi> (though
he had for his own part as much Authority, as ever <hi>Bishop of Geneva</hi>
had; and <hi>Presbytery</hi> it self is little else then a multiplied <hi>Episcopacy,</hi>
setting up in every Parish a <hi>Diocesan)</hi> I say, he might probably look
upon <hi>Church-government,</hi> as an indifferent thing, as well as he did
upon the <hi>Lords day</hi> it self, which he was about (as <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of him) to have changed from <hi>Sunday</hi> to <hi>Thursday,</hi> for the
convenience of that people, in their marketings. Again, hereupon it
is, from this liberty, whereby the Churches may each order its own
affairs in <hi>Christian Policy,</hi> that the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> themselves,
though agreeing, as to the main, in doctrinals; yet in other things
differ so much among themselves: and yet with that fair regard
nevertheless, that, as all the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> abroad do highly
magnifie the constitution of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and approve her
Methods; as being the main Rampart and Bulwark against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish</hi>
Tyranny; So, on the other hand, the <hi>English Church</hi> is very
far from condemning them, for accommodating themselves to the
necessity of their conditions, but embraces them all with a hearty
friendship. And herein, I say, if I mistake not, lies the very <hi>ratio
formalis,</hi> the nature and extent of <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> so much talkt of;
that the several Churches indeed may, in <hi>externals</hi> and <hi>circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials,</hi>
square themselves to the necessity of times and places, and order
their affairs accordingly. But to say that every particular person or
party, in the same <hi>Church,</hi> has, by vertue of his Christianity, a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to disobey the publick Orders of that <hi>Church,</hi> whereof he is a
Member, and to serve God, as shall, notwithstanding those Orders,
seem good to that party or person, (for, as the <hi>Party</hi> breaks, it will
come to <hi>Persons</hi> at last:) to take <hi>Liberty</hi> (as I said before) in this
notion, is to make it but another name for confusion. Wherefore,
since <hi>Churches</hi> are now constituted, and 'tis clear, they are no more
to be under the peoples Government, then the <hi>Civil States</hi> are; but
that the ordering of both belongs to the <hi>Christian Magistrate</hi> as the
<hi>Guardian</hi> of <hi>both Tables; I</hi> say, since 'tis so, it necessarily follows,
that for any man to affirm, that, what the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> upon grave
deliberation, requires of us, in Gods publick Service, is an intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
imposition upon conscience; and that things <hi>indifferent,</hi> and in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105963:21"/>
their own nature lawful to be done, being once commanded and
recommended by lawful Authority, become <hi>eo nomine,</hi> upon that
very account, unlawful; is a most absurd defiance, and not to be
endured. For these are such <hi>Theses,</hi> as, although some have been
bold to publish them, and are still confident enough to act according
to them; yet have no footing, either in the Word of God, or in
right Reason, (upon which two, <hi>Societies</hi> are founded, and the right
of <hi>Government</hi> stands) as being destructive at once, not only to the
<hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> but to the purposes of the <hi>Civil Power</hi> too.</p>
            <p>That I may make all clear; I shall, to omit that of <hi>Korah,</hi> the Son
of <hi>Levi,</hi> who might possibly otherwise be lookt upon as a godly and
able man, as having a great opinion amongst the <hi>people,</hi> and an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in many of the <hi>Princes,</hi> and, for ought as we read, was guilty of
no other fault but <hi>Non-conformity</hi> and murmuring against <hi>Aaron,
Numb.</hi> 16. 11. Indeed <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> Lay-men, Sons of
<hi>Reuben,</hi> went further against <hi>Moses</hi> himself, in <hi>vers.</hi> 13, 14. though
these <hi>State-Reb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ls</hi> too, as well as that disobedient <hi>Levite,</hi> had the luck
upon the very morrow after that dreadful execution upon them, to
be esteemed at <hi>vers.</hi> 41. by all the Congregation, <hi>the people of the
Lord.</hi> Though this look too much like our case; yet, I say, to pass
it by; because that was a severe example, I shall give you two milder
instances; the one, in the Jewish <hi>Church,</hi> long before the building
of the Temple, that of <hi>Micah:</hi> the other, of a famous Christian
<hi>Church,</hi> planted by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that of the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Story of <hi>Micah</hi> is, that he made an <hi>Ephod</hi> and <hi>Teraphim</hi> and
consecrated one of his Sons to be his Priest, <hi>Iudg. 17. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> upon
which the remark is, in the next verse; that <hi>in those days there was no
King in Israel; but every man did that which was right in his own eyes,</hi>
Nor was the matter mended, when he got a young <hi>Levite</hi> to be his
Father and his Priest: for in the very beginning of the next <hi>Chapter,</hi>
'tis again said: <hi>In those days there was no King in Israel;</hi> so that 'tis
clear, that this is taxed as a scandal of those loose ungoverned times,
when there was no <hi>King;</hi> that any man should set up for himself a
private Form of Worship, to which it should seem the people of the
neighbour-houses resorted, <hi>Chap. 18. vers.</hi> 22. This practice then
of <hi>Micah's</hi> was a fault without doubt; which, had there been a <hi>King
in Israel,</hi> a lawful Authority in being, to have taken order about such
things, would not have been suffered.</p>
            <p>That of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> is yet more plausible, and yet not fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105963:22"/>
neither: they kept to their publick Ministers; yet, because they
prefer'd one to another, and some liked better of <hi>Pauls</hi> performance,
others of <hi>Apollo's,</hi> in the same common work; he taxes them of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality,
<hi>i. e.</hi> of <hi>Schism. 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 3. for so he gives the reason; <hi>For,</hi>
saith he, <hi>whereas there is among you envying and strife, and divisions
or factions, are not ye carnal? why?</hi> what <hi>factions</hi> or <hi>divisions</hi> are
these, he speaks of? he tells you, <hi>vers. 4. For while one saith, I am
of Paul; and another, I am of Apollo; are ye not carnal?</hi> and yet
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> were excellent Persons, both of them; not only Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
sound men, but men of eminent abilities both, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
graces. But <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> were but <hi>Ministers,</hi> as he
tells us in the <hi>next verse,</hi> that employed those gifts, and exercised
those graces for the Churches good, <hi>as the Lord giveth to every one.</hi> If
this be <hi>envying,</hi> and <hi>strife,</hi> and <hi>division</hi> or <hi>faction,</hi> what would <hi>Paul</hi>
have said of us? how <hi>carnal</hi> are we, who do not gad after the <hi>Pauls</hi>
and <hi>Apollos?</hi> I wish they were, for their own and their Hearers
sakes, all such, whom people now-a-days so eagerly follow; but
quite Kim-kam leave the regular Assemblies of <hi>Orthodox</hi> men, and
run a wildring after every <hi>Will-in-the-wisp,</hi> that comes in our way,
and have such persons in admiration, as are, many of them, neither
Orthodox nor able; and further, some of us take up dangerous
Principles at any rate, and exercise Religions of our own making,
in such a manner, as must needs in the end (might such things prevail
amongst us) prove destructive to <hi>Christianity</hi> it self.</p>
            <p>And thus I have answered that <hi>Objection</hi> at large, taking in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
Worship amongst the people, for the honour of God, the reputation
of Religion, and the safety of the Government: since we ought not
in stark <hi>Charity</hi> to suppose, but that they, who profess the worst of
Religions, do, in their conscience, and according to their Principles,
take it to be the best in the world. I hope there's no one in this
<hi>Assembly,</hi> will make so uncharitable a reflection upon my Discourse,
as to imagine, that has been the drift of it, to countenance the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
practices and cruel persecutions, used, either in the Popes Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105963:22"/>
or the Grand Signor's Territories. Far be it from me
to plead the cause, either of the one or of the other. Yet I do
in my <hi>Conscience</hi> think, that some of those the most violent <hi>Princes</hi>
of either Religion, that have been the most zealous <hi>Persecuters,</hi>
were in their <hi>Conscience</hi> perswaded, that they were in the right.
You'l say, that's fair for me to grant: Our Saviour says the same;
<hi>they shall kill you, and think they do God good service</hi> by so doing:
and yet I say Positively, and I would have it taken notice of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it may concern some, who may think themselves far enough
from being in the same form with <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Papists;</hi> I do Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
say, that this their acting according to their Conscience
will by no means excuse them. For my proof, I have both the
great Apostles <hi>Rule</hi> and his <hi>Example</hi> too. His <hi>Rule</hi> is set down,
<hi>Gal. 4. 18. It is good to be zealously affected, always in a good thing.</hi>
The <hi>case,</hi> he brings it upon, is not so clear; I suppose upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of some false Teachers, which endeavour'd to alienate them
from that Doctrine, which he had taught them, and to withdraw
them from the <hi>Church</hi> for their own advantage; and this with a
great shew of zeal, in the fore-going verse: <hi>They zealously affect
you</hi> (says he) <hi>but not well: yea they would exclude you:</hi> or, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reading, <hi>they would exclude us, that you might affect them.</hi>
I wish our People would beware of such, who with a great deal
of zealous affection carry on their own designs. But whatever
the particular case was, the <hi>Rule</hi> will hold in general. 'Tis good
to be zealous, if a man's cause be good, and if the man be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd,
his cause is so. Otherwise <hi>Zeal</hi> without knowledge, or
in a wrong cause, is a ridiculous and mischievous thing; and is
upon this score reckoned amongst <hi>the works of the flesh.</hi> And thus
is it with those Idolatrous People, who, the more zealous they
are, the more they have to answer. I confess 'tis a sad thing, for
any man to have an erring guide to follow; I mean an errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Conscience.</hi> For which way soever he take, either with or
against <hi>Conscience,</hi> he is concluded to an unavoidable necessity of
sinning; and I must acknowledge too, that 'tis safest to sin on
Conscience side; and yet the mistake of Conscience will not be a
sufficient plea for unjustifiable actions. And thus it was with
<hi>Paul,</hi> who, in the time of his <hi>Pharisaism,</hi> was a zealous Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and thought he did well; but after his Conversion, for that
very thing condemns himself, as the worst of sinners, and yet was
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105963:23"/>
no less zealous for the Religion he turn'd to. Now does his <hi>Zeal,</hi>
whilst he was a <hi>Pharisee,</hi> which was his great sin, make his <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Zeal</hi> e're a whit the less commendable? No sure. No more
does <hi>Nero</hi>'s or <hi>Dioclesian</hi>'s Persecutions of the <hi>Saints</hi> blemish any
<hi>Christian Magistrates</hi> severity, in defending the <hi>Faith</hi> against
<hi>Hereticks,</hi> or the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> against <hi>Sectaries. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>'s
killing of a Friend in his drink could be no Argument
against his putting a Traytor to death by sober advice; nor
could the execution of a <hi>Traytor</hi> excuse the murder of a <hi>Friend.</hi>
To retort it upon the Objectors: if they are so zealously affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that, rather then their conceits shall not carry, they will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the pulling down. <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> about their ears; let
any one judge, is not the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> whom God hath intrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the care of his <hi>Church,</hi> obliged to be as Zealous for the
preservation of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> in the vigorous defence of Truth
and Peace? To make a familiar instance: an honest man in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
shews a just courage in maintaining his right, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for it; whilst the injurious invader, let his courage be
what it will, is apprehended and deservedly punish'd by Law,
unless he grow too strong for the Law; and then that's a sad
case.</p>
            <p>I have done with the <hi>Arguments,</hi> wherein I could not but
think it my duty, as to plead the <hi>Churches Peace,</hi> so to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
her against <hi>Objections,</hi> which are usually made; and now
shall only desire, that, as you have hitherto attended me with
an obliging patience, so you will extend that patience a little
farther, whilst I make an earnest and affectionate Address to you,
in a short <hi>Application,</hi> with which I shall close all. Let me then
press it upon you, <hi>Right Honourable</hi> and <hi>Worshipful,</hi> the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates</hi>
and <hi>Patriots</hi> of this great <hi>City,</hi> and you worthy <hi>Citizens,</hi>
of what rank and degree soever, which hear me this day (and I
could wish, my voice could reach from one end of the <hi>City</hi> to
the other) that you will all of you put on Publick Spirits, and
lay to heart the concerns of your <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Companions,</hi> and

his Prayers and endeavours for the Prosperity of the <hi>English
Church,</hi> and the composure of our unnatural irreligious differences
in Religion. Your <hi>City</hi> is the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> the <hi>Royal
Seat</hi> of the <hi>Government,</hi> and the great <hi>Staple of Trade;</hi> which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105963:23"/>
spreads its universal influence into all parts of the Land; and

<hi>Iustice,</hi> which holds the ballance in all National dealings, 'tis
your <hi>mode of Religon</hi> here, that is follow'd every where; yonr
fashions of serving God, that are taken up and <hi>retayl'd</hi> into the
Countrey. The union of this <hi>City</hi> would unite us all. O do
not be wanting to so Pious, so Necessary, so Charitable a Work.
If you have any regard to <hi>God's Honour</hi> amongst us, if any care
of <hi>Religion,</hi> if any love to your Native Countrey and the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
you live under; if any kindness to your own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and Families, to your Wives and little ones, to your
Friends and Relations; if you have any hopes left, after all those
heavy <hi>Iudgments</hi> that have gone over you, of enjoying <hi>Peace</hi>
and <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Plenty</hi> in your new dwellings; if all these
dear concerns do, as I know they needs must, lye near your
hearts; act then in the name of God, for his sake and your
own, in a full and vigorous sense of these things, and study the
<hi>Churches Peace,</hi> which is to secure them all to you by your
unanimous Agreement in God's Worship and Service. Your
publick <hi>Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Regulation of Trade,</hi> and <hi>Reformation of
Abuses</hi> in <hi>Civil</hi> Affairs, and the prudent and vigilant admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> are things make you wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
spoken of: but if this be all, if there be not a like <hi>zeal</hi>
for <hi>Gods House,</hi> and the cause of <hi>Religion,</hi> we may say, as he
did, <hi>Arcem perdimus, dum castella defendimus;</hi> We have lost
the main sort of our happiness, the <hi>Churches Peace;</hi> while we
take care of the out-works, things less considerable. Pardon
me; 'Tis not flattery, will uphold a <hi>Government.</hi> I speak it
out of hearty affection to my <hi>Countrey,</hi> and a due respect to this
famous <hi>City.</hi> My heart bleeds within me, and my bowels earn,
to think, in what a posture our <hi>Ierusalem</hi> now stands. You
are very now building in the Flames; they have seiz'd your
<hi>Suburbs,</hi> and are got within your <hi>Gates,</hi> and are smothering
in the midst of your <hi>Ruines.</hi> Let us do, as is usual, when a Fire
breaks out: every one bring his Bucket, and help to quench:
unless such a <hi>Stupor</hi> and unactive astonishment hath overtaken us,
as did in the late <hi>Conflagration,</hi> and we tamely give up all to
the Fury of the Merciless Element. And this sure is the far
more deplorable <hi>Fire</hi> of the two, as laying wast the Consciences
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105963:24"/>
of men, and burning up our main strengths and greatest orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and laying us open to dismal expectations. I pray read
the 28. of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and apply it to our case; that, <hi>if they
did not observe the Commandments and Statutes, God appointed
them to walk in,</hi> (by which was not meant the <hi>Moral</hi> Law alone,
for that has an equal obligation upon all mankind; but those
<hi>National</hi> rules and institutions, by which they were made a <hi>People</hi>
and a <hi>Church)</hi> they should be <hi>cursed in the City, and cursed in
the Field; they should build Houses, and not dwell in them; they
should be pursu'd with Plagues, and at last given up to the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of Forreiners, and pluckt off from the Laud of their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</hi>
What then can we look for at last, after so many me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
God has lost upon us, after so many <hi>praeludia</hi> of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
but some determining exterminating Judgment? But
God forbid! I have some hopes still of Gods mercy to this our
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and his pity to her, as she lies in her dust. Nor is
the thing it self, I am perswaded, past remedy, were it apply'd
to, and we would take Saint <hi>Iude</hi>'s advice, <hi>Iude 19, 20, 21, 22,
23. verses,</hi> where he tells us of those, that <hi>separate themselves;
that,</hi> for all their pretences, <hi>have not the Spirit. But ye Beloved,</hi>
(says he) <hi>building up your selves on your most holy Faith, praying
in the Holy Ghost,</hi> (which may most certainly be done in the
publick wholsome forms of <hi>Church-Devotion) Keep your selves in
the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Iesus Christ
unto eternal life. And of some have compassion, making a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
and others save with fear,</hi> his meaning i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, by rugged
means; <hi>pulling them out of the Fire.</hi> This <hi>Schism</hi> then and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi>
is a <hi>Fire,</hi> in the Apostles Language; and some are to
be <hi>pull'd out</hi> of it by force. The ingenuous will be sham'd, the
meek will be convinc'd, the considering will be reason'd out of
it; but some there are, it seems, must be roughly dealt with;
and aw'd by Authority. Let us, like <hi>Brethren and Companions,</hi> take
up the business between our selves. Come; We are <hi>Men.</hi> 'Tis the
priviledge of the blessed <hi>Angels</hi> to be free from errour; but the
infirmity of <hi>humane</hi> nature to commit mistakes; to persist in
errours though, even to publick mischief, is the character of the
<hi>Devil's</hi> pride and malice; but to return and repent, is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the <hi>Saints</hi> of God. Why should any one of us be asham'd
of that which is his glory, and will be his Eternal comfort?
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105963:24"/>
We are <hi>Brethren and Friends;</hi> we live under the same Laws,
and profess the same <hi>Gospel of Peace;</hi> why should we disagree,
and fall out in our greatest concern, and quarrel one another into
common Ruine? <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is the mother of us all; let not us
by our Divisions make her a <hi>Samaria,</hi> a Seminary of <hi>Sects</hi> and
<hi>Factions:</hi> let us not make our <hi>Mother</hi> a harlot. What have we
to do with the Statutes of <hi>Omri</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> and the sin of usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Ieroboam,</hi> which he caused <hi>Israel</hi> to sin? They are dead and
gone, and let their <hi>Statutes</hi> dye with them. You are <hi>Citizens
of London,</hi> a People of great Credit and Reputation all the
World over, for your Prudence and good Government, for your
vast Trade and Dealings; and you are allied to most of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Families of the Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let it not be said of you;
that you are grown weak and mean, a fluttering and unsteady Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
that you have quit your establishments, and are perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to seek for your <hi>Religion,</hi> and are ready like Children in
your streets, to be caught up by every Spirit, and to run after
any one, that pretends to be a Guide. <hi>London,</hi> an Ancient and
Noble <hi>Mart,</hi> long talkt of in the world, before ever there was
<hi>Dam</hi> or <hi>Dike</hi> in <hi>Holland;</hi> let it not truckle under <hi>Amsterdam,</hi>
and be made a Magazine of Opinions, and new fangled <hi>Religions.</hi>
For shame do not justifie that advantage, the Enemies of our
<hi>Church</hi> have taken from 666. to clap the name of <hi>Babylon</hi> upon
your <hi>City;</hi> but wipe off the reproach, and fling it back into the
face of them, as they deserve it; by uniting all, as one man, in
the service and worship of God, and in the common defence of
the <hi>Protestant</hi> cause. And then, when you are thus agreed,
when your minds are as <hi>uniform,</hi> as your buildings are
like to be; then <hi>shall ye be blessed in the City, and blessed shall
ye be in the Field; blessed shall be your Basket and your Store:
then the Lord shall establish you a holy people unto himself; and all
people shall see, that ye are call'd by his name, and they shall be
afraid of you. Then the Lord shall open unto you his good treasure,
and shall make you plenteous in goods; and he shall command the
blessing upon you, in your Store-houses, and in all that you set your
hands unto.</hi> And then, when <hi>your Example,</hi> has prevail'd with
the rest of the <hi>Nation</hi> (as it will in a very short time) that having
our hearts united in God's fear, and laying aside all animosities
and unnecessary quarrels, we may serve him with one heart and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105963:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with one shoulder, and with one voice confess his holy name and
his word, and, being like-minded, we may unanimously seek
those things, which tend to publick peace, and to the good of
community; Then, when we are thus united, all other disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
will easily be regulated, all grievances redrest, and all scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
remov'd, to the honour of the Government, and the welfare
of the People; <hi>Then shall the Earth bring forth her increase, and
God, even our own God, shall give us his blessing:</hi> Then shall we see
both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> once more in a flourishing condition:
when God shall make all our Officers righteousness, and with his
favour shall encompass us, as with a shield: Then shall this <hi>float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Island</hi> be setled upon sure and lasting grounds; Then shall
<hi>Albion</hi> again be the praise and terrour of the Nations, nor shall
her white cliffs, or her wooden walls, or the embraces of her
beloved Ocean, so much secure her, as the <hi>Divine</hi> protection, and
agreement of her <hi>Inhabitants:</hi> Which God in his good time, of his
Infinite Mercy, grant, for his <hi>Churches,</hi> and <hi>for our Brethren and
Companions sake.</hi> Amen, Amen.</p>
