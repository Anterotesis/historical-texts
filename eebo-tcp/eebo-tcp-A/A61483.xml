         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
ARTICLES
Recommended by the
ARCH-BISHOP of CANTERBVRY
To all the Bishops within his Metropolitan Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
<date>the 16th of July, 1688.</date>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YEsterday the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
the <hi>Articles</hi> which I send you inclosed,
to those <hi>Bishops</hi> who are at present in this
place; and ordered <hi>Copies</hi> of them to be likewise
sent in his Name to the absent <hi>Bishops.</hi> By the
Contents of them, you will see that the Storm in
which he is, does not frighten him from doing his
Duty; but rather awakens him to do it with so
much the more vigour: and indeed, the <hi>Zeal</hi> that
he expresses in these <hi>Articles,</hi> both against the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions</hi>
of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> on the one hand,
and the unhappy <hi>Differences</hi> that are among <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
on the other, are such Apostolical Things,
that all good Men rejoyce to see so great a <hi>Prelate</hi> at
the Head of our <hi>Church,</hi> who in this Critical
Time has had the Courage to do his Duty in so sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
a manner. I am,</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>Sir,</salute>
               <signed>Yours.</signed>

            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:50635:2"/>
            <head>Some Heads of things to be more fully insisted
upon by the Bishops in their Addresses to the
Clergy and People of their respective Diocesses.</head>
            <p>I. THat the <hi>Clergy</hi> often read over the <hi>Forms</hi> of their <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
and seriously consider, what Solemn Vows and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
they made therein to God and his Church, together with
the several <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Subscriptions</hi> they have taken and made upon
divers Occasions.</p>
            <p>II. That in Compliance with those and other <hi>Obligations,</hi> they
be Active and Zealous in all the Parts and Instances of their <hi>Duty,</hi>
and especially strict and exact in all Holy <hi>Conversation,</hi> that so they
may become Examples to the Flock.</p>
            <p>III. To this end, that they be constantly <hi>Resident</hi> upon their <hi>Cures</hi>
in their Incumbent Houses; and keep sober Hospitality there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Ability.</p>
            <p>IV. That they diligently <hi>Catechise</hi> the Children and Youth of their
<hi>Parishes</hi> (as the <hi>Rubrick</hi> of the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book,</hi> and the 59th
<hi>Canon</hi> injoyn) and so prepare them to be brought in due time to
<hi>Confirmation,</hi> when there shall be Opportunity; and that they also
at the same time expound the Grounds of <hi>Religion</hi> and the Common
<hi>Christianity,</hi> in the Method of the <hi>Catechism,</hi> for the Instruction and
Benefit of the whole Parish, teaching them what they are to believe,
and what to do, and what to pray for; and particularly often
and earnestly inculcating upon the Importance and Obligation of
their Baptismal Vows.</p>
            <p>V. That they perform the Daily <hi>Office</hi> publickly (with all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
Affection and Gravity) in all <hi>Market</hi> and other Great
<hi>Towns,</hi> and even in <hi>Villages,</hi> and less populous <hi>Places,</hi> bring Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to <hi>Publick Prayers</hi> as frequently as may be; especially on such
Days and at such Times as the <hi>Rubrick</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> appointed on
<hi>Holy Days,</hi> and their <hi>Eves,</hi> on <hi>Ember</hi> and <hi>Rogation Days,</hi> on <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesdays</hi>
and <hi>Fridays</hi> in each Week, and especially in <hi>Advent</hi> and
<hi>Lent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VI. That they use their utmost Endeavour, both in their <hi>Sermons</hi>
and by <hi>Private Applications,</hi> to prevail with such of their Flock as
are of competent Age, to receive frequently the <hi>Holy Communion:</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50635:2"/>
and to this end, that they administer it in the greater Towns once
in every Month, and even in the lesser too, if <hi>Communicants</hi> may
be procured, or how-ever as often as they may: and that they
take all due Care, both by Preaching and otherwise, to prepare all
for the worthy receiving of it.</p>
            <p>VII. That in their <hi>Sermons</hi> they teach and inform their People
(four times a Year at the least, as what the <hi>Canon</hi> require) that
all <hi>Usurp'd</hi> and <hi>Foreign</hi> Jurisdiction is for most Just Causes taken
away and abolish'd in this <hi>Realm,</hi> and no manner of Obedience or
Subjection due to the same, or to any that pretend to act by virtue
of it: but that the King's Power being in his Dominions highest
under God, they upon all Occasions perswade the People to <hi>Loyalty</hi>
and <hi>Obedience</hi> to his <hi>Majesty</hi> in all things <hi>Lawful,</hi> and to patient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
in the rest; promoting (as far as in them lies) the publick
Peace and Quiet of the World.</p>
            <p>VIII. That they maintain fair Correspondence (full of the kindest
Respects of all sorts) with the <hi>Gentry</hi> and <hi>Persons</hi> of <hi>Quality</hi> in
their Neighbourhood, as being deeply sensible what reasonable
Assistance and Countenance this poor <hi>Church</hi> hath received from
them in her Necessities.</p>
            <p>IX. That they often exhort all those of our Communion, to
continue stedfast to the end in their most Holy Faith, and constant
to their Profession; and to that end, to take heed of all Seducers,
and especially of <hi>Popish Emissarics,</hi> who are now in great numbers
gone forth amongst them, and more busie and active than ever.
And that they take all occasions to convince our own Flock, that
'tis not enough for them to be Members of an <hi>Excellent Church,</hi>
rightly and duly Reformed, both in Faith and Worship, unless they
do also reform and amend their own Lives, and so order their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
in all things as becomes the Gospel of Christ.</p>
            <p>X. And forasmuch as those <hi>Romish Emissaries,</hi> like the Old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<hi>Insidiantur Calcaneo,</hi> are wont to be most busie and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to our People at the end of their Lives, labouring to unsettle
and perplex them in time of Sickness, and at the hour of Death;
that therefore all who have the Cure of Souls, be more especially
vigilant over them at that dangerous Season; that they stay not till
they be sent for, but enquire out the Sick in their respective Parishes,
and visit them frequently: that they examine them particularly
concerning the state of their Souls, and instruct them in their Duties,
and settle them in their Doubts, and comfort them in their Sorrows
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50635:3"/>
and Sufferings, and pray often with them and for them; and by
all the Methods which our Church prescribes, prepare them for the
due and worthy receiving of the Holy <hi>Eucharist,</hi> the Pledg of their
happy Resurrection: thus with their utmost Dilligence, watching
over every sheep within their Fold (especially in that critical Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
lest those <hi>Evening Wolves</hi> devour them.</p>
            <p>XI. That they also walk in Wisdom towards those that are <hi>not</hi> of
Our Communion: and if there be in their <hi>Parishes</hi> any such, that
they neglect not frequently to confer with them in the Spirit of
Meekness, seeking by all good Ways and Means to gain and win them
over to our Communion: More especially that they have a very
tender regard to our <hi>Brethren</hi> the <hi>Protestant Dissenters;</hi> that upon
occasion offered, they visit them at their Houses, and receive them
kindly at their own, and treat them fairly where-ever they meet
them, discoursing calmly and civilly with them; perswading them
(if it may be) to a full Compliance with our <hi>Church,</hi> or at least,
that whereto we have already attained, we may all walk by the same
Rule, and mind the same thing: And in order hereunto that they
take all Opportunities of assuring and convincing them, that the
<hi>Bishops</hi> of this <hi>Church</hi> are really and sincerely irreconcileable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the Errors, Superstitious, Idolatries and Tyrannies of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that the very unkind Jealousies, which some
have had of us to the contrary, were altogether groundless.</p>
            <p>And in the last place, that they warmly and most affectionately
exhort them, to joyn with us in daily fervent Prayer to the God of
Peace, for an Universal Blessed <hi>Union</hi> of all <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> both
at <hi>Home</hi> and <hi>Abroad,</hi> against our common Enemies, and that all they
who do confess the Holy Name of our dear Lord, and do agree
in the Truth of his Holy Word, may also meet in one Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and live in perfect Unity and Godly Love.</p>
