         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14525:4"/>
The first is, to prouoke, to challenge, to dare al learned men, to the combat. for would any man in his wittes, make such an offer, were he not moste assured of victory, and to triumphe ouer the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, that haue so often triumphed ouer others? The second is, with great sorrowe of sowle to lament, that he can get no answere to his bookes, and vtterly to dispaire euer to see any such thinge effectually attempted: an euident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, that they be of rare erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and truth in his side. The third is an inuection (if we liste to beleue him of his owne, as Thraso said in Terence) <note place="margin">Enuche.</note> and that is to ouerthrowe papistry, by papistry it self, and to ruine our saith, by the principal professors and patrons of our religion. Mary god blesse vs from this Bell, for neuer was there such à peale runge in our dayes, or in the dayes of our forefathers. The fourth and laste is, his saint-like protestation of sincerity, vpright dealinge, and ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dlinge al thinges accordinge to equitie and conscience. These be the mayne bulwarkes of his bookes, framed by this excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t engenite, both to defend them selues, and to batter vs: Al which not withstandinge, are

And I wil not deny, that he might with some pretie credit, haue tampered amonge litle ones, who are soone scandalized, but when wich phantastical conceit he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth, that he can contriue the ruine of gods Church, or confounde al learned Catholikes whatsoeuer. <hi>Sutor vltra crepidam</hi> the Cobler is beyond his shoe, and he doth walke (as the Prophet saith) <hi>in great and wonderful thinges aboue him self.</hi> His malice is great, but his power nothing <note place="margin">

Thus the minister braggeth &amp; braueth others to disputation, either by worde or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge, and like à desperate cowarde, feareth not to fight with any, prouided alwayes that they be far ynough of, and him self out of al daunger: and so he sheweth him self of as resolute a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as the coliar of Croidon, who litle fearinge the Maior of Londons authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, out with his purse, and like a liberall gentlman, gaue him that liuerie which would better haue beseemed some body els: but yet not before he was six miles out of towne. Yf he take him self for such à silogistical swashbuckler, that nothinge but present death, to approache the sphere of his disputant actiuitie, why did he neuer vouchsafe to visit Wisbiche, where he might haue wonne him self imortal fame, if he could by his learninge and force of arguments, either haue transformed them from Papistes to ministers (as by special reuelation he

               <p>This is the magnanimous spiritt of worthie Sir Thomas, or els why hath he not repaired to these places, where his longinge might haue bin satisfied: or if he desiered to manifest him self to the world, or to seeke for the common good of many, why did he not procure by that great grace &amp; fauour which his desartes hath purchased him in court, wherof <note place="margin">In the epistles dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey.</note> him self to his comfort, maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he might in publike audience, haue scufled with these ignorant Iesuits,

of myne owne knowledge that our consciences doe not condemne vs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe wee knowe that we are not able to performe as great a matter as that. To giue the more creditt to my wordes, and somwhat to reuiue his dead spiritts, I will here giue him a note of the nomber of the bookes, and their particular contents. They be in all Fiue, written againste his motiues, and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueye fiue yeares agoe. The first booke contayneth many of his notable vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, corruptions, and falsifications. The second presenteth a gallant and desperate fraye, betwixt the reformed minister of Bascall, and Thomas Bel preacher of the worde: all the clubbes in London being not able to part them. For such a grace he hath in writinge, that he falleth into grosse contradictions, and what he saieth in one place, not feldome he vnsaieth in another. The third handleth a couple more of extra. ordinary, and choice contradictions, worthie for their dignitie, to haue a speciall place by them selues. In the first (which hath diuers proofes) he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth him self, and his owne congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation (the defence whereof he hath
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14525:11"/>
vndertaken) for the maintayners of false, hereticall, and blasphemous doctrine. A pointe worthie to be considered of by his bretheren, for he giueth them moste iuste cause, to suspect him of playinge bootye, and that his hart is still an harbourer of Poperie, or at leaste not replenished with the liuely liquour of the new gospell: And though he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to purge him self of that suspition, <note place="margin">

Peter vvith a <hi>loquela tua te ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestum facit, thy speech doth bewraye thee.</hi> In the second (fortified also with diuers reasons) he acknowledgeth our faith (which with might and maine he would seeme to oppugne) to be the truth, and that very religion which Iesus Christ god &amp; man, brought from the bosome of his father, and planted in the worlde: so that the Protestants haue againe iuste cause to complaine of him (as <hi>Balec</hi> did <note place="margin">

And although what hitherto hath bin written, concerneth only his first two bookes, yet will I now take the paynes, to veiw ouer those also, which came out after: as that terrible tooth-lesse bitinge beagell, called the huntinge of the <hi>Romishe Fox:</hi> the naturall ympe of his motiues and Suruey, begotten by them in sinne and iniquitie: it resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth the parentes so liuelie, as though it had crept out of their mouthes: his

otherwise he would neuer haue smothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the wordes followinge, the witnesses of his false doctrine; nor euer haue giuen a false glose and translation, to those which he doth cite. The truth is this: Martin the fifth dispensed not with one, to marry his owne naturall and full sister, of the same father, and the same mother (as Belle ambleth in amplification, and troteth alyinge pace with out all modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) but only to continue still with hir with whome he had married, and with whom he had consummat matrimony, notwithstandinge he had before his mariage committed fornication with hir naturall sister: So that S.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14525:22"/>
those also that haue any skill in pewter, might haue espied the grosse vntruth, had he cited the whole sentence as it is in Antonius before alloadged: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to healpe out a lye, he ventured vpon corruption, and chopt away all those wordes which might haue marred the market of this Geneua marchant. For had one married his owne naturall sister, as Bell not so confidently as impudently affirmeth: then should it not haue bin truly said, that he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted fornication, but incest, a sinne distinct in nature, and far more odious in the sight of god: nether could the matter haue bin secret as Antonius saith it was, nor yet the seperation scandalous, but rather offensiue to haue suffered them to continue together in filthie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensed matrimony. To conclude therfore he had not dispensation in respect of his owne naturall sister, but to remaine still in matrimony with that woman, whose naturall sister he had before ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage carnally knowen.

Austen proueth the cleane contrarie. It is a constant doctrine with that holie father; that sinne is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie otherwise no sinne, and for as much as some dout might be made of originall sinne, because it seemeth wholy inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14525:23"/>
he affirmeth also that sinne to be voluntarie and so concludeth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all sinne to be so: Marry a man of the ministers learninge, may quicklie ouerthrowe vs with our owne Doctors, if by that rare skill which he hath in lyinge, when they say one thinge, he can without all blushinge maintayne them to say the contrarie.

newes of the ouerthrowe of this glorious Absalon, who hath as shamefully apostared from his vocation, and waged war against his mother the church, as euer did that graceles impe reuolte from his naturall alleigaunce, and tooke armes against his father the kinge: the mayne battayle heauenlie grace asistinge me shall with conuenient speede followe after. God that willeth not the death of a sinner, put into the hartes of all such Protestaunts as loue truth and detest falshoode: desier saluation with Christ and his Sanites, and tremble at eternall damnation with. the diuele and his angelles, carefully to seeke for the knowledg of the pure, auncient, and Aposto like faith, Zealously when it is found to keepe and imbrace it, and constantly to liue and dye in the profession of the same.
