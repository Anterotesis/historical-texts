         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:19266:5"/>
to correct vs for our ſins
alſo: and that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vs together with the

of afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The one nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth

vs: the one teacheth
vs to do the will of God,
the other maketh vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
our owne: both
equally effects of his loue.
For God humbleth vs by
afflictions, and pricketh
the ſwelling of our pride.
He cutteth &amp; loppeth vs,
to the end we may bring
forth the more fruite. He
filleth vs with bitterneſſe
in this life, to the end we
might long for the life to
come. For thoſe whom
<pb facs="tcp:19266:5"/>
God afflicteth grieuouſly
in this world, leaue it with
leſſe griefe. And indeed if
the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Iſrael, being
come out of Egypt, after
hauing endured there ſo
many afflictions, did not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
grieue, and
oftentimes mutined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
thither againe: how
much more had they grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
if they had ſuffered
nothing? Adde hereunto,
that God who hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
vs to feare him, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
that our prayers are
ſlacke and cold in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
as proceeding from a
ſpirit that is cooled by
ſucceſſe, and which are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited
by cuſtom. The cries
which our owne will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
are feeble, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
<pb facs="tcp:19266:6"/>
of thoſe which
griefe expreſſeth. There is
nothing ſo ſtrong as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie:
nothing ſo ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to pray well as ſorow,
which in an inſtant for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the ſloweſt tongues
to a holy eloquence, and
furniſheth vs with ſighes
which cannot be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
It is not then in anger
that God afflicteth vs; but
becauſe that ſinne is a kind
of falling ſickneſſe, God
ſtriketh and afflicteth vs
to awaken vs. His beatings
are fatherly corrections: if
he vſed vs otherwiſe, we
ſhould not be his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
For if a man ſeeing two
children a fighting, doe
chaſtiſe one for the ſame,
without touching the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb facs="tcp:19266:6"/>
the ſtanders by, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
further knowing him,
preſume that it is his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
ſo God correcteth as
his children thoſe which
he embraceth with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
loue.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 17.</note> 
               <hi>He beginneth
his chaſtiſings at his owne
houſe.</hi> Now if Ieſus Chriſt
(as ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>hath
learned obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce by the things
which he hath ſuffered,</hi>

much more ought wee to
bow downe our neckes
vnto Gods corrections, &amp;
humble our ſelues in his
preſence, rather then to
kicke againſt the prick, or
to make the afflictions
which are bitter enough
of themſelues, to be yet
more bitter by impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce?
<pb facs="tcp:19266:7"/>
None can make a white
haire become blacke with
all his care: but well may
he make his blacke haire
becom white through his
vnprofitable diſcontent. It
is euer better to follow,
then to be dragged on, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all when God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducteth
vs: for if the way
through which he leadeth
vs be thornie, yet is it
ſtraight.</p>
            <p>Now when I caſt mine
eye vpon all the remedies
of afflictions, I find there
are three things which
may aſſwage griefe; time,
reaſon, and the feare of
God. For length of time
mitigateth ſorow, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
vp the wound, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in the weakeſt ſpirits,
<pb facs="tcp:19266:7"/>
and moſt vncapable of
conſolation: but reaſon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemeth
this remedie too
long, and vnworthy of a
couragious man; for wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe
of weeping is a
poore remedie. The feare
of God doth more: for as
to appeaſe griefe, reaſon
ſtayeth not for time, ſo the
feare of God ſtayeth not
for reaſon; but before that
reaſon can bring in her
conſolations drawne from
the ineuitable neceſſitie of
euils, or from the vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe
of teares, that
reſolueth promptly vpon
the loue of God, who cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſeth
vs for our good: ſo
as in ſteed of caſting forth
complaints, it findeth out
occaſion of thankſgiuing,
<pb facs="tcp:19266:8"/>
and formeth not only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
patience, but alſo vnto
ioy, as acknowledging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
his afflictions cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ſignes of Gods loue.</p>
            <p>Theſe documents Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
are ſo much the
more familiar vnto you, as
you haue had often expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of them, and who
being paſt her appre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiſhip
in afflictions, haue careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſought out the lenitiues
which Gods word doth
furniſh vs withall: which,
beſides that ſobrietie and
modeſtie which ſhineth in
you, and hath altogether
eſtranged you from the
vanitie which now a daies
reigneth in the world,
haue taught you to ſolace
your ſelfe with God. But
<pb facs="tcp:19266:8"/>
take heed alſo leſt you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
your ſelfe to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with ſorow, and
make pietie the nurſe of
diſconte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Inueterat griefs
do often turne into habit,
and old wounds become
freſh with too much hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
which me thinks is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all verie vnfitting
your nature, whoſe meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and gentlenes ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
vnto all, is much more
at accord with ioy. Shall it
be ſaid, that the great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacity
of ſpirit which God
hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, ſerueth you
but to feele griefe more
ſenſibly? or that God hath
made you great, that your
teares might haue the
greater fall? Time which
eaſeth the moſt ignorant
<pb facs="tcp:19266:9"/>
people of their euils, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
it finiſh the ſighes of
a perſon whom God hath
ſo much enriched with his
knowledge? Shall it not
be better to ioy in future
good things, which are
great and certaine, then to
afflict our ſelues for euils
paſt, which are remediles?
Herein ſurely God is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
if in worldly croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
we find more occaſion
of griefe, then matter of
ioy in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly riches. And
wrongfully do we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of our afflictions;
ſeeing we hurt our ſelues,
we doe vnderhand as it
were confeſſe, that God
hath not afflicted vs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
The Pſalmiſt ſaith
indeed, that <hi>God putteth vp
<pb facs="tcp:19266:9"/>
our teares into his bottels,</hi> as
precious things: but he
ſpeaketh of teares bred of
repentance, or of griefe, to
ſee God blaſphemed and
deſpiſed amongſt men. For
God gathereth not vp ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate
tears, which exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
themſelues beyond
their limits, occupie the
time due to conſolation.
How many times (giuing
your ſelfe to reading) haue
you bedewed the holie
ſcripture with your teares,
and yet this booke contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the matter of our
ioy? And in the booke of
Pſalmes, the tunes wherof
you loue, and yet much
more the matter, where
you ſee your own picture,
and the anatomie of your

inward affections: Haue
you not obſerued that all
the Pſalmes which haue
their beginnings troubled,
and whoſe firſt lines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
nothing but profou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
ſighes and broken com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
do end in delight,
and termes which witnes
contentment and peace of
conſcience? Let your tears
Madame, be formed vpon
this example, and let them
end in ſpirituall ioy. Let
your faith raiſe her ſelfe
from vnder her burthen,
and let the ſluces of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
which God hath
ſtopped her courſe withal,
make her to runne forth
with the greater impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes:
let her take ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth
from reſiſtance. Hereunto
<pb facs="tcp:19266:10"/>
the meditation of Gods
graces will much ſerue

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terballance
with your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils,
they will mightily
weigh them downe. The
onely attention of future
glorie, which you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
by faith, can it not
digeſt all bitterneſſe? That
faith which filled the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
with ioy in the midſt
of their preſent torments,
may ſhe not in our reſt
comfort vs againſt the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
of paſſed euils. And
you who acknowledge
what ſeruitude thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
liue in, which are drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into perdition by the
inuiſible chaines of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and cuſtome: can you ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
magnifie the grace
<pb facs="tcp:19266:11"/>
which God hath giuen
you, in honoring you with
his alliance; and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
you with his truth?
Yea, and in your life time,
how many of Gods aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
how many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
happily ouergone?
God hauing giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you the
grace to be alone in your
family an example of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie
and holy perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in the profeſſion of
his truth, hauing made you
great, that in the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the world, you
might be an example of
firmeneſſe and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
And yet admit your
wounds were more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous,
as taking all at the
worſt, our liues being ſo
ſhort, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not long laſt:
<pb facs="tcp:19266:11"/>
for you are not troubled
to ſeeke conſolations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
death, ſeeing that
death it ſelfe is a conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
vnto vs. For God if
he receiue the ſighs which
wee powre foorth in our
praiers, much more regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
he the ſighes which
our ſoules giue vp vnto
him in our deaths. Which
being a place of ſhelter,
and which putteth our
ſoules into ſecuritie, we
ought not onely looke for
his coming, but euen go
forth to meete him: haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his comming by our
deſires, by the example of
<hi>S. Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 23.</note> who ſaith, that <hi>his

               <hi>O when

being bound vnto our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
by two bonds, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the one is naturall, and
the other voluntarie: if
through hatred and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of life preſent, we
vntie the voluntary bond,
waiting the time when
God ſhall breake the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
death then coming
ſhall find the buſineſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
and our ſoules prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

            <p>Theſe cogitations Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
and ſuch like, haue
hitherto giuen you conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:
the which although
you be ſufficiently proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

yet you borrow
<pb facs="tcp:19266:12"/>
from other the receipts;
and haue thought that I
could contribute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to your conſolation.
And to this effect hauing
heard talke of ſome of my
Sermons vpon the Loue
of God, you would needs
make vſe of the power
you haue ouer me, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them of me in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
knowing well, that
of the diſcontentments of
this life, there is no ſuch
gentle remouall as the
loue of God, or more
ſtronger remedy then that
he loueth vs. Herefrom I
drew backe a long time,
partly through idleneſſe
accompanied with ſome
other diſtractions: partly
through feare, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:19266:13"/>
your iudgement,
which far ſurpaſſing ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
ſpirits, feedeth it ſelf
not vpon vulgar meates.
At length, after long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
being not any longer
able to ſtriue againſt your

vnto me as ſo many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
I haue let

            <head>CHAP. I. Of true and falſe Loue.</head>
            <p>LOue is that point
of our ſpirites,
whereby ſhe ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
her ſelfe vnto ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.
That which is
weight in heauie things,
Loue is the verie ſame
in our ſoules. For as
weight moueth earthly
bodyes towardes the
place of their reſt, ſo
loue moueth our ſoules
towardes that obiect
which promiſeth reſt &amp;
contentment. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it followeth, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19266:17"/>
as heauie things doe
moue in a direct line to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the place of their
reſt; ſo if we will attaine
vnto any perfect repoſe,
our loue muſt go right,
and haue an equall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>1 True loue then is
that ſame,<note place="margin">Seuen rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to proue that the loue of God, is the onely true loue.</note> which giueth
reſt and contentment
vnto the ſoule; whereas
falſe loue is an irregular
agitation, and endleſſe
motion. Such is world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
loue, which we ſee to
be filled with vnquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and not to ſtay his
agitation, but through
weariſomneſſe or deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19266:17"/>
which is no reſt,
but an vnableneſſe to
moue, becauſe that
force failing, deſire doth
ſtill continue; like vnto a
tied horſe, which gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his bit. Such are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all men: they haue
many deſires, and little
power; they moſt deſire
that they can leaſt do:
neither being able to
obey or command their
couetouſnes. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
obey it, becauſe of
their weaknes; nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
it, becauſe of
their incontinencie. So
that if a man enioy,
without any let, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19266:18"/>
which he loueth, that
verie eaſineſſe it ſelfe
bringeth him a diſtaſt
withal. For worldly loue
is enflamed by reſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
and nouriſhed with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties:
like vnto thoſe
fiſhes which loue to be
in violent ſtreames and
floud-gates, but do die
in a ſtill water.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe,
is becauſe
that our loue chuſeth
falſe obiects, and which
cannot ſatisfy couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
For if you paſſe
your eie vpon all which
is beſt and moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
in the world, you
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19266:18"/>
ſhall not finde therein
any firme and ſtable
quiet, but a chaine of
cares linked together, a
web of perpetuall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.
The moſt graue
ſweetes are ſow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed in
bitternes. The atcheiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of riches, pleaſure
and honour, is painfull,
and many periſh in the
purſuite therof: the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
is vncertaine, but
the loſſe certaine. For if
theſe things leaue not vs
by ſome accident, we
ſhall leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by death.
Theſe are things which
are beſtowed not onely
vpon the wicked, but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19266:19"/>
euen becauſe they are
bad, as being rewards of
wickedneſſe. To expoſe
a mans loue towards
theſe things, is but a
purſuing of the winde,
and a perpetuall trauell.
For euen when theſe
things might be termed
alwaies good, yet are
they vncertaine. A man
cannot take good aime
at a flying fowle, nor
haue any aſſured de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignement,
aiming after
tranſitorie goods and
pleaſures. We muſt ſeek
our reſt then ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
where the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on earth,
and turne the edge of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19266:19"/>
our loue, towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
For euen as the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
part of the elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
region, is the ſeate
of windes, tempeſts and
earthquakes, but that
part towards heauen is
alwaies peaceable &amp; ſtil:
ſo our loue ſhall be euer
full of vnquietnes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
it ſetteth it ſelf vpon
baſe things; but it ſhall
find reſt if it raiſe it ſelfe
towards heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; Gods
promiſes. And for this
cauſe is it, that in the
middeſt of tempeſtuous
wether at ſea, the needle
of the Compaſſe remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
alwayes vnmoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19266:20"/>
and ſtayed vpon
one point, namely, be
cauſe it gouerneth it ſelf
by the Pole. In like ſort
the ſoule of a faithfull
Chriſtian, in the midſt
of the confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of this
world, &amp; moſt grieuous
afflictions, ſhall enioy a
moſt aſſured peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his loue aimeth at
heauen, and ſtayeth it
ſelfe vpon Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which is the true ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
of our loue, which
alone is to be chiefly
loued; which can make
vs louely in louing vs,
and which alone can,
yea will make them
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19266:20"/>
happie who loue them.
As the Apoſtle <hi>S. Paul</hi>
ſaith:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 9.</note> 
               <hi>The eie of man hath
not ſeene, his eares heard,
nor hath euer entred into
his hart, what things God
hath prepared for thoſe
which loue him.</hi> Alſo he
promiſeth in <hi>S. Iohn: To
come vnto him which lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 23.</note> 
               <hi>and to dwell
with him.</hi> Admirable
loue, which maketh our
ſoules to be the pallace
of the King of heauen,
and the ſanctuarie of his
Spirit.</p>
            <p>2 Philoſophie lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs hereunto at vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares:
for it hath for a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19266:21"/>
generall Maxime, that
God and nature make
nothing in vaine. Now
this infinit deſire, this vn
ſatiable appetite which
is in man, ſhould be
in vaine, if there were
not ſomething to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
it; which being not
found vpon earth, muſt
be ſought for in heauen,
and towards God, who
is infinite goodneſſe.</p>
            <p>3 Adde hereunto,
that God hauing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the world for mans
vſe, hath without all
doubt created man for
ſome better thing then
the world, to wit, for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19266:21"/>
God himſelfe.</p>
            <p>4 And that amongſt
all creatures, God hath
created man alone vnto
his Image, alone with
vpright ſtature, &amp; viſage
erected vpwards, to the
end he might loue him
whoſe reſemblance hee
beareth, and that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
and his loue might
aime at heauenly things.</p>
            <p>5 Adde we hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
that the perfection
of our ſpirits cannot be
but in the vnion with
the Chiefe of ſpirits,
which communicateth
his vertue vnto the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in like faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19266:22"/>
Sunne darteth out his
beames, that is, giueth it
in ſuch ſort, that it yet
dependeth vpon him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hauing giuen it.</p>
            <p>6 Moreouer, true loue
is that which transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the louer into the
thing beloued. Now if
a deformed man loue a
corporall beautie, neuer
ſhall hee by that loue
correct his owne imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
contrariwiſe, by
louing God, we become
like to him, and as the
Apoſtle ſaith in the 2.
Corinth. chap. 3. <hi>Behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as in a mirrour the
glorie of the Lord with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19266:22"/>
open face, we are changed
into the ſame image.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7 Finally, beauty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the firſt ſparke of
loue, we ſhall ſee hereby
how that which we call
loue, is not ſo, but only a
ſuperficial colour which
couereth filth; but that
light is true beautie.
God then being the firſt
light, &amp; father of lights,
is alſo the <hi>chiefe beautie,</hi>
and by conſequent hee
that we ought chiefly
to loue.</p>
            <p>Yet humane Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie
diſagreeth here in
one point from diuine,
which is the word of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19266:23"/>
God. For naturall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie
holdeth, that
naturall motion is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
better then that
which is againſt nature.
On the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of loue, the Scripture
teacheth vs, that the
loue contrarie vnto our
nature, is better then the
natural. For ſithence Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
by ſeducing <hi>Adam</hi>
hath disfigured the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God in man,
mans deſires haue tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
towards the world,
and in a maner our loue
hath bene fallen head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to earth. The affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19266:23"/>
of the fleſh are
enmity with God.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi>
8. If any one loue God,
it is not of his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but it is a gift of
God. Wherefore our
Lord Ieſus in the eight
of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſaith, that
<hi>none can come to him if
his Father draw him not,</hi>
And the Apoſtle <hi>S. Paul</hi>
pulling vs out of the
mire and thicke mud,
commandeth vs to <hi>ſeeke
the things which are on
high.</hi> Coloſſ. 3. ver. 1, 2.
For the ſaying of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<hi>S. Iohn</hi> is moſt
true, that <hi>we muſt loue
God becauſe he hath loued
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19266:24"/>
vs first.</hi> This is alſo one
of the effects of the loue
of God towards vs, to
wit,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3. 19.</note> 
               <hi>our loue towards
him.</hi> And there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that we ought to
demaund of God with
more feruencie, then to
haue the grace to loue
him: for this is vnto the
faithfull a witneſſe that
God loueth him: it is
the firſt effect of faith: it
is a moſt expreſſe trace
of Gods image: it is the
moſt liuely marke of
Gods children. This
loue is the ſoule of other
vertues, the rule of our
actions, the ſummary of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19266:24"/>
the law. This loue is the
vpholder of Martyrs,
the ladder of heauen,
the peace of conſcience:
yea, I dare ſay, it is a taſt
and a beginning of the
vnion and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which we ſhal haue
with God in heauen.
Our meditation cannot
chuſe a more excellent
ſubiect: for what is there
which is greater then
God, or more ſweete
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his loue? The profit
likewiſe is no leſſe then

This is true: but for all

borne a Grecian, and
not a Barbarian. 3. That
not onely ſo, but a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher

are inſtructed in a better
ſchoole, do otherwiſe
diſtribute our thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
and do praiſe him

That amongſt all his

amongſt all ſorts of men

3. That amongſt
thoſe which beare the

adde if you will the 4.
that he hath adopted &amp;
elected vs in his Sonne
before the foundation
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19266:31"/>
of the worlde: hauing
had care of vs not onely
before we were borne,
but euen before the
world was made. For if
a woman lately concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
loue her future
fruite, much more doth
ſhe ſo when it is borne
and embraced in her
armes: ſo if God loued
vs before wee had any
being, how much more
when we call vpon him
and loue him with a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liall
loue? Now in this
grace, the leſſe our num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is, the greater is our
priuiledge, the greater
his bountie and mercie
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19266:32"/>
towards vs, to be like a

God hath enuironed vs

               <p>All theſe graces de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
vpon one ſpeciall
grace, which is our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
with God
by the death of Ieſus
Chriſt; it is he that is the
conduit-pipe, through
which the graces of
God do flow vnto vs: it
is <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder, which
ioyneth earth vnto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
which ioineth man
againe with God. The
Angels aſcending this
ladder, do ſignifie our
prayers. The Angels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending,
ſignifie Gods
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19266:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bleſſings. <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſleeping
at the foote of this lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
repreſenteth the reſt
of our conſciences vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſhadow of his
interceſſion. For before,
on what ſide ſoeuer man
could turne his eyes, he
could ſee nothing but
matter of feare and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
If he looked
on God, he ſaw a conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
fire, and a ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
iuſtice armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſinners. If he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
on the law, hee ſaw
the ſentence of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation:
if on the
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he ſaid, I am ſhut
out thereof by my ſins:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19266:33"/>
if on the world, he ſaw
himſelfe fallen from the
empire he before had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the creatures: if on
himſelfe, he ſaw a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
corporall and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
infirmities. By the
ſignes in heauen, and
earthquakes, he was ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
with trembling and
feare: then Satan, death
and hell were the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
which either drew
him to perdition, or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
him with their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.
But now
each man which hath
an aſſured truſt in Ieſus
Chriſt, looketh on all
theſe things with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19266:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
eye, and ſingeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
ſong. If he looke
vpon God, he will ſay,
It is my Father, who
hath adopted me in his
Sonne. If he thinke on
the iudgement ſeate of
the laſt day, he will ſay,
My elder brother ſitteth
thereon, and he who is
my Iudge, is alſo my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate.
If he thinke on
the Angels, he will ſay,
Theſe are my keepers,
Pſal. 34. If he looke on
heauen, he will ſay, It is
my houſe. If he heare it
thunder from aboue, he
will ſay, It is my Fathers
voice. If he conſider the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19266:34"/>
law, he ſaith, The Sonne
of God hath fulfilled it
for me. If he be in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie
on earth, he will
ſay, God hath yet better
things for me in ſtore. If
he be in aduerſitie, he
wil ſay, Ieſus Chriſt hath
ſuffered much more
hereof for my ſake; God
exerciſeth me, proueth
me, or correcteth me, or
rather honoureth mee,
making me like vnto his
Sonne. If he thinke on
the diuell, death, or hell,
then he will triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
all, ſaying with the
Apoſtle, 1. Cor. 15. <hi>O
death, where is thy victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie?
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19266:35"/>
O graue where is thy
ſting? Thankes be to God
who hath giuen vs victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
through Ieſus Chriſt
our Lord.</hi> If theſe things
buzze and keepe a noiſe
like angrie waſpes, yet
haue they loſt their
ſting. If the old Serpent
pricke our heele, yet is
his head bruiſed. If the
diuell through perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
giue vs a falſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme,
yet belong we to
Ieſus Chriſt, who hath
bought vs, and none
ſhall ſnatch vs out of his
hand. Who wil feare ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
ſuch a patron, who
not onely maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19266:35"/>
for ſinners, but
of ſinners maketh them
iuſt? who not only plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
for a bad caſe, but
alſo of bad, maketh it
good, becauſe that hee
doth not only pray, but
alſo pay for vs: ſo that to
pardon vs is not onely a
worke of his mercie, but
alſo an effect of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
               <p>Theſe obligations vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the louing God, are
common vnto all the
faithfull. But I thinke, if
each one would looke
backe into the courſe of
his life, and call to mind
the time paſſed, there is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19266:36"/>
none of vs but ſhould
finde iuſt cauſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg

of the care and loue of
God towards vs: Of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerances
out of many
dangers, vnhoped for

afflictions, our
purpoſes croſſed, but
for our good, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
meanes to bring vs
vnto the knowledge of
his truth. Shall it be ſaid,
that the bleſſings of God
haue rained vpon the
ſands, without making
vs more fruitful of good
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19266:36"/>
works? Shall we be like
vnto beaſts, which drink
of the brooke without
thinking of the ſpring;
without raiſing vp our
thoughts vnto God the
wel-ſpring of all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing?</p>
               <p>Meane while, when
we ſay that God doth
vs good, to the end we
ſhould loue him: it is
not becauſe he hath any
need of our loue: but
becauſe he would ſaue
vs, he would that we
ſhould loue him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is impoſſible to
be ſaued whilſt we hate
him. Moreouer, our lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19266:37"/>
him alſo, is partly
his gift; for it is he which
kindleth his loue in vs.
God doth not only giue
vs his graces, but giueth
alſo grace to demaund
them, the hand to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
them, &amp; grace
to make good vſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
the vertue to glorifie
him for the ſame, in ſuch
ſort, as to acknowledge
that we owe vnto him
not only thoſe his good
things, but euen our
ſelues alſo. God doth
good vnto the vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
but he maketh them
worthy by this doing
them good: his ſpiritual
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19266:37"/>
graces being of ſuch na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as that they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
ſuch as receiue
them.</p>
               <p>This firſt degree of
loue being holy and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
is not for all that
any more then a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the loue of God
and as the firſt ſtroke of
true pietie. For he who
loueth God but for his
profite, is like vnto little
children, who ſay their
prayers that they may
breake their faſts: and to
ſpeake properly, they
loue not God but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
Such a loue, if it
extend it ſelfe no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19266:38"/>
is a mercenary loue,
yea and iniurious vnto
God. For it may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
thought, that the
end is better then thoſe
things which tend ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
If then the loue of
God haue no other end
but our owne profit, we
place the ſame aboue
God, and make our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt

the chiefeſt beautie:
<hi>He is the Father of lights,</hi>
ſaith <hi>S. Iames. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of light is in him,
and through his light we
ſee crearly,</hi> ſaith <hi>Dauid</hi> in
the 36. Pſalme. For this
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19266:41"/>
cauſe, when hee firſt ſet
his hand vnto the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he began with the
light, as a thing beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
his nature.
He is the Sunne of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice:
the Sunne which
ſetteth not, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
no ſhadow; vnto
which all things are
tranſparent: which not
onely enlighteneth the
eyes, but euen giueth
ſight. And iudge you
what this ſoueraigne
brightneſſe is,<note place="margin">Pſal. 146. 8</note> ſeeing
that <hi>the Scraphins ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

their wings,</hi> as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith,
being not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
ſo great a ſplendor.
For if at the glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition
of the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Ieſus Chriſt, the
Sunne ſhall be darkened
as ſome litle light at the
appearing of a greater,
what may be the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
of his Diuinitie?</p>
               <p>If you will conſider
the life of God,<note place="margin">The life of God.</note> ours is
but a ſhadow, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in compariſon.
For our life is a flowing
and ſucceſſion of parts:
but God poſſeſſeth his
life entirely at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
and all at once. He
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19266:42"/>
who wil know what the
life of God is in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of mans life, let
him compare the ſea
with ſome litle brooke.
1. The ſea is very great,
and the brooke very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
2. The ſea budgeth
not from his place, but
the brooke runneth ſtill
forth, and is alwayes a
new water. 3. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Sea come
from no other place; but
all running waters come
from the ſea, and return
thither. The like is the
life of God compared
with ours. 1. His life is
infinite, and ours verie
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19266:42"/>
ſhort. 2. His life conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
in reſt, and to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
all his life at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant:
but our life is a
fluxe, and ſucceſſion of
parts. 3. His life com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
from none other,
but our life commeth
from him, Acts 17. ver.
28. and returneth vnto
him againe, as <hi>Salomon</hi>
ſaith in the 12. of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtes:
The earth retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vnto the earth, as it
was before, and the ſpirit
vnto God which gaue it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gods knowledge is
alſo a bottomleſſe pit.<note place="margin">The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, what it is.</note>
He knoweth all things,
yea euen ſuch as are not.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19266:43"/>
Things paſſed, are not
paſſed vnto him: the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are preſent before
him. He ſoundeth the
heart: he ſeeth through
the cloake of hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.
We behold things
one after another, but
he ſeeth them all at one
view: as if a man were
all eye, and ſhould ſee
all that were about him
without turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
We ſee things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are: on the
contrarie, things are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
God ſeeth them.
For in God to ſee, is as
much as to will, and his
will is, to do. To know
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19266:43"/>
things, we looke vpon
them: but God to know
things, looketh on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
becauſe that in his
wiſedome hee hath the
models of all things, and
in his will the ſentence
of all chances.</p>
               <p>How admirable alſo

<hi>Behold, he hath no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

of holies, becauſe his

of all the Saints, as being
infinitely inferiour. The

loueth iuſtice and truth.
<hi>He hateth the workers of

Pſal. 5.</p>
               <p>What ſhall we ſay of
his goodneſſe,<note place="margin">His goodnes</note> through
which he loueth them
which hate him, by
which hee cauſeth his

euen into the

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19266:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Aboue all, this infinite

                  <note place="margin">Eſay 9.</note>
would make
himſelfe the Sonne of
man, to the end that we
might be children of
God: yea was content
to be borne in a ſtable,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19266:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the end that wee
might be receiued into
heauen; to be borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

Hee who is the

to ſtammer as a

wee might ſpeake vnto

who is the bread of life,

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19266:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Briefly, he who is

might make them of

matter of admiration,
and alſo no leſſe ſubiect

that grace which the

               <p>Now to what end
all this, but that wee
ſhould loue him who
hath ſo much loued vs,
and admire with ioy the

God, as thy greatneſſe
is incomprehenſible, ſo
alſo thy bountie is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite!
our ſpirits are ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
with this contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation;
our words are

and our thoughts yet
much lower then the

our praiſes do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19266:48"/>
thee, we draw the

vp our ſoules to thee:
and if our ſpirits be too

make our affections ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

who waſt pleaſed to be
our Father, touch our
hearts with a filiall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Thou which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt

thee, giue vs alſo the

much as we are poore in
meanes, ſo much are we
vncapable to receiue
them, and to loue thee
after hauing receiued
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19266:48"/>
them, if thou thy ſelfe
doeſt not plant thy loue
in vs.</p>
               <p>All theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
do raiſe vp our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
to loue God, not for
our ſelues, but for his
owne ſake: which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
alſo in this, that
our loue to God cannot
be well directed, if it be
not formed vpon the
modell of that loue
wherewith God hath
loued vs. Now God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs for the loue of
himſelfe, as he ſaith by
the mouth of <hi>Eſay:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſay 43.</note> 
                  <hi>It is
I, it is I, that blotteth out
thy ſinnes for mine owne

ſake.</hi> And it is the prayer
which <hi>Daniel</hi> maketh in
his ninth chapter, <hi>Lord
heare, Lord pardon, Lord
tarrie not, but haſten for
thine owne ſake; for thy
name hath bene called
vpon this citie, and vpon
thy people.</hi> God conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that we beare his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage:
hee conſidereth
that wee are vnworthy
of his grace, but that it is
a thing worthy of his
bountie, to do good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the vnworthy, and
which is more, to make
them worthy by doing
them good. He conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
that his Church
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19266:49"/>
is like vnto a flock which
carieth his name,<note place="margin">Oſea 2.</note> and is
called the people of
God; and therefore he
will not let it be Sathans

            </div>
            <div n="3" type="degree">
               <head>The third degree of the
loue of God.</head>
               <p>THe third degree
or ſtep, is ſo to
loue God aboue all
things; that we ſhould
loue nothing in the
world but for his ſake.
For example, there are
many perſons and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things in the world
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19266:50"/>
that wee cannot keepe
our ſelues from louing,
yea and it would be ill
done not to loue them.
So a father loueth his
children, a wife her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
our kindred, allies,
neighbours and friends
haue part in this amitie.
So a man loueth his
health, his houſe, his
land, his ſtudie, &amp;c. To
go about to diſpoſſeſſe a
man of the loue of theſe
things, would be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
doctrine, and
more then tending to
brutalitie. <hi>He is worſe
then an infidell that hath
not care of his familie,</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:19266:50"/>
ſaith the Apoſtle. Pietie
rooteth not out theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
but doth huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
them, and of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſſes
which they were,
maketh them but hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids
vnto the loue and
feare of the Lord. No
more then <hi>Ioſua</hi> would
kill the Gibeonites, but
ſubiected them vnto the
ſeruice of Gods houſe.
For then doth a father
loue his children as hee
ought, if in bringing
them vp, he purpoſe to
vſe them as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do yong
plants, which ſhall one
day bring forth fruite to
the glorie of God. If he
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19266:51"/>
ſo remember himſelf to
be their father, that he
be yet more mindfull
that God is his. Then a
man loueth his friends
as he ought, when he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
them becauſe they
loue God, and becauſe
hee ſeeth the image of
God ſhining in them.
So we ſhall then iuſtly
loue health, when wee
ſhall loue it, not becauſe
it is more gameſom and
without paine, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it bringeth vigour
vnto our bodies, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
vnto our mindes
to ſerue God in our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
The like ought
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19266:51"/>
to be ſaid of riches, of
honours, of knowledge,
things which one may
honeſtly loue; prouided
that their loue doe not
diſtract vs from the loue
of God, but may rather
thereto aduance &amp; help
vs to performe good
workes. And as there is
not any ſo little brooke
but it leadeth vnto the
ſea: ſo let theſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of God, ſeeme
they neuer ſo ſmal, leade
our thoughts to this
great depth of the
goodnes and greatneſſe
of God. Briefly, all our
liues and affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19266:52"/>
our neighbours,
ſhal be well ſquared out,
when they ſhal be bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
&amp; brooks of Gods
loue, and a reflection of
our ſight, which from
God glanceth vpon his
image. Neuer loue the
perſons for that which
is about them, but for
what is in them. Eſteem
not of men, as of purſes
for the money which is
therein. If you honour
a man becauſe he is well
clothed, by conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
ought we to ſalute ſattin
in whole peeces. If you
account of a man for his
honours ſake, you tie
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19266:52"/>
his dignitie to his titles
and to his habite: which
things being take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away,
there is no more of any
thing which ought to
be loued; as a horſe
which carieth an idoll,
which being take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away,
hath no more reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
done about him. On
the contrary, if you loue
a man becauſe he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
God, becauſe he is
firme in the faith, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the knowledge
of God, true in his
words, iuſt in his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
charitable towards
the afflicted, burning
with the zeale of Gods
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19266:53"/>
houſe, you ſhall neuer
want occaſion to loue
him. Take away from
him his goods, his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
yea his cloathes,
yea euen his bodie; all
theſe ornaments will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,
and that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
which conſiſteth
in the image of God,
and the graces of his
Spirit.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant,
that the ſecrets of mens
hearts are very deep; and
oftentimes the friends
which a man chuſeth
for vertuous, do becom
vicious, or elſe ſhew
they were neuer other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19266:53"/>
In this caſe the
man which loueth God,
ought to reprehend his
friend, and to reforme
him if he can poſſible.
Flatterie hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away
from true friendſhip all
his termes, except the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
to reprehend. To
be afraid to chide ones
friend, leſt wee ſhould
offend him, is a reſpect
full of crueltie: as if whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
hee were readie to be
drowned, thou ſhouldſt
feare to catch him by
the haire of the head,
leſt hee ſhould leeſe a
haire or two. If by theſe
reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſions thy friend
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19266:54"/>
do not ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of a man muſt then
giue place vnto Gods
loue. We muſt do like
<hi>Moſes,</hi> who made vſe
of his rod whileſt it was
a rod, but fled from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it when it became
a ſerpent. And yet in
this caſe it were better
to ſeparate our ſelues by
little and little, and to
vnſow friendſhip rather
then to teare it aſunder.</p>
               <p>Vnto all theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
the loue of God
ſerueth as a rule. Many
heathen haue gathered
a number of precepts of
friendſhip, but haue not
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19266:54"/>
diſcouered this ſecret,
which ruleth all their
rules, that is, to learne
firſt to loue God, and to
cauſe our friendſhips to
be deriued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his loue.
Such as the braine is
vnto the ſinewes, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
vnto the veines, and
the heart vnto the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that very ſame is the
loue of God vnto hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
friendſhips; that
is to ſay, they are but
threds and branches
which depend thereon.
This diuine loue not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therein, friendſhips
are no friendſhips, but a
conſpiration; an accord
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19266:55"/>
or agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to diſagree
with God: friendſhips
grounded vpon pleaſure
or vpon gaine, which
ceaſſe when pleaſures
leeſe their taſte through

or is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
diſtributed: but
friendſhips grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the loue of God, are
firme, becauſe they are
grounded vpon a ſure
foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Which loue
ought ſo far to aduance
it ſelfe, that for the loue
of God we ought not
onely to loue our
friends, but euen our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
becauſe God
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19266:55"/>
willeth it. Matth. 5. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that amongſt theſe

               <p>Here is the fourth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
or ſtep of loue, and
the higheſt that man
can reach vnto in this
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19266:57"/>
life. It was this degree of
loue, which made the
Apoſtle to crie out:<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Alas
miſerable man that I am,
who ſhall deliuer me from
the bodie of this death?</hi> It
was this degree of loue
which cauſed <hi>Dauid,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a ſcepter in his
hand, being vanquiſher
of his enemies, and filled
with earthly riches and
honor, to acknowledge
himſelfe but a ſtranger
and way faring man vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
earth.<note place="margin">Pſal. 39. &amp; 129.</note> It is this degree of
loue which hath ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Martyrs in their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the heate wherof
hath bene hoter then
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19266:58"/>
the heate of the fire: can
you think that they had
their muſcles of ſteele,
or bodies vncapable of
torment and paine? it is
not ſo. But as the heate
of a feauer drieth vp out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
vlcers, and a leſſer
heate is ſurmounted by
a greater: ſo the interior
heate of Gods loue did
ſurmount the heate of
the flame, and had more
ſtrength to ſuſtain them,
then paine had power to
preuaile againſt them.
Martyrs, whoſe vertues
do yet vnto this day ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine
our vices; whoſe
aſhes do yet heate our
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19266:58"/>
coldneſſe; whoſe bloud
doth yet crie, ſpeaking
both for the truth of the
Goſpell, and againſt our
ſlackneſſe, who in a litle
time are ſo farre degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from their conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
Surely if they do not
ſerue vs for an example,
they will ſerue vs for a
reproach and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>Now to come to this
degree of loue, we muſt
haue a long and hard
combat: for our fleſh is
rebellious &amp; mutinous,
and couetouſnes ſo roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
therein, that to pluck
it vp (as witneſſeth the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19266:59"/>
Son of God himſelfe)
is as if a man ſhould cut
off a hand,<note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> or plucke out

and the fleſh, betweene
the loue of God and the
loue of the world, hee
feeleth contrarie ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
and a maruellous
combat. How many

paſſe, that after the loue
of God hath had the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

be good, by and by his
deſires doe reaſſemble
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, &amp; giue a new
aſſault vnto the feare of
God? The faithful being
thus aſſailed, either with
ſome appetite of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
of rapine, or luſt,
ſhall feele this loue of
God ſpeaking thus vnto
him in his heart: Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
man, whither go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
thou? doth not God
ſee this? deſpiſeſt thou
his threatnings? reiecteſt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19266:60"/>

Wherfore wouldeſt
thou grieue the Spirit of
God? wherefore woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
thou bring a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall
vpon his Church?
Where are the promiſes
which thou haſt made
him? where is thy mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
of his benefits?
Is this the way to the
kingdome of heauen?
Art thou aſſured that
being fallen, thou ſhalt
riſe againe? For a little
pleaſure mingled with
bitterneſſe, wilt thou
trouble the peace of thy
conſcience? For a little
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19266:60"/>
porttage of herbes, wilt
thou neglect thy birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right?
At theſe ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the faithfull wil ſtay
himſelfe, he will ſigh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God; and like <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſon,</hi>

nor this rebellious fleſh
is not yet quelled. For
after theſe holy reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

Then the diuell

if he ſee vs idle, if we
haue diſcontinued prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
reading or hearing of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19266:61"/>
the word of God, then
our deſires doe rouſe
themſelues vp againe;
then the contrarie ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions
of the fleſh and
the ſpirit ſtruggle toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for maſterie: which
maketh the life of the
faithful oftentimes ſeem
bitter, euen to the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of death to end this
combat. O miſerable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

which troubleth
our beſt actions by bad

ſome euill. If we thinke
vpon death, our fleſh
ſuggeſteth vnto vs, that
there is yet time inough
to thinke thereon. If we
heare or reade the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of Gods word,
it perſwadeth vs that it

               <p>But becauſe this loue,

grow from the view &amp;

this our loue. Our bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eies ſee things by two

we ſee the bodies expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

receiuing into our eyes
the thing it ſelfe which
wee ſee: ſo wee ſee the
light, which wee ſee in
ſuch ſort as that it ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
euen into our eyes.
Now God who is the
chiefeſt of lights, will
make our ſoules to ſee
him in heauen in this
latter faſhion. <hi>For he
dwelleth in his Saints, and
is in them all in all.</hi> But in
this life he cauſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to be ſeene by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
that is, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of his works,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19266:65"/>
in which hee hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
a picture (as it
were) of himſelfe, and
the expreſſe markes of
his vertue. Therfore we
ſhal then ſee our God in
ſuch ſort as we now ſee
the light: but that now
we ſee it not but by the
windowes of the bodie,
that is, by the eyes: for
then wee ſhall receiue
throughout all our parts
the light of God, which
ſhall enlighten vs on all
ſides with the beames
of his holineſſe. Euen
as if a man were all eye

               <p>This ſame ſight of

            <p>3 <hi>The third is,</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie

that the loue of himſelfe

this loue for being weak,
ſhall not let to be true,

Let vs runne ouer

               <head>The firſt marke of Gods
Loue.</head>
               <p>THere are three ſorts
of loue:<note place="margin">That vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt loues muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed.</note> the one
whereof, is euer good:
the other is euer bad: the
third, good of his owne
nature, but accidentally
bad becauſe of our bad
diſpoſition. That which
is alwayes good, is the
loue of God, in which
it is impoſſible to ſinne
through exceſſe: and in
this point it is good to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19266:69"/>
let ſlip the reines of our
deſires. The meaſure of
louing God, is to loue
him without meaſure.
The loue which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
bad, is the loue of
murder, of theft, and of
vnchaſte pleaſures, &amp;c.
The loue which being
good of it owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
becometh euill
by accident, is the loue
of meate, of drinke, of
eaſe, or recreation; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
which are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
good and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
but which we make
to be bad by exceſſe and
intemperance.</p>
               <p>The loue of God doth
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19266:69"/>
diuerſly behaue it ſelfe
towards the other two
ſorts of loue. For it ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the latter within the
limits of mediocritie, &amp;
teacheth vs to ſatisfy our
neceſſitie, and not our
curioſitie. It reiecteth all
farre-fetched delicates,
being the diſtaſte of a
proud ſtomacke, which
awakeneth it ſelfe with
artificiall meanes: tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
vs to nouriſh this
bodie, ſo that it may not
be a hinderance to the
ſoule: to watch and be
ſober leſt we enter into
temptation. As for the
ſecond loue, it can in no
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19266:70"/>
wiſe remaine with the
loue of God: but the
feare of God doth who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cut it off, becauſe that
in a thing entirely bad,
we are not to ſeeke for
any mediocritie. None
can be a fornicator, an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer,
or a murderer
by meaſure; for the leaſt
inclination vnto theſe
things is ſinne againſt
God.</p>
               <p>But aboue all, the
ſtrength of Gods loue
is ſhewne in rooting out
of our hearts vnchaſte
loue, which kindleth in
the mindes of worldly
men a firebrand of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19266:70"/>
deſires, which defile
our ſoules with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
beaſtly thoughts,
and importunate; which
of our bodies dedicated
to be temples of God,
make an infectious bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thell,
and (as ſaith Saint
<hi>Paul</hi>) of the members
of Chriſt do make them
the members of a harlot.
Pleaſures which weaken
the bodie, coole the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and abate courage,
which after the ſtrength
is conſumed, leaue yet a
deſire. Infamous plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
which place men
beneath beaſts; of
which, man in this point
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:19266:71"/>
ought to learne the laws
of continencie and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie.
Traiterous plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
which embrace
men to ſtrangle them:
dally with him on the
lap of delight, as <hi>Dalilah</hi>
played with <hi>Sampſon,</hi>
that they may deliuer
him, not to the Philiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
but vnto the diuell;
who hauing poaked out
the ſinners eyes, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
leade him this way
vnto the temple of the

not enough, man hath
choſen out a painefull
way vnto his pleaſures;
they are not eſteemed
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19266:71"/>

               <p>The loue of God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring

doth preſently void out

A beautie which is not

without horror; but it is
a beautie which exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

the body, is but a flower
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19266:72"/>
which is withered with
age; but the beautie of
the ſoule is not ſubiect
vnto time; and which
is more, the wrinkles
which it hath, are done
out with time. Many
women might haue bin
more happie if they had
bene leſſe beautifull; for
their beautie hath plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
afflicted them:
but ſpirituall beautie is
alwayes accompanied
with Gods bleſſing. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
conſider atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely
the faireſt viſage
of the world, and you
will becom neuer a whit
the more faire your ſelf,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19266:73"/>
but ſhall rather ſeem the
fouler being neare it.
But carefully to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
a ſoule which
God hath embelliſhed
with vertue, will make
you become vertuous,
and will forme you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his example.
Carnall eyes perceiue
not this beautie, and
pleaſure knoweth not
what it is. For, as a horſe
louing a mare, thinketh
that in the world there
is no other beautie: ſo
the carnall and ſenſuall
man thinketh there is
no other beautie but
that which through the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:19266:73"/>
ſight toucheth his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.
But the view of the
faithfull pierceth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and oftentimes
cleane through a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
beáutie, ſeeth the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
image of the diuell.
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe, the inward
beauty is oftentimes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
an exteriour foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
as that of a ſlub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
diamond. As that
of Ieſus Chriſt during
his opprobrious hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
whereof <hi>Eſay</hi> in the
53. chap. ſaith, that there
was not in him either
forme or beautie: and
yet in the 45. Pſalme, he
is called the moſt faire
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19266:74"/>
amongſt the ſonnes of
men. As the beautie of
the Church, whereof it
is ſaid in the firſt of
Canticles, that ſhe is
browne, and yet faire;
being blacke without,
and burnt with afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
blot not out
her inward beautie.</p>
               <p>Therfore that women
curious of their beautie,
may rather ſtudie to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne
themſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
as it is ſaid in
the 45. Pſalm, <hi>The Kings
daughter is full of glorie
within:</hi> Let them take
heed leſt in decking arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19266:74"/>
their bodies,
they become a ſnare of
deſires, an inſtrument in
the diuels hand. A ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
hauing a ſword that
hath ſurely ſerued him
in many combats, will
be careful to ſcowre and
poliſh it: and doe wee
maruell if the woman
hauing ſerued Sathan to
ouerthrow <hi>Adam,</hi> be
carefully decked &amp; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed
by him; and
that women are ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in ornaments, by
the ſuggeſtion of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell?</p>
               <p>But we whom God
hath honored with his
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19266:75"/>
knowledge, to the end
we might be inflamed
with this loue, let vs ſhut
our eyes to theſe allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
poſſeſſing (as
ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) our veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels

from euill, but alſo from

of euill. Eſchue
idleneſſe, for it is the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

coming to aſſaile you,
find you euer occupied.
Flie bad companie, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
talke, books of loue;
for they are fire-brands
of luſt, the hookes and
baits of the diuel. None
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19266:75"/>
cometh to do euill but
by theſe acceſſaries, yea
the euill is alreadie in
theſe acceſſaries. Many
will ſay, that they are
chaſt of bodie, but their
eyes, their eares, and
their thoughts are cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of luſt. Yet Chriſt
ſaith, that he who loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
on his neighbours
wife to luſt after her,
hath already committed
adultery. The beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
and the beſt buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to diuert our minds
from this euill, is the
carefull reading of the
word of God ioyned
vnto prayer. Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:19266:76"/>
in the eight book
of his Confeſſions, cap.
8. &amp; 12. ſaith, that when
he was vpon termes of
rendering himſelfe a
Chriſtian, that which
moſt troubled him, was,
that hee muſt leaue his
fornication; and that in
this combatfull anguiſh,
hee withdrew himſelfe
into a garden, where
twice he heard the voice
of a child, as it were, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from the houſes
hard by, ſaying, <hi>Take
and reade.</hi> At this voice
he tooke the booke of
the Epiſtles of <hi>S. Paul,</hi>
and chanced at the firſt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:19266:76"/>
opening of the booke,
on this text of the 13.
chapter to the Romains,
where he ſaith: <hi>Let vs
walke honeſtlie as in the
day time, not in riot and
drunke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neſſe, not in cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering
and wantonneſſe,
neither in ſtrife or enuie;
but put you on the Lord
Ieſus Chriſt, and haue no
care of the fleſh to fulfil the
luſts thereof.</hi> There was
enough for him: and
thereupon, were it that
this voice came from
God, or that it chanced
by other meanes, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
to follow the
counſell of the Apoſtle,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19266:77"/>
who without looking
for any reuelation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
doth ſufficiently
manifeſt vnto vs the wil

For what euill ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:19266:77"/>
happeneth him who
loueth God, he wil euer
remember the ſentence
of the Apoſtle, Rom. 8.
<hi>That all things turne to
the best for them which
loue God.</hi> Euen their
croſſes becom bleſſings;
their bodily pouerty is a
ſpiritual diet vnto them;
their baniſhments teach
them to leaue the world:
their ſequeſtring from
honors is their approch
vnto God: their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

entrie into life, and a
bringing forth, by which
the ſoule is deliuered of
the bodie, as of her laſt
after-birth; and cometh
forth of a darke den, to
enter into Gods light.
The paſſage through af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
reſembleth the
paſſage of the red ſea;
for the wicked are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
therein, they
are vnto them forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of damnation; but
the faithfull and Gods
people finde that way a
paſſage vnto the land of
promiſe.</p>
               <p>This verie ſame loue
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:19266:78"/>
of God, will ſuggeſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the faithfull this
thought: Seeing that I
loue God, it is certaine
that he loueth me. For
Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> that <hi>we
loue him becauſe he loued
vs firſt.</hi> For I had not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
in me any incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to loue him; but
it was hee who louing
me, framed my heart to
loue him. Now if God
loue mee, he intendeth
my good; and he can do
all that he will, nothing
hapneth but according
to his will. He will not
then permit that any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
happen me; he will
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:19266:79"/>
turne my euils vnto
good for my ſaluation:
he will leade me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
through a way
thornie vnto fleſh, but
healthfull to my ſoule.
Briefly, the loue of God
excludeth feares, and is
the prop of our aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
as ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
Saint <hi>Iohn:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4 3.</note> 
                  <hi>There is
no feare in charitie, but
perfect charitie driueth
forth feare.</hi> This ſame
loue ſweetneth afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and maketh our
Lords yoake eaſie and
tollerable. For you ſhall
ſee by experience, that
in a houſe where loue
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:19266:79"/>
is great betweene the
husband and the wife,
they paſſe the bad time
ouer with content, and
haue mutuall conſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
one of another: yea, to
haue a faithfull friend,
into whoſe boſome you
may ſhed your teares,
and powre forth your
complaints, doth bring
a man much eaſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it bring no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.
How much more
ſhall the faithfull ſoule
find &amp; feele in the loue
of his God? of God,
who not onely know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
our euils, counteth
our ſighes, layeth vp our
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:19266:80"/>
teares in his veſſels; but
who can and will reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
them: and not onely
remedie them, but turne
them to good; giuing vs
in our afflictions, not
onely occaſion to ſuffer,
but euen matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing.
So the faithfull
ſpeake in the 46. Pſalm:
<hi>Let the waters of the ſea
make a noiſe, and let the
mountaines ſhake by the
riſing of his waues: in the
meane time the brookes of
the riuer ſhall reioyce the
city of God.</hi> Theſe troble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
waters are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
banded againſt God,
as is expounded in the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19266:80"/>
Apocalypſe, chapter 17.
Theſe brookes which in
the meane time do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
the holy citie, are
the inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Gods
word, whoſe voice is
our conſolation. For in
his afflictions the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
will turne aſide his
eyes from his enemies,
and from all ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and will ſay: Lord, it
is thou that haſt done it;
I receiue this affliction
at thy hand; make this
proue healthfull vnto
me, and permit not that
I euer come to murmur
againſt thee, or to kicke
againſt the pricke. We
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:19266:81"/>
ſwallow with the better
reſolution a bitter poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when it is preſented
vs by a friendly hand,
whoſe ignorance or falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
we feare not. We
finde all theſe things in
God, who moreouer
maketh venomes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to prooue good
medicines.</p>
               <p>So the loue of God
is a retraite and ſhelter
againſt all anguiſh: it is
the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of true peace:
it is the prop of our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance,
which cauſeth
vs to deſpiſe the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of men; to looke
on the enterpriſes of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:19266:81"/>
great men, and the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
of people with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine;
which cauſeth vs
to find eaſe on the rack,
and to looke on deaths
face with aſſurance, and
take off his maske to ſee
Ieſus Chriſt, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
vnto vs vnder that
ſhew: which maketh the
faithful to ſtand vpright
in the middeſt of the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines
of his country. This
holy loue made <hi>S. Paul</hi>
to ſay, Rom. 8. <hi>If God be
with vs, who ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vs? He which hath
not ſpared his owne Sonne,
but deliuered him ouer for
vs, how ſhall not he giue
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:19266:82"/>
vs all things with him?</hi>
Let vs likewiſe ſay, He
that laieth vp our teares,
wil not he gather vp our
prayers? He, without
whoſe prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce a ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
lighteth not on the
ground, wold he permit
that our ſoules ſhould
fall into hell for lacke of
caring for them? Hee
who extendeth his care
to gather vp our teares,
yea to count our haires,
how much more care
will hee haue of our
ſoules, for which his
Sonne hath died? This
ſame loue made <hi>Dauid</hi>
ſay, Pſal. 23. <hi>Euen when I
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:19266:82"/>
ſhould walke in the way
of the ſhadow of death, I
would feare none euill, for
thou art with me, thy rod
and ſtaffe do comfort me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereby we may iudge
what difference there is
betweene louing God
and men. Let vs not
ſpeake of the weakneſſe
of our friends to deliuer
vs, their little conſtancie
in their loue, yea and of
the cruel officiouſnes of
ſome friends, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to ſee their friends in
trouble, to make them
beholding vnto them
for ſuccouring them.
And let vs talke that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:19266:83"/>
which is beſt and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſt
in our friendſhips.
I ſay then, if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one who loueth a
douzen perſons faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
he muſt then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
be miſerable:
for it is a very likely mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that one of a douzen
perſons will euer be in
trouble, or ſicke, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.
If then a man
ſhall according to the
lawes of friendſhip par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
of his friends af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
ſhall he not by
hauing many friends, be
in perpetuall miſerie?<note place="margin">Loue is a thing full of care and feare.</note>
And if any one of them
be abſent, it is a ſubiect
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:19266:83"/>
of continuall apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
So that many are
of opinion, that to be
obdurate, and without
compaſſion, is commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.
Faithfull friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
are kindes of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
ingenious to
feare, and which from
diuers parts draw vnto
themſelues griefe and
compaſſion. The loue
of God hath none of
theſe inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities: for
we loue him for whom
we can be in no feare,
and who puts vs out of
all feare for our ſelues,
and warranteth vs from
all euill.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:19266:84"/>
Now if the loue of
God be ſo full of reſt, in

amongſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; how

               <p>Now if we ought to

               <p>This charity amongſt

man, if he take not away
the life of the poore by

ſuffereth him to wither
and drie away for lacke
of powring into him
ſome liberalitie.</p>
               <p>The roote of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
is the loue of God,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:19266:88"/>
which redounds vpon
his members: wherfore
alſo, as the loue of God
is free and voluntarie; ſo
alſo muſt not our almes
be forced or vnwillingly
done, but free and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie.
<hi>God loueth a
cheerfull giuer,</hi> 2. Cor. 9.
7. ſaith the Apoſtle Saint
<hi>Paul.</hi> And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
he calleth there in
that ſame place <hi>almeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds</hi>
a <hi>ſeede.</hi> A ſeed
which wee caſt in the
earth, but gather the
crop in heauen. Seeing
then wee muſt giue
cheerfully, it is here the
contrarie of that which
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:19266:89"/>
is ſaid in the 126. Pſalm:
<hi>Thoſe which ſhall ſow in
teares, ſhall reape in ioy
and triumph.</hi> For hee
who ſhal ſow this reliefe
with teares, ſhall reape
with griefe. None ſhall
reape with ioy in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
if he haue not ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſowed vpon earth.
An almes giuen vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
doth not onely
leeſe all reward, but alſo
deſerueth no pardon. It
fareth alike with almes
which are vaingloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
giuen, and to be ſeene
of men, which our Lord
condemneth in the 6. of
<hi>Matthew.</hi> Alſo it fares
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:19266:89"/>
alike with almes done of
goods ill gotten; who
hauing enriched himſelf
by fraudulent meanes
and extortion, thinks to
appeaſe God by giuing
part of his robberies in
alms, goes about to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
God with preſents,
&amp; cal him to take part of
the ſpoile. As in the law,
God receiued not as an
offring, neither the price
of a dog, nor the hire of
the letcher: ſo in the
Goſpell, God will that
almes (which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to the Hebrews cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
a ſacrifice) ſhould
be of iuſt things,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 16.</note> and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:19266:90"/>
gotten by labour: that
<hi>he who hath ſtollen, ſteale
no more, but rather labor
with his hands, that he
may haue to giue vnto
him that hath neede.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.
4. Wherfore when
Ieſus Chriſt in the 16. of
<hi>S. Luke,</hi> wil that we giue
almes of vniuſt riches;
hee calleth riches there
euill, not becauſe they
were vniuſtly gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but
becauſe that ordinarily
they are enticements &amp;
baits of iniquitie; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
hee would ſooner
haue commanded them
to be rendered vnto
ſuch as they had bene
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:19266:90"/>
wrongfully taken from.</p>
               <p>This ſame loue of
God,<note place="margin">Agreement among bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</note> produceth peace
and concord amongſt
brethren. For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to loue God,
without imitating him.
Now <hi>he is the God of
peace.</hi> Rom. 16. Wee
muſt therefore be chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of peace, in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of him: for ſo are
the faithful called in the
10. of <hi>Luke.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
in the 19. of the firſt
of Kings, God is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
as not being in
the ſtorme and boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
winde, but in the
ſtill and quiet ſound; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:19266:91"/>
God is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
confuſions and
quarrels, amongſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
which eate vp one

thoſe which be at peace
and vnitie. But the diuel
liueth vpon diſcord, and
is friend vnto ſtrife. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as men cauſe two
dogges or two cocks to

the lookers on en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
them to the

not, but when two men
fight together, the diuel
pricketh them on, and
taketh pleaſure thereat.
Let vs take heed leſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:19266:91"/>

We (I ſay) that be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who haue all the

who by one ſelfe ſame
combat, do tend to one

to repaire the breaches
of Ieruſalem, to build a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
the houſe of God
in the view and deſpite
of the diuel. It is written
in the 1. of Kings, chap.
6. that <hi>Salomons</hi> temple
was builded without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:19266:92"/>
in the worke of God
without any noiſe, and
without ſtrife. And here
may and ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
the aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which <hi>Ioſeph</hi> gaue

God, to wit, a frequent

               <p>For the man which
loueth God, being to
deliberate vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any thing
of importance, doth firſt
conſult with the oracle
of Gods mouth, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
after his will. As
for example, vpon the

not call the belly to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

God; &amp; after hauing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently

Adde hereunto, that if

Ieſus Chriſt promiſeth
that all which we ſhall

               <p>Likewiſe if he be to

any vocation, he wil firſt
counſell himſelfe with
God, that he may chuſe
that vocation in which
he ſhal be leaſt ſollicited
to offend God, and in
which he ſhal haue moſt
meanes to glorifie him.
After this conſultation,
humane wiſedome may
be heard in her rank, not
as a miſtris to rule the
roſt, but as a ſeruant,
who ſpeaketh when he
is queſtioned: ſhe ſhall
propound what our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are, what the preſent

the circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:19266:95"/>
and perſons. In like
ſort, if there be any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
of mariage, the
faithfull wil before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things conſult with
Gods mouth, and will
heare the Apoſtle Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> (1. Corin. 7.) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
that it be done
in the Lord. And God
himſelf in the 7. of Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomie,
charging vs
not to contract mariage
but with true beleeuers.
So <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> were
maried by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of their fathers;
but <hi>Eſau</hi> took vnto him
wiues of the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Gen. 26. 35.</note>
which were a bitterneſſe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:19266:96"/>
vnto <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca.</hi>
I paſſe ouer the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
which doe ſpring
thereof, for at this time
we do ſeeke onely after
the proofes and effects
of the true loue of God.
For if a friend ſhould
marrie himſelfe without
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vnto his frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d; might
he not take occaſion to
ſay, You doe miſtruſt
me, and do all your bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
without ſpeaking
thereof vnto me. Now
if God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto vs all his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel,
as ſaith <hi>S. Paul,</hi> Acts 20:
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:19266:96"/>
ſhall we make difficultie
to let him know ours?
His counſell (I ſay)
which is a bottomleſſe
depth of wiſedome, full
of wholeſome and holy
myſteries: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
our cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels which
are but light things, and
wherein he will be our
counſeller for our good,
and which he knoweth
without our communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
them. Certainly
the word of God is our
good counſeller, who
counſelleth vs without
flatterie, who ruleth vs
without ambiguitie: and
the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> cha. 9.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:19266:97"/>
calleth Ieſus Chriſt <hi>the
Counſeller,</hi> not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
hee hath manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
to vs the counſel of
God in the Goſpell, but
becauſe he is to counſell
vs in our doubts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue
vs in our delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>That which I ſay of
our difficulties, ought
alſo to be vnderſtood of
our ſorrowes; in which
wee ought to addreſſe
our ſelues to God, make
our complaint to him,
powre out our teares &amp;
diſcouer our afflictions
vnto him with a ſon like
libertie: and though he
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:19266:97"/>
know them well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating,
yet will he thereby giue
vs eaſe and contenting.
Take example hereof in
the Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid,</hi>
where you haue an ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomie
of the thoughts
of the faithfull, and the
picture of a diuers agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
within him. You
ſhall ſee many Pſalmes,
as the 6. the 22. the 51.
&amp;c. wherein the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
are full of feare, &amp;
the entry ful of anguiſh,
and as it were within
two fingers of deſpaire;
but in the end you ſee
nothing but ioy and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance:
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:19266:98"/>
ſo that you
would thinke that the
Pſalme were compoſed
by two men of contrary
humors. From whence
commeth this ſo ſudden
change? was it, that in
the midſt of his prayer,
ſome good newes arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
which might allay
his griefe? no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
but thus, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as hee grew more
and more feruent with
God, his ſoule riſing
from vnder her burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
ſtayed her ſelfe vpon his
promiſes, &amp; came forth
with peace &amp; aſſurance.
Who is that faithfull
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:19266:98"/>
Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who hath pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
this exerciſe, and
hath not felt eaſe? And if
an obſtinate penſiuenes,
which holdeth the hand
ſtill on the wound, ſeize
on our ſpirits and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
them, ought it not
to be imputed vnto the
want of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating
with God? for teares ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
procure double
ſmart; and although but
vnprofitably ſpent, yet
do they diſcharge vs of
griefe, and giue aire vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the wound. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſpent before God,
who hath bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
by promiſe, yea
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:19266:99"/>
euen by oath, not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
vs, doth bring
vs a great conſolation,
before God (I ſay) who
doth regiſter our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts,
yea euen preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
them, ſo farre forth
as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith in the 32.
Pſalme, that God hath
pardoned him his ſinne,
not only after his praier,
but euen as ſoone as he
had any will to craue it.</p>
               <p>For he requireth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
praiers of vs, becauſe
he hath need of our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
but becauſe wee
haue need of his grace:
and that according to
his iuſtice it cannot be
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:19266:99"/>
giuen to thoſe which
ſhall not daigne to craue
it. As the Sunne draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vp vapours from the
earth, not for it ſelfe, but
to render them to the
earth in raine to moiſten
and fatten it: ſo God the
true Sun of our ſoules,
draweth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs our ſighs
and prayers, not for his
own profit, but to make
them raine downe again
vpon vs in ſo many bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.
This ſame freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
communication with
God in our afflictions,
will teach vs to turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
our eyes from men
which do afflict vs, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:19266:100"/>
God who doth
employ them, that we
may not be like the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie
dog, which biteth
the ſtone which is caſt
at him. The man that
ſhall loue, will ſay as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
when <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed
him:<note place="margin">2. Sam. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Suffer him to curſe,
for the Lord hath bidden
him.</hi> The Lord proueth
me, or correcteth me;
my ſinnes fortifie mine
enemies, and make them
neceſſarie: the ſtroakes
of God are more whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
then the flatteries
of the world. In our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticke
harmes let vs
take heed of reſembling
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:19266:100"/>
ſuch hurt men, as falling
into frenſie, do teare
all things prepared to
dreſſe them withal. Yea
euen out of affliction,
and in full proſperitie,
what ſweetneſſe &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
is there in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication?
For accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Sauiour,
Math. 6. the faithful <hi>ſhal
enter into his cloſet, and
hauing ſhut his doore, ſhal
pray vnto his Father, who
ſeeth him in ſecret, and
who will reward him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly.</hi>
There being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
from the eyes of
men, he ſhall diſcouer
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:19266:101"/>
himſelfe before God
with leſſe diſtraction, &amp;
more familiarity. There,
after hauing ſpoken to
himſelfe, he will frame
his owne inditement, &amp;
condemne himſelfe that
God may pardon him.
And taking the law as a
looking-glaſſe, he will
acknowledge therin the
ſpots of his ſoule, will
ſeeke to couer them by
faith, &amp; to correct them
by repentance. There
he wil meditate vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
works of God through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the world, his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
againſt his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
his benefites to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:19266:101"/>
his Church; and
particularly vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
how God hath
guided him, inſtructed
him, and brought him
vnto his knowledge.
How many monarks &amp;
peoples haue ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
againſt the church
being weake and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
in appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
and haue cruſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
thereagainſt: but
the church of God ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth,
and ſo ſhall do
vnto the end. Yea euen
vſing a ladder as it were
in his meditation, he
ſhal raiſe himſelfe to the
contemplation of the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:19266:102"/>
workes of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
marking therein
how God would haue
the remedies proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
vnto the euil. For,
becauſe man deſiring to
make himſelfe like vnto
God, by exalting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
is fallen into death:
God hauing made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
like vnto ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
himſelf, hath reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him vnto life. And
as the woman brought
vnto man the fruite of
death: ſo God would
that woman, to wit, the
holy Virgine, ſhould
bring man the fruite of
life. And as out of the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:19266:102"/>
profound ſleepe of the
firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> God drew
him forth a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who
was bone of his bone,
and fleſh of his fleſh: ſo
by the death of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Adam</hi> (which the
Scripture calleth a ſleep)
God hath gotten him a
Spouſe, that is to ſay, his
Church, which is one
bodie with him. In this
ſame meditation he wil
admire, how in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
God hath vnited
himſelfe vnto man, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
ioyned the author
of life with a mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
ſhutting vp all his
celeſtiall treaſures in a
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:19266:103"/>
veſſell of earth, to the
end wee might there
draw of his fulneſſe.
How by the infirmity of
this fleſh, he vanquiſhed
the force of Satan; from
his extreme ſhame hath
drawn exceeding glory;
from the death of that
man, drawne the life of
all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by that very ſame
vertue, through which
in the beginning of the
world hee had drawne
light out of darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>In this contemplatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
as being enflamed with
this diuine loue, he will
raiſe vp himſelf through
faith, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the ioyes
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:19266:103"/>
of heauen; where God
diſcouers himſelfe face
to face; where the harps
of Saints ſound forth;
&amp; where the Seraphins
aſſiſting before the
throne, crie, Holy, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
holy is the Lord of
hoaſts. O how ſweete a
thing is it to ioyne vnto
theſe their praiſes, and
haue a part in this cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall

It were good (ſaid
he) that we ſtayed here;
and would haue ſet vp
tents there. How much
more wold he haue bin
rauiſhed, if himſelfe had
bene transfigured: as the
Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 21.</note> that <hi>Ieſus
Christ ſhall transforme
our vile bodies, that they
may be made like vnto his
glorious bodie.</hi> Who
doubteth, but that when
this glorie vaniſhed, S.
<hi>Peter</hi> was ſeized with
great ſorrow: and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
the heart of the
faithfull comming from
this meditation againe
to conſider theſe baſe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:19266:104"/>
and earthly things, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
touched with a
great diſtaſt and baſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
of them, and is
grieued to ſee himſelfe
tied thereunto, and to
ſay with <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 42.
<hi>O when ſhall I preſent my
ſelf before the face of God?</hi>
It was theſe thoughts
which made the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
greedie and thirſtie
after the Lord. Theſe
were the thoughts which
made <hi>Paul deſire to be
diſlodged, and to be with
Chriſt:</hi> which made him
thinke that which was
gaine vnto others, to be
loſſe vnto him. Theſe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:19266:105"/>
are the thoughts which
haue euen in our time
ſuſtained the Martyrs,
which haue made them
go vnto death as cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
as thoſe which
come thence. For <hi>loue
is ſtrong</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon)
as death,</hi> yea ſtronger,
ſeeing it maketh one to
deſpiſe life.</p>
               <p>This ardour of loue
is entertayned in our
ſoules by a frequent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
with God:
and wee may eaſily ſee,
that the cauſe of our
ſlackneſſe and coldneſſe
in this loue, is, becauſe
wee ſpeake not often
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:19266:105"/>
with God. The moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
friendſhips doe
waxe cold for want of
communication: how
much more if friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
neuer hath bene, as
indeed man is naturally
borne and inclined vnto
enmitie with God. This
is a common euill, to
wit, that wee are much
exerciſed in ſpeaking
with others, but very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
with our ſelues, and
yet leſſe with God. If
ſome houres of leiſure
do ſteale vs from men,
they giue vs not any
whit the more vnto
God. If we enter alone
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:19266:106"/>
into our cloſet, we enter
not euer the ſooner into
our ſelues, to examine
our conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, to ſearch
our wounds, to feele the
pulſes of our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or to talk with God.
And yet none ſhall ſee
him aboue, who hath
not carefully ſought
him here below; and
hath not carefully wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with him by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
meditations, and by
the ſtudie and reading
of the word. This let vs
ſtudy, and from our life,
which is deuided into a
thouſand parts, amongſt
a thouſand occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:19266:106"/>
ſuites, ſolicitations, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
and domeſticke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires;
let vs withdraw
ſome houres to giue our
ſelues vnto God, reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our ſelues out of
the throng and noiſe of
this world, quietly to
meditate on thoſe
things which pertaine
to our ſaluation. As if by
a litle channell we wold
diuert a part of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
waters of a ſtream,
that they may run more
gently and cleerly. A
running brooke preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
not any images; nor
a ſpirit which is euer in
action, &amp; alwaies puſſed
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:19266:107"/>
with buſineſſe, hardly
can hee frame himſelfe
vnto the image of God.
We muſt then ſeparate
ſome houres to ſpeake
with God. All the time
of our life is loſt except
that which is thus huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded.
That time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is only ours which
we giue to God.</p>
               <p>Let none here alledge
his domeſticke affaires.
For if we be Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
his ſeruice is part
of our domeſticall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires:
yea, and whileſt
we are doing our handy
workes, what hindereth
vs that we may not think
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:19266:107"/>
of God, and ſend him
vp by our broken ſighes,
thoſe ſort of prayers
which the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
called <hi>eiaculatoriae?</hi>
ſhort praiers which may
be ſaid euery where,
prayers lanced forth, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
ſallies borne of the
preſent occaſion; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
which haue no other
ornament but feruency,
whoſe clauſes haue no
other contexture but
neceſſitie. Who doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
but that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Eliſeus</hi> ploughing

and the loue of God is

(ſaith ſhe) <hi>is departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Iſrael.</hi> There is no more
certain effect of the loue
of God then this here:
for if at one time we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
ſeuerall newes; the
one of the loſſe of a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite;
the other of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolt

grieued with the laſt
then the firſt. Or if we
be more angrie to heare

then to heare our ſelues

haue we in vs an aſſured

of God is liuely imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

who ſo is not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

himſelfe a baſtard

confeſſe their liues to be

will hazard them for ſo

God be blaſphemed, &amp;
his truth ſlandered, if his
name be abuſed before
their eyes, they remaine
vnmoueable, and beare
a part therein. We are
leapers, without feeling
in ſpirituall things, but
verie ſenſible in carnall.
We go for curioſitie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſermons, where Gods
truth is oppoſed againſt,
and our preſence by the

a place or companie
where the honor of our

but to contradict

acknowledge that this
ſpirituall feeling is verie
feeble in vs, to the end
we may craue of God
to awaken it, by quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vs with his loue.</p>
               <p>From theſe fiue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
and fiue markes,
you may eaſily gather,
that the loue of God
conſiſteth not onely in
hauing a good opinion
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:19266:112"/>
of him, or to haue a
good feeling, or to ſpeak
well of him; but that
chiefly it conſiſteth in
obeying him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
vs to his wil. So
God in his law ſaith, that
he ſheweth mercie vnto
them which loue him;
but he addeth, <hi>&amp; which
keep my commandements.</hi>
And Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.
14. Who ſo loueth me, will
keep my ſayings.</hi> And the
ſame Apoſtle in another
place:<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>My litle children,
loue not in word, neither
in tongue onely, but in
deed and in truth.</hi> So S.
<hi>Iames</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">Cha. 1. v. 17</note> 
                  <hi>That pure
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:19266:113"/>
and vnderfield religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, is to viſit the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe
and widows in
their aduerſitie, and to
keepe our ſelues vnſpotted
of the world.</hi> But there be
many that are religious
in ſpeech, not in actions;
and who ſtudie to be
more skilfull, not more
wiſe; who confeſſe God
with their lips, but denie
him in their hearts. Like
vnto thoſe which ſtruck
Ieſus Chriſt, ſaying,
<hi>Haile maiſter:</hi> or to <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhakeh,</hi>
who ſpake not
the language of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, but for to
diſhonour him withall.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:19266:113"/>
He knoweth not God,
who loueth him not; &amp;
he loueth him not, who
obeieth not his wil. The
children of <hi>Eli</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in the will of
God; for being Prieſts
they taught it vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
and yet the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſaith, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 12.
that <hi>they knew not God,
becauſe they loued him
not.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>The kingdome of God</hi>
(ſaith <hi>S. Paul) lieth not
in words, but in power.</hi> It
is euen ſo with his loue.
So <hi>Dauid</hi> in the 33. Pſal.
ſaith, that <hi>praiſes are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

<hi>in the mouths of iuſt men.</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:19266:114"/>
As for the wicked, God
ſaith vnto him in the 50
Pſalme, <hi>Wherefore takeſt
thou my words into thy
mouth?</hi> For this cauſe
was it that Ieſus Chriſt,
when the diuell confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him, ſaid vnto him,
<hi>Hold thy peace, hold thy
peace.</hi> For the praiſe of
God, and the truth of
religion, are vilified and
debaſed in the mouth
of the wicked, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
loſe their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
for ſhee is made a
companion of vice; and
the liuerie of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
becometh by this

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:19266:114"/>
Thou ſaiſt, I loue
God, but doeſt deſpiſe
his will: I loue God, but
doeſt hate the image of
God. Canſt thou loue
God without following
him? or follow ſuch as
do good to their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
whileſt thou liueſt
in diſcord with thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?
We proteſt all of
vs to loue God, but we
better loue the increaſe
of our monies then the
aduancement of his
cauſe. Wee proteſt to
feare him, but we do
not feare to do before
him ſuch things as we
would ſhame to do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:19266:115"/>
men. Who is that
quarreller or theefe, that
wil ſtrike or ſteale in the
preſence of the Iudge?
and for all this, what do
we not in Gods ſight,
the Iudge not onely of
our actions, but alſo of
our thoughts? We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
to loue Ieſus Chriſt,
and yet abandon his
members which are the
poore. We ſpend more
in a quarter of an houre
at play, then in a whole
yeare in almes. The ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie
of our attire,
would cloathe a great
number of poore. All is
ſpent in pleaſure, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:19266:115"/>
nothing in pietie. All is
for our couetouſnes, &amp;
nothing for Gods ſake.
Doth that man loue
God, which wil not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
ſpeake vnto him,
nor of him; or who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
no counſell of God
in his diſtreſſe? or who
is not touched with the
zeale of his glory? In the
mean time there is none
amongſt vs, who maketh
not profeſſion to loue
God: which ſheweth
that wee loue him in
groſſe, but hate him in
retaile; this being in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
and gainſaid in
particular. We ſpeake of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:19266:116"/>
heauen, but haue our
hearts on the earth. By
this meanes if one mark
apart our loue to God,
it may be found ſome
ſpeciall matter; but if we
ballance it with our loue
of the world, our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
our riches, our
preferments, it is found
verie light: ſo that our
loue is a kinde of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteeme,
and almoſt an
hatred. Let vs take heed
to our ſelues; for we ſhal
not be iudged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
but according
to our particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And if ſo it be, that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:19266:116"/>
we loue not God as we
ought, or if wee loue
ſome other thing with
him otherwiſe then for
his ſake, how ſhall we
ſubſiſt before him, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
any thing better
better then he? yea euen
againſt him, louing that
which God hateth, to

whereupon this ſpirit
is called the ſpirit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption

giuen to any other then
the children of God,
which he hath adopted
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:19266:117"/>
in Ieſus Chriſt: and that
therefore hee frameth
their hearts vnto a child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

recourſe vnto God as

of ill ſauor before God:
but Chriſtian wiſedom
findeth meanes to draw
eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from this filth, ſome
commoditie. He then
which would ſeek ſome
model, whereon to form
the loue of his God,
ought to obſerue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all the reſt, the
moſt monſtrous and the
moſt obſtinate vices, &amp;
they are ſo all indeede.
Yet I think that extreme
auarice doth ſome deale
beare away the bell. Let
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:19266:120"/>
it then be expoſed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
view; and let this
monſter, which corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
man when it is
within him, teach man
being thruſt forth, and
inſtruct him afarre off.
For will you loue God,
as you ought? loue him
then as a man extremely
couetous loueth his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
Auarice taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
reſt, and troubleth
ſleepe; his money is the
firſt thought at his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king:
ſo let the loue of
God breake our ſleepe,
poſſeſſe our thoughts in
the night; let it be the
firſt of our thoughts at
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:19266:120"/>
our awaking, to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
on his former gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to diſpoſe of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
life, to bewaile our
ſinnes at the cock-crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Couetouſnes doth
ſhut the heart of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous

where his treaſure is: ſo
alſo let the loue of God
fixe our hearts in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
to the end that
there where our trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
be, there may our
hearts be alſo. Auarice
ſnatcheth out of the nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
hand the bread he
ſhould eate, and maketh
him be content with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle:
ſo muſt the loue of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:19266:121"/>
God teach vs abſtine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
and how to bring vnder
our bodies; to liue with
litle, and to depriue our
ſelues when it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
of temporall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
for his ſeruice.
The auaricious man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh
for gaine long
voyages, ſequeſtring
himſelfe from his wife
and children: ſo muſt
the loue of God prepare
vs to endure baniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
to leaue wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to follow God; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
the ſaying of
our Lord, Mat. 10. <hi>Who
ſo loueth father or mother
more then me, is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:19266:121"/>
of me: or who ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

of me.</hi> The couetous
man hauing put his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
vnto vſurie, calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the time, and with
impatience atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the
terme: ſo we that know
that God hath in his
hands our pledge, and
that hee will render vs
our almes with vſurie,
ought with impatience
to attend the time of
payment; and in the
meane time very preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
keepe his obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Goſpell.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:19266:122"/>
The couetous man, the
older hee waxeth, the
more greedy he is to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
he liueth poorely,
that he may die rich; his
purpoſe to gather is at
the greateſt, when the
terme of his life is at the
ſhorteſt: ſo muſt the old
man fearing God, make
more carefull prouiſion
of faith and good works.
Let him liue poore in
worldly goods, that he
may die rich in heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Old age is the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
and lees of life; but in
the faithfull man it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neweth,<note place="margin">Pſal. 103.</note>
as vnto an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle:
for then he feeleth
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:19266:122"/>
more liuely and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the motions of the
life to come; then hath
he the wager almoſt in
his hand, being neere
the end of his courſe.
Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the riuers are neer
their end, and approach
vnto the ſea; the tide
cometh towards them,
and meeteth them: ſo
when the courſe of a
faithfull mans life com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
neare his end, then
God cometh to meete
him; and before death,
giueth him ſome taſte
and feeling of the life to
come. Then it is that we
ought to haue a holy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:19266:123"/>
to husband
our time, make a ſtocke

This medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which giueth vice
a double conſtruction,
and maketh it look both
waies, enforceth it to be
an example and helpe
vnto vertue: as Amor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
captiues, to cleanſe

as a woman of Hethe,
whoſe haire and nailes

vertue is ſo feeble in vs,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:19266:123"/>
that to raiſe it ſelfe vp, it

it paſſeth ouer to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s

For, as a man ſtrucken

them into Gods pallace,
where hee is glorified;
and aſſures himſelfe that
God wil giue peace and
ſtrength vnto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
For in this pallace
of God, which is his
church, doth ſound that
voice, not which ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the mountains, but
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:19266:138"/>
which aſſureth our
hearts; not that voice
which rooteth vp the
Cedars, but that which
comforteth our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences:
not that which
cauſeth the Hindes to
caſt their yong ones, but
which maketh vs to
conceiue hope. It is the
word of the Goſpell, in
which God layeth open
the treaſures of his loue:
in which whoſoeuer
ſhall take a reliſh, he ſhall
finde the ſweetes of the
world to be bitterneſſe,
and hating the ſame, wil
learne to loue God.</p>
               <p>Now we ſay this, not
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:19266:139"/>
to diſcharge our ſelues
of all earthly things: this
careleſnes of the world
hindereth not the loue
of our children, nor the
care of our family, nor
our endeuour in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracie;
but the faithful
will do theſe things, as a
paſſenger fits himſelfe in
the beſt manner he may
at ſome Inne. He who is
not to ſtay there aboue
a night, will not ſtand to
build a wall; and if he
ſuffer there any diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
he wil patiently
digeſt it, becauſe it is but
a paſſage. For the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:19266:139"/>
wil follow domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and ciuil affaires, not
as if he meant there to
ſet vp his ſtaffe, to tie
therunto his deſſeignes,
or therein to place his
hope. His thoughts will
euer be in ſome other
place; and during his
buſineſſe, will euer think
of the vanitie of his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.
He will alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
his actions with the
ſeruice of God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation
of his name;
and that ſhal euer be the
firſt, which he will haue
laſt: whileſt worldlings,
after the example of
<hi>Martha,</hi> paine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:19266:140"/>
exceſſiuely in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticke
affaires; he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Maries</hi> example, will
chuſe the good part,
which ſhall not be taken
from him, placing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
at Chriſts feete to
heare his word. If hee
haue any worldly feares,
they wil giue place vnto
the feare of God. If he
haue any hopes, they
will giue place vnto his
hope of the kingdom of
heauen. If he haue any
ſorrowes, they will be
ſwallowed vp of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſorrow, proceeding
from the ſence of his
ſinnes, or the bruiſings
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:19266:140"/>
of <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> God himſelfe
herein is an example vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs. For in building of
the world, he hath done
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary vnto men which
do build alſo: men begin
at the foundation, but
God beginneth at the
top. He ſtretched out
the heauens, before he
laied the foundations of
the earth. The naturall
workes of God, are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
inſtructions vnto
vs. To the end that wee
may follow this order,
and that wee may euer
begin by the care of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
things; the earthly
will preſent themſelues
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:19266:141"/>
in the ſecond rank to be
thought on, not of loue
or of purpoſe, but by
neceſſitie, and as much
as is required, for not
ſeeming cruell vnto
thoſe which be ours, or
enemies to our ſelues.

knoweth our harts, who
ſeeth all our filthineſſe
through the cloake of

               </p>
               <p>Then when we come
to frame our prayers,
each word that we ſay,
is a leſſon or a reproach.
For example, we thus
begin the Lords prayer,
<hi>Our Father which art in
heauen.</hi> In calling him
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:19266:145"/>
                  <hi>our Father,</hi> wee learne
on the one part to be his
obedient children, and
to be perſwaded of his
loue: on the other ſide,
to deſpiſe the world, as
inferiour to our digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
ſeeing wee be the
children of God. This
word alſo of <hi>Our,</hi> fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
vs vnto charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our neighbors, &amp;
to procure their good,
not only in our prayers,
but in all our actions.
And theſe words, <hi>which
art in heauen,</hi> aduertiſe vs
to ſeeke for heauenly
things; and that our
conuerſation ſhould be
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:19266:145"/>
as that of heauenly citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
and children of the
heauenly King. Then
when the faithful ſhall
come to propoſe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds,
he will chide
himſelfe on this ſort: I
craue of God that <hi>his
name may be hallowed,</hi>
and yet I profane and
diſhonor it. I deſire that
<hi>his kingdome may come,</hi>
and be aduanced; and
notwithſtanding I reſiſt
and foreſlow it as much
as lieth in me, vnwilling
that he ſhould reigne in
me; not ſubiecting my
ſelfe vnto the ſcepter of
his kingdome, which is
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:19266:146"/>
his word; nor contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any thing to his
Church, which is called
in the Goſpell, Gods
kingdome. Item, I pray
<hi>his will may be done,</hi> and
yet I reſiſt this wil. I beg
my <hi>bread,</hi> and yet couet
another mans: <hi>My dailie
bread,</hi> and yet my coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
care extends it ſelfe
vnto many yeares. So
likewiſe wee craue that
God <hi>would forgiue vs as
wee forgiue them which
haue treſpaſſed againſt vs:</hi>
and for all that wee are
vnreconcileable, our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
is mortall, or to ſay
better, immortall; and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:19266:146"/>
yet feare not that God
ſhould heare vs, pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vs according as we
pardon our neighbours.
So we deſire <hi>not to be led
into temptation,</hi> and yet
we runne after tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
bad companies,
bookes of loue-tales, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
enticements and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
of doing ill. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
we finiſh this prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
with mention of the
kingdome and glorie of
God, by which this
ſame prayer began, that
it might warne vs, that
eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as our praiers, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
al our affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ought
to begin and end with
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:19266:147"/>
the glorie of God. So
many petitions, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
aduertiſements: for
Ieſus Chriſt moſt artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
by teaching vs
how to craue for good,
teacheth vs alſo to do it.
In ordering our praiers,
hee alſo ordereth our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
ſo as ſpeaking to
God, we alſo ſpeake to
our ſelues; by praying
vnto God, we learne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to feare him. And
ſurely when you ſhall ſee
vnrulineſſe in a houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
either by diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the children, or
by diſſention betweene
man and wife, it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:19266:147"/>
witneſſe that God
is not there called vpon
as hee ought. For this
only action of lifting vp
of hearts and hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
vnto God, might
haue ſufficed to reunite
their diuided affections,
and entertaine from day
to day their familie in
the feare of God. For by
ſpeaking often to God,
we learne to loue him,
and louing him to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him. <hi>Moſes</hi> his face

of ſo great a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,

That which is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
of the world, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth
it ſelfe for the
leaſt of his children, and
ſerueth for the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of his loue.</p>
               <p>The holy Scripture
being full of ſuch exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
rightly may it be
called <hi>the booke of true
loue;</hi> ſeeing that therein
God not onely vnfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
his loue, but alſo
bindeth vs to loue him;
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:19266:148"/>
and not only exhorteth
vs to this loue, but alſo
produceth it in vs by
this ſame word, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying
the preaching
of the ſame with the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
of his holy Spirit.
And to ſay true, I thinke
that the moſt part of vs
haue had experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that
after the hearing of the
word, the ſparks of loue
do kindle in our hearts;
and that hearing God
ſpeake, or ſpeaking of
God, we are inflamed
with his loue. So the
two diſciples being in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maus,
after Ieſus Chriſt
was vaniſhed, ſaid, <hi>Did
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:19266:149"/>
not our harts burn within
vs, when he ſpake vnto vs
on the waie, and preached
the Scriptures?</hi> And <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi>
in the 20. chap. deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to reſerue the word
of God in his hart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vttering it, ſaith, that
he felt it in his heart like
a burning fire. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſo? but becauſe this
word receiued into the
hearts of the auditors,
heateth them with the
like ardour: as alſo the
tongues of fire deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vpon the Apoſtles,
witneſſed that God gaue
them burning tongues,
and a word full of effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:19266:149"/>
to enflame mens
hearts. Wherefore thoſe
which being caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with their buſines,
or withheld by feare, or
perſwaded of their ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie,
neglect coming
to ſermons, ſhall inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
feele that this heate
waxeth coole, and that
a caule groweth ouer
their conſciences. This
negligence will grow to
a diſtaſt, this diſtaſt to a
diſdaine, this diſeſteeme
vnto a hardnes of heart
&amp; enmitie againſt God.
Whoſoeuer will enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the loue of God in
his heart, ought dayly to
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:19266:150"/>
come &amp; heare his word,
the which he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
as a wholſom means

                  <hi>You are cleane

went and conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

to ſee the conformitie

of the Prophets; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that the Apoſtle
being powerfull in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
and in words, did
preach with authoritie
enough to be beleeued,
as might be thought:
how much more ought
we now a dayes, at our

content our curioſity, to

they proue their ſayings
by the word of God? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all the books of

obſcure is the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe,
and yet it is ſaid
in the firſt chapter, that
<hi>happie are they that reade,
and thoſe which heare the
words of this propheſie.</hi> In
the 17. of Deuter. God
commandeth Kings to
reade the booke of the
law, all the dayes of their
life. Reading thereof
was the exerciſe of the
Queene Candaces Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch,
as he rode in his

being become a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an?
And if he read when
he vnderſtood not, how
much more when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to vnderſtand? If he
read in his chariot, how
much more in his houſe?
Alſo God hath tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him his hand by the
miniſtery of <hi>Philip;</hi> and
vpon the reading, the
light of the Goſpell is
come vnto him, for an
argument vnto vs of
hope, that in reading
carefully the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
God wil enlighten

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:19266:153"/>
becauſe we are learned,
but to become ſo.</p>
               <p>Now here we paſſe
ouer an infinite number
of profits which we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of this reading; as is
the confirmation of our
faith, conſolation in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
a gentle diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
a maiſter which
flattereth not, a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie
which is not trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
a ſpirituall muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
houſe, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
all ſorts of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
againſt temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which furniſheth
wherewithall to reſiſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
error, following
the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of our Lord,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:19266:154"/>
euer reſiſting the diuell
by Scripture, and ſaying
vnto him,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>It is written, it
is written,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Onely we
will ſtay our ſelues vpon
this, to wit, that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
kindleth in our
hearts the loue of God.
This is knowne by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.
For after a man
once begins to take a taſt
in reading the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
other ſtudies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to proue without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh:
you ſhall ſee no
more vpon the Carpet,
bookes of loue; the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Romanes and
tales of <hi>Amadis</hi> do flie
before the Bible more
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:19266:154"/>
then the diuell before
holywater: all theſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and vaine readings
which buſied the ſpirit
and tickled the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
do leeſe their taſte
after this ſpirituall nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.
Another kind
of loue is kindled in the
ſpirits of thoſe which
dayly propoſe vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
the witneſſes of
the loue of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
vs, contained in
his word.</p>
               <p>This meditation fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
vs with a iuſt
ſubiect of complaint.
For then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vs for reading the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:19266:155"/>
Scripture, wee burned
with zeale to be reading
them. Now with our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
is bread alſo our
negligence &amp; diſeſteem
thereof. We are barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and new to ſeeke
in the language of Gods
Spirit. Our hearts then
reſemble flint-ſtones,
which caſt no ſparks but
when they are ſtrucken.
Many will haue a Bible
well bound &amp; gilt, lying
vpon a cupboord, more
for ſhew then for inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
we loue but the
outſide thereof. Wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne
the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
outwardly, but it
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:19266:155"/>
were better it might
decke vs within. It were
better it were torn with
often reading, that thy
conſcience might be
more entire: for it is
more eaſie for thee to
haue another, then it is
eaſie for thee to be an
honeſt man without it.
Wee deſire a faire im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion;
but the faireſt
impreſſion is that which
is made with the finger
of God in our ſoules.
The matrices of theſe
characters are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
This loue of God
is ingrauen in our hearts
with his hand, and is
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:19266:156"/>
formed vpon the model
of that loue which hee
hath borne vs in his Son:
according as he ſaith in
the 15. of Saint <hi>Iohn: As
my Father loued me, ſo
haue I loued you:
remaine in
my loue.</hi>
