            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE insuing Discourse being in part a difficult expostulation with the renitencies of our present Age, I intend not to involve any mans name in the Patronage of it.</p>
            <p>Let it stand or fall, as the worth of the Subject (how weakly soever prosecuted) shall plead for its due Patronage in the hearts of all that wish well to the Peace of Church and State amongst us.</p>
            <p>

May any who yet wander, be recovered from the errour of their way, and the end of this exposure is fully attain'd. I have chosen for their sakes, to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion several persons and passages (highly and deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly) honoured by themselves: Hoping they will please to give a kind audience (if not to us yet) at least to them.</p>
            <p>In the search of former times, both they and we may soon meet with the mournful complaints of History; while eminent Reformers in other Countries have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all faithful care to redress whatever was truly evil: The giddy multitude, <note n="*" place="margin">Erant (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud nos) qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus nihil in reformando satis purum videbatur, unde &amp; ab Ecclesiâ sese segregabant, &amp; conventicula peculiaria constituebant. Quae mox Schismata &amp; variae sectae consequebantur. Jucundum Papisticis Spectaculum. <hi>Epist. Hen. Bullingeri Episcopo Winton.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Some to whom no Reformation seems pure enough, would not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding separate from them, set up pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conventicles of their own, and run into endless Schisms. Such sport was made for</hi> Rome.</p>
            <p>This hath been the Epidemick distemper of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> Sad it is; but so it proves: We fastidiously refuse our own mercies, and are impetuously fond of inconsistent vanities.</p>
            <p>So great an evil must be seriously withstood. And it may be a real kindness, though unkindly taken. 'Twas the just observation of a most worthy person; calculated indeed for another Meridian, but may as
<pb facs="tcp:61143:3"/>
truly serve our own: <hi>Had none</hi> (faith he) <hi>been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>

               <hi>to bear the envy and censures of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, in withstanding the enterprizes and proceedings of the Anabaptists when they began in</hi> Germany: <hi>Anabaptism had over-run those Churches, and utterly destroyed them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What was their danger then, hath been ours since. <note n="*" place="margin">Si suo quis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que feratur impetu, non plane unit as erit, sed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusio. <hi>Bern. in Cant. Serm. 49. Exod. 32. 32, 33.</hi>
               </note> And there needs no more to make us miserable, than that Anarchy and Confusion which some mens excentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal opinions, and ways of Separation would introduce.</p>
            <p>This necessitateth a <hi>Moses-</hi>like standing in the gap; and happy are they that can do it with his zeal, and yet with his compassion. <hi>And he said, this people have sinned agreat sin; yet now I beseech thee, O Lord! forgive their iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We owe (and that justly) the utmost tenderness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the persons of all; even those who dissent fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest from us. There is no good Christian but wisheth we might live at circumstances of ease and comfort one by another. Every man sitting under his Vine, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Fig-tree.

            <p>'Tis observ'd of <hi>Meteors,</hi> though they both blaze and frighten for a time; yet in conclusion, they spend themselves, and go out.</p>
            <p>We will also modestly hope, that these fiery exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, these passionate divisions of ours <hi>(the Achans that have so long troubled Gods</hi> Israel) may now
<pb facs="tcp:61143:4"/>
at length expire and die. And the desired <hi>Shechinah</hi> of a Divine Presence rest upon the land.</p>
            <p>This seems the Princely aim of our Gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, in the most admired conduct of his Government over us. This, the very summ of those Royal expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his heart so condescensively vouchsafed to his people.

               <hi>My Subjects, I have one thing to ask of you, in the name of the Great God, our common Master. 'Tis that which is acceptable to him, 'tis that which is proper for me to demand, 'tis that which is bounden duty for you to yield; Lay down all your quarrelsome controversies, and live henceforth in Love and Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O how undeniably must our reverence to God, and his Vice-gerent; the sacredness of the authority, and the justness of the charge, even adjure us to the most cheerful immediate comportment with our duty?</p>
            <p>In order whereto, I cannot forbear mentioning the affectionate language of that reverend aged <hi>Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> particularly directed by him (upon his Majesties happy Restauration) to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> as the last token of his love to us, and his own Swan-like Song before his death.</p>

            <p>He that loves Gods Church truly, is likewise most highly concerned for Gods anointed. He prays not for the one, without the most affectionate remembrances of the other. <hi>For</hi>

            <p>So blasphemously would some men force Almighty God to patronize their highest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts to his Vice-gerent. So easily can they canonize their own Partizans.

The affairs of <hi>Israel</hi> from their first coming up out of <hi>Egypt</hi> had been both in Religion and Civil Government much unsetled.

            <p>Our Church (without any indecent reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon others) proceeded to its own due Reformation; rather than incur more guilt and danger under that common infection.</p>
            <p>The whole conduct of this good work were a voluminous History. The summ is this:</p>

            <p>Thus the Waters formerly bitter, were now healed. The <hi>Naaman</hi> before leprous, became now cleansed. And the Ark, after many high indignities put upon it, restor'd once more with much joy and comfort to a state of better rest amongst us.</p>
            <p>I might now justly say, as once <hi>Jonathan</hi> to his Father <hi>Saul</hi> concerning <hi>David,</hi> with very little alteration; <hi>This great Salvation God wrought</hi>

However our best answer to whole Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of this intemperate Dialect, will be calmly to reply as once the Angel, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee.</hi> Or as that mild reverend man Bishop <hi>Usher, Little</hi> (says he) <hi>do these men consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

            <p>And so we proceed to the Second: To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, that the Ark thus setled, might be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <note place="margin">2.</note> now to rest.</p>
            <p>We read of the <hi>Philistims,</hi> how rudely they carted Gods Ark in their time. From <hi>Ashdod</hi> to <hi>Gath,</hi> from <hi>Gath</hi> to <hi>Ekron;</hi> any way whither fancy and humour had a mind to drive it. Truly, we have had too much of such carting of Religion up and down amongst us. From this Opinion to that Opinion, from this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle to that Conventicle, whithersoever giddiness inclin'd to go; till we have almost carted the <hi>Glory of Israel</hi> out of our Land.</p>
            <p>Most men will industriously strive to excuse themselves. But to be plain with you, our posture (in this very particular) may be just matter of astonishment to all: And I presume, there are few, but sit at this day (as once <hi>Eli)</hi> our <hi>hearts trembling within us for the Ark of God.</hi> O let it rest.</p>

1. I entreat you by all the Religious care that has been shown in the good settlement of it amongst us.</p>
            <p>It began (as we all know) with that pious charge of King <hi>Edward</hi> to Arch Bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and others, as the Act of Parliament still openly records, <hi>That having as well an eye and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi>

               <hi>to the most sincere and pure Religion taught by the Scripture, as to the usage of the Primitive Church, they should draw up one meet form of Common Prayer and administration of the Sacraments to be used amongst us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it began with God, so it proceeded, so it ended still with God. We can scarce read words of more solemness than what we find extant from those reverend persons, whose lot it was to close this honourable work. <hi>We have endeavoured</hi> (say they) <hi>to discharge our duties in this</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Preface to the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</note> 
               <hi>weighty affair as in the sight of God; And to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our sincerity therein (as far as in us lay) to the Consciences of all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now for which of these good deeds do we so fiercely stone the memory of these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy persons? O that men would be modest and sober-minded! The search of truth is deep, and the lapse of time now very great; above sixteen hundred years since the first planting of Christian Religion.</p>

What a prodigious piece of Confidence must it needs be, for every illiterate Mechanick, for every private or discontented person scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to tread under foot the most deliberate Constitutions of their lawful Governours; and audaciously <hi>to set up another Altar besides the Altar of the Lord!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will become us to conclude and act far otherwise. Lo! here the Authority, the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the Learning, the Piety of the whole Kingdom, saying to us (as that voice in the Prophet) <hi>This is the way, walk ye in it.</hi>

            <p>'Tis not possible to enumerate every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.

Lo here the words of eternal life. In Gods name what would we have, or whither would we go? 'Tis true, mens mouths are full of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.

The fault is not in the Bed, 'tis the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward indisposition in the sick person himself, that makes him so restless upon it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is it objected that we have here set forms of Prayer? <hi>Calvin</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Is it urg'd, O but we retain the sign of the Cross in Baptism, and still receive the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Communion in that offensive gesture of kneeling, both of them gross superstitions? To this we answer; That learned man <hi>Bucer</hi> will be our sufficient Advocate in the one, and the <hi>Brethren of Bohemia</hi> in the other.</p>

            <p n="4">4. It were needless to take any notice of that weak clamour against the use of the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice,</hi> or such vulgar murmurs: Our ancient Reformers have done it to our hand. Say

            <p>Instead of that angry captiousness (which so much disquiets the present age) we may freely say of this point, as the same Reformers have also said before us, <hi>From the consideration of these White Garments, the peoples minds should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly raised to aspire after that spotless purity in which we ought all to appear before the Holy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O what restless endeavours have been us'd to bring up an evil report upon a good Land! But the accusations have been observ'd unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily to recoil upon the Accusers.</p>
            <p>When our Dissenting Brethren had made their bitter complaints (to some beyond Sea) against us; expecting thanks and countenance from Reformers there: Instead thereof <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>And now if the sense of so many famous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons must be perfectly set at nought, if all those old objections (long since answered) must needs be rak'd out of their graves, and reviv'd as fresh matter of endless quarrel amongst us; God forgive them that do it.

            <p>And thus far their Principles seem to lead them; If they own what some of the greatest Writers (in this Separation-controversie) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly assert. Say they, <hi>As the Hangings are made fit to the house, so the Common-wealth must be</hi>

               <hi>made to agree with the Church, and the Government thereof with her Government.</hi> It seems then, it must be a <hi>Common-wealth;</hi> or at best such a Government, as must be made to agree with their Church.</p>
            <p>From which bold Premisses, he that runs may plainly read, what a dismal conclusion is like to follow. The whole <hi>Systeme</hi> of our present Monarchy must then lie at the mercy of those who now separate from us; what they and their Church will please to have done with it.</p>
            <p>The truth is, the Schismaticks Loyalty is a deep riddle: He must be an <hi>Oedipus</hi> indeed that understands it. 'Twas but an odd me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod which was sometimes taken, <hi>To reform the Church by ruining the State, to inthrone Christ by dethroning</hi> Caesar.</p>
            <p>And yet such procedures from evil to evil are plainly natural, if God doth not almost miraculously restrain us. The same evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which thus easily seduceth us from the <hi>Ark,</hi>

            <p>Their eager zeal for the <hi>Holy Discipline</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time satisfied them not. There were high words of some <hi>special ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> they had to do. They boasted much of a <hi>hundred thousand</hi> already of their mind.</p>
            <p>The great distaste which stuck with them was, <hi>Spretae injuria formae;</hi> That the Queen was not for their <hi>Geneva</hi> platform: But steady in maintaining the present Government of the Church. This they were pleas'd to call <hi>the defence of abomination, and a bearing the mark of the Beast.</hi>

The next measures are plainly desperate: Because the Queen could not be perswaded, she must be compell'd. And accordingly (as appears by several Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions of themselves and others) the black design was now very far laid, <hi>To remove the Lords of the Council, to secure the Queens person, as</hi>

               <p>And now Men, Brethren, and Fathers! Are we in earnest? Do we sincerely desire this Holy Ark of God might be at rest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us? O then let us turn every one from the evil of our ways. Let there be all due exemplariness in the Clergy, all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conformableness in the Laity; all true Piety and Loyalty in both.</p>
               <p>Let not <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons cause the Sacrifices of God to be abhorr'd through their profaneness, lest it proves <hi>Shilo</hi>'s fall, as well as their ruine. Let not <hi>Uzzah</hi> dare to touch the Ark pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically with his Lay-hands; lest it pulls down another <hi>Peretz uzzah,</hi> Gods displeasure, and some fatal breach upon us.</p>
