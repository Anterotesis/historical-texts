         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE KING OF BOHEMIA HIS ARMY,
Concerning the Emperour FERDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAND,

FRANCE.</head>
            <p>NOT to meddle with (what euery man
knowes) the inſatiate Ambition of the
Houſe of AVSTRIA, in both the
braunches thereof, which all Chriſtendome
ſhortly will not bee enough to content, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
long ſince prepared the way to that Fift
Monarchy, which certaine Religious Perſons
Confidents of <hi>Spaine</hi> affirme to bee as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for the preſeruation and increaſe of the
Catholicke Religion, as is the Popes Spirituall
Monarchy. Nor to ſpeake of the Cruelties
which the Princes of this Houſe haue giuen
way to, in the <hi>Indyes,</hi> in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and
in all places where they haue extended their
Dominions; nor the Deſignes or Attempts
they haue had (open or ſecret) againſt <hi>England,
Ireland, Venice,</hi> or <hi>France</hi> it ſelfe, wherein they
haue nouriſhed partialities and indeauoured
to ſuppreſſe the Lawes Salique. For as for <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
Bohemia,</hi> and <hi>Hungarie,</hi> (Electiue Eſtates)
who is ignorant that to perpetuate them to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:15440:3"/>
themſelues, they haue ſought to make them
Hereditary and Patrimonies to their Familie?</p>
            <p>Not to mention alſo the ſcornefull faſhion
of the two laſt Emperours, who would neuer
ſend to <hi>France</hi> to performe office of Congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
or Condoling, when it is well knowne
that in their Courtes, were publicke reioycings
for the Murthers committed vpon the Perſons
of our two laſt <hi>Henryes,</hi> of famous and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
memory, refuſing to acknowledge the laſt
for a King or a Catholicke, till long time after
his abſolution, when they ſaw him Victorious,
Tryumphant, and Abſolute in his Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
And yet when that Great and good
Prince, was pleaſed to vſe his Credit and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation,
for according the difference betweene
certaine great Princes of the Empire (friends
and allyes of this Crowne,) one of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Rodulphs</hi> principall Officers, ſpared not to
ſay, that the King of <hi>France</hi> might meddle with
the affayres of his owne Kingdome, and let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
reſt: When at that time there was on
foote a queſtion, touching a certaine litigious
Territory, which the ſaide Emperour preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to bee deuolued to him, and lay, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
very fitt for him and one of his Brothers.
Not I ſay to mention or repeate what hath fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
ſo often vnder the Pennes and diſcourſes of
men, and whereof no man almoſt is ignorant:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15440:3"/>
I will onely ſuccinctly anſwer to the Fiue prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
reaſons, framed to induce the King to
aſſiſt the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> now ſtript of
the Kingdomes of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and <hi>Hungarie.</hi>
            </p>
            <div n="1" type="reason">
               <head>1.</head>
               <p>The firſt is Religion, the ordinary pretext of
ſuch as vndertake to inuade others, or to draw
from them ayde and ſupplyes. It is true that
the hard meaſure offerd the Proteſtants of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi>
by the Officers of the Emperour, (as is
apparent by the frequent Complaintes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances
preſented by the ſaide Proteſtants
to his Imperiall Maieſty, and of late by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie
and declaration Publiſhed in diuers
Languages) gaue the firſt hint and occaſion to
the laſt Combuſtion, and brought foorth the
fruites and changes that wee now beholde.
But this is not the firſt time that the <hi>Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
haue in generall complained of the force
offered their Priuiledges, and Liberties; and
of the breach of the fundamentall Lawes of
their Eſtate, (which is in very deede Electiue)
and that the Imperiall branch of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> hath
endeauoured to make it Hereditary, as well as
the Empire; to the preiudice of the Imperiall
Liberties and Conſtitutions, and particularly
to that of the Golden <hi>Bull,</hi> which expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
the perpetuating of the Succeſſion in one
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15440:4"/>
and the ſame Family. In a worde then, it is a
buſines of State and not of Religion: Beſides
that, the Bohemians make it appeare (and they
thinke with ſufficient proofe) that <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
was Elected King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> by the ſurpriſe of
three or foure Officers of that Kingdome, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
and Partiſans of <hi>Spaine,</hi> without calling
thereto the aſſiſtance of the three incorporate
Prouinces, <hi>Sileſia, Morauia,</hi> and <hi>Luſatia,</hi> which
haue euer had, and ought to haue, their free
voyces and aſſents. Againe it is moſt true, that
at ſuch time as the Eſtates of the ſaide King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
expelled the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> (whome they char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
as the Authors of that miſchiefe) they
tooke into their protection, all other orders of
Church-men, who euen to this houre haue not
receiued any interruption in their Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Functions, or in the free inioying of their
reuenues and Benefices. Beſides that, King
<hi>Frederick</hi> at his entrance, tooke a ſolemne oath
for their maintenance, and protection, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
as much to the King in his Letters, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at <hi>Amberg</hi> the Twentieth of October laſt.
And queſtionleſſe if hee ſhould proceed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
he ſhould bee ill aduiſed, in regard that a
good and great part of that Eſtate conſiſts of
Catholickes. It is then a meere Columny to
ſay that it is a buſines of Religion, and that the
Deſigne of the Proteſtantes is to ſuppreſſe the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:15440:4"/>
Catholickes. The falſhood alſo of this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is prooued by the Suffrages, that a Prince
Catholique had in his Election to <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and
in like number as had another Prince of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi>
profeſſion: each of them hauing had
ſixe Voyces: And ſince all this is matter of
Fact, the proofe or diſproofe thereof is moſt
eaſie.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="reason">
               <head>2.</head>
               <p>The Second reaſon alledged, is Alliance:
becauſe the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> is by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide Vnckle to our Queene, whoſe Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
they ſay is tyed in reſpect of ſo ſtraight a
Bond to aſſiſt him: But the moſt ſtraight Bond
is of a King to his Subiectes, as of a Father to
his Children; and the ſafety of an Eſtate ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth
all other conſiderations. The tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Greatnes of this Houſe hath coſt <hi>France</hi>
deare enough in our dayes, without ſeeking
farther proofe of this in other Hiſtories then in
that of the laſt League; vnleſſe we will now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue,
what was almoſt two thouſand yeares
ſince ſaide of our Nation, That wee aſſoone
forget an Iniury, as a Benefit. This alſo is a
point of Conſideration, that the King in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
himſelfe a party for the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi>
diuideth his Subiects that are of different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
before the woundes of the State bee
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15440:5"/>
throughly cloſed; offendeth his Oldeſt and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
Friends and Allies; and bringeth his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
into the danger of a Warre abroad, and
of trouble at home. For if hee imploy his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
againſt the Palatinat for the diuerſion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded;
what other effects may hee expect?
Since the Palatinat during the abſence of King
<hi>Fredericke,</hi> is vnder the Protection of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
of the vnited Prouinces, and of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Vnion. Againe, the King (ſhall as
in a brauery) empty his Treaſure for a buſines
farre from vs; and which concerneth not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
nor indirectly, his Eſtate or Perſon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(as I haue ſaide) a matter neither of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
nor Conſcience. In yeelding alſo Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes
to one party before hee heare the other,
his Maieſty tacitly Condemneth one, and is
Guilty of that which all the Lawes of the
world and hee himſelfe forbids, in ordinary
Suites and differences, betweene party and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
it being likely that before many dayes bee
paſt, the ſaide King <hi>Fredericke,</hi> his Friends and
Allyes, will giue his Maieſty an account of
what hath paſſed in this buſines, and acquaint
him with the cauſe and motiues of ſo great a
change and enterpriſe.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="reason">
               <head>3.</head>
               <p>The third inducement is the aſſiſtance and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15440:5"/>
Protection that Kings owe one another; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſuch as are in diſtreſſe: But let the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
be pleaſed to remember how hee and
his Predeceſſors, haue euermore neglected
<hi>France;</hi> expreſly forbidden the Princes of the
Empire, Friends and Allyes of this Crowne, to
aſſiſt our Kinges of later times, in their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
much leſſe that they haue euer ſupplyed
them with men or money: Let him remember
alſo the refuſall, hee lately made the Duke of
<hi>Neuers,</hi> of the Kings mediation, fauour, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
for ſetling the Affayres of <hi>Bohemia,</hi>
when they were yet in Good tearmes; I meane
during the Life of the Emperour <hi>Mathtas,</hi> and
many monthes before this new Election. But
if the King will fauour one of the partyes (as by
reaſon of State and for diuerſion it hath beene
at other times in practice) there may be ſhewed
to his Maieſtie, halfe a hundred Letters of the
deceaſed King, and of ſome of the Kings his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors,
contayning thankes for the good &amp;
notable ſeruices performed by the houſe of the
Prince Palatine and his Allyes, to their Perſons
and Crownes in their occaſions of need. The
inſtructions giuen to ſuch as haue bene within
theſe thirtie or fortie yeares, ſent into <hi>Germany</hi>
confirme this: Beſides, the ſtraight alliance that
King <hi>Henry</hi> the great (a moſt wiſe Prince) ſettled
betweene him and the body of the Vnion in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:15440:6"/>
                  <hi>Germany,</hi> a ſmall time before his death; appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
ſince by the King now Raigning, and by
the Queene his Mother then Regent, when the
Duke of <hi>Deux Ponts</hi> came into this Kingdom to
condole the laſt Kings murthering. In like ſort
the Contracts &amp; Obligations vpon proofe in
the Chamber of Accounts for many ſummes of
money, lent and paid before hand, by the ſaid
houſe of the Prince Palatine, his neere kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and Allyes, (of a part whereof <hi>France</hi> is yet a
debtor.) Theſe (I ſay) are proofes ſufficient of
what I haue ſaide, and oblige his Maieſtie to
lend his aſſiſtance rather to this then to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
party.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="reason">
               <head>4.</head>
               <p>The fourth induction, is the dangerous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Reuoltes (for with ſuch tearmes doe
they qualifie this change, to make it the more
odyous, without diſtinguiſhing between King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
Electiue and Hereditary; Eſpecially
ſince between Electiue Kingdomes, there is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of Condition as all the world knowes.
And it is to bee noted, that at the Sacring and
Coronation of the Kinges of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the King
firſt ſweares to obſerue the Lawes and Priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the Countrey, and then the people take
the Oath of fidelitie. And at that ioyfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
(as it is tearmed) of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> which is the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15440:6"/>
ſolemnity of Creating and receiuing a newe
Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> it is deliuered in expreſſe
tearmes that hee declares himſelfe fallen from
his Right and Dignity, if hee make not good
the Articles that hee hath promiſed and ſworne
to the people. So did the deceaſed Duke of
<hi>Anion,</hi> laſt Duke of <hi>Brabant</hi> promiſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
in the yeare, 1583. For betweene the

and Cruelties of the Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
exerciſed vpon the Proteſtants and
Catholickes, The Count of <hi>Egmont</hi> (whoſe

then was the moſt part of ſo many thouſand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of all Ages, Sexes, and Conditions, whom
hee brag'd, at his departure thence, that he had
made an end of by the hand of the Hangman.
And it is moſt true, that the inhumane and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
courſes taken by the Count of <hi>Bucquoy,</hi>
for theſe fifteene or ſixteene Monthes, in the
Warre againſt the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> thinking with
Fire and Sword to bring them to obedience
(which is wiſdome againſt the hayre) ſerued
but to haſten the reiection of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and the
Election of <hi>Fredericke:</hi> Not to mention the
obſtinate denyall, made to admit or heare the
Deputies of the Eſtates of that Kingdome, and
of the Prouinces incorporate vnto it, at the

laſt aſſembly at <hi>Franckfort,</hi> when the ſaide <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi>
was aduaunced to the Crowne Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
And of this kinde of wiſdome, was alſo
the Refuſall made lately by the ſame Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> to his Subiectes, of the lower
<hi>Auſtria,</hi> and <hi>Stiria,</hi> who made offer to ſerue
him with their Liues and goods, in withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Inuaſions of the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
that hee would Confirme their Priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and graunt them free vſe of their Religion:
It is hee himſelfe, that in the like caſe ſaide
once, That he had rather bee a Prince without
Subiects, then to haue any, of a contrary Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to his owne. This humour of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in that Language, made ſuch an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
and apprehenſion of him in his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
(though hee be held otherwiſe a Good
and a wiſe Prince) as it was not the leaſt reaſon
of the Alteration wee now ſee. Happy are
thoſe Princes, that hauing neede of Counſell,
are able to make choyce of Wiſe and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Councellours, ſuch as haue no other ayme
but their Maiſters aduauntage, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to their owne particuler intereſt. There
haue beene in this Houſe, Great and Famous
Princes for Valour and Vertue, but theſe of

               <p>The Fift and laſt, principall reaſon is, That
the Turke will infallibly, lay holde on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of theſe Combuſtions, to ſerue his
turne, and to aduaunce his Conqueſts, to the
hurt of Chriſtendome; which is not vnlikely?
And if hee doe it not, it is either the fault of
his little wiſdome, or of his weakneſſe; which
yet may bee auoyded by leauing this new King
in quiet Poſſeſſion, now that he is Elected, and
that without Suite or labouring of his owne,
nay without his owne Knowledge, and beeing
forcedly as it were carryed on, by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
of his Friends, to the Acceptance of this
Crowne, which hath beene ſince ſet on his
Head; accompanyed with all the Formes and
Solemnities due and Correſpondent to the
fundamentall and moſt auncient Lawes of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia;</hi>
a Kingdome Free and Priuiledged if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
any: Whereas, on the Contrary, if hee
bee moleſted; and diſpoſſeſſed; Hee will be, by
the law of Nature, and of Reaſon, inforced to
inuite his Friendes and Allyes to ayde him;
As the Princes of <hi>Germany;</hi> the Kings of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi>
and <hi>Sweden;</hi> the <hi>Hans</hi> Townes, and the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:15440:8"/>
Proteſtant Cantons of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> with whom
hee and ſome other Princes of the Vnion, are
Confederate for their common Defence. Not
to ſpeake of <hi>England,</hi> and the Vnited Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
whence hee cannot but receiue Powerfull
ſuccours. Not to ſpeake alſo of certaine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and Eſtates Catholicke, which holde good
Correſpondence with him: Nor of the Prince
of <hi>Tranſiluania,</hi> who offreth him his beſt meanes
and Forces.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, it is a falſe affirmation
that the ſaid King entertayneth Intelligence or
commerce with the <hi>Turke,</hi> hauing Friends ſo
many and ſo mighty in Chriſtendome, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being driuen to ſeeke them elſe where with
ſo great danger. But if the Prince of <hi>Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uania</hi>
