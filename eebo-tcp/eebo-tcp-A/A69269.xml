            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ouer-ruled mee, and enforced

I found the Caſe

in Opinion (though the

ſeemed to mee to be both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent

proper and fit to bee ſpoken by

            <p>The Defendants pleade, that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife

            </p>
            <p>And the Defendants ſay further, That

            <p>This is the ſpeciall Caſe now depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

               </note> theſe
Commiſſioners beganne their Treatie. Of
the graue and iudicious Courſe which
they held, in debating of the Matter then
propounded, I will forbeare to ſpeake:
But for this point of Naturalization now
in queſtion, their reſolution in the end
was thus:</p>
            <p>That it ſhall bee propounded to both
the Parliaments at the next Seſsions,<note place="margin">The reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners.</note> that
an Act be made containing a declaration,
as followeth: That all the Subiects of both

the late Qu. of <hi>England</hi> of happie
memory, and all that ſhalbe borne hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vnder the obedience of his Maieſtie,

Lawes of both the Realmes, and ſhall
be for euer, inhabled to obtaine, ſucceede,
inherite, and poſſeſſe all <hi>Lands, Goods,</hi> and
<hi>Chattels,</hi> &amp;c. as fully and amply as the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
of either Realme: reſpectiuely might
haue done, or may doe in any ſort with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Kingdome where they were borne.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:366:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
This, after long debating, and graue and
deliberate conſideration, was, in the end,
the reſolution of the greater part of the
Commiſſioners, not one openly gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying
it. And diuerſe of the principall
Iudges of the Realme were preſent at all
times when the point was debated. And
herein I note the wiſe and iudicious forme
of that reſolution, which was not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
to the Parliament the making of a
new Lawe, but a declaration of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Lawes of both the Realmes in this
queſtion.</p>
            <p>Now, if wee conſider who theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
were, what Lords of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Houſe, and what perſons of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Houſe, ſelected of all degrees, moſt
eminent for their learning and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as well in Ciuile and Common Law,
as in knowledge, and experience other
waies, beeing aſſiſted by the graue Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the Realme: If this, I ſay, be well
conſidered, then this Reſolution muſt be
accompted and eſteemed as a matter of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:366:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great and weighty importance, and much
to be regarded in the deciding of this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
            <p>According to this Act of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners,<note place="margin">The Iudges opinion in Parliament.</note>
the Caſe was propounded in the
next Seſsion of Parliament. In the higher
Houſe, the Iudges were required to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
their opinions. There were then elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
Iudges preſent; whereof tenne did
with one vniforme conſent affirme the
Lawe to be, That the <hi>Post-nati</hi> were not
Aliens, but naturall Subiects (one onely
diſſenting.) After this, the Queſtion was
debated in a ſolemne Conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
both the Houſes of Parliament at
ſeuerall times, and at great length, and
with much libertie: Nothing was omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that Wit or Art could inuent to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
againſt this opinion; And that was
done by men of great learning, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
iudgement in the Common Lawe,
and Ciuile Lawe; and by ſome other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of the Common Houſe, of rare
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:366:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
gifts for their learning knowledge, elocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and experience.</p>
            <p>At this Conference the Iudges were
preſent; who, after they had heard all
that was, or could be ſaid, did confirme
their former opinions, which they had
before deliuered in the higher Houſe:
Three of the chiefe of them declaring
their reaſons, and all the reſt (ſauing one
alone) concurring in the ſame. So, here
was now a generall reſolution by all the
Iudges of the Realme (one excepted)
and that deliuered, not priuately, but in
Parliament; which without more adoe
had beene ſufficient to haue decided and
determined this Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Touching the Proclamation,<note place="margin">The force and ſtrength of the Kings procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations.</note> it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetely
and modeſtly ſaied by a learned
Gentleman of the lower Houſe. That it
was of great reſpect, and much to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded;
but yet it was not binding, nor
concluding: for, Proclamations can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make, nor declare Lawes: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:366:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that this Proclamation was not
grounded vpon any reſolution of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend

ſome skilfull in the Lawes of this Land.</p>
            <p>Of the ſtrength of Proclamations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made by the King, by the aduiſe of
his Counſell and Iudges, I will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;

bee learned and ſtudious in the Lawes,
and by their profeſſion are to giue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
and to direct themſelues, and others,
to take heede that they doe not contemne,

4 It becomes vs to eſteeme of Iudges
now, as our forefathers eſteemed them in
times paſt; for, as they ſucceede them in
Time and Place (I thanke God, and the
King, I haue neither cauſe to feare any for
diſpleaſure, nor to flatter any for fauour:
wherefore I will neither be afraid, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed
to ſpeake what I thinke:) I ſay
therefore, that as our Iudges now ſucceed
the former Iudges, in Time and Place; ſo
they ſucceede them, and are not inferior to
them in Wiſedome, Learning, Integritie,
and all other iudicious and religious Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
            <p>Then let vs ſee what the wiſedome of
Parliaments in times paſt attributed to
the Iudges opinions declared in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
Of which there bee many Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
but I will trouble you but with two
or three.</p>
            <p>I wil not remember <hi>Richard</hi> the ſeconds
time (of which ſome of our Chroniclers
doe talke idely, and vnderſtand little)
where power and might of ſome potent
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:366:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
perſons oppreſſed iuſtice, and faithfull
Iudges, for expounding the Law ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and truely. The firſt that I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
is this.</p>
            <p>In the Parliament 28. <hi>H. 6. 16. Ianuarij,</hi>
the Commons made ſuite, That <hi>W. de la
Poole</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolke</hi> ſhould bee commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to priſon for many treaſons and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hainous crimes committed by him.
The Lordes in Parliament were in doubt
what anſwer to giue; they demaunded the
opinion of the Iudges: Their opinion
was, That hee ought not to bee commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
And their reaſon was, for that the
Commons did not charge him with anie
particular offence, but with generall
ſlaunders and reports; And therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Specialties were not ſhewed, hee
was not to bee committed. This opinion
was allowed; And thereupon 28. <hi>Ianuarij,</hi>
the Commons exhibited certaine ſpeciall
Articles againſt him, <hi>viz.</hi> That hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
with the French King to inuade
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:366:16"/>
the Realme &amp;c. And thereupon hee was
committed to the Tower.</p>
            <p>2 In the Parliament <hi>Anno 31. H. 6.</hi> in
the vacation (the Parliament being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
by prorogation) <hi>Thomas Thorpe</hi> the
Speaker was condemned in a thouſand
pounds dammages in an action of Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe,
brought againſt him by the Duke
of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and was committed to priſon in
Execution for the ſame. After, when the
Parliament was re-aſſembled, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
made ſuite to the King and the
Lords, to haue <hi>Thorpe</hi> the Speaker deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,
for the good exploite of the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament;
whereupon the Duke of <hi>Yorkes</hi>
Counſell declared the whole Caſe at
large. The Lords demaunded the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Iudges, whether, in that Caſe,
<hi>Thorpe</hi> ought to bee deliuered out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
by Priuiledge of Parliament: The
Iudges made this aunſwere, That they
ought not to determine the Priuiledge of
that high Court of Parliament; But for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:366:16"/>
the declaration of proceeding in lower
Coutts, in caſes where Writtes of <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedeas</hi>
for the priuiledge of the Parliament
be brought vnto them, They aunſwered:
That if any perſon that is a Member of
the Parliament bee arreſted in ſuch caſes
as bee not for treaſon or felonie, or for
ſuretie of Peace, or condemnation had
before the Parliament, it is vſed that ſuch
perſons be releaſed; and may make At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney,
ſo as they may haue their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and libertie, freely to intend the
Parliament. Hereupon it was concluded,
That <hi>Thorpe</hi> ſhould ſtill remaine in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
according to the Lawe, Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the priuiledge of Parliament, and
that hee was the <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>peaker. Which reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was declared to the Commons by
<hi>Walter Moyle,</hi> one of the Kings Serieants
at Lawe. And then the Commons were
commaunded in the Kings name, by the
Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne</hi> (in the abſence of the
Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> then Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor)
to chooſe another Speaker.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:366:17"/>
3 In the Parliament <hi>An. 7. H. 8.</hi> a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
was moued, Whether ſpirituall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
might bee conuented before tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Iudges for criminall cauſes; There ſir
<hi>Iohn Fineux</hi> and the other Iudges deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their opinion, that they might and
ought to bee ſo. And their opinion was
allowed, and maintained by the King and
the Lords: And D. <hi>Standiſh,</hi> who before
had houlden the ſame opinion, was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
from the Biſhops. And it is worth
the noting, what wordes paſſed in that
Caſe betweene the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
and that worthy Iudge <hi>Fineux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 If a Writ of Errour bee brought in
Parliament vpon a Iudgement giuen in
the Kings Bench,<note place="margin">Writs of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſued in parliament.</note> the Lords of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Houſe alone (without the Commons)
are to examine the Errours; But that is
by the aduiſe and Counſell of the Iudges,
who are to informe them what the Lawe
is, and ſo to direct them in their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And if the iudgement bee reuerſed,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:366:17"/>
then commaundement is to bee giuen to
the Lord Chancellour to doe Execution
accordingly. And ſo it was in <hi>Anno 17. R.
2.</hi> in a Writte of Errour brought in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by the Deane and Chapiter of <hi>Lich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi>
againſt the Prior and Couent of <hi>New-port-Panell,</hi>
as appeareth by the Record.
But if the iudgement bee affirmed, then
the Court of the Kings Bench are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
to execution of the Iudgement, as
it appeareth in <hi>Flowerdewes</hi> Caſe <hi>P. 1. H. 7.</hi>
fol. 19. But it is to bee noted, that in all
ſuch Writtes of Errour, the Lords are to
proceede according to the Lawe; and for
their iudgement therein they are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and guided by the Iudges, and doe
not follow their owne opinions or diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>This extrauagant Diſcourſe touching
Proclamations, and Iudges opinions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
in Parliament, and how they
ought to bee regarded, I haue thought
materiall and neceſſarie, both in reſpect
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:366:18"/>
of the time wherein wee liue, and the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which we haue in hand: And theſe bee
thinges which I thinke haue beene too
lightly paſſed ouer: But if you condemne
it as impertinent, I muſt then confeſſe I
haue preſumed too much vpon your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
I pray you beare with mee, it is but
my labour loſt, and a little time miſ-ſpent,
if it ſeeme ſo vnto you: You are wont to
pardon greater faultes; Call it either a
<hi>Paſſe-time,</hi> or <hi>Waste-time,</hi> as pleaſeth
you. Now, to returne to the Caſe we haue
in hand.</p>
            <p>The generall Queſtion hauing had
this paſſage (by Proclamation,<note place="margin">The proceſſe and forme of proceeding in the Caſe of <hi>R. C.</hi> now in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</note> by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
and by debating in Parliament)
remaineth yet without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion or iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And as euerie man abounds in his
owne ſence, ſo euery one is left to his owne
opinion; Specially thoſe that were not
ſatisfied with the graue Reſolution of
the Iudges in Parliament, which (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ſome may tearme and accompt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:366:18"/>
as bare opinions) I muſt alwayes valew,
and eſteeme as a reall and abſolute iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Now, I ſay, this generall Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is reduced to two particular Caſes, and
is iudicially depending in two the higheſt
Courts of Iuſtice in this Realme; and that
is by one Complainant againſt ſeuerall
Defendants for the freehoulde and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
of ſeuerall parcells of Land: and
(as M. Solicitor ſaid well) is a Caſe, not
fained, nor ſurmiſed, but a true Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
true parties: And being <hi>Quaestio
iuris, non facti,</hi> is by both theſe Courts
adiourned hither to bee decided, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by all the Iudges of <hi>England,</hi> as
the rareneſſe of the Caſe, and the weight
and importaunce of it, both for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and the future doth require.</p>
            <p>And the Caſe being of this nature and
qualitie, it is not amiſſe to obſerue the
proceeding in it: for, it is woorth the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing,
and not to bee forgotten. The
Defendants counſell, men of great learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and in their profeſsion inferiour to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:366:19"/>
none of their qualitie and degree, men
conuerſant and well exerciſed in the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
and ſuch as in the great conference
in parliament, moſt of them were ſpecially
ſelected &amp; choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (for ſo they wel deſerued)
as moſt ſufficient, able, and fit, as well for
Learning and Knowledge, as for all other
giftes of Witte and Nature, to handle ſo
great and rare a Queſtion. And although
it hath pleaſed them of their good diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to vſe the paines but of a few in the
debating and arguing of the Caſe at the
Barre: yet no doubt that was done vpon
mature deliberation and conference with
all the reſidue: And whatſoeuer the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
the Learning, the Wiſedome, and
Knowledge of all the others, vpon long
ſtudy could affoorde, was put into the
mouth of thoſe few to ſerue as Organs
and Inſtruments to deliuer it vnto vs;
which they haue ſo well and ſufficiently
performed, that they deſerue great praiſe
and commendation: For, in my poore
opinion, the witte of man could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:366:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to ſay more touching this Queſtion
in Lawe than they haue ſaied. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
hath beene ſithence ſpoken for that
part, it is for the Matter but the ſame in
ſubſtance, which the counſell at the Barre
did deliuer; though it hath beene vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in forme, and amplified with other
wordes and phraſes, and furniſhed with
ſhew of ſome other ſtrained Caſes and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities.</p>
            <p>The handling of it by the learned and
reuerend Iudges, hath beene ſuch, as it
may appeare to the world, that euerie
one hath ſpoken his owne heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
and hath laboured by long ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to ſearch out the Lawe and the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Lawe in this rare Caſe; and ſo
they haue ſpoken, as <hi>Coram Deo &amp; Angelis:</hi>
None, with deſire to ſeeme popular; for
nothing ought to bee <hi>tam populare quam
veritas:</hi> None to ſeeme to be Time-ſeruers,
or Men pleaſers; for the King (whome
vnder God they ſerue) being <hi>Pater patriae,</hi>
and ſoueraigne head of both theſe great
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:366:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vnited Kingdomes, is to them both, like
as the head of a naturall body is to all the
Members of the ſame, and is not, nor can
not bee partiall more to one than to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Hee deliteth in truth, and deſireth
it; and without truth hee can not bee
pleaſed. Hee ruleth by his Lawe, and
commaundeth his Iudges to miniſter to
all his Subiects Lawe and Iuſtice ſincerely,
and truely; and equally and indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
without any partiall reſpect.</p>
            <p>It was neuer ſeene, but that in all rare
and difficult Caſes, there haue beene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie
of Opinions; but yet without
breach of Charitie, which is the Bond
of Vnitie. So it hath happened in this
Caſe. The Caſe hath beene argued at
large by foureteene learned Iudges;
twelue of them haue concurred in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but vpon ſeuerall reaſons: for, as
many wayes may leade to one end of the
iourney; ſo diuerſe and ſeuerall reaſons
may conduce to one true and certaine
concluſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:366:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And here I may not omit the woorthie
memorie of the late graue and reuerend
Iudge, Sir <hi>Iohn Popham,</hi> chiefe Iuſtice of
the Kings Bench deceaſed (a man of great
wiſedome, and of ſingular learning and
iudgement in the Lawe) who was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
of the ſame opinion, as he often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
as well in open Parliament, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Thomas</hi> doubted of the
Reſurrection of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt,
when all the reſt of the Apoſtles did firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beleeue it: But that his doubting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
in the whole Church, the Faith of
the Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>The two woorthy and learned Iudges
that haue doubted in this Caſe, as they
beare his Name, ſo I doubt not but their
doubting hath giuen occaſion to cleare
the doubt in others; and ſo to confirme
in both the Kingdomes, both for the
Preſent and the Future, the truth of the
iudgement in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:366:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thus, my Lords, haue you hitherto no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from mee but <hi>Amen,</hi> to that which all
the Iudges (ſauing two) haue ſaied; and
much more you cannot expect from mee:
Yet, ſince I muſt giue iudgement in this
Caſe; and I ſaied in the beginning, that I
would render the reaſons of my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
(for that is the courſe of argument
I muſt houlde) I will now deliuer vnto
you, what are the ſpeciall and principall
reaſons that firſt haue induced mee, and
ſtill mooue mee to houlde the opinion
that I doe: And as I goe, I will indeuour
to cleere ſome doubts and queſtions, that
partly in the conference in Parliament,
and partly otherwiſe, I haue heard made;
not onely touching this Caſe it ſelfe, but
alſo touching the forme and manner how
it is to be decided and iudged.</p>
            <p>The Caſe is rare,<note place="margin">How this Caſe is to be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and by what Law.</note> and new (as it hath
beene often ſaied) it was neuer decided
<hi>Terminis terminantibus;</hi> It was neuer iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by any Statute Lawe, which is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:366:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lawe; nor by iudgement of the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the common Lawe.</p>
            <p>Now, the firſt Queſtion is (as ſome
would haue it) How it is to be iudged,
and by what Lawe; and haue wiſhed that
it might haue ſtayed vntill the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſo bee decided by Parliament.
They that make this doubt, I will let them
demurre, and die in their doubts: For,
the Caſe beeing adiourned hither before
all the Iudges of <hi>England,</hi> is now to be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by them according to the common
Lawe of <hi>England;</hi> and not tarrie for a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:
For, it is no tranſcendent Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
but that the common Lawe can
and ought to rule it, and ouer-rule it, as
Iuſtice <hi>Williams</hi> ſaid well.</p>
            <p>But then this Queſtion produceth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;<note place="margin">What is the common Law of England: &amp; whether it be <hi>Ius ſcriptum</hi>
               </note> That is, What is the Common
Lawe of <hi>England;</hi> Whether it be <hi>Ius ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
or <hi>non ſcriptum;</hi> and ſuch other like
niceties: For, wee haue in this Age ſo
many Queſtioniſts;<note place="margin">Questionists</note> and <hi>Quo modo</hi> and
<hi>Quare,</hi> are ſo common in moſt mens
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:366:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mouthes, that they leaue neither Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor Lawe, nor King nor Counſell,
nor Policie, nor Gouernment out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
            <p>And the end they haue in this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
What is the Common Lawe? is to
ſhake and weaken the ground and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of all gouernement: And in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Queſtion of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> to
ouerthrow that Law whereby this Realme
hath many hundred yeares beene gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in all honour and happineſſe: or at
leaſt to caſt an aſperſion vpon it, as
though it were weake and vncertaine. I
will therefore declare mine opinion in
this point plainely and confidently, as I
thinke in my conſcience, and as I finde to
be ſufficiently warranted by ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and good authorities voide of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            <p>The common Law of <hi>England</hi> is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon the Law of God,<note place="margin">The ground of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law.</note> and extendes it

            <p>Wherein I note theſe three thinges:
Firſt, The Clerkes are to agree; and if
they agree, that is an end, and ſtandes
for Lawe, and then no referrement to the
Parliament. Second, If the Clerks agree
not, and ſo the Caſe be referred to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
Then <hi>De Conſenſu Iuriſperitorum
fiat Breue:</hi> So <hi>Conſenſus Iuriſperitorum</hi> is the
Rule, and not the multitude of vulgar opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
The third is, That Iuſtice faile not
them which complaine: Which will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
faile, if you ſtay vntill a Parliament:
For Parliaments are not to be called for the
wrong of a few priuate Subiects: but for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:366:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the great and vrgent affaires of the King
and the Realme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I finde alſo a like Rule in the Ciuile
Lawe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vbi non eſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recta Lex &amp;c.</note> Vbi non est directa lex ſtandum est ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrio
Iudicis, vel produce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dum ad ſimilia. <hi>And
another ſaith,</hi> De ſimilibus ad ſimilia iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
&amp; argumentatio recipiuntur.</p>
            <p>4 Beſides theſe,<note place="margin">Rex ſolus iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, &amp;c.</note> there is an other
generall and certaine Rule in the Ciuile
Lawe, which I reſerue to the laſt parte of
that which I meane to ſpeake in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>So, leauing that vnto a more proper
place, I will hereupon conclude, That
if there bee no former Iudgements, nor
Examples, nor Precedents to bee found,
then <hi>Concordia Clericorum,</hi> &amp; <hi>Arbitrium Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicum</hi>
is to ſeeke out the true and ſolide
reaſon; and thereupon to ground their
Iudgements in all new Caſes: For it was
truely ſaide by a learned Gentleman of the
lower Houſe, <hi>Deficiente lege recurrendum eſt
ad conſuetudinem: Deficiente conſuetudine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currendum
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:366:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ad rationem.</hi> And ſo from the
Iudges we ſhall haue <hi>Reſponſa prudentum</hi> to
decide all ſuch new Caſes and Queſtions.
And according to this Rule, all ſuch new
doubts and queſtions haue beene reſolued
and decided by the graue Iudges in former
times.</p>
            <p>But here,<note place="margin">A requeſt to the profeſſors of the Ciuile Lawe.</note> before I proceede further, I
am to make a ſuite, which is this:</p>
            <p>That whatſoeuer I haue ſpoken, or
ſhall happen to ſpeake of the Ciuile Lawe;
or whatſoeuer I ſhall cite out of any Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of that Lawe, I pray fauour my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
that profeſſe it. I acknowledge that
Lawe to be auncient and generall in many
parts of the world; and I reuerence the
profeſſors of it, as men of great learning,
wiſedome, and iudgement. I profeſſe it
not; I haue learned little of it; but in that
little I haue found that in the reall and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall
partes of Iuſtice, the Ciuile and
common Lawe doe in many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre,
though they differ much in the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:366:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
forme and manner of proceeding. And
that which I ſhall haue occaſion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
of that Lawe, will bee to ſhew how
the common Law and Ciuile doe agree in
one reaſon and iudgement in thoſe things
which I ſhall ſpeake of.</p>
            <p>Yet I muſt take libertie to ſay, That
neither in <hi>Spaine,</hi> nor in <hi>France</hi> (thoſe two
great Monarchies) it is not generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
nor allowed as a concluding and bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Law.</p>
            <p>They take there the reaſon of it onelie
as a directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their proceeding &amp; iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But to produce or alleadge it as a
concluding or binding Law, was no leſſe
than <hi>Capitis poena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>In ciuile cauſes in auncient time, the
Lawe was houlden, That hee in Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

was often iudged otherwiſe; and ſo is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:366:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the common experience and practiſe at
this day.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Anno 40. Ed. 3. 28. Fynchden,</hi> chiefe
Iuſtice of the common place, ſaith, that
in ancient time the Vicar could not haue
an Action againſt the Parſon; But hee
ſaieth the contrarie is vſed at this day,
which is the better.</p>
            <p>In ancient time a Diſſeiſee could not

            <p>By this Rule it is alſo,<note place="margin">Conſtruction of words.</note> that words are

and many other like: And of all

               <item>3. That before <hi>Anno 19. Edw. 3.</hi> there

            <p>If it be ſaid (for ſo ſome haue ſaid) That
if this be thus,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> then the common Lawe of
<hi>England</hi> is vncerten;<note place="margin">That the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon Lawe is vncerten.</note> and ſo the rule of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
by which the people are gouerned,
is too pliable, and too weake, and vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:366:34"/>
By the ſame reaſon it may be ſaid,<note place="margin">Reſponſ.</note> That
all the Lawes of all Nations are vncerten:
For, in the Ciuile Lawe, which is taken to
be the moſt vniuerſall and generall Lawe
in the world, they hould the ſame rule
and order in all caſes which be out of the
direct words of the Lawe; and ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
be infinite: For, as I ſaide, new caſes
ſpring euery day as malice and fraude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth.
And ſince the Roman Impire
beganne, moſt of their Lawes bee either
<hi>Edicta Principum,</hi> or <hi>Arbitria Iudicum,</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſa
prudentum.</hi> And in their Iudgements
they are guided by Arreſts and former
Iudgements, as may appeare in the Books
of many that haue collected ſuch Arreſts.
And they attribute ſo much to ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Iudgements, That as <hi>Pryſot</hi> equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
them to a Poſitiue Lawe, ſo they
hould, that <hi>Sententia facit Ius, &amp; res iudicata
pro veritate accipitur, &amp; legis interpretatio legis
vim obtinet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay (which is more vncerten) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they relie vpon Doctours opinions
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:366:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deliuered in their Prelections and Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
And when they finde them varying,
and differing one from another (as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they doe) then they preferre that
which is <hi>Communior opinio:</hi> And ſo in good
reaſon they may: For, <hi>Pluralitas idem ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientium,
ſemper ſuperat; quia faciliùs inuenitur
quod à pluribus quaeritur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to conclude this point, I would
aske of theſe Noueliſts, what they would
haue done in <hi>Sibill Belknappes</hi> caſe; if they
had liued in <hi>Henry</hi> the fourths time?</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Belknappe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">M. 2. H. 4. 7.</note> that reuerend and
learned Iudge, of whome ſundrie noble
and worthy perſons, and ſome now of
great &amp; eminent place in <hi>England</hi> are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,
was baniſhed out of the Realme,
<hi>(Relegatus in vaſconiam,)</hi> not for any deſert
or offence of his, but by the might of his
potent enemies, and malice of the time.
The Lady his wife continued in <hi>England;</hi>
ſhe was wronged; ſhe brought a Writ in
her owne Name alone, not naming her
Husband. Exception was taken againſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:366:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it, becauſe her husband was liuing; and
it was adiudged good, and ſhee recouered:
and the Iudge <hi>Markeham</hi> ſaid;</p>
            <q>
               <l>Ecce modo miru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quòd foemina fert breue regis,</l>
               <l>Non nominando virum coniunctu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> robore legis.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Here was a rare and a new caſe, yet it
was not deferred vntill a Parliament: it
was iudged, and her wrong was righted
by the common Law of <hi>England,</hi> and that
<hi>Ex arbitrio Iudicum, &amp; ex reſponſis pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi>
and yet it was counted <hi>Mirum</hi> with an
<hi>Ecce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to apply this to <hi>R. Caluines</hi> caſe:
his caſe is rare and new, ſo was that: There
is no direct Law for him in preciſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
tearmes: There was neuer iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before touching any borne in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
ſince King <hi>Iames</hi> beganne his happie
raigne in <hi>England:</hi> Hee is the firſt that is
brought in queſtion: So there was no
direct Lawe for <hi>Sibill Belknap</hi> to ſue in her
owne name without her husband, who
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:366:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was then liuing: nay rather there was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Lawe againſt it; yet by the Lawe of
<hi>England</hi> ſhee had iudgement to recouer
with an <hi>Ecce modo mirum:</hi> So by the lawe
of <hi>England</hi> iudgement ought to bee giuen
for <hi>Robert Caluine,</hi> but not with an <hi>Ecce mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
mirum;</hi> but vpon ſtrong Arguments
deduced <hi>à ſimilibus,</hi> and <hi>ex dictamine rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I come to thoſe arguments,
I wil vſe a few words more touching ſome
Rules which I haue read for the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of lawes.</p>
            <p>There is a graue and learned Writer in
the Ciuile Lawe that ſetteth downe foure
waies &amp; formes of interpretation of lawes:<note place="margin">Note foure formes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Lawes.</note>
that is, firſt, <hi>Interpretatio historica;</hi> ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Etymologica;</hi> thirdly, <hi>Analogica;</hi> fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Practica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Argument of this Caſe all theſe
formes haue beene vſed, and largely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
and the two firſt be thoſe that ſeeme
but light to me, and therefore in mine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:366:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
haue beene too much ſtoode vpon,
and ouer-weighed.</p>
            <p>For the Hiſtoricall interpretation,<note place="margin">Historica.</note> it
is alwaies darke, obſcure, and vncerten, of
what kingdome, countrey, or place ſoeuer
you ſpeake; I doe alwaies and onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the diuine Hiſtories written in the
Bible.</p>
            <p>Liuy <hi>ſaith,</hi> In tanta rerum vetustate multi
temporis errores implicantur.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſpeaking of the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Bookes of <hi>Henoch</hi> ſaieth, <hi>Libri isti ob
nimiam antiquitatem reijciuntur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, for this parte let this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
whether in the beginning there were
one or ſeuerall Kingdomes in great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine;</hi>
or one or ſeuerall Monarches and
Kings of theſe two great &amp; famous King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
in great <hi>Britaine.</hi> The King our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
is lawfully and lineally deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of the firſt great Monarchs and Kings
of both the Kingdomes;<note place="margin">Fergus.</note> and that by ſo
long a continued line of lawfull diſcent,<note place="margin">Inas.</note> as
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:366:37"/>
therein he exceedeth all the Kings that the
world now knoweth; and therefore to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
further of Hiſtoricall knowledge in
this Caſe, I hould it needeleſſe.</p>
            <p>For the Etymologicall interpretation,<note place="margin">Etymologica</note>
there hath beene very much ſaied, euen as
much as Wit and Art could deuiſe: There
haue beene alleadged manie Definitions,
Deſcriptions, Diſtinctions, Differences,
Diuiſions, Subdiuiſions, Alluſion of
wordes, Extenſion of wordes, Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of words; and nothing left vnſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to finde what is <hi>Ligeantia, Allegiantia,
Fides, Obedientia, Subiectio, Subditi;</hi> And
who bee <hi>Aborigines, Indigenae, Alienigenae,
Aduenticij, Denizati, &amp;c.</hi> And much of this
hath beene drawne out of ſome Writers
of the Ciuile Lawe; amongſt whome the
Etymologicall interpretation of the
words <hi>Ligeus,</hi> and <hi>Ligeantia,</hi> is as vncerten
and doubtfull, as it is with our common
Lawyers; And ſo vpon any of theſe there
cannot be any certen Rule found for Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:366:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to iudge by, eſpecially in new and rare
Caſes.</p>
            <p>As for Definition, <hi>Vlpian</hi> teacheth vs,
<hi>Omnis definitio in iure Ciuili eſt periculoſa:</hi> and
it is ſaid, that <hi>Definitio est duplex: Propria,
quae constat ex genere, &amp; differentia: Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pria,
quae &amp; deſcriptio vocatur, &amp; est quaeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
rei deſignatio:</hi> So Definition and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
are often confounded, and both
vncerten. Then, ſince both be vncerten and
dangerous, I will leaue both, and ſeeke a
more certen Rule to iudge by.</p>
            <p>As for Etymologie of words, I agree
with him which ſaieth, It is <hi>Leuis &amp; fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax,
&amp; plerumque ridicula.</hi> It is a Pedant
Grammarians fault. <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> and
others haue beene noted for it. And
if you examine the Examples which
ſome doe bring, you will perceiue how
ridiculous and vaine it is. So this Rule
will not ſerue to finde out that which
wee ſeeke for: Theſe bee but <hi>Tendiculae
verborum, &amp; Aucupationes ſyllabarum</hi> as one
calleth them: It may haue ſome vſe, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:366:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſerue a turne in Schooles, but it is too light
for iudgements in Lawe, and for the ſeates
of Iuſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſetteth downe a more certen
Rule, <hi>In vocibus videndum, non tàm à quo,
quàm ad quid ſumantur.</hi> And words ſhould
be taken <hi>Senſu currenti:</hi> for Vſe &amp; Cuſtome
is the beſt Expoſitor both of Lawes and
Wordes, <hi>Quem penes arbitrium &amp; ius &amp;
norma loquendi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, of the many and diuerſe
diſtinctions, diuiſions, and ſubdiuiſions,
that haue beene made in this Caſe, I will
ſay no more but, <hi>Confuſum est quicquid in
puluerem ſectum est:</hi> and will conclude with
Biſhop <hi>Iuel; A man may wander and miſſe his
way in Mists of Distinctions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then leauing theſe Hiſtoricall and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymologicall
interpretations,<note place="margin">Ligeantia ſenſu currenti eſt vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum fidei &amp;c.</note> and theſe
curious and ſubtile Diſtinctions and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions,
I ſay, <hi>Ligeantia,</hi> or <hi>Allegiantia</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<hi>Senſu currenti,</hi> is <hi>vinculum fidei &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedientiae,</hi>
as Iuſtice <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaid well. And
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:366:38"/>
hee that is borne in any of the Kings Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
and vnder the Kings obedience,
is the Kings liege ſubiect, and borne <hi>Ad
fidem Regis</hi> (for that is the proper and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
word which the lawe of <hi>England</hi> hath
vſed; <hi>Ad fidem Regis Angliae, Ad fidem Regis
Franciae)</hi> and therefore hee cannot bee a
Stranger or <hi>Alien</hi> to the King, or in any of
his Kingdomes; and by conſequence, is
inhabled to haue lands in <hi>England,</hi> and to
ſue, and be ſued in any Reall action for the
ſame.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Ligeantia</hi> hath ſometimes a more
large Extenſion: For, hee that is an <hi>Alien</hi>
borne out of the kings Dominions, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the obedience of another king, if hee
dwell in <hi>England,</hi> and be protected by the
king and his Lawes, hee oweth to the
king the duetie of <hi>Allegeance;</hi> and ſo hee is
<hi>Ligatus Regi,</hi> and <hi>Ligeus Regis:</hi> and if hee
commit treaſon, the Indictment ſhall bee
<hi>contra ligeantiae ſuae debitum,</hi> as it was in <hi>Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
the French-mans Caſe: yet is hee not
the Kings ſubiect: for, hee was not borne
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:366:39"/>
               <hi>Ad fidem Regis;</hi> But, this is not that Lige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
which wee muſt finde: For, in a true
and lawfull ſubiect, there muſt bee <hi>Subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio,
fides, &amp; obedientia;</hi> and thoſe cannot
bee ſeuered, no more than true Faith and
Charitie in a true Chriſtian. And hee that
hath theſe three <hi>à natiuitate,</hi> is <hi>Ligeus Regis,</hi>
and can not bee a Stranger or <hi>Alien</hi> to the
King, or in his Kingdomes. And that
it is ſo, may be proued by the Rule of the
other two interpretations of Lawe; That
is,<note place="margin">Analogica.</note> 
               <hi>Analogica, &amp; Practica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> hath now the Kingdomes
of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the
Iſles of <hi>Gernſey,</hi> and <hi>Ierſey</hi> by diſcent; all
theſe bee his Dominions, and vnder his
ſubiection and obedience.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond had <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Normandy</hi> by diſcent, from his mother
<hi>Mawd</hi> the Empreſſe; and <hi>Aniow,</hi> and <hi>Maine</hi>
by diſcent from his father <hi>Geffery Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genet;</hi>
and <hi>Ireland</hi> by conqueſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the third had <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:366:39"/>
by diſcent from his Grand-father <hi>Henry</hi>
the ſecond: and <hi>Aquitany</hi> by diſcent from
his Grand-Mother Queene <hi>Elenor</hi> wife to
King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, and daughter to
the duke of <hi>Aquitany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt had all the ſame by
diſcent; and parte of <hi>Scotland</hi> by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Edward</hi> the
third had all the ſame by diſcent alſo:
and beſides, <hi>Edward</hi> the third claimed all
<hi>France</hi> by diſcent from his mother Queene
<hi>Iſabell,</hi> and had the moſt part of it in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion;
and ſo had <hi>Henry</hi> the fift and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the ſixt alſo.</p>
            <p>Now if in theſe kings times, ſubiectes
borne in thoſe Countries, being then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their obedience, vvere no <hi>Aliens,</hi> but
capable of landes in <hi>England:</hi> And if at
this time ſubiects borne in <hi>Irela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,</hi> or <hi>Gern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi>
and <hi>Ierſey</hi> be no <hi>Aliens,</hi> but capable of
lands in <hi>England;</hi> then, by an Analogicall
interpretation, why ſhould not ſubiectes
borne in <hi>Scotland</hi> be at this time in like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree?
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:366:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For, in proportion, and in likeneſſe,
and conueniencie, there can bee no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
at all.</p>
            <p>But whether the ſubiects borne in thoſe
Countries in the time of thoſe kings vvere
then capable of lands in <hi>England</hi> as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ſubiects;<note place="margin">Practica: &amp; ſic ad ſimilia.</note> or were deemed <hi>Aliens,</hi> is the

in Diuinitie <hi>Praxis ſanctorum est interpres

            </p>
            <p>Now then the Queſtion is, Whether

that be <hi>Post-nati,</hi> may be reſembled to the

<hi>Gaſcoyne,</hi> and parte of <hi>Scotland</hi> in former
times, when the ſame were the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and vnder the obedience of the King

points materiall concerning this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they are alike, though not in all things:
(for, then it were <hi>Idem,</hi> and not <hi>Simile:)</hi>
and this can not bee better vnderſtoode,
than by examining the Obiections to the

and the Conquerour may impoſe

not the true parts of a difference: for thoſe
that are borue in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and thoſe that
are borne in <hi>Scotland,</hi> are all alike for their
birth within the Kings Dominions, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:366:41"/>
are borne vnder the like ſubiection and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the King, and haue the like
bond; Nay, euen the ſame bond of <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance;</hi>
That is, they are borne <hi>Ad fidem
Regis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, where it is ſaid, The Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
may impoſe what Lawes hee will:
Then conſider how it was in the <hi>Interim</hi>
before King <hi>Iohn</hi> gaue lawes to <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, which is more, I aske whether
the Conquerour of <hi>Ireland</hi> can giue new
lawes to <hi>England,</hi> and make Iriſh men to
bee as naturall borne ſubiectes in <hi>England</hi>
(if their birth-right doe not giue it them)
which before the Conqueſt they were
not? for, that is properly the Queſtion:
But if any difference bee, the Caſe of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
is the ſtronger: For, (as Iuſtice <hi>Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerton</hi>
ſaide) that is by an vndoubted Title
made by lawe; the other by a doubtfull
Title wonne by the Sword.</p>
            <p>But leaue <hi>Ireland</hi> gotten by Conqueſt;<note place="margin">France.</note>
vvhat ſay you to the great kingdome of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:366:41"/>
               <hi>France;</hi> which <hi>Edward</hi> the third had firſt
in right by lawfull deſcent, and after in
poſſeſsion by triumphant Conqueſt; and
vvhich <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixt held after in poſſeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by deſcent? Was euer doubt made,
Whether the ſubiects borne there ſo long
as it vvas in ſubiection and obedience to
the King, vvere capable of landes in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I vvill now turne the Caſe, and aske an
other Queſtion; If King <hi>Iames</hi> our Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
had firſt beene King of <hi>England</hi> by
lavvfull deſcent (as novv hee is) and after
<hi>Scotland</hi> had deſcended vnto him, ſhould
not the Subiects of <hi>Scotland</hi> (I ſpeake ſtill
of <hi>Post-nati)</hi> haue beene iudged as Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ſubiects in <hi>England,</hi> as thoſe of <hi>France</hi>
were in <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds time?</p>
            <p>Then, he hauing now both kingdomes
by lineall, true, and lavvfull deſcent, it can
make no difference touching the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Subiects, vvhich kingdome deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to him firſt, and vvhich ſecond; but
both are to him alike. And it is cleere,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:366:42"/>
               <hi>Post-nati</hi> in <hi>England</hi> are now capable and
inheritable in <hi>Scotland,</hi> though ſome haue
made a cauſeleſſe and needeleſſe doubt
of it: and ſo on the other ſide thoſe of
<hi>Scotland</hi> are in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſaid,<note place="margin">Normandy and Aquitany.</note> 
               <hi>Normandie</hi> and <hi>Aquitanie</hi> were
no monarchies or kingdomes,<note place="margin">Obiect. 2.</note> but duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
or ſeigniories in <hi>France,</hi> and holden
of the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> and therefore not
to bee reſembled to <hi>Scotland,</hi> which is an
ancient and abſolute kingdome.</p>
            <p>This Obiection reacheth not to the
reaſon of our Queſtion:<note place="margin">Reſponſ.</note> For, bee they
kingdomes, bee they Seigniories, yet the
ſubiectes borne there, were borne out of
the kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
Aliens: But in that they were borne
within the kings dominions, and vnder
his ſubiection and obedience, they were
no Aliens but liege and naturall borne
ſubiectes to the King; and ſo capable and
inheritable in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:366:42"/>
I ſay beſides, the Dukes of <hi>Normandie</hi>
and <hi>Aquitany</hi> were abſolute Princes, and
had ſoueraigne power in thoſe countries,
although they did not beare the name of
kings; as at this time the Duke of <hi>Sauoy;</hi>
the duke of <hi>Florence;</hi> the Duke and State
of <hi>Venice;</hi> and of late, the great Duke of
<hi>Ruſsia;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke
of <hi>Austria,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So the difference in Stile and Name
makes no difference in Soueraignty: For,
king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight had as abſolute ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignetie
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> vvhen his Stile was
Lord of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as when hee changed his
Stile, and was called, <hi>King of Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, to ſay, That the tenure of the
Crowne of <hi>Fraunce</hi> ſhould giue any priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to them of <hi>Normandie</hi> and <hi>Aquitanie</hi>
in <hi>England</hi> is a ſtrange conceipt; It might
rather bee obiected againſt them. But, as I
ſaied before, they were borne within the
kings Dominions, and vnder his obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance,
and therefore as ſubiects borne in
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:366:43"/>
And if men may beleeue ſome auncient
Stories, <hi>Aquitany</hi> and <hi>Normandy</hi> had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
kings, and were kingdoms of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues:
and not depending nor ſubiect to
the Crowne of <hi>France:</hi> and the kingdome
of <hi>France</hi> was then a ſmall portion of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
and but a little one, in compariſon of
that which it is at this day. And ſome ſay,
that there were foure and tvventie kings
in <hi>Gaule:</hi> But as the kings of <hi>France</hi> increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in povver and ſtrength, they ſubdued
their neighbor-Princes, and ſo that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
grew to that greatneſſe that novv it
is at; euen as the <hi>Heptarchie</hi> in <hi>England</hi> was
diſſolued, and made an intire kingdome,
when one of the kings mightier than the
reſt ſubdued his neighbors.</p>
            <p>It is ſaied further,<note place="margin">The Crowne and great ſeale of England.</note> that <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitany</hi>
vvere ſubiects to the Crovvne of
<hi>England;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obiect. 3.</note> and to the great Seale of <hi>England;</hi>
but ſo is not <hi>Scotland: Ergo &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſtandeth not wel with that which<note place="margin">Reſponſ.</note>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:366:43"/>
was obiected before; That they were but
Seigniories houlden of the Crowne of
<hi>Fraunce.</hi> And it is true, that before <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the thirds time, thoſe Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
that held thoſe great Seigniories, did
acknowledge, that they held the ſame of
the Crowne of <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But theſe Obiections be light, and not
worth the time that hath beene ſpent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them. The Soueraignetie is in the
perſon of the King; the Crowne is but an
Enſigne of Soueraignety; the Inueſture
and Coronation are but Ceremonies of
honour, and maieſtie: the King is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
and perfect king before he be crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and without thoſe Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>The Seale is to be altered and changed
at the will and pleaſure of the King: hee
may haue one, hee may haue many, as
pleaſeth him. The King did vſe Queene
<hi>Elizabeths</hi> Seale, for diuerſe moneths af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his comming into <hi>England:</hi> Queene
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> vſed king <hi>Philips</hi> &amp; queene <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
Seale for a time; and queene <hi>Marie</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:366:44"/>
king <hi>Edwards</hi> ſeale. And all that vvas
ſo done, was well and lawfully done. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things were done by auncient kings of
<hi>England</hi> before the Conqueſt by their ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature,
and ſigne manuell without anie
ſeale at all; and ſome ſuch ſince the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
alſo: as Graunts made by <hi>Maude</hi> the
Empreſſe to <hi>Albericke de Vere,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>The King may by his great ſeale com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
all his ſubiectes that bee vnder his
obedience whereſoeuer they bee in the
world: So he did in <hi>Normandie;</hi> ſo he did
in <hi>Aquitany;</hi> ſo hee did in that part of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
that he had in poſſeſsion. And in 24.
<hi>Edw. 1.</hi> his Iudges kept ordinary Courts
of iuſtice there: and I haue ſeene the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of <hi>Placita. Exercitus Regis apud Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,
Apud Roxburgh, Apud S. Iohns-towne,
&amp;c. in Scotia.</hi> So hee may commaund his
ſubiects, if they be in <hi>France, Spaine, Rome,</hi>
or <hi>Turkie,</hi> or the <hi>Indies.</hi> And for ſeuerall
ſeales, the Earle of <hi>Chester</hi> had a ſpeciall
ſeale for that his auncient County <hi>Palatine.</hi>
The Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> had a ſpeciall ſeale
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:366:44"/>
for his new Countie <hi>Palatine.</hi> And after,
when theſe Counties came to the kinges
poſſeſsion, the Kinges continued ſeuerall
ſeales in them both for the adminiſtration
of iuſtice; but as ſubordinate to the great
Seale of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I make little doubt, but if the King
ſhall now commaund any of his ſubiects
of <hi>Scotland</hi> vnder his great ſeale of <hi>England,</hi>
they will (as they ought) duetifully obey
him. As in king <hi>Edward</hi> the 1. <hi>Edward</hi> the
2. and <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. times they comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
many of the Lordes of that parte of
<hi>Scotland</hi> which then was vnder their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I finde, that in</hi> 13. Edw. 2. quarto die Iunij,
<hi>the King</hi> Constituit Adomaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> de Valentia co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitem

            </p>
            <p>It is ſaide,<note place="margin">Seueral Laws.</note> that <hi>Scotland</hi> hath Lawes that
are proper for that kingdome,<note place="margin">Obiect. 4.</note> &amp; that they
are not ſubiect to the lawes of <hi>England,</hi> and
ſo <hi>è contra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And laſtly it was ſaide, that in <hi>England</hi>
euery perſon was within the iuriſdiction of
ſome Leete, and at the age of twelue yeares
euery one is to bee ſworne in the Leete to
bee Foiall and Loiall to the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
That is, to the Lawes of <hi>England,</hi>
(for ſo hee vnderſtoode Loiall:) But <hi>Post-nati</hi>
in <hi>Scotland</hi> can not be ſo; and that they
haue an other forme of oathe in <hi>Scotland:
Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:366:45"/>
For this laſt parte,<note place="margin">Reſponſ.</note> of the Oathe in the
Leete, the Lord chiefe Baron did cleere it
ſo plainely, as more needes not to be ſaid.
This is <hi>Legalis ligeantia,</hi> It is not <hi>Alta lige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antia</hi>
by birth, which is that which we haue
now in queſtion.</p>
            <p>The Hiſtoricall diſcourſe that hath bin
made of Leetes, of Law dayes, of <hi>Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
Decennarij,</hi> of the Tenne-mens Tale,
and the Oathe of all Male children of
twelue yeeres, &amp;c. taken at the Leete, is
no newes indeede, it is very olde.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Lambard</hi> hath it all,<note place="margin">Lambard in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatione verbi Centuria.</note> and more
too, at large <hi>in Explicatione verborum</hi> in the
word <hi>Centuria;</hi> It vvas before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
            <p>But it maketh no hing to this naturall
Allegeance and ſubiection of birth; it is
not <hi>Alta ligeantia</hi> by birth-right; it is but
<hi>Legalis ligeantia</hi> by Policie: And <hi>Fitzher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
calleth it <hi>Swearing to the Lawe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if that were the onely Bond and
Marke of Allegeance, many are out of it,
and ſo at libertie. As, children vnder
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:366:46"/>
twelue yeeres; yet ſometimes they may
commit treaſon and felony; where, <hi>Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
ſupplet aetatem:</hi> So women of all ſortes;
yet they may bee ſhrewd and daungerous
traitours; and if they bee women nobly
borne, or widowes that were wiues to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
men, they ſhall be tried <hi>per pares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo Noble men of all ſortes, who are
neither bound to attend the Leete, nor to
take that Oathe, as appeereth by <hi>Britton
cap. 29.</hi> treating of the Court called <hi>The
Shirifes Turne,</hi> out of which the Leete ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to be extracted: For, whatſoeuer is
not preſented in the Leete may bee preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and puniſhed in the <hi>Shirifs Turne.</hi> And
M <hi>Kitchin</hi> citeth <hi>Britton</hi> in this point for
the Leete; and alleadgeth alſo the ſtatute
of <hi>Marlebridge cap. 10.</hi> to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>And at this day the view of Francke-pleges,
and the putting in of Francke-ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and the <hi>Decennarij,</hi> are but bare names
of things paſt, the vſe and ſubſtance is obſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete
and gone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:366:46"/>
And, as it was ſaide, few in this place
haue put in ſuch Pleges, or taken that
Oath, and yet I truſt wee are good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
and beare true faith and allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>But this hath beene ſo fully anſwered
and cleered by the Lord chiefe Baron, and
the Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> chiefe Iuſtice of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
pleas, as I doe wrong to ſpend time
in it.</p>
            <p>But touching the ſeuerall Lawes; I ſay,
that ſeuerall lawes can make no difference
in matter of Soueraigntie; and in the bond
of <hi>Allegeance</hi> and obedience to one King:
And ſo it concludeth nothing for the point
in queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Aquitany</hi> had ſeuerall
lawes differing from the lawes of <hi>England:</hi>
ſo had <hi>Fraunce</hi> in King <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. and
<hi>Henry</hi> the 6. his time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ireland,</hi> before king <hi>Iohns</hi> time continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their auncient Lawes, and ſo, for the
moſt part, haue done euer ſince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gerneſey</hi> and <hi>Ierſey</hi> haue yet at this day
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:366:47"/>
ſeuerall lawes, which, for the moſt part,
were the auncient Lawes and Cuſtomes of
<hi>Normandie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wales</hi> had, &amp; in many things yet haue
ſeuerall Lawes: ſo for the County Palatine
of <hi>Chester</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>Yet theſe neuer were, nor muſt not be
cantelled and cut off from their allegeance
and obedience to the King; nor the Kings
ſubiects borne there be incapable of lands
and inheritaunce in <hi>England:</hi> for vvhere
there is but one Soueraigne, all his ſubiects
borne in all his Dominions bee borne <hi>Ad
fidem Regis;</hi> and are bound to him by one
bond of Faith and Allegeance: And in that,
one is not greater nor leſſer than an other:
nor one to bee preferred before another:
but all to bee obedient alike; and to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
alike; yet vnder ſeuerall Lavves and
Cuſtomes. And as Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſayeth
of the Church, <hi>In vna fide nihil officit
Eccleſiae ſanctae diuerſa conſuetudo.</hi> So I will
conclude for this point, That diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Lavves and Cuſtomes makes no
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:366:47"/>
breach of that vnitie of obedience, faith,
and allegeance which all liege ſubiects
owe to their liege King and Soueraigne
Lord. And as none of them can be Aliens
to the king, ſo none of them can bee Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
or Strangers in any of his kingdomes
or dominions; nor Aliens or ſtrangers
one to another, no more than a Kentiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
to a Cheſhire-man; or <hi>è contra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore all that haue bin borne
in any of the kinges dominions ſince hee
was King of <hi>England,</hi> are capable and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
in all his Dominions without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            <p>And as to the other parte of the Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,<note place="margin">Defect of Triall.</note>
that there will be defect of triall;
for, things done in <hi>Scotland,</hi> cannot bee
tried in <hi>England;</hi> I ſay, that that maketh
little to our preſent Queſtion, whether
<hi>Post-nati</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> be Aliens in <hi>England,</hi>
and not capable of landes in <hi>England:</hi> but
it trencheth to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> caſt ſome aſperſion vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the common lawe of <hi>England;</hi> That
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:366:48"/>
it is not ſufficient to giue iuſtice to the
Kinges ſubiectes for lacke of ſufficient
meanes of triall of queſtions of fact: but
to this baron <hi>Altham</hi> gaue ſo full an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare,
as more cannot bee ſaied: And
ſo hee did both cleare the doubt, and did
vphould the ſufficiencie of the lawe of
<hi>England</hi> in that behalfe. And it ſeemeth
ſtrange, that this ſhould now bee found
out to bee obiected againſt <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſince
it vvas neuer heeretofore obiected for
<hi>France, Normandie, Aquitany,</hi> nor is at this
day for <hi>Ireland, Gerneſey,</hi> and <hi>Ierſey,</hi> &amp;c.
whereas all ſtand vpon the ſame reaſon
for the point of triall. But the wiſedome
of the lawe of <hi>England</hi> hath beene ſuch, as
there neuer failed certen rules for triall of
all queſtions in fact; and thoſe were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and adapted to the Matter which was
to bee tried. And therefore, whoſoeuer
doth diligently obſerue it, hee ſhall finde
in the courſe and practiſe of the lawes of
<hi>England</hi> aboue twenty ſeuerall formes of
trialls: as by Battell; by Iurie, and that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:366:48"/>
in diuerſe kindes; by Wager of Lawe; by
Proofes; by Examination; by Inſpection;
by Certificates of diuerſe kindes; and by
manie other wayes: And leſt there ſhould
bee any defect in that behalfe, the Law
hath prouided ſeuerall formes of <hi>Ioyning
of iſſues;</hi> and in that, hath ſpeciall regard
of things done out of the Realme, as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Student may ſee in the Bookes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.</p>
            <p>Thus I haue paſſed theſe foure Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and therefore for this part I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That if <hi>Argumentum à ſimili</hi> were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
good and concludent in Lawe, my
Lords the Iudges haue prooued this Caſe
by ſo many plaine and direct Examples,
and like Caſes; and by ſo manie ſtrong
arguments &amp; ſolide reaſons drawne out of
Booke Caſes, out of Statutes, out of the
true rules and forme of pleading, and
out of ancient Records and Precedents,
ſome produced by M. Atturney, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
moe remembred by the Iudges, as no
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:366:49"/>
one thing can bee more plainely exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
nor appeare more like to an other,
than this Caſe is to thoſe Caſes which

            <p>Now when wee come to examine by
reaſon, whether <hi>Post-nati</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall
be diſabled as Aliens, or ſhall be capable
of lands in <hi>England,</hi> as naturall borne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
there; wee are firſt to conſider vvhat
is the reaſon whie Aliens in the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and vnder the obedience of other
forraine Princes, are nor capable of landes
in <hi>England:</hi> And ſurely, the true reaſon is,
that which was noted by baron <hi>Altham;</hi>
and hath ſince beene ofte remembred, <hi>viz.</hi>
The danger that might thereby come to
the king and the common-weale: Special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:366:50"/>
by drawing hither too great multitudes
of them: for ſo the Treaſure of the Realme
might bee tranſported by them into other
forraine Kingdomes and Countries;
whereby it might bee vſed againſt the
King, and to the preiudice of the State.
And beſides, they might vnder-hand
practiſe Sedition and Rebellion in the
kingdome, and cauſe many other daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and inconueniences: but that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
cannot ſerue againſt <hi>Post-nati</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
now that there is but one King of
both the kingdomes, no more than it can
ſerue againſt thoſe that are borne in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
or <hi>Gerneſey,</hi> or <hi>Ierſey:</hi> and therefore
in reaſon they are as capable of landes in

               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> were two
ancient ſeuerall kingdomes vnder ſeuerall
kings, and ſeuerall crownes.</p>
            <p>2. That they continue yet ſeueral king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
            <p>3. That they haue yet ſeuerall Lawes,
ſeuerall Seales, ſeuerall Crownes, and ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Kings: For, it is ſaid, though king <hi>Iames</hi>
be king of both, and hath but one naturall
body, yet in iudgement of Law, he is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of his two ſeuerall kingdomes, as
two ſeuerall kings, and the ſubiects of ech
ſeuerall kingdome are bound to him by
diſtinct allegeance, according to the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Lawes of the kingdome where they
were borne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And all this is grounded vpon this rule
or fiction in Lawe:</hi> Quando duo iura concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt
in vna perſona, aequum est ac ſi eſſent in
diuerſis.</p>
            <p>And vpon this ground is this new form
of pleading deuiſed, which the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:366:51"/>
haue vſed in this Caſe, ſuch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be found in any Record, euer to haue
beene pleaded before; and may as well
ſerue againſt the Kinges ſubiectes of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as againſt the <hi>Post-nati</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
And ſithence in former times the like
forme of pleading vvas neuer ſeene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
any of the Kings of <hi>Englandes</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
which were borne in any of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
out of <hi>England,</hi> as in <hi>Normandie</hi> or
<hi>Aquitanie,</hi> or in <hi>France</hi> (I meane ſuch part
of it as was in the Kinges poſſeſsion, and
in ſubiection and obedience to him, and
not in that parte of <hi>France</hi> which his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
helde) it may be probably inferred,
That it was then generally houlden, that
neither ſuch a forme of pleading, nor the
Matter it ſelfe was ſufficient in Lavve to
diſable anie ſuch Plaintife: for, againſt
French-men that vvere not vnder the
Kings obedience wee finde it often plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
And as thoſe that were not ſubiects
to the King, nor borne vnder his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
did then preſume to bring ſuites,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:366:52"/>
and actions in <hi>England.</hi> So it can not bee
thought, but that the king hauing then
ſo large and ample Dominions beyond
the Seas, as <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Aquitany,</hi> and
many other partes of <hi>France,</hi> ſome of his
ſubiects borne there, had cauſe to haue,
and did bring the like ſuites in <hi>England.</hi>
And ſithence no ſuch Plea is found to
haue beene then vſed againſt them, it can
not in Lawe and Reaſon bee now allowed
againſt the <hi>Post-nati</hi> in <hi>Scotland:</hi> For, I may
ſay as <hi>Aſcue</hi> ſaied in 37. <hi>H. 6. Our Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
were as ſage and learned as we be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I ſee not, but that in this Caſe a
good Argument may bee reaſonably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from the Negatiue, as it was in the
Caſe reported by the great learned, and
moſt graue and reuerend Iudge ſir <hi>Iames
Dyer</hi> chiefe Iuſtice of the Common pleas,<note place="margin">P. 23. Elizab. Dyer. 376.</note>
               <hi>Anno 23. Elizab.</hi> The Queſtion there, was,
Whether an erroneous iudgement giuen
in <hi>Rie,</hi> which is a member of the Cinque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes,
might bee reuerſed in the kinges
Bench, or Common place at Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:366:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And it was thus reſolued; <hi>Sed pro eo
quod nullu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tale breue in Registro, nec in aliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
Praecedentibus curiarum praedictaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niri
potuerat, dominus Cancellarius Bromley
per opinionem Capitalium Iuſticiariorum vtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſque
Banci denegauit tale breue concedere.</hi>
And ſo Iuſtice <hi>Fenners</hi> argument houldeth
well, <hi>viz.</hi> There is in this Caſe no lawe to
exclude the Complainant, <hi>Ergo</hi> hee is a
liege and a naturall borne ſubiect.</p>
            <p>But the forme of pleading in the time
of king <hi>Ed. 1.</hi> in <hi>Cobledickes</hi> caſe, which was
cited out of <hi>Hengam,</hi> (and the Booke
ſhewed heere by the Lord chiefe Iuſtice
<hi>Coke)</hi> is ſo direct and plaine for this our
Queſtion, as nothing can be more plaine:
and therefore I thinke it not amiſſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it againe.</p>
            <p>That Caſe was in effect and ſubſtaunce,
thus:</p>
            <p>A woman brought a Writte of <hi>Ayel</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Roger Cobledicke,</hi> and declared of
the ſeiſin of <hi>Roger</hi> her Grand-father, and
conueied the diſcent to <hi>Gilbert</hi> her father;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:366:53"/>
and from him to the Demaundant, as his
daughter and heire. The Tenant pleaded,
that the Demaundant was a French-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and not of the ligeance nor of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie
of <hi>England;</hi> and demaunded iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
if ſhee ought to haue the action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him. This plea vvas houlden to
bee inſufficient; and thereupon the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
amended his plea, and pleaded fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
That the Demaundant was not of
the ligeance of <hi>England,</hi> nor of the fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the King; and demaunded iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
&amp;c. And againſt that plea none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
was taken, but thereupon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundant
prayed licence to depart from
her Writ. By this it appeareth plainely,
that the firſt plea, alleadging that ſhe was
a French-woman, and not of the lige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
nor of the fidelitie of <hi>England,</hi> was
inſufficient (and ſo declared by <hi>Berreford</hi>
the chiefe Iuſtice;) For, there can bee no
fidelitie nor allegeance due to <hi>England,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
the land and ſoile without a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
and King. But the ſecond Plea
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:366:53"/>
alledging, that ſhee was not of the lige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of <hi>England,</hi> nor of the fidelitie of the
King, was good and ſufficient: For, to
the King fidelitie and allegeance is due;
and therefore, ſince ſhee failed in that, ſhe
was not to be anſwered: and thereupon ſhe
praied licence to departe from her Writte,
and ſo ſhe left her ſuite.</p>
            <p>Now,<note place="margin">Stat. 14. Ed. 3.</note> for the reaſons which haue beene
drawne and ſtrained out of the ſtatute <hi>An.
14. Edw. 3.</hi>
               <note place="margin">That the Realme of England ſhall not be ſubiect to France.</note> if they bee well examined, they
ſerue little for this point which we haue in
hand.</p>
            <p>It is to be conſidered, at what time, and
vpon what occaſion that Statute was made:
King <hi>Edw.</hi> the third being right heire to
the Crowne and Kingdome of <hi>Fraunce</hi> by
deſcent from his Mother, and hauing
ſpent many yeeres for the recouering of
the ſame, reſolued to take vpon him the
Name and Stile of <hi>King of France;</hi> being
aduiſed thereunto by them of <hi>Flaunders:</hi>
Hereupon he did take the Stile of <hi>King of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:366:54"/>
Fraunce;</hi> and altered his Seale and his
Armes; and after a while, placed the
Armes of <hi>France</hi> before the ancient Armes
of <hi>England,</hi> as they are borne at this day.
This gaue occaſion for the making of
this ſtatute: for ſome people <hi>(Aſcun gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
ſaith the ſtatute) ſeeing this change,
and conſidering the large and ample ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and the magnificence of that great
Kingdome, beganne to doubt that the king
would make his Imperiall ſeate there; and
conceiued thereby, that the kingdome of
<hi>England,</hi> being the leſſer, ſhould bee in
ſubiection of the king and kingdome of
<hi>France,</hi> being the greater, and to bee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
and ruled by a Vice-Roy, or Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as they ſaw <hi>Ireland</hi> was. And though in
the Kings Stile, <hi>England</hi> was placed before
<hi>France,</hi> yet they ſawe the Armes of <hi>France</hi>
marſhalled before the Armes of <hi>England;</hi>
though at the firſt bearing thereof ſome
ſay it was not ſo.</p>
            <p>To cleere this doubt, and to take away
this feare from the Subiects of <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:366:54"/>
was this Statute made, as doth plainely
appeare by the wordes of the ſtatute it
ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Now if you will make an apt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
application of that Caſe then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Fraunce,</hi> to this our
Caſe now, betweene <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi>
it muſt be thus:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Edw. 3.</hi> then king of <hi>England</hi> (being
the leſſer) had afterwardes the kingdome
of <hi>France</hi> (being the greater) by deſcent,
and tooke the Stile of <hi>King of France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> king of <hi>Scotland</hi> (beeing the
leſſer) hath afterward the kingdome of
<hi>England</hi> (being the greater) by deſcent,
and taketh the Stile of <hi>King of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. King <hi>Ed. 3.</hi> altered his Seale, and his
Armes, and placed the Armes of <hi>Fraunce</hi>
before the Armes of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> hath changed his Seale, and
his Armes in <hi>England,</hi> and hath placed the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:366:55"/>
Armes of <hi>England</hi> before the Armes of
<hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It was then doubted, that King <hi>Edw.
3.</hi> would remoue his Court out of <hi>England,</hi>
the leſſer, and keepe his Imperiall ſeate and
ſtate in <hi>France,</hi> the greater.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> hath indeede remooued his
Court out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the leſſer, and doth
in his royall perſon (with the Queene and
Prince, and all his Children) keepe his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall
ſeate in <hi>England,</hi> the greater.</p>
            <p>4. In al theſe the caſes agree; but yet one
difference there is, and that is in the Stile:
For king <hi>Ed. 3.</hi> in his Stile placed <hi>England,</hi>
the leſſer, being his ancient kingdome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>France,</hi> the greater, being newly deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
vnto him.</p>
            <p>But King <hi>Iames</hi> in his Stile placeth <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the greater, though newly deſcended
vnto him, before <hi>Scotland,</hi> the leſſer, being
his ancient kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:366:55"/>
5. Now, this being thus; perhappes
<hi>Scotland</hi> might out of this Example haue
conceiued the like doubt againſt <hi>England,</hi>
as <hi>England</hi> did then againſt <hi>France:</hi> But as
there was then no doubt made, whether
the kings ſubiects borne in <hi>England</hi> ſhould
be capable of lands in <hi>France;</hi> ſo, out of this
ſtatute, and vpon this example no doubt
can bee inferred, whether the kings ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
now borne in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhall be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of lands in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, all theſe Obiections, and the
ground whereupon they are framed, <hi>viz.
Quando duo iura &amp;c.</hi> haue beene ſo tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
and profoundly examined, and
ſo learnedly and fully anſwered and clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the Iudges, as I make no doubt but
all wiſe and indifferent hearers be well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
therein.</p>
            <p>And if there bee any ſo poſſeſſed with a
preiudicate opinion againſt Trueth, and
Reaſon, that will ſay in their owne heartes
<hi>licèt perſuaſeris non perſuadebis;</hi> &amp; ſo, either
Serpent-like ſtop their eares, or elſe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:366:56"/>
abſent themſelues, becauſe they
would not heare the weakneſſe and abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
of their owne conceipts laied open
and confuted: If there bee any ſuch I
ſay (as I truſt there bee but few, and yet
I feare there bee ſome) I would they had
learned of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> That <hi>Veritas docendo
ſuadet, non ſuadendo docet.</hi> And I wiſh that
they bee not found among the number of
thoſe to whome Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaieth, <hi>Si quis
ignorat, ignoret:</hi> And Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calips,
<hi>Qui ſordidus est, ſordeſcat adhuc.</hi> And
I will exhort with Saint <hi>Paul. Qui tenet, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neat,</hi>
and not wauer or doubt by ſuch
weake arguments and obiections.</p>
            <p>But in this new learning,<note place="margin">A dangerous diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the King and the Crowne.</note> there is one
part of it ſo ſtrange, and of ſo daungerous
conſequent, as I may not let it paſſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
That the king is as a king diuided in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
and ſo as two kings of two ſeuerall

the King and the kingdome: It rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
too farre; I wiſh euery good ſubiect

            <p>Or by ſeditious Sectaries and Puritans,

            </p>
            <p>But, vpon this ſubtle and dangerous

ſoule and conſcience of euery ſubiect ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

obedient to the King: and as a Soule or
Conſcience cannot bee framed by Policie;
ſo Faith and Allegeance cannot bee framed
by Policie, nor put into a politike bodie.
An oath muſt be ſworne by a naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die;

            <p>Now then, ſince there is but one king,
and ſoueraigne, to whome this faith and
allegeance is due by all his ſubiects of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Scotland,</hi> can any humane policie
diuide this one King, and make him two
kings? Can <hi>cor Regis Angliae</hi> be <hi>in manu Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi>
and <hi>cor Regis Scotiae</hi> not ſo? Can there
bee warres betweene the King of <hi>England,</hi>
and the king of <hi>Scotland?</hi> or betweene the
kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and the kingdome
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſo long as there is but one
king? Can the king of <hi>England</hi> now ſend
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:366:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an army roial into <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt the king
of <hi>Scotland?</hi> Can there bee any Letters of
Marke or Repriſall now graunted by the
king of <hi>England,</hi> againſt the ſubiects of the
king of <hi>Scotland?</hi> Can there bee any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
now, <hi>Quia profecturus in exercitu Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobi
Regis Angliae in Scotiam?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay ſhortly, Can any man bee a true
ſubiect to King <hi>Iames</hi> as King of <hi>England,</hi>
and a traitor or rebell to king <hi>Iames</hi> as king
of <hi>Scotland?</hi> Shall a foote breadth, or an
inch breadth of ground make a difference
of birth-right of ſubiects borne vnder one
king? Nay, where there are not any certen
bounds or limites knowne at all, but an
imaginarie partition wall, by a conceipted
fiction in Lawe? It is enough to propound
theſe and ſuch like Queſtions, whereof
many more might be remembred: they
carry a ſufficient and plaine anſweare in
themſelues: <hi>Magis docet qui prudentèr in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the King nor his heart cannot bee
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:366:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diuided, for hee is one entire King ouer
all his ſubiectes, in which ſoeuer of his
Kingdomes or Dominions they vvere
borne, ſo hee muſt not bee ſerued nor
obeyed by halues; hee muſt haue intire
and perfect obedience of his ſubiects: for,
<hi>Ligentia</hi> (as Baron <hi>Heron</hi> ſaied well) muſt
haue foure qualities; It muſt bee 1. <hi>Pura
&amp; ſimplex: 2. Integra &amp; ſolida: 3. Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalis
non localis: 4. Permanens, continua, &amp;
illaeſa.</hi> Diuide a mans heart, and you loſe
both parts of it, and make no heart at all;
ſo hee that is not an intire ſubiect, but
halfe faced, is no ſubiect at all; and hee
that is borne an intire and perfect ſubiect,
ought by Reaſon and Lawe to haue all the
freedomes, priuiledges, and benefites
pertaining to his Birth-right in all the
Kinges Dominions; and ſuch are all the
<hi>Post-nati</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> And the
inconuenience of this imaginary locall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance
hath beene ſo lately, and ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared by the Lorde chiefe Iuſtice
<hi>Coke,</hi> as more needes not bee ſaied in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:366:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
In ſome ſpeciall Caſes there ſometime
may bee a king of ſubiects without land in
poſſeſsion, as Iuſtice <hi>Fenner</hi> noted in the
gouernement which <hi>Moſes</hi> had ouer the
people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſſe; and as
in the Caſe which ſir <hi>Iohn Popham</hi> the late
Lord chiefe Iuſtice did put in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
If a King and his ſubiects bee dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
out of his kingdome by his enemies,
yet notwithſtanding hee continueth ſtill
King ouer thoſe ſubiects, and they are ſtill
bound vnto him by their bond of allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
whereſoeuer hee and they bee: But
there can not bee a King of land without
ſubiects: For, that were but <hi>Imperium in
belluas,</hi> and, <hi>Rex &amp; ſubditi ſunt relatiua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſaied there was an other generall rule
for expounding of Lawes,<note place="margin">Rex ſolus iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat &amp;c.</note> which I reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to bee laſt ſpoken of, I will now but
touch it; for, I will not ſtand to examine
by humane reaſons, whether Kings were
before Lawes, or Lawes before Kinges;
nor how Kings were firſt ordained; nor
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:366:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whether the kings, or the people did firſt
make Lawes; nor the ſeuerall conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and frames of ſtates and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales;
nor what <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Aristotle</hi> haue
written of this argmment.</p>
            <p>They were men of ſinguler learning
and wiſedome, but wee muſt conſider
the time, and the countrie in which they
liued, and in all their great learning they
lacked the true learning of the knowledge
of God. They were borne and liued in
<hi>Greece,</hi> and in popular States: they were
enemies, or at leaſt miſlikers of all Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies;
yet one of them diſdained not to
bee a ſeruant or mercenarie hireling to a
Monarch. They accompted all the world
barbarous, but their owne Countrey of
<hi>Greece:</hi> their opinions therefore are no
Cannons to giue Lawes to kinges and
kingdomes, no more than ſir <hi>Thomas
Moores Vtopia,</hi> or ſuch Pamphlets as wee
haue at euerie Marte.</p>
            <p>I beleeue him that ſaieth,<note place="margin">Prou. ca. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Per me Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:366:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I make no doubt, but that as God ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
kings, and hath giuen Lawes to kings
themſelues, ſo hee hath authorized and
giuen power to Kings to giue Lawes to
their ſubiects; and ſo kings did firſt make
lawes, and then ruled by their lawes, and
altered and changed their Lawes from
time to time, as they ſawe occaſion, for
the good of themſelues, and their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this power they haue from God
almighty; For, as Saint</hi> Auguſtine <hi>ſaieth,</hi> In

in quantum ſunt Reges, ſi in ſuo Regno
bona iubeant, mala prohibeant, non ſolum quae

            <p>

there is a ſtronger authoritie, euen

            <p>Now beeing led a little from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Lawe to the Ciuile Lawe, I finde in
the ciuile Lawe a direct Text, warranting
that generall Rule which I reſerued to
this place,<note place="margin">Cod. li. 1. Tit. 14 le. 1.</note> which is this; <hi>Inter aequitatem iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
interpoſitam interpretationem nobis ſolis &amp;
licet &amp; oportet inspicere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And another like Text in theſe words,<note place="margin">Ibidem le. 12.</note>
               <hi>Sententia Principis Ius dubium declarans, Ius

Writers in the ciuile Lawe ſay, <hi>Rex

Some others ſay, <hi>Interpretantur legem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudo
&amp; Princeps:</hi> Another ſaieth, <hi>Rex
ſolus iudicat de cauſa à iure non definita.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as I may not forget Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi>
words, which are theſe; <hi>Generale pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum
eſt ſocietatis humanae regibus ſuis obtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare:</hi>
So I may not wrong the Iudges of the
common Lawe of <hi>England</hi> ſo much as to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:366:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſuffer an imputation to bee caſt vpon
them, That they, or the Common lawe
doe not attribute as great power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
to their Soueraignes the kinges
of <hi>England,</hi> as the Romane lawes did to
their Emperours: For, <hi>Bracton</hi> the chiefe
Iuſtice in the time of king <hi>Henry</hi> the third,
hath theſe direct wordes, <hi>De Chartis Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gijs
&amp; factis regum non debent nec poſſunt Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciarij
nec priuatae perſonae disputare. Nec etiam,
ſi in illa dubitatio oriatur, poſſunt eam interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri.
Et in dubijs &amp; obſcuris, vel ſi aliqua dictio

interpretatio &amp; voluntas; Cum eius ſit
interpretari cuius eſt condere.</hi> And <hi>Britton</hi> in
the time of king <hi>Ed. 1.</hi> writeth as much in
effect.</p>
            <p>So as now if this queſtion ſeem difficult,
that neither direct law, nor Examples &amp;
Precedents, nor application of like caſes,
nor diſcourſe of reaſon, nor the graue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of the learned and reuerend Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
can reſolue it, here is a true and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Rule, how both by the Ciuile Lawe,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:366:61"/>
and the ancient Common lawe of <hi>England</hi>
it may and ought to be decided: That is,
by ſentence of the moſt religious, learned,
and iudicious king that euer this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or Iland had.</p>
            <p>But this Caſe is ſo cleare as this needeth
not at all.</p>
            <p>And in this I would not be miſ-vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode,
as though I ſpake of making of
new Lawes, or of altering the Lawes now
ſtanding; I meane not ſo, but I ſpeake on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of interpretation of the Lawe in new
queſtions and doubts, as now in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
caſe: neither doe I meane hereby to
derogate any thing from the high court of
Parliament; (farre be it from my thought)
It is the great Councell of the kingdome,
wherein euery ſubiect hath intereſt. And
to ſpeake of the conſtitution or forme of
it, or how, or when it was firſt begunne,
is for buſie Queſtioniſts; It ought to bee
obeyed and reuerenced, but not diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and it is at this time impertinent to
this Queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:366:62"/>
But certen it is, it hath beene the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the Kinges of this Realme to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
in themſelues that ſupreame power
to call their Nobles, Clergie, &amp; commons
together, when they ſawe great and vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Cauſes; and by that great Councell
to make Edicts and Statutes for the weale
of their people, and ſafetie of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and State, as in <hi>Anno 10. Edw. 3.</hi> the
Aſſembly at <hi>Nottingham</hi> for the great wars
in <hi>France:</hi> And in <hi>Anno 20. H. 3. Prouiſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
Merton,</hi> which I remembred before.</p>
            <p>There haue beene made ſome Obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of inconueniencie,<note place="margin">Obiect. of Inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</note> as for bearing of
Scot and Lot, and ſuch other charges; and
ſome out of frugalitie, that the king ſhall
loſe his profit of making Denizens, and
ſuch like: Theſe are ſo light as I leaue
them to the winde; They are neither fit
for Parliament, nor Councell, nor Court.</p>
            <p>Another argument and reaſon againſt
the <hi>Poſt-nati</hi> hath beene lately made out<note place="margin">Obiect. vpon diffidence.</note>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:366:62"/>
of diffidence and miſtruſt, that they will
come into <hi>England</hi> ſans number, and ſo as
it were to ſurcharge our Common; and
that this may be in <hi>ſecula ſeculorum.</hi> I know
not well what this meanes. The Nation
is ancient, noble and famous; they haue
many honourable and woorthie Noble
men and Gentlemen, and many wiſe
and worthie men of all degrees and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities;
they haue lands and faire poſſeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in <hi>Scotland:</hi> Is it therefore to bee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
or can it in reaſon bee imagined,
that ſuch multitude ſans number will
leaue their natiue ſoile, and all tranſport
themſelues hither? Hath the Iriſh done
ſo? Or thoſe of <hi>Wales,</hi> or of the Iſles of
<hi>Man, Gerneſey,</hi> and <hi>Ierſey?</hi> Whie ſhould
we then ſuſpect it now more for <hi>Scotland?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, doe you ſuppoſe that the Kinge
of <hi>England</hi> will euer ſuffer ſo great a parte
of his Dominions, and ſo great and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
a Kingdome as <hi>Scotland</hi> is to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled?
It is a doubt imagined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any foundation or ground of reaſon.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:366:63"/>
But if it were to bee doubted, the twelue
Iudges that haue concurred in opinion,
and that late worthy Iudge <hi>Popham</hi> had as
great cauſe to feare it as any others: They
are wiſe, they are learned, they haue
faire poſſeſsions and good eſtates, They
haue poſteritie to care for, as others
haue.</p>
            <p>Yet, admit it bee a matter worth the
doubting of, what is that to the yoong
<hi>Post-nati</hi> that are not like in many yeares
to come hither in ſuch number? Shall we
vpon this cauſleſſe feare depriue them of
their lawfull Birth-right?</p>
            <p>Haue wee ſeene in theſe fiue yeeres
paſt anie moe of them than this one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
that haue gotten any Lands in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
And this little that he hath is ſo ſmall
and poore a portion, that his purchaſe is
not great, and therefore no iuſt cauſe of
offence to any.</p>
            <p>Nay,<note place="margin">Ante-nati.</note> if you looke vpon the <hi>Ante-nati,</hi>
you ſhall find no ſuch confluence hither,
but ſome few (and very few in reſpect
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:366:63"/>
of that great and populous kingdome)
that haue done long and worthie ſeruice
to his Maieſtie, haue, and ſtill doe attend
him, which I truſt no man miſlikes: For,
there can bee none ſo ſimple, or childiſh
(if they haue but common ſenſe) as to
thinke that his Maieſty ſhould haue come
hither alone amongſt vs, and haue left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
him in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and as it were caſte
off, all his ould and worthie Seruants.</p>
            <p>And if theſe Noble and worthie Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I meane the <hi>Ante-nati</hi>
be louingly and brotherly entertained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
vs, with mutuall loue &amp; beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
that ſo we may <hi>coaleſcere,</hi> &amp; be vnited
together, by marriage, and otherwiſe (as
in ſome particular caſes wee ſee it already
happily begunne) no doubt God will
bleſſe this Vnion of both theſe Nations,
and make them, and the King, and great
<hi>Britaine</hi> to be famous through the world;
and feared &amp; redoubted of our enemies,
and of all that wiſh vs ill: For, <hi>Vis vnita
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:366:64"/>
fortior, &amp; concordia multos facit vnum.</hi> But
what may follow vpon ſuch arguments of
diffidence and ſuſpition, which ſeeme
but to hinder Vnion, and to breede diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
and diſſention I will not ſpeake; Let
euery wiſe man conſider it well: For, <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana
conſilia castigantur vbi coelestibus ſe praefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi>
And remember Saint <hi>Paules</hi> caution,
<hi>Si inuicem mordetis, videte ne ab inuicem conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamini.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the reſemblance that hath bin
made of this Caſe of <hi>Post-nati</hi> (but indeed
for the Vnion of both Kingdomes) with
the houſwifes cutting of her cloth by a
threede, I will ſay but this, That if ſhee
cut her peece of cloth in length aſwell as
in breadth, all the threeds will bee cutte,
and the cloth marred. And this cutting
in this our Caſe, is, to cutte all aſwell
in length as in breadth, euen through
all the Kinges Dominions; and ſo will
rent aſunder the whole frame of the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:366:64"/>
and cut in peeces all the threeds of
Allegeance.</p>
            <p>But now I wil aske this queſtion:<note place="margin">A Queſtion, how long this ſuſpition and diſ-vnion ſhall continue?</note> How
long ſhall this ſuſpition and doubt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue?
Shall there bee a diſ-vnion for euer?
If it bee ſaied, No, but vntill the Lawes,
and Cuſtomes of both Kingdomes bee
made one and the ſame: then I aske; how,
and when ſhall that be done? And it may
bee, that the Conſtitutions of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
bee ſuch as there can hardely in all
things bee ſuch an abſolute and perfect
reconciling or vniting of Lawes as is fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied.
Is it yet ſo betweene <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>VVales?</hi> or betweene <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Cornewall?</hi>
or betweene many other parts of this
Kingdome? I ſay no; and I ſpeake it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently,
and truely it is not ſo, nor well
can be ſo. Therefore let <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
be in like degree now, as <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>VVales</hi> were for many hundred yeeres,
and in many things are yet ſtill; and yet
let Vnion and Loue increaſe amongſt vs,

for certainely they are not.</p>
            <p>One other Reaſon remaines againſt

               <note place="margin">Obiection vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Diuination</note> and that is out of a proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
