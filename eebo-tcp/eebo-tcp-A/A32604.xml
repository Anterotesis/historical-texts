            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And whereas complaint hath beén to Us made by the Artificers in this Our Realm of <hi>England</hi> (as well within Our City of <hi>London,</hi> as within other Our Cities, Towns, and Boroughs) that notwithstanding the said Statutes, and the Penalties therein contained, Foreign Wares and Merchandizes of the sorts aforesaid (amongst others) have of late been brought from beyond the Seas in great abundance, and sold within this Our Realm of <hi>England</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> whereby the said Artificers and their Families are not only utterly impoverished, the youth not trained up in the said Sciences, and thereby the said Faculties, and the exquisite Knowledge thereof, like in short time, within this Our Realm to decay, but divers of Our Cities and Towns are thereby much impaired, the whole Realm greatly endamaged, and Foreign Countries much enriched: We with the Advice of Our Privy Councel, out of Our Princely care of the Artificers of this Our Realm, in the Sciences aforesaid, to whom We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to give all good encouragement, they being nothing inferiour to Foreigners (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (as We cannot but take notice) Our Subjects are too inclinable to a prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Foreign Manufactures before Our own) and for prevention of like mischiefs for the time to come, have thought fit by this Our Proclamation to revive the notice and memory of the said Acts of Parliament, and the Penalties therein contained, to the end that all persons which are or shall be therein concerned, may not be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ignorance of their dangers or duties touching the premisses: And do also by like Advice by this Our Proclamation streightly Charge and Command all Merchants, as well Denizens as Strangers, and all other persons whatsoever, not to presume at any time hereafter to bring, send or convey into this Our Realm of <hi>England,</hi> or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of <hi>Wales,</hi> from any part beyond the Seas, any Foreign Bone-Lace, Cut-work, Imbroidery, Fringe of Gold, Silver, Silk, or Thread, Lace of Gold or Silver, Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds, or Bever-Hats (or any other the Wares or Merchandizes above mentioned, or by the said Acts of Parliament, or any other Prohibited to be Imported) by way of Merchandize, to be sold, bartered, or exchanged within this Our Realm of <hi>England,</hi> or Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> contrary to the form and effect of the said Acts of Parliament, or any of them, upon the pains and penalties in the said Acts contained, which (if they do) they must expect, with the uttermost severity, to be inflicted upon them. And for that end We do hereby streightly Charge and Command all Searchers, Waiters, and all other Our Officers and Ministers whatsoever (upon the forfeiture of their Offices and Places, and such other Penalties, as for their negligences or connivances may by Law be inflicted upon them) to use their uttermost care and diligence to discover all Foreign Wares and Merchandize abovesaid, or others by the said Acts of Parliament, or any other prohibited, which shall be Imported from beyond the Sea into this Our Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> or Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> contrary to the said Acts or any of them, and to seize the said Wares and Merchandizes to Our use, to the end such proceedings may be thereupon had, as shall be agreeable to the said Acts.
