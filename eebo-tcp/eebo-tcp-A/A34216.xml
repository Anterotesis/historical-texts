            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Conference between a <hi>Benſalian</hi> Biſhop, and an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Doctor concerning Church-Government, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Was caſt upon that happy Country of <hi>Benſalia;</hi> amongſt other Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes I had with ſeveral perſons of note and eminency in their reſpective faculties and functions, as I was one day in Conference with an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and worthy Phyſician, whoſe acquaintance I had contracted, comes a Meſſenger with a Letter from the Biſhop of <hi>Benſalia</hi> to the Doctor; the main ſcope of which was, That whereas he perceiv'd that thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were ſo highly favour'd as to have that Indulgence granted by the King and Council, to inquire into and make their remarks upon the Laws, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Cuſtoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of their happy Country, more than ever was yet permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any ſtrangers before: Therefore was deſirous to diſcourſe us; ſo urg'd him to bring us along, and particularly the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Phyſician on the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to dine with him. At which news I was not a little glad, that I might have ſuch an opportunity (unſought for, yet deſired by me) of converſing with one of thoſe wiſe, grave Seniors.</p>
            <p>I askt the Doctor if the Biſhop of that great place (being the Metropolis of the Country) was a Lord? he anſwered, No: For they lookt upon Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom not to be of this world, or at leaſt that that Kingdom of his which is to be attended with grandure, is not yet come. I queried further, with what ſtate he was attended? Not (ſaith he) as the Lord Biſhops are in <hi>England;</hi> yet hath a plentiful allowance and ſervants ſufficient to attend, but in no great pomp or ſplendour. For (ſaith he) they judg in themſelves, that they are here to partake of the Humiliation of Chriſt, that ſo they may the better be fitted for their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation with him in his glorious Kingdom, when it ſhall come. But (adds he further) I ſuppoſe the Biſhop may take liberty himſelf further to diſcourſe theſe things to you. Only take notice (which he perhaps may not acquaint you with, leſt he be thought guilty of oſtentation) that he and other Biſhops of this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Country are very hoſpitable and charitable, (I was going to ſay to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but that we have ſo few, that as to that matter not worth naming; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever) to the poor; I mean not to beggars, for we have none (in all our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) come to any of our doors; but to the poorer ſort of Families who live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, and to the binding poor mens children Apprentice, and putting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them to School, (although care is moſt-what taken of them by publick ſtocks to maintain publick Schools, Work-houſes, or Manufactories, which are conſtantly ſupply'd at the charge of the King and his Sophy.) However in every reſpect, wherein they are in a capacity of ſhewing charitable acts, they are not at all wanting. Yea, it's part of their ſtudy, how they may find out occaſions for charitable offices; and for their piety and exemplary lives, are had in great eſtimation, and reverenc'd by all men.</p>
            <p>The next day the Doctor call'd of us (according to his kind offer) and took us in his Coach to the Biſhops houſe; who expecting us, was in readineſs for our reception; where being (by one of his ſervants) brought into the Hall, the Biſhop came, and with a comely grave countenance (yet ſomewhat ſmiling) ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted us, and told us we were kindly welcome, as ſhould be ſhewn with all cheerfulneſs, according to his ability. After ſome previous diſcourſe, the Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61344:3"/>
came up. I obſerv'd the Biſhop had no Chaplain, for he in perſon with a great deal of ſeriouſneſs crav'd a bleſſing before meat. At Dinner the Biſhop was pretty pleaſant with us, askt us about many of our Cuſtoms in <hi>England,</hi> and concerning our King, what age he was? I told him as far as I knew, that he was about 46 or 47 years. I began (taking an occaſion from the Biſhops naming him) to magnifie and extol our King for the greateſt Prince in the world. You mean (quoth the Biſhop) in <hi>Europe.</hi> But take heed of <hi>Benſalia,</hi> as you will bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter know, when you come to ſee our King, and the grandeur of his State, which with that of <hi>Solomon's</hi> houſe and the Sophy (in relation to whom he is ſtiled <hi>Preſes Sophora</hi>) is the moſt magnificent in the world, not excepting the world <hi>Europe.</hi> He asked with a cheerful countenance, what children our King had? I replied very modeſtly, I was not ſo well vers'd in our Court-affairs as to be able to give him any account thereof, only I have heard ſome ſay he had none; ſo beg'd his excuſe in anſwering to that or other queſtions of that kind; whereupon ſmilingly he began ſome other matter of diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>And (amongſt the reſt) askt me if many of our Clergy-men were not Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellows (as you in your own Dialect (ſaith he) improperly enough call ſuch.) I told him, if any, ſurely they were more than ſhould be, and more than became the gravity of that worthy function. Come (ſaith the Biſhop) you are very modeſt, I commend you for your cautiouſneſs in ſpeaking any thing againſt your own Country-men. I thankt him for ſo good an opinion he had of me. Come (ſaith he) you may ſpeak out here, drollingly telling me, we were out of their hearing. For we know (ſaith he) the ſtate of your affairs, both as to what relates to your Court, Clergy, as other grand affairs, as well as you can tell us; only I am willing (for diſcourſe ſake) to ask queſtions, and to be a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfy'd in the truth of what we already have received. I told him, ſeeing it was ſo, I could neither add nor diminiſh to, or from the vertue or viciouſneſs of our own people. As to the latter, I could not but confeſs, that the more I convers'd with the <hi>Benſalians,</hi> and became acquainted with their Laws, Cuſtoms, Demeanors, juſtneſs in Traffick, civility in behaviour, and other worthy En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, the more I diſlik'd, yea bluſht at our own. It's (quoth the Biſhop) the part of every honeſt, vertuous, good man, to own honeſty and vertue, and goodneſs, where ever he finds it; and that without reſpect, or any byas to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries or perſons, but where its nakedly apparent.</p>
            <p>Although there was plenty of diſhes of meat well ordered, yet the Biſhop eats generally but of two or three at the moſt. You ſee (ſaith the Biſhop) I have a good ſtomack (I thank God) to my meat, I can eat heartily once a day, at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſome ſmall repaſt, no Breakfaſt at all, take no Tobacco, nor drink I between meals, unleſs very thirſty; whereby I enjoy my health (I bleſs God) very well. And although our Phyſicions be (without doubt) the beſt in the world, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the beſt Medicines that nature and art can afford, what of their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration in their Laboratory, and what is handed down to them from the Sophy (thoſe <hi>Adepti</hi> and Maſters of the greateſt Hermetick Secrets) yet for my own part I had much rather enjoy my health, wherein I can by an orderly diet and temperance preſerve it, than be ſick to make trial of their skill. I commended the Biſhops prudence in that matter, and wiſht his preſident was exemplary to our <hi>European</hi> Countries. Why (ſaith he) you have excellent good Phyſicians amongſt you. Yes, Sir, ſaid I, but for all that we are ſomewhat of your mind, have no great ſtomack to be ſick if we can help it. At which the Biſhop ſmil'd.—When Dinner was over, the Biſhop roſe up, and return'd thanks himſelf.</p>
            <p>A while after Dinner the Biſhop betook himſelf into a withdrawing-room,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61344:3"/>
and ordered one of his ſervants to whiſper in my ear, his deſire of my leaving the company to diſcourſe a while in private with him, mean while had taken care the company ſhould be entertain'd with diſcourſe by the Doctor and ſome other perſons. Come, <hi>Sir,</hi> (ſaith he) you may perhaps think ſomewhat ſtrange of me for my pleaſantneſs and cheerfulneſs at Dinner, I am uſually ſo, to help the digeſtion of my meat, for I think it quickens and invigorates the ferment, (if I may borrow a word or two with you in your noble faculty) the ferment of the ſtomack oyls the wheels of the digeſtion, procures the moſt laudable nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive juices, helps forward the circulation of the blood, and all this the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in order to health.</p>
            <p>But now I am willing to be very ſerious with you, for I have ſome weighty things to acquaint you with, which when you return into your own Country, may perhaps (if our King and his Sophi do permit you the liberty of publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof) be of great uſe to your people; who (as we are inform'd) are ſo much divided in their judgments and opinions about matters of Religion; we have the ſtate of your Church-affairs (we think) truly repreſented to us, and wherein I ſhall err through any miſtake, ſhall beg the favour at your hands to ſet me right.</p>
            <p>My method ſhall be, firſt to ſhew you the rectitude and uniformity of ours, and the genuine conſequences thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> peace, unity, Chriſtian charity, and the exerciſes of other heavenly Graces. Next, how much yours comes ſhort and deviates from ours; then ſhall ſhew you the reaſons; and laſt (if we have time) ſhall propoſe ſome expedients in order to the healing your claſhing differences, towards the ratifying a Chriſtian union amongſt you.</p>
            <p>Firſt as to ours, it is <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> which rightly underſtood we have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to conclude from Scripture, and other Teſtimonies, to be truly Apoſtolical, and according to Divine inſtitution; which with the Presbytery and other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes, together with their modes of connexion to the people, are ſufficient to the conſtitution of our Church. We have no univerſal Biſhop or Pope, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly own Chriſt Jeſus to be the ſupreme Head of our Church. Our Council of Biſhops with ſome of the Elders or Presbytery, do determine all our differences, both as to Doctrine and Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>2. And for the continuation and promotion of our unity and peace, we avoid all Scholaſtick diſputations, and verbal janglings, as much as poſſible; as ſeeing it, by the doleful effects thereof throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> to be the bane of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the mother of diſſention, animoſities, contention and diſcord; yea, the very parent of all the enmity, and war found amongſt thoſe whom charity would enforce us to call Chriſtians, whoſe lives and well-meanings more than the ſimilarneſs of their opinions, muſt ſpeak them Chriſtians, or they will dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultly be found, having by ſuch contentions even rent the ſeamleſs coat of Chriſt, the very badg of their Chriſtianity, <hi>viz.</hi> Love, Peace, and Unity. We by a Law prohibit all diſputes and controverſies about Predeſtination, <hi>viz.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and Reprobation, and other diſputable Doctrines; as obſerving them to be the mother of many animoſities and contentions amongſt brethren; yea, and well remarking that no Hiſtory can give us any inſtance of perſons conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the true Chriſtian faith thereby; or of any (already converted) whoſe lives have thence been rended better. But many Hiſtories are fill'd with inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the contrary. I call to mind we had once a learned Philoſopher happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be caſt aſhore on our coaſts, who diſputing with ſome of our Biſhops, they notwithſtanding all their learned arguments, although they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him (which yet was hard to make him or any (who ſtand out for victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) confeſs) yet they did not convert him, till a zealous <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſhop (leſs learned
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61344:4"/>
than the reſt) in great power and demonſtration of the Spirit, repeated to him the Creed, and (as I remember) the Lords-prayer; which done, queries the man, ſaying, Philoſopher, doſt thou now believe? who by ſuch power being conquered, anſwer'd (according to <hi>Naked Truth</hi>) Yes, I do believe; and ſo became a Proſelyte.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> And becauſe we would not offend our weak brethren, we diſpenſe with many Ceremonies, which you of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (as we are well infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) are ſo ſtiff in defending, as rather than you will abate any thing therein, you will adventure the loſs of hundreds, yea perhaps thouſands of the weaker brethren, ſuffering them for the ſake of ſome diſpenſible Ceremonies to depart from you by whole ſholes, to the great rending of the unity of your Church, which by all means poſſible ſhould have been preſerved in the bonds of love and unity by your condeſcending to them in ſome things allowable both by Scripture and reaſon, as well as from the different <hi>Genius</hi> of people both as to time and place. As if the union of your brethren, and conſequently peace of your whole Church was not of more value to you, than the ſtiff adhering to many indifferent and (in caſes aforeſaid) unneceſſary Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>If any amongſt us be upon any occaſion offended or diſſatisfied, we make it our buſineſs preſently to pour in oyl and wine (the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Balſom) to heal up the wound, uſing all the ſuppleing and ſoft means we can, by friendly viſits, prayer, and all tender demeanor, to ſatisfie their ſcruples of Conſcience, and like good Phyſicians never leave them till they be made whole. We beſeech, exhort, admoniſh, and rebuke according as neceſſity requires; being inſtant with them in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon. And as Fathers (for ſo in a ſpiritual ſenſe we look upon our ſelves) we are tender and affectionate to them, uſing all fatherly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition. We by our tender bowels of compaſſion melt them down, if they have the leaſt grain of the Spirit of God in them; and they know right well, we make no prey of them, but as Miniſters and ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt, ſerve them in all we can. For we no ſooner underſtand that any one is offended, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, or hath done any thing amiſs contrary to the Doctrine of our Church, if it be in ſuch matters as renders them offenders of our Civil Law, we leave them to that Law (only take care (by friendly admonition for their ſouls.) But if in matters which relates to ſpiritual things, we (<hi>viz.</hi>) one of our Biſhops or El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, preſently go to the diſſatisfied perſon, whom we treat with tender bowels of compaſſion, and endeavour by fatherly admonition to reduce and reclaim them.</p>
            <p>But if that will not do, (which ſeldom happens but our private, tender, and affectionate addreſſes to them, becomes effectual) then we admoniſh them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, which is ſeveral times perform'd. If it be about ſome new opinion that he would broach, and that he is very pertinacious in, we conſult ſome of our eminent Phyſicians, or (if the caſe be high) ſome of our Sophi, to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed ſomewhat of Hypochondraiſm has not infected or tainted the mans fancy; which if they conclude in the affirmative, they take him under cure, and by rectifying the Humours, new moduling the ſpirits, and inverting, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting or expunging the dement and Irregular Idea's, (which they perform with a great deal of curioſity, (treating them variouſly according to the nature and different manner of Hypochondraiſm) return them well and ſound to us again.</p>
            <p>If any perſon has a new opinion, and keeps it to himſelf, and queſtions of that nature being askt him, he anſwers according to that opinion, only endeavours not to publiſh it abroad, we concern not our ſelves in that matter, but let him alone to enjoy his own fancy; yet we endeavour as occaſion offers, to put him
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61344:4"/>
upon more right and orthodox notions; as being well ſatisfy'd, that as long as there is any variety to be found in nature, it will be diſcernable in the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of thoughts and opinions of men; it being as congeneal to men many times to think variouſly concerning the ſame thing, as it is natural for them to differ in Phyſiognomy. We no more can always think or opine alike, than we can look alike. Faces and thoughts plead variety as their great and indiſpenſible prerogative. Scarce two faces in the world are in every lineament and feature alike. Nor are there two men throughout the world, who have the ſame Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical notions about all things; and indeed variety and diſputableneſs of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our thoughts, and underſtanding, doth truly ſolve the chief reaſon of our great variety in opinions.</p>
            <p>But if the man deſignedly for oſtentation ſake, and to make himſelf popular, not only affects, but blazons abroad new opinions that are deſtructionable to the fundamental Principles of Chriſtianity, if after private and publick admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition he be not reclaim'd, we pronounce the ſentence of Excommunication a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, all other perſons are forbidden any manner of Traffick with him, after a time (if ſtill he perſiſt) he is apprehended by a Bailiff of the Civil Law (which is our <hi>Jus Gentium</hi>) and at their Quarterly Seſſions try'd, where (if he yet prove obſtinate) he is ordered to the <hi>Staffee,</hi> and thence at the next Shipping is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to ſome of the Eaſtern Iſlands of <hi>America.</hi> But if he ſhew any token of recantation and penitence, he is received again (upon the reality thereof) into the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> We have no vexatious Courts for Citations, Capias's, or Pleadings by Proctors, as your Church (to it's great diſparagement) has. Nor is any perſon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any miſdemeanor to pay a peny of money, no charges plac'd to his account. We have a natural averſneſs to all money-mulcts, for we think it the bane of any Church to be entail'd with ſuch Courts and Officers as (like <hi>Rome</hi>'s ſin-ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers) grieve the people either with impriſonment, or puniſh them with fines. For with us if a man be Excommunicated, as he is not own'd in common ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſo neither can he with all the moneys he has, buy off the Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; no, nothing will do it but a penitency, and humble ſubmiſſion, and then he is moſt affectionately receiv'd into the arms of the Church, without being put to one farthing of charge. If we ſhould have ſuch a Court, as that you call (how improperly let others judg) your Spiritual-Court, our people would fall off from us in ſpite of all our force and compulſion, and each competent number would make themſelves Churches, to which our people would flock as faſt as they do to your diſſenting brethrens Churches, which we foreſeeing, ſhall we hope, never be mindful to run our ſelves and Church upon ſuch rocks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly.</hi> Our Viſitations are perform'd twice every year, where we go in perſon to every particular Church under our care. Where our great work is (next to our earneſt and ſerious admonition of them to love unity and peace (the main ſcope of all our Doctrine) to examine whether any particular Church be diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the Paſtor and Teachers we have plac'd over them; and to know what ſuch Paſtors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have againſt their people; that ſo we may by all means poſſible reconcile their differences; that if the people can juſtly accuſe their Teachers of any debauchery or bad example in their converſation, upon ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proof and teſtimony thereof, the Paſtor or Teacher is diſplac'd, ſent to the <hi>Staffee,</hi> and another more pious, ſober, good man, of ſufficient abilities, is put in by the Biſhop, or propos'd from amongſt themſelves to the Biſhop, which if approv'd of, is admitted and plac'd over them.</p>
            <p>So that hereby we take care to remove all ſcandalous Miniſters, leſt they ſhould offend, and by their bad example lead our people aſtray into bad pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61344:5"/>
and leſt others being diſſatify'd thereat, ſhould thence endeavour a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, ſchiſm, or rent in our Church, which we ſtudy as much as poſſible to prevent; and if any of the people are refractory and of diſſolute diſorderly lives, we take care to admoniſh them, and if tender bowels will not do (which we by all means attempt) to chaſtiſe them with the threats of Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the <hi>Staffee.</hi> But we impoſe no fines or money-mulcts upon them at all, have no ſorts of ſin ſwindgers. Thus we endeavour to keep up the unity of love in the bond of peace amongſt our people, the great and main ſcope of every Viſitation, all true and faithful Biſhops ſhould aim at.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6ly.</hi> We (the Biſhops) our ſelves always preach, ſometimes in one, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while in another place within our Juriſdiction. We are never idle, but deſire to ſhew our ſelves true Over-ſeers, Biſhops indeed over our flocks. We in our preaching and reading of Divine Service, which we have as it ſprings purely (without any adulteration) from the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, always omit the Ceremony of the Surplice, as knowing that it grates againſt the natural <hi>Genius</hi> of our people, and therefore we wave it. And becauſe many of our people are diſſatisfied with the ſign of the Croſs in Baptiſm, we omit that alſo; and many are offended at kneeling at the Sacrament of the Lords-Supper, as thinking from our Lord and his Diſciples example, that it was not of Divine inſtitution; which therefore we for their ſatisfaction forbear. We impoſe no bowing at the Name of Jeſus; but bowing at the Altar we wholly prohibit, leſt we ſhould in any meaſure admit of, or connive at the Idolatry of Popery (againſt whom we generally have a natural and inbred averſneſs.) Yea, in all diſpenſible Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, we ſet the doors of our Church ſo wide open, that all (who otherwiſe would be diſſenters, and in fine would (in ſpite of us have Churches and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of their own) willingly come in, and once in, moſt willingly would go forth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7ly.</hi> We compel or force none in matters of Religion, as judging it to be a voluntary free action of the Soul in the exerciſe of things that relate to Heaven and happineſs; as well knowing that if we ſhould conſtrain people to acts of Worſhip, we could at the beſt (unleſs it was from a free act of their ſouls) but make hypocrites of them; as to which we think the prophane perſon (who has nothing of religious actions) more acceptable in the ſight of God than ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful hypocrites, who only make Religion a ſtoking-horſe for their worldly advantages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>8ly.</hi> We (the Biſhops) ſtudy to avoid all height of honours; for our King would have made us Lords, but we beg'd of him that favour as not to confer ſuch high dignities upon us; and that becauſe we being men of like frailty and paſſions with others, were afraid leſt that height of honour ſhould enſnare us, make us forget God, turn droniſh and careleſs ſhepherds; which we declare our ſelves to have ſo great zeal for the honour and glory of God, and good of the ſouls of our dear children or people, as we would not have any thing of that nature happen for the gaining all the world or worldly honours; leſt neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our flock, we ſhould impoſe on them other droniſh, leud, ſcandalous tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, whereby the flock would be ſcattered, and they ſeek or make other ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds of their own, ſo quite break off and relinquiſh our Church; which brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches we dread; as alſo judging ſuch high honours not ſuitable to the poor hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Miniſters of Chriſt, in this our Pilgrimage through the wilderneſs to the land of peace, who are here to partake with him in the ſtate of Humiliation, as we expect and hope to ſhare with him in his ſtate of Exaltation at the coming of his Kingdom; which very Kingdom we have always before us, as near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, the glory of which ſo dazles our eyes, as that it darkens theſe tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61344:5"/>
ſcenes of temporal honours, eclipſes the beauty thereof, and makes them only ſeem to us like a finer ſort of Pageantry; which makes us careleſs of them, as alſo leſt we ſhould be in danger of Lording it over Gods heritage, and thereby ſhould give cauſe of dividing and rending the ſeamleſs coat of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Lord and Maſter.</p>
            <p>And now (my Son) I muſt acquaint you with one thing, which ſtrikes not ſo univerſally with the <hi>Genius</hi> of your people of <hi>England,</hi> as with ours of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalia,</hi> and that is concerning Muſick in Churches. Firſt therefore (as a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what I have to ſay, and to make it leſs ſtrange to you) I muſt tell you<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>that harmony, whether vocal or inſtrumenal, ſtrikes in ſo naturally with the <hi>Genius</hi> of our people, as what through their education and cuſtom (and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a private inſtinct peculiar to Countries, of which we can give no account) Muſick or Muſical harmony ſeems to be ſo congeneal to them, as nothing more: every boy and girl in one ſort or other, is train'd up with it; even Mechanicks are not ignorant of the grounds of Muſick. <hi>Vulcans</hi> at their Forges, Glaſſmen at their Furnaces, Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes in their Tents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent occaſions ſtrike up into Muſical conſort, and ſmite your ears with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant harmony. In the very Groves, and ſhady places, we have inſtruments of Muſick almoſt like Organs or Pedats, which are ſet into motion by the air, or wind, and ſo contriv'd, that without any hands guiding them, they ſtrike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pleaſant tunes; the very birds are ſo ſorted as they make vocal conſort: <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 17. 18. So that the whiſtling winds, the melodious noiſe of birds among the ſpreading branches, the pleaſing fall of waters, and the rebounding Eccho from the hollowing mountains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (too tedious now to relate) all ſound aloud, yea eccho forth, and that ſweetly too, the natural bent of our peoples <hi>Genius</hi> to Muſical harmony.</p>
            <p>Which conſidered, (and what was wonderfully done to the deſtruction of that terrible army of the <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Ammonites</hi> which came againſt <hi>Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> even by ſinging and praiſing God, we have upon record in the Sacred Chronicles, <hi>Book</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 22.) We were willing (for their further ſatisfaction, and to make Religion in its acts of Devotion not burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and offenſive, but to be perform'd with alacrity and cheerfulneſs) to appoint ſome choice muſick in our Churches. Which muſick is not perform'd by a company of leud, vain Quiriſters, Boys and Singing-men, (who ſing for money as your Ballad-ſingers do) ſuch as you foſter up to the great diſcredit of your Church-muſick in <hi>England,</hi> and other places of <hi>Europe,</hi> which are indeed a great diſgracc to ſo heavenly an ornament in the Church: But moſt of our people, even children from a dozen years of age, are able not only to ſet in, but alſo to go along in harmony with the Muſick. Which they do (my Son) with ſuch ſeriouſneſs and gravity, as that it ſeems to be the moſt ſweet and harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing in the world. They are ſo raviſht with that harmony as they ſeem to be wrapt up in it, even beyond all outward things, who thus in Pſalms, Hymns, and ſpiritual Songs, praiſe and magnifie God with ſuch ſweetneſs and wholeneſs of heart, and ſuch praiſes to God are ſounded forth in ſo great innocency of ſpirit, and ſweetneſs of voice, as ſurely nothing is more delectable, next to the Beatiſick Quire of Angels, and heavenly ſpirits in the full Coeleſtial Chorus—</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Whoſe greateſt work in height above,</l>
               <l>Is only with joy to ſing and love.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Then he paus'd a little, as if upon the uttering thereof he had been wrap up into a heavenly ſweet extaſie.</p>
            <lg>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61344:6"/>
               <l>His Spirit for a while ſeem'd to retire,</l>
               <l>And he was gone to th' Heavenly Quire.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>At his return, I was afraid (Reverend Father ſaid I) by any queſtion to interrupt you at the firſt ſo ſerious, and at the laſt ſo ſweet diſcourſe, but that your pauſe and heavenly rapture gave me an opportunity to take you up as you were falling or retiring to the pledg (your body) left behind, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you that your wholeſome and ſweet Doctrine, together with the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of your Diſcipline, has begot an ardent affection in my ſoul towards your ſo happy and concording Church, ſo aſſimilating and ſymphonizing with the Divine Angelical Chorus.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Ah <hi>(quoth the Biſhop)</hi> my ſoul was wrapt among</l>
               <l>That heavenly hoſt, who ſweetly ſing the Song</l>
               <l>Of Moſes and the Lamb.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And indeed our mental people, as we call them, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as are ſpiritually minded, and given up to high contemplation of the mercies, wiſdom, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the moſt high God, are ſometimes in ſuch ſweet concording harmony, even wrapt up well nigh into extaſies, and have much ado to contain their divinely ſymbolizing ſouls within the narrow confines of their bodies. But to return:</p>
            <p>We ſuffer no Jeſuits or other Papiſt-Prieſts whatſoever to come amongſt us, as well knowing, how ſpreading and contagious their leven is and has been to thoſe Kingdoms and Countries where it hath been admitted. Yea, it cannot eaſily ſlip out of our memories, what danger we had like to have been in both as to our Church and State, upon admiſſion of an unknown Jeſuit, who being in a Merchants Ship driven upon our Coaſts, was ſuffered to dwell amongſt us, and in a very little time he had ſo poyſoned near a ſcore of our people with his venomous leaven, which like a contagious ferment had got footing among us; and if that joint of our body-Politick had not been ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably cut off, the Gangreen would in no great time have endangered the whole body. But by the prudence of our King and Sophi (we the Biſhops not a little contributing) the grand Jeſuit was apprehended and all his proſelytes, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good proof being found to be ſuch, were ſentenced to the <hi>Staffee,</hi> and thence for <hi>Iſlands</hi> near <hi>America.</hi> Only this liberty was granted to thoſe of our own inhabitants, that as many of them as would return to their own mother-Church, and reclaim that of <hi>Rome,</hi> was to be received again, which moſt of them accepted. The reſt, with the Jeſuit, was ſpeedily ordered for the <hi>Staffee.</hi> And becauſe it happened at a time that Ships were not ſhortly to go off, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent further delay, a Ship on purpoſe was appointed to go away with them; and becauſe they would not have other places (which are much peopled) hazarded by them, gave command to ſet them upon ſome Iſland re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from <hi>America.</hi> For although (quoth the Biſhop) your Laws are ſo ſevere in <hi>England</hi> as to puniſh with death Jeſuits that are ſo prov'd to be (which yet how duly executed you know beſt) yet ours doth not ſentence any man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever to death for his opinion in Religion. We think that Law of death to perſons of different Religions not to be agreeable to the judgment, cuſtom, or preſident of the Primitive Church of God; therefore we avoid it.</p>
            <p>Thus (my Son) I have in ſhort ſhew'd you the ſtate of our thrice happy
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61344:6"/>
Church and Government thereof: only before I conclude this head, it will not be impertinent to touch a little further upon the nature or manner of our Church. For the Church I have been ſpeaking of, is made up of living ſtones, well knit and cemented together, in every of which Chriſt by his Spirit dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and is thereby render'd a true Church. Our people which convene and are linkt together in Church-fellowſhip, are the Church, not the place of Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Which places of Convention or meeting-places, we do not call Churches, left we ſhould loſe the Primitive and true ſenſe of that name; but for diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſake call them Convents, or in ſhort Covents; which are built very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently for meeting, but are no ſtately Fabricks; nor is our Worſhip attended with any gaudry or any ſpiritual ſort of pageantry, wherefore we wave all Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, Copes, Tippets, Caps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> leſt our people being amus'd with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, ſhould loſe the internal acts of devotion; leſt too much buſied in their heads, their hearts ſhould let go the main object: <hi>Give me thy heart,</hi> ſaith God, (not thy head or thy eye), and leſt they ſhould let themſelves too much forth into the outward, they ſhould leave nothing for God in the inward. Yea in ſhort, leſt our people (whom we always watch over with a jealous eye) by ſuch ſpiritual ſhews in the external pageantry of Worſhip, ſhould be drawn aſide on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to an outſide Religion, and ſo ſhould commit ſpiritual fornication, which we dread to think on; and therefore rather abate in Ceremonies, than to have them ſupernumerary.</p>
            <p>And as our Paſtors, Teachers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> avoid all pomp in the performance of all Religious duties, ſo likewiſe our people come not together in ſuch gaudy dreſs as we hear yours do, who come rather as if they were to act their parts in a Play, than to ſuch ſolemn Worſhip; in ſuch pageantry of dreſs, as would more become their appearance in either of the two Parks, or a Maſquerade, than their proſtrate approaches to the footſtool of Grace; more likely to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie a Comical ſcene, than ſuch a ſolemn Convention. As to which, even many of your profeſſors (who as more ſtrict, ſhould ſee and forſake the folly of the former) to their great ſhame are guilty herein. Is it not ſo (ſaith he) to me? I cannot (anſwer I) but confeſs (Reverend Father) to the truth hereof, and am much aſham'd of it. Ah (ſaith the Biſhop) how becoming and ſuitable to the profeſſion of the Goſpel is a modeſt garb; our people accounting the Graces of the Spirit in a vertuous mind the chief ornaments.</p>
            <p>And now (my Son) to acquaint you with the reſult and genuine effects of our ſo happy Church, it is no leſs than love, unity and peace, and what can be expected more in any Church in the world? The glory of God, and good of Souls, being the main aim, and end of the Biſhops, Presbyters, Paſtors and Teachers ſet over the flock of Chriſt. What love we have to each other, and in what unity of heart and mind we are eſtabliſhed, you may in part read in every family you come, and in every publick meeting and Congregation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon matters Civil or Divine: For it's a great part of the work of our Teachers we ſet over them, at ſeaſonable times to viſit their people, and in Chriſtian love to quiet and compoſe the differences, quarrels, or private animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities amongſt them, by removing the cauſes, and bringing them to a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of each other, ſtudying by all mild and prudential means their recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, nipping their feuds and quarrels in their firſt bud, ſo prevent their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming publick.</p>
            <p>As to the publick peace we enjoy, no people, Country, nor Kingdom whatſoever can vye with us, having now enjoyed great peace without any diviſion, fraction, or ſchiſm, either in Church or State, for ſo many hundred
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61344:7"/>
years. Tell me, I challenge you, what Country, Nation, Kingdom or States can glory of the like? It's true that of the States of <hi>Venice</hi> come the neareſt to us of any known parts of the World, having had their Government unvaried for about 1400 years, which no Princes or Kingdoms in <hi>Europe</hi> can boaſt of. But yet they maintain their peace and unity at home by their Wars abroad; which very thing renders their peace the leſs peaceable; whilſt we have no enemies at home or abroad to annoy or diſturb our peace.</p>
            <p>And thus (my Son) as I have in the firſt place ſhewed you the happy and florid ſtate of our Church, with the amiable effects and fruits thereof; which like a wholſome and fruitful tree, whoſe leaves and fruits are for the healing of our whole Nation; So my next work (according to my propos'd method) is to ſhew you how your Church of <hi>England</hi> (as you call it) comes ſhort of, and deviates from ours.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Therefore (my Son) although yours be Epiſcopal (which ſo far is well) yet you differ from us in your Head; and you ſee what little alterations made in Heads, whether Eccleſiaſtical, Civil, or Natural, begets great changes and alterations in all Bodies appertaining thereto. To inſtance firſt in Eccleſiaſtick Bodies: do not you obſerve that in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, the Head thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pope, doth, by his pretended Succeſſion in <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, to be Chriſts Vicar upon Earth, and as ſuch aſſumes to himſelf that title (competible to no man but to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who as God and Man is the true Head of his Church) of Infallibility; which Headſhip and Infallibility thereof, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence hath it not, I pray, upon the whole? and how much (I would ask) doth that make their Church to differ not only from the Primitive Church of God, but alſo from all others in the world? We ſhall ſay nothing by reflection upon your Church, as it ſtands related to its head, leaving the ſuitableneſs of ſuch a Head to ſuch a Body, and the ſymmetry of the proportions thereof to your own conſideration. And as to Civil, do not you obſerve what alterations, Tyrants (thoſe monſtrous heads) make in their body Politick. And laſtly, as to the body Natural, what influence Cephalick diſeaſes have upon the whole Body, is evident in Paralytick, Apoplectick and Convulſive maladies; what theſe ſlight touches upon things may hint to you, I ſhall leave to your further, and more leiſure conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> How much your Church of <hi>England</hi> differs from ours of <hi>Benſalia,</hi> by admitting Scholaſtick Diſputations, and verbal janglings, your Univerſities, and many books of Controverſie put forth by them and their diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, doth teſtifie with what effects they have had, your late inteſtine broils, Civil Wars, yea and preſent animoſities doth too much declare, and we fear (if not ſeaſonably prevented) may eat out the very marrow and pith of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity (even love, unity, and peace) from amongſt you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> So much differs your Church from ours, wherein yours are guilty of offending their weak brethren, by ſtrictly impoſing upon them many indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Ceremonies, neither agreeable to Scripture, Reaſon, nor the natural <hi>Genius</hi> of your people, and thereby of making them ſin by forcing to a ſeparation and ſplitting of themſelves into Parties, Churches, or Congregations of their own, is too evident in the ſophiſms and factions of <hi>Presbyterians, Independents, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, Quakers, &amp;c.</hi> of all which diviſions, how much your Epiſcopal
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61344:7"/>
Church (what through your ſtiff adhering to ſome diſpenſible Ceremonies, and through ſome other cauſes yet to be toucht upon) has been and is the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, let your ſpeedy pouring in of oyl into the wounds of your offended and diſſatisfied brethren, be (by the effects) the Judg. Do your Biſhops and their Subſtitutes by friendly viſits, prayer, and tender demeanor, endeavour the ſatisfying the ſcruples of Conſcience in their diſſenting Brethren? Do they by abating or cutting off their bill of Ceremonies at halves (which they may well enough afford to do) and by opening wide their Church doors, make way to take in thoſe they have formerly ſo peeviſhly thruſt out? And laſtly, do they by their good lives, pious example, and other requiſite ſuitable means, ſtudy the reclaiming of their diſſatisfied Brethren?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> So much doth your Church differ and deviate from ours, by how much you endulge and keep up thoſe Courts of vexation, call'd by you (improperly enough) Spiritual Courts. Your Citations, Excommunications, Capias's, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, all to get money with, we (except what we hear of you) know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of. An Excommunicated perſon of your Church may (ſo byaſſed are you by gain) buy it off with money; which in our Church without repentance, is impoſſible to be done, and when done, it's without charge to the offender. Can your Biſhops and their Vicegerents through a ſound judgment in Spiritual things that differ, diſtinguiſh aright between theſe three ſorts of perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Thoſe who are Hypochondriack, and thereby fall into different notions. 2. Thoſe who for oſtentation ſake, and to make themſelves popular, deſignedly blazon their new and lately coyn'd opinions diametrically oppoſite to the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Principles of Chriſtianity or Goſpel of Chriſt. And <hi>3ly,</hi> ſuch as truly out of a Conſcientious zeal eſtabliſh and confirm ſome Doctrines and Diſciplines different from the received ones. Do they not only know (I ſay) how rightly to diſtinguiſh theſe, but alſo by proper expedients, how to reduce them to their proper Claſſis, and bring them to rights again? Do they not only know (of which they cannot well be ignorant) but do they likewiſe ſtudy to make it practical? and are they ſolicitous to ſatisfie your peoples ſcruples without putting them to a peny charge?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly.</hi> Yours differ from ours in your Viſitations; and that, firſt, your Biſhops rarely viſit in perſon as we do: <hi>2ly,</hi> Your Biſhops Deputies ſearch more into the faults and lapſes of the people, than into the errors, debaucheries, and bad exemplary lives of their Paſtors and Teachers; which is quite the contrary to what we do. And how much care ſhould be taken for the purging and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punging all ſcandalous Miniſters in order to the health, peace, unity, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the ſeveral Churches we preſide, the difference betwixt our Church-State (where ſuch care is taken) and yours (by the due conſideration of matters now under diſcourſe) will eaſily determine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6ly.</hi> Ours differ from yours, particularly in relation to the dignity and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the higheſt Miniſters of the Church; and that firſt as to dignity, yours are Lords, ours not; yours make ſure of a Kingdom here, ours are as ſure as they, but with this difference, ours is to come and only foreſee it by faith; yours have it preſent, which requires not much faith, for that which is of faith is not ſeen. Therefore perhaps yours may think themſelves on the ſurer ſide of the buſh; however as to that Kingdom of Chriſt, we are willing to live by faith in view of it; and do not envy yours, their preſent temporal Kingdom.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61344:8"/>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> As to the function, we the Biſhops of <hi>Benſalia</hi> always preach in our own perſons, which few of yours do, but by proxy, as we have the ſtate of your Church repreſented to us; (contradict me in matters of fact if you can) being willing in every reſpect by our care, to ſhew our ſelves <hi>Epiſcopi,</hi> Overſeers, Biſhops indeed, and Paſtors over our belpved flocks; one ſheep in which flock we value more than a thouſand (if there were ſo many) diſpenſible Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7ly.</hi> Compulſion in matters of Religion makes yours to differ from ours; for you compell and drive by force as much as you well can. But we compel not at all; and yet our flock by ſuch ſoft tender means as we treat them with, is much larger, yea more ſecured and fixt to us than yours by your ſeverer me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, is, or in probability ever can be. For we chain them to us by our friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Chriſtian charity, and tender affection, ſhewn to them upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by which we purchaſe more love from them than yours can ever do by all threats of Citations, Excommunications, Capias's, and other vexatious brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing modes of treating them; all which ſets them more aloof off you, and confirms them more in their ſeveral Claſſis of Separation.</p>
            <p>Thus our Biſhops (good old and reverend Fathers are they) are not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid leſt the pomp of the world ſhould ſteal away their hearts from God, and they thereby ſhould become droniſh Shepherds, who thence ſhould (not only) not feed the flock of Chriſt, but perhaps through idleneſs and the heaping up of worldly wealth, might give way to that error as to endeavour to hinder others from feeding the flock, whom God had fitted with endowments and gifts for that purpoſe; but alſo are afraid leſt by too ſtiff maintaining arbitrary and diſputable Ceremonies, they ſhould give cauſe to the beginning of diviſions in our happy and peaceable Church.</p>
            <p>Now (my Son) what remains to be ſpoken according to my propos'd method, is next to ſhew you the reaſons hereof; and laſtly, to propoſe ſome expedients in order to the healing your long contracted differences in your Churches: As to the firſt of which you may (if you obſerve) take notice, that I have moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what interwoven the reaſons with the differences I have been acquainting you with. And that in the main the reaſons of your differences and diviſions amongſt your ſelves, chiefly, if not ſolely, ſprings from the deviation of your Church of <hi>England</hi> from ours of <hi>Benſalia,</hi> as you may eaſily and with much perſpicuity ſee in the lately quoted ſeven Heads, to which we have reduc'd the moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble differences and deviations of your Church from ours, which is obvious to any one who reads them. Which I ſhall here only in ſhort recount, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In your Head.</item>
               <item>2. In your permiſſion and indulgence of dubious Controverſies and jangling Diſputations.</item>
               <item>3. In your ſtrict impoſition of diſpenſible Ceremonies upon your weak and diſſatisfied Brethren.</item>
               <item>4. By your upholding thoſe vexatious Courts call'd Spiritual Courts, that newly furbiſhed Inquiſition, or Religious-houſe of Correction, where your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwindgers from money-mulcts got by Citations, Excommunications, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> raiſe their fortunes out of the ruins of your weak and diſtreſſed Brethren, whom you ſhould rather pity, commiſerate, and receive into tender bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</item>
               <item>5. In your Viſitations, by your ſcourging the people rather than removing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61344:8"/>
bad exemplary, and therefore ſcandalous Miniſters, the great eye-ſore of your people.</item>
               <item>6. In that your Biſhops, as to dignity, are Lords; and as to function rarely preach.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Laſtly, By your compulſion in matter of Religion. In all which I ſay you differ and deviate from us and our Church-diſcipline. And therefore no wonder that you have not enjoyed thoſe expected fruits (which we conſtantly poſſeſs) of love, unity and peace, but rather have been imbroiled in Domeſtick diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, animoſities, and inteſtine Wars, the bane and reproach of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>For can you expect to gain the credit of being endowed with Chriſtian charity, while you ſhew ſo much of a ſpirit of enmity, as to impoſe burdens up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on weak Conſciences, and not condeſcend (in matters dubious, and therefore indifferent) to the weakneſſes of your diſſatisfied Brethren? And can you think to procure a happy unity amongſt your ſelves (which we always enjoy) while in the forenamed Heads you take away the very baſis and foundation thereof? Laſtly, can you upon ſerious conſideration perſwade your ſelves, that ever you ſhall poſſeſs peace, while you vex, diſquiet, and ſit upon the skirts of your Brethren in matters indifferent, wherein they ought in all Chriſtian ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, not only to be received, but to be as well ſatisfied as your ſelves?</p>
            <p>But I haſt, leſt your company will wonder what is become of us; therefore as to the laſt thing I propos'd to diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to propound ſome happy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient in order to the healing your claſhing differences, and towards the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting a Chriſtian charity and firm union amongſt your diſcording Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which becauſe it would be too tedious now to inſiſt upon, as alſo would (I fear) too much intrench upon your Companies patience, I ſhall therefore refer to its due place in a Letter, which I intend (if it ſhall be permitted by our King and Sophi) to write to one of your Arch-Biſhops in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, at preſent take notice (my Son) that I have not diſcours'd theſe matters to you without both the knowledg, yea and advice of our King and his Sophi, whoſe leave and conſent we deſire, before we diſcourſe any thing of this nature to ſtrangers. But in as much as you are (my Son) highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by them (more than any ſtranger that ever yet came upon our happy Iſland) I was (I ſay) not only permitted, but indeed adviſed to make this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtate of our Church, and to compare it with yours, that thereby you may legibly view the difference.</p>
            <p>Whether at your return from us you may have leave to publiſh this relation in your own Country, in order to their good, I know not; as to which you are to wait our King with his Sophy's pleaſure therein. Only this (on the by) I may take leave to acquaint you with, that none of your Country-men (that we call to mind) was ever before caſt upon our coaſts, except one, which was my Lord <hi>Verulam,</hi> whoſe ſtay in the Country was ſo ſhort, as he took but a tranſient view, and therefore gave but a ſlight and imperfect account thereof to the world. Now in order to your more through information, I have perform'd my charge (and hope others according to their ſeveral incumbent tasks will do the like) and if it ſhall be permitted to come abroad, I pray God what I have ſaid of ours, may become exemplary to your diſtracted Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi> eſpecially to <hi>England</hi> (that happy Country, if they knew their own good), to which place we ſeem with a joint conſent (I had almoſt ſaid harmonically) to wiſh well, and to write the firſt copy after our original pattern; which (with a great deal of ſeriouſneſs concluding) the great God of Heaven for his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Sons ſake bleſs unto you, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:61344:9"/>Which done, I made my Obeyſance to the Biſhop, and humbly thank'd the Reverend Father for his great condeſcention, love, and familiarity, in his late admirable diſcourſe. As I was coming forth of the withdrawing-room, the Biſhop thruſt a heavy paper, well lin'd with red, into my hand: What mean you, Reverend Father, ſaid I, the fee is rather due to you, for you have given the advice, while I have been your Auditor, and our Church your Patient. Come, come, ſaith the Biſhop, this is only a ſmall pledg of the kindneſs and bounty you are likely to partake of in this Country, and to ſhew you we are kind to ſtrangers, and that we not only talk, but do. I return'd my humble thanks and acknowledgment of double obligation to the Biſhop. Now (ſaith he) before we return to your company, I would only add, that if you ſhall have the honour of being admitted to diſcourſe with any of the Sophy, thoſe Fathers of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s houſe, and Knights of the Noble Order of the Golden Fleece, I doubt not but they will give you an account of the greateſt ſecrets and rarities, attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in nature by art; which will doubtleſs ſtrike in you no ſmall admiration, to view thoſe wonders, and grand <hi>Arcana</hi> of nature and art, they are poſſeſſors of; they being <hi>Adepti</hi> of the choiceſt ſecrets within the orb of Viſibles.</p>
            <p>Now (ſaith he) we will return to your Company. To whom he was pleaſed to make a ſhort Apology for his abſence; having (ſaith he) had ſomewhat of great import to relate to your friend the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Doctor; at which I hope you are not offended. Then we all acknowledging the Biſhops free, kind and noble Treat, took our ſolemn leave and departed.</p>

               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving by the advice and conſent of our King of <hi>Benſalia</hi> and his Sophi, had lately a Conference with your beloved friend, and your Country-man an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Doctor, (providentially caſt upon our hitherto unknown Coaſts) about matters relating to ours and your Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who ſince that diſcourſe, has been ſo highly favour'd by the King and Council, as to be indulg'd the liberty of looking into, and taking cognizance of the Government, Laws, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, and other grand affairs of our thrice happy Country, yea, has been thought worthy of taking a proſpect of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s houſe, that glorious fabrick of the world, and there to view the admirable improvements of Art and Nature to their utmoſt perfection they are capable of: And to whom the Sophi has been free to impart ſome of their grand <hi>Hermetick Arcana,</hi> (otherwiſe by Writers upon that ſubject, wrapt up in Hieroglyphicks, and other dark Enigmatical Characters) alſo has had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with ſome of our Phyſicians, who doubtleſs for their high knowledg in the Theory, and great skill in the curing of Diſeaſes, may without any affected Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole, be reputed the best in the world. As to which, what advantage he may thereby reap in the influencing his practice at his return, will be afterwards known. What was then left imperfect in my late diſcourſe with him, ſhewing the difference betwixt our happy Church of <hi>Benſalia</hi> and yours of <hi>England,</hi> in the late thing there propos'd, <hi>viz.</hi> the propounding ſome happy Expedient in order to the healing your claſhing differences, and what might moſt tend towards the begetting a Chriſtian charity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and love union among you, is now I ſay the main ſcope of theſe lines. And indeed our King, his Sophi, and our Biſhops, (men doubtleſs gifted with high and noble endowments from God) do all unanimouſly conſent and concur in the matter of advice I am by their appointment now to propound to you, which is in the particulars following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That you will ſet your Church-doors not only achar, but wide open, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off at halves, or rather indeed the whole <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>ll of diſpenſible Ceremonies in your Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſcipline and Worſhip, no way eſſential to the Apoſtolical Doctrine of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> That you will expunge or eject all idle, droniſh, drunken, lend, ignorant, ſcandalous Miniſters, who in publick only ſerve to read over a Tranſcript, ſcarce daring to caſt their eye off it, and whoſe evil examples, as they are bad preſidents to the vulgar, and more looſe, wickedly inclin'd, ſo they are alſo offenſive and ſcandalous to the ſober, good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and well inclin'd people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thence become a great block of offence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> That in lieu of the aforeſaid debaucht or otherwiſe ſcandalous Miniſters, you would admit of as many honeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſcientious, ſober, judicious, vigilant and able Ministers (now as the preſent ſtate of affairs are, ſecluded) ſuch whoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is ſound, agreeable to Scripture, and the known Truthe thereof, and whoſe lives for piety, are exemplary in all good Chriſtian converſation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:61344:10"/>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> In order thereto, that in all your Viſitations you have a ſtricter eye to the Doctrine and Morals of the Preachers, than to the demeanor of the people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly.</hi> That all manner of force or compulſion be forbidden, whereby no other than ſoft, gentle, tender, bowel-like means may be us'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6ly.</hi> That you impoſe no heavy burdens in matters of Religion, upon the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of your people; but that that may be kept free, whoſe ſingular prerogative it is to be ſubject to God alone, as being his Kingdom and juriſdiction, and in the main ſolely accountable to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7ly.</hi> That the path to Eccleſiaſtical preferments may never be way laid by inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, Symony, or other indirect courſes; but that every man according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of his converſation, learning, gifts, and qualifications, may himſelf (and not by proxy, intereſt, &amp;c.) gradually aſcend thoſe ſteps of preferment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>8ly.</hi> That no one perſon have two Livings, nor no one able Preacher to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>9ly.</hi> That you forbid all manner of diſputes and ſcholaſtick janglings in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſial points of Religion; keeping a middle road betwixt the extreams of the ſevereſt <hi>Galviniſm,</hi> and extravagant <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> in matters of Election, Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and Free<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>will; rather acquainting the people with, and preſſing them to the great neceſſity of their obedience to the requirings of the Goſpel than too much prying into the ſecrets of Gods council, preaching the Doctrine of Christ in the evidence of the Spirit, with demonſtration and power.</p>
            <p>And by this wide manner of opening the Church-doors, and the milder treats, you will ſurely find by a wiſe (but honeſt) ſtratagem, manag'd by a gentle and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine method, the moſt of other ſorts of perſwaſions (who at preſent are at a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote diſtance from them) brought over to be one with you. Thoſe who will not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by yet come in, will in probability be ſcarce more than two ſorts, who still are to be treated with all gentle means imaginable. And becauſe thoſe who remain, are generally ſuch as are much tutor'd and led by their Teachers, whoſe example and Doctrine doth strangely influence their proſelytes; therefore your vein of policy muſt chiefly tend towards them; and that firſt in lieu of Citations, Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, Capias's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gaols, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by studying all manner of interweavings of intereſt and traffick with them, by making uſe of them in their imploys (if they have any) or by kind invitations, inter-marryings of yours with their Sons and Daughters, therehy and other familiar treats to remove all bars or lets in communication (want of which is the very gate to prejudice, and private feuds) whence from a free intercourſe, all ſtrangeneſs, private heats, and animoſities, (from not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtanding each other) will quite be remov'd and they conſequently reduced to a mutual firm unity, and Chriſtian charity with you, the great end of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian converſation. Add to all which, if a ſcore or two of the eminenteſt heads be taken off (not by an ax but) by preferring them to places of truſt and repute, <hi>viz.</hi> either by conferring places of trust at Court, or making them Noble-mens Stewards, Subtreaſurers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will mightily win upon them, and put a ſtop to the current of the preſent animoſities, the bane of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>Thus by your innocent and Chriſtian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like policy, you may without a peradventure gain ſuch a conqueſt over all your ſeparated Brethren, as all the ruder and more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere methods in the world could (if complicated) never effect; and would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alter the whole ſeries of affairs, make a new, but lovely ſcene of friendſhip, amity, and unity to appear; of the truth of all which by matter of fact upon trial, you would be abundantly ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:61344:10"/>Thus, my Lord, I have with great humility and ſincerity perform'd my charge: And whit other conference your <hi>Engliſh</hi> Doctor has had with Maſters of the Arts and Sciences, whom he has converſt with; and what diſcourſe has past between him and ſome of our Doctors and Apothecaries, relating to the great improvements of the practice of Phyſick: As alſo what mutual intercourſe he has had with ſome of our Sophi (thoſe masters in wiſdom) relating to the highest <hi>Hermetick Arcana,</hi> attainable by Nature and Art; he has liberty from our King and Council at due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to divulge; and what improvements may thence redound to your people, we leave to the future iſſue of time. If any ſcruples ſhould ariſe wherein you would be further ſatisfied, concerning what I have ſaid in the behalf of our ſo happy Church, the difference betwixt ours and yours, and expedients here propos'd; your Lordſhip may write it down, and ſend it to your <hi>Engliſh</hi> Doctors, who knows ways of ſending to us, and you ſhall as ſpeedily as may be receive further ſatisfaction. Mean while deſiring that your people may be the first who ſhall write after our original Copy, I take leave and remain,</p>
