         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Dover,</hi> Viſcount <hi>Rochford,</hi> Lord <hi>Hunſdon,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Approach your Lordſhip with
the ſame hardineſs as they who
ſatisfie themſelves, that the
ſincerity of the Giver may attone for
the little value of the gift; having
learnt this preſumption from Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
where I find that great Princes
have look'd kindly upon mean obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and thereby rendred the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity
of their acceptance more il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious,
by the duty and obedience
of the Preſenters.</p>
            <p>Nor with this trick of moral ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
would I be thought to wind your
Lordſhip into the reception of a
trifle, but that I carry a braver de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
in it; that is, on this occaſion
<pb facs="tcp:55817:3"/>
to make a publick acknowledgment
of the many and great favours (and
of one eſpecially above the reſt, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow
of your nobleneſs) which you
have been pleas'd to confer upon your
unworthy ſervant. For (my Lord)
the ſenſe of them hitherto, bounded
within the narrow knowledge of my
meanneſs, hath ſeem'd to me a kind
of guilty concealment, and almoſt
tantamount to a denyal of them, till
I was able to render this happy and
open declaration to the world, of an
humble and obſequious gratitude for
thoſe favours done me; and ſo done,
that your generous affability in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſing
them may for ever condemn
the rough cuſtom of the age, whoſe
haughty ſtate in doing kindneſſes,
does moſt commonly turn their
bread into ſtone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55817:3"/>
And though I know, that thanks
alone is no payment ſterling; yet
ſince to the greatest Beings for the
greateſt and moſt laſting benefits we
can ſcarce make any better return.
I hope it will not ſeem ſtrange, if I
preſent your Lordſhip the memory of
your own goodneſs to pay your ſelf.
For where the obligation exceeds
poſſibility of requital, the ſawſineſs
of attempting to ſatisfie, is infinitely
worſe than the humble acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſtill owing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I offer to your view a
piece, that dare not ſtand the teſt of
your Judgment, but would humbly
ſhelter near your goodneſs, &amp; which
(when your Lordſhip takes breath
from your other more weighty both
publick and private affairs) may
<pb facs="tcp:55817:4"/>
ſerve to entertain you in the leſs
ſerious part of the day; The matter
is leaſt mine, the form &amp; compoſure
I may own a whole ſhare in; ſo the
<hi>Bulloin</hi> of the <hi>Indies</hi> (if the alluſion
be not preſumptuous) becomes the
Kings coin, after it has receiv'd his
stamp &amp; image. And as after view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſcatter'd pleaſures of a large
and fair Garden, ſome ſatisfaction
is receiv'd from the contracted ſcent
and beauty of a poſie; ſo if I have
here at all juſtified the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,
whatever error may have paſt
in the choice or ordering of the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
I hope your Lordſhip will pardon

Afflictions of this Nature; there

which in you ſhine in their Meridian,

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Preſent you (Reader) with a novelty,
which if your pallate be not wholly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated,
may generally reliſh well with you.
For the variety of the matter you may call it
a kind of <hi>Olio,</hi> the ſeaſoning of which hath
coſt me both time and expence; and
though it be not of the choiceſt rarities, it is
done at leaſt according to the beſt of my
skill. If by this ſlender attempt I may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
any better able more handſomely and
regularly to couch a ſubject attended with
ſo much both profit and pleaſure, I think I
have done the kind and induſtrious part of
<pb facs="tcp:55817:7"/>
the world no ill office, who will (though
but for this reaſon) let paſs without rigid
and ſupercilious Cenſure the mean Eſſay of
him, whoſe ardor to ſerve them, hath ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
him leſs ſeeing in the examination of
his own ability. Yet would I not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
to know my ſelf and value my pains
ſo little, but that I may merit ſome thanks,
at leaſt from the well tempered meaſurers
of mens intentions: however ſome there
will be (and thoſe not a few) whom I could
wiſh (becauſe I love my ſelf well) might
be won to my ſide) but I fear my ſingle ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
of perſwaſion will never be able to gain
them; for being ill-natured, and therefore
doing nothing themſelves but miſchief,
they carry an intenſe hatred to thoſe that
would humbly do good, nay though it be
done never ſo perfectly. What quarter
then my poor offering (being ſenſible to
how many exceptions it may be lyable) is
like to find among them I well know, but
have heart enough not much to fear; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
hoping among the Candid Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſuch reception as will amply remunerate
<pb facs="tcp:55817:7"/>
me for all the ill uſage I may meet with
elſewhere.</p>
            <p>Here is a taſt then (to you kind Reader
I ſpeak it) of what in ſo uſeful a Subject
might be performed by a more judicious
pen, Analects of the Hiſtory and Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the World, not ſo choicely nor methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
handled as might be expected, but yet
may ſerve to refreſh your memory after the
tedious and ill way of other mighty Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes.
It were a worthy employ for any
that hath parts and leiſure to go through
with it (in a more acute and accurate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
not emitting ought memorable) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
from thoſe numerous Records of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
all ſuch ſhort Memoirs as may tend
either to inſtruction or delight. And as he
will thereby infinitely oblige both theſe,
whoſe way of Education may have leſs qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
them to diſtinguiſh the Stars in ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the vaſt Ocean of Story; and thoſe
alſo, whoſe confinement in time or coin
may diſenable them for ſuch expenſive
ways of knowledge: So ſhall he in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
find me the moſt acknowledging of all
<pb facs="tcp:55817:8"/>
his Servants, muſt eſteem mine moſt happy
faults, that have been to him incentives of

DESCRIPTION
OF THE
WORLD.</head>
            <p>IN our Deſcription of the World
there are four parts, into which the
World is divided; <hi>Europe, Aſia,
Africa, America utraque.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will begin firſt with <hi>Aſia,</hi> for in
<hi>Aſia</hi> did God himſelf ſpeak his miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
work of the Creation: There was
the Church firſt collected, there was
the Saviour of the world born, Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and Raiſed again: Indeed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55817:10"/>
part of Divine Hiſtory was there
written and Acted; There was the firſt
Monarch, and Monarchies of the World
in <hi>Aſſyria, Perſia, Babylonia, Media.</hi> The
firſt people of the world received their
being in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> and the ſeveral
tongues of the World their Original in
<hi>Babylonia:</hi> Theſe are parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi>
and were in the firſt ages bleſt with
God's own holy Preſence, <hi>Exodus</hi> the
third; and the footing of <hi>Angels, Exod.</hi>
14. However, now it is left (for her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity)
to the puniſhment of a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Curſe that long before paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her, and is delivered up into the
hands of Turks, and Nations that
Blaſpheme the Creatour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth not flouriſh in that height
as heretofore.</p>
            <p>Now add together, that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
was at firſt the Paradiſe of the
World, and indeed ſtill enjoyeth a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Soyl and temperate Air, and that
it exceeds in compaſs the two other
parts of the old World, to which ſhe was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55817:10"/>
the Miſtreſs for Arts and Sciences; Yet is
it not at this day ſo well peopled in
proportion, as this little <hi>Europe,</hi> which
came many hundred years after; for
this we need ſearch no further cauſe than
God's juſt Anger: Yet hath he not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
upon her, only by Miraculous
and Immediate Puniſhment from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but hath ſuffered (as it were) her
own Creatures, over which Man at
the firſt had the Rule) to turn head
upon their Lords, and poſſeſſe their
Habitation, for it is ſo over-run with
wild-Beaſts, and cruel Serpents, that
in many places they live not without
much danger.</p>
            <p>In this; though the Nation ſuffer for
their Monſtrous Irreligion; Yet the
Earth which did not offend, reſerves her
place, and abounds with many excellent
commodities, not elſe-where to be
had; Myrrhe, Frankincenſe, Cinamon,
Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace, Pepper, Musk,
Jewels of great eſteem, and Minerals of
all ſorts; It breeds Elephants, Camels,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55817:11"/>
and many other Beaſts; Serpents, Fowl
wild and tame, and ſome have added
ſuch Monſtrous ſhapes of men, as paſſe
all belief.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Aſia</hi> were the ſeven Churches
which St. <hi>John</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calips;</hi>
now ſcarce is it inhabited but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Sea-ſide, and that by a baſe
and abject people, ſuch as are both lazy
in their life, and odious Idolaters in their
Religions, for the moſt part Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Epheſus</hi> it ſelf the Star of <hi>Aſia,</hi>
that as well for her Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
as her miraculous
Temple,<note place="margin">This is within the compaſs of that one part which bears the name of <hi>Aſia pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pria.</hi>
               </note> ſet the world at
gaze upon her: It was
raiſed in the middle of the
City, Modelled out by
<hi>Cteſifon,</hi> but was 220. years in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and was ordered in ſuch a ground,
that no Earth-quake ſhould move it; It
was 425. foot long, and 220. broad,
and 127. Pillars, given by ſo many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Kings, whereof twenty ſeven
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55817:11"/>

of Marble poliſhed. In this City St.
<hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt is ſaid to have gone
down into his Grave alive, there be
who yet queſtion his death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Armenia minor,</hi> which is one of the
Provinces of <hi>Aſia minor,</hi> is by moſt
thought to be the Land of <hi>Ararat</hi> where
the Ark reſted, And there is great ſtore
of Oyl, and excellent Wine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arabia Foelix</hi> in <hi>Aſia major</hi> is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the fruitfulleſt Country in the World.
In this <hi>Arabia</hi> is the City <hi>Medina,</hi> where
<hi>Mahomet</hi> is Intombed in an Iron Cheſt,
ſupported only by a Roof of Adamant,
without other Art to keep it from
falling to the ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyprus</hi> a place heretofore Conſecrated
to <hi>Venus,</hi> to whom both Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
performed their Sacrifice naked, till
by the prayer of <hi>Barnabas</hi> the Apoſtle,
the Temple was ruined.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trojus</hi> Reports, that the Fathers of
this Iſle had wont to proſtitute their
Daughters to Mariners for money,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55817:12"/>
whereby to raiſe them a portion againſt
they could get them Husbands; but
Chriſtianity corrected thoſe Barbarous
Cuſtoms.</p>

               <head>AFRICA.</head>
               <p>IN moſt parts ſhe hath ſcarce plenty
ſufficient to maintain Inhabitants,
and where there is, we ſhall meet
with multitudes of Ravening Beaſts,
or other horrible Monſters, enough to
devour both it and us: In a word,
There is no Region of the World ſo
great an Enemy to Mans Commerce;
there is ſuch ſcarcity of water, that no
Creature almoſt could live, had not
Nature provided thereafter, that the
greater part of them endures not drink
in the very midſt of Summer: And if
(as ſometimes they be enforced by ſuch
as take them) they ſuddenly periſh.
Thus we ſee how God gives a property
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55817:12"/>
to each place, that may make up her
defects, leaſt it ſhould be left as well by
Beaſts as Men.</p>
               <p>Their Land is full of ſandy Deſarts,
which lye open to the winds and ſtorms,
and oftentimes are thrown up into Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
like Waves of the Sea, and indeed
are no leſs dangerous. <hi>Strabo</hi> writes, that
<hi>Cambyſes</hi> his Army was thus hazarded;
a fooliſh Nation in <hi>Africa,</hi> as they march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
towards the South, to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon the Winds for drying up
their Rivers, were overwhelmed with
Sand, and ſo dyed in their Graves. It is
alſo full of a venemous kind of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
that in ſome places they dare not
dreſs their Lands unleſs they firſt fence
their legs with Boots againſt the ſting:
Other wild Creatures there are, which
range about, and poſſeſſe to themſelves
a great portion of this Countrey, and
make it a Wilderneſs of Lyons, Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards,
Elephants; and in ſome places
Crocodiles, Hyena's, Baſilisks, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Monſters without either number
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55817:13"/>
or name: <hi>Africa</hi> as it is reported, is full
of danger to the Inhabitants, more dye
by Beaſts than by diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>But among all theſe Inconveniences,
Commodities are found of good worth,
and the very evils yield at laſt their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
both to their own Country and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of the world: The Elephant
a docible Creature and exceeding uſeful
for Battel; The Camel which affords
much riches to the <hi>Arabian;</hi> The <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary</hi>
Horſe, which we our ſelves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend;
The Ram that beſides his fleſh
gives twenty pound of wool from his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

ſo moſt of their worſt, alive or dead

the world could not well want.</p>
               <p>In one of the Diviſions of <hi>Africa,</hi>
which is <hi>Feſſe</hi> that hath a City in it with

the Globes of pure Gold that ſtands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

the top of it, and weighing 130000.
<hi>Barbary</hi> Duckats.</p>
               <p>The Land of <hi>Negro</hi> is full of Gold
and Silver, and other commodities, but
the Inhabitants moſt barbarous; they
draw their Original from <hi>Chus,</hi> and have
entertained all Religions that came in
their way; firſt their own, then the
Jews, the Mahumetans, and ſome of
them the Chriſtian; For the moſt part
they live not as if Reaſon guided their
Actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bornaum,</hi> a Country where the people

               <p>
                  <hi>Aethiopia ſuperiour,</hi> it is governed
by one of the mightieſt Emperors in

he hath under him ſeventy Kings, which

Among theſe the Province of <hi>Dobas</hi> hath
one, that no man marry till he hath
killed twelve Chriſtians; Their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55817:14"/>
yet differ from us, for they Circumciſe
both ſects; their Oath is by the life of
their King, whom they never ſee but at
<hi>Chriſtmas, Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Holy-Rood;</hi> Their
Commodities are Oranges, Lemmons,

               <p>
                  <hi>Aethiopia inferior,</hi> the Government of

Here there lives a kind of <hi>Amazons</hi> as

Maſtives. <hi>Cafraria</hi> is another Kingdom
whoſe people live in the Woods with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Laws like brutes. And here ſtands
the <hi>Cape</hi> of good Hope, about which the
Sea is alwaies rough and dangerous; It
hath been eſpecially ſo to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
it is their own note, inſomuch, that
one was very angry with God, that
he ſuffered the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hereticks to

and have ſhambles of Mens fleſh, as

their Nation with ſtolen Brats from
their Neighbouring Countries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aegypt</hi> is another part of the <hi>African</hi>

Rats coming at the firſt out of a Ship,
few in number, increaſed in the ſpace
of two years or leſs ſo exceedingly, that
they filled not only thoſe places where
they were firſt Landed. But ſwimming
from place to place, ſpread themſelves
into all parts of the Country: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that there was no Iſland, though
ſevered by the Sea from all other
Lands, and many Miles diſtant from the
Iſles where the Rats had their Original,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55817:31"/>
but was peſtred with them. They had
their neſts almoſt in every Tree, and in
all places their Burrows in the ground
(like Connies) to harbour in; They
ſpared not the Fruits of Plants or Trees,
neither the Plants themſelves, but eat
them up. When we had ſet our Corn,
they would commonly come by troops
the night following, or ſo ſoon as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to grow, and dig it up again. If by
diligent watching any of it were preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
till it came to earing, it ſhould then
very hardly ſcape them; yea, it was a
very difficult matter after they had it in
their Houſes, to ſave it from them; for
they became noy ſome even to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Men. They uſed all diligence
for the deſtroyng of them, nouriſhing
many Cats wild and tame for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
they uſed Ratsbane, and many
times ſet fire on the Woods, ſo as the
fire might run half a Mile or more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it were extinct. Every Man in the
Country was enjoyned to ſet twelve
traps, and ſome of their own accord ſet
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55817:32"/>
near a hundred, which they viſited
twice or thrice in a night; they trained
up their Dogs to hunt them, wherein
they grew ſo expert, that a good Dog
in two of three hours ſpace, would kill
forty or fifty Rats: and other means
they uſed to deſtroy them, but could
not prevail, finding them ſtill to increaſe
againſt them, and continued with them
till almoſt to the end of
Captain <hi>Tuckers</hi> time (who
was then Governour) but
towards the end of his
time it pleaſed God (by
what means it is not well known) to
take them away;<note place="margin">Captain <hi>Tucker</hi> ſucceeded Mr. <hi>Moor</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, arriving in <hi>May</hi> 1616.</note> inſomuch that Wild

Fiſhes, Beaſts, and Fowls; They are in

and have four fins, they are as great as
three or four men can carry, the upper
part of them is covered with a great
ſhell, which they call a Galley patch,
weighing about half a hundred weight,
the Fleſh that cleaveth to the inſide of
this being Roaſted againſt the Fier, is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55817:33"/>
excellent Meat, almoſt like the Marrow

horn; ſhe hath alſo a ſhell on her belly
not ſo hard, but being boyled it beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
ſoft, like the ſinews or griſtle of
Beef, and good Meat. Theſe live in the
Sea, ſpending the Spring time, and part
of Sommer about theſe Iſlands, but the

They are like to Fowl in reſpect of
ſmallneſs, and faſhion of their heads and
necks, which are wrinckled like a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies,

They alſo breed their young of Eggs
which th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

hard and ſolid, and they feed always up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
graſs growing at the bottom of the
water; neither can they abide any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
under water then they hold their
breath, which the old ones will do long,
but the young ones being chaſed to and

their firſt coming in, the Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male

couple, which is there called Coot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
this they continue ſome three days

ſcarce ſeparate though a Boat come to

Not long after, the ſhe Turckle
comes up by night upon ſome ſandy
Bay, and further up then the water u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth

Eggs (as it ſeems) are afterwards hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Earth; for they could never perceive

the Earth after they are hatched, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
(as is before ſaid) they cannot live
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55817:34"/>
without breathing. Sometimes is ſeen
the young ones no bigger then a Mans

They grow ſlowly, and ſeem to have a

of the Water, and were wont to ſleep
often on the Land, till the Country was
peopled; they will alſo live out of the
Water ſome three weeks, and that
without Meat, but mourn and pine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
they are very witty. Being on the

no more without ſome help or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
recover themſelves, by which
means when they come on ſhore to lay
their Eggs, they are eaſily taken, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
they are when they are Cooting.
But otherwiſe they take them for the

by no means either of long praiſes or
large promiſes, able to gain like affection
at her hands: when he ſaw his hopes
fruſtrate, and that he was not like to have
his purpoſe of her, turned his love into
rage, and cut of the Maids head, which
being afterwards hung upon an Ewe
tree, common people counted it as an
hallowed Relique till it was rotten:
And afterward (ſuch was the credulity
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55817:52"/>
of that time) it maintained the opinion
of reverence and Religion ſtill, for the
people reſorted thither on Pilgrimage,
and perſwaded themſelves, that the little
veins that ſpread out between the bark
and body of the Ewe-tree like fine
threds were the very hairs of the Maids
head: Hereupon it was called by this

<hi>Strabo.</hi> The Inhabitants (ſaith he) of
<hi>Ireland</hi> are more rude then the <hi>Britains,</hi>
they feed upon the fleſh of men; yea,
and think it a point of worth to eat their
dead Parents, wantonly they accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
with Women, making no difference
of other mens wives, their own Siſters,
nor of their natural Mothers; but of
theſe things (ſaith he) we have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
witneſs of ſufficient credit. <hi>Pompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
Mela</hi> recordeth, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are
uncivil, ignorant of Vertues, and void
of Religion. And <hi>Solinus</hi> affirmeth, that
after Victory they drink the bloud of
the ſlain, and beſmear their own Faces
therewith, ſo given to War, that the
mother at the birth of a man-child, feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the firſt meat into her Infants mouth
upon the point of her Husbands ſword,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55817:64"/>
and with heatheniſh imprecations, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that it may dye no otherwiſe then
in War, or by ſword.</p>
               <p>But from theſe ancient and barbarous
manners, we will come to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their middle time, whom <hi>Giral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
Cambrenſis</hi> deſcribeth as followeth.
The <hi>Iriſh</hi> (ſaith he) are a ſtrong and bold
people, Martial and Prodigal in War;
nimble, ſtout and haughty of heart; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
of life, but greedy of glory; courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to ſtrangers, conſtant in Love, light
of belief, impatient of injury, given to
fleſhly luſts, and in enmity implacable.
At the baptizing of their Infants, their
manner was, not to dip their right arms
into the water, that ſo (as they thought)
they might give a more deep and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable
blow, never calling them by the
name of their Parents whileſt they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
together, but at their death took it
upon them: Their Women nurſed
not their Children they bare, and they
that nurſed others, did affect and love
them much more than their own.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:55817:65"/>
So much were they given to Fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
conceits, that they held it very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
to give their Neighbours Fire
upon <hi>May-day,</hi> to eat an odd Egg;
endangered the death of their Horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And before they caſt in their ſeed, they
ſent ſalt into the field; to hang up the
ſhells in the roof, was a preſervative of
the Chickens from the Kite; to ſet up
green boughs at their doors in the
month of <hi>May,</hi> increaſed their Kines
Milk, and to ſpit upon Cattel, they held
it good againſt Witchery, whereof <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was full.</p>
               <p>Superſtitious Idolatry among the
Wild <hi>Iriſh</hi> was common, yielding di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
honour unto the Moon after the
change, unto whom they both bowed
their knees, and made ſupplications, and
with a Loud Voice would thus ſpeak
unto that Planet, <hi>We pray thee leave us
in as good Eſtate as thou foundſt us.</hi>
Wolves they did make as their <hi>God-ſis,</hi>
terming them <hi>Chari Chriſt,</hi> and ſo
thought themſelves preſerved from their
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55817:65"/>
hurts, the hoofs of dead Horſes they
accounted and held Sacred: About
childrens necks they hung the beginning
of St. <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel, a crooked nail of an
Horſe ſhooe, or a piece of a wolves-skin,
and both the ſucking Child and Nurſe
were girt with Girdles finely plated with
Womans hair; ſo far they wandred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ways of errour, in making theſe
arms the ſtrength of their healths.</p>
               <p>Their Wives were many, by reaſon of
Divorcements, and their Maids marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at twelve years of Age, whoſe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
were to ſend to their lovers, brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
plated, and curiouſly wrought of
their own hair, ſo far following <hi>Venus</hi>
in the knots of theſe allurements. The
men wore Linnen ſhirts exceedingly
large, ſtained with Saffron, the ſleeves
wide, and hanging to their knees, ſtrait
and ſhort Truſſes plated thick in the
skirts, their Breeches cloſe to the thighs,
a ſhort skeine hanging point down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and a Mantle moſt times caſt over
their heads. The women wore their
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55817:66"/>
hair plated in curious manner, hanging
down their backs and ſhoulders from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foulden wreaths of fine Linnen, roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about their heads, rather loding the
wearer then delighting the beholder;
for as the one was moſt ſeemly, ſo the
other was unſightly, their necks was
hung with Chains and Carkaneths, their
Arms wreathed with many Bracelets,
and over their ſide garments the Shag
Rug Mantles, purfled with a deep
fringe of divers colours, both Sexes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
idleneſs their only liberty, and
eaſe their greateſt riches.</p>

where transformed (as they did believe)

he remained until he was hunted with

               <p>For the dying and dead, they hired

               <p>His place of Birth is queſtioned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he were a <hi>Cirenick,</hi> an <hi>Arabian,</hi> or
<hi>Perſian,</hi> it is not yet fully decided; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
enough it is he was of baſe Parents,
his Father (ſome ſay) a Worſhipper of
Devils, and his Mother a faithleſs Jew,
betwixt them they ſent into the World
a pernicious deceiver (which none but
two ſuch Religions could have made
up.) In the year 597. when he had
been for a while thus inſtructed by his
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55817:68"/>
diſtracted Parents, poverty and hope to
improve his Fortunes, perſwaded him
from his Native ſoil, to live for another
while among true profeſſed Chriſtians,
where he received ſo much knowledge
of the Word, and light of the Goſpel,
as to pervert it to his deſtruction, and
ruine of many Millions of ſouls.</p>
               <p>In his firſt adventurous travels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
he fell into the hands of thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh
<hi>Saracens,</hi> which ſold him to a Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Merchant, and he imployed him to
drive his Camels through <hi>Egypt, Syria,
Paleſtine,</hi> and other forrain Countries,
where he ſtill gathered farther inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of that truth which he intended
to abuſe. His wickedneſs firſt brake
forth into fraud, open Theft and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,
and other ſins of higheſt rank, in
which he continued and ſeduced others,
till the death of his Maſter, and after
marryed his Aged, but rich Miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>He had means now to act his malicious
purpoſes, and wealth to countenance his
exceeding Pride, which would not be
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55817:69"/>
ſatisfied with a lower Ambition, then to
be called a Prophet of God. This he
began to practice, by the Counſel of one
<hi>Sergius</hi> a Monk, who being caſt out for
Hereſie from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> betook
himſelf into <hi>Arabia,</hi> and joyned in with
<hi>Mahomet</hi> to make up this miſchief per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
ſee now their Juggling. There
wanted no craft betwixt them, to make
uſe of his worſt actions to gull the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
For when by his debaucht drinking
and gluttony, he was fallen into an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſie,
and in his fits lay (Bear like) gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
and foaming upon the Earth, as
one without ſenſe; he pretended an
Exta-like ſwoon, wherein his ſoul was
wrapped from his body, in which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſt
with <hi>Gabriel</hi> an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
To make this familiarity with God
the more to be believed, he had bred
up a Dove to take her meat from his ear,
which he moſt blaſphemouſly profeſſed
to be the Holy Ghoſt, who in ſuch times
and in that ſhape infuſed the propheſies
which he was to preach. Laſtly, what
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55817:69"/>
they in their wicked fancies had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and meant to propagate, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
into a Volume, and called it the
Alcoran.</p>
               <p>For this too they had a trick, that it
might ſeem to have been ſent from
Heaven into the hands of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and
to this purpoſe he had himſelf fed up a
tame Bull, which by cuſtom became ſo
familliar, that no ſooner he heard the
voice of his Maſter, but he would
ſtraight run, caſt the head in his lap, and
uſe his wanton dalliance as with a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
Betwixt the horns of this Bull, had
he faſtned the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and conveyed
him into a by-place, near where he had
aſſembled the Multitude at a ſet time,
to expect a wonderful Miracle from
Heaven that might confirm his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
The Scene thus ordered, on the
ſudden he lift up his voice, and made a
loud cry, which no ſooner the beaſt
heard, but he brake his way through the
Preſs, over-turned many of the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
which now ſtood at a gaze, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55817:70"/>
gently laid his horns and book in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
of this falſe couzener, which he with
much ceremony, and feigned Reverence
received, and in their preſence opening
the Volume, began to interpret the chief
of their Laws, which for hereafter they
were to obſerve.</p>
               <p>Circumciſion he allowed, and with
the old Law forbad Swines fleſh, that
he might with more eaſe lead on ſuch
as were Jewiſh; he ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be baptized by <hi>Sergius,</hi> that the
Chriſtian too might have in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
his content: <hi>Moſes</hi> and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
he denyed not to be great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
but that neither party might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate
the greater obſervance of other,
and indeed eſpecially that his own
might ſeem new, and yet take place
from both, he changed the circumſion
of the Jews from the eighth day, and
multiplyes baptiſm, which can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
but once for all, upon the true
believer. For the like reaſon of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with other Nations and Sects, he
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55817:70"/>
left both the Jews Sabbath, and <hi>diem
Chriſtianorum Dominicum,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
his holy ceremonies to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
on the <hi>Friday;</hi> for ſo it was,
whent he Bull beſtowed on him his <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caran.</hi>
Before they enter the Temple,
they waſh all the unclean parts of their
bodies, and then to prayer, which muſt
be performed five times in a day with
their face toward the <hi>South.</hi> They have
a Months faſt too once every year, but
it is obſerved only for the day, for they
may, when the Sun is down, redeem it
with what gluttony they pleaſe; Wine
is forbidden, only for a ſhew that he
might not ſeem to have loved that
which (he was guilty to himſelf) had
brought him into his Epileptical fits.
Briefly, what he knew would beſt agree
with the brutiſh deſires of the people,
that he took order ſhould be confirmed
by his Laws, four or five Wives to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Husband, and as many Concubines as
they could maintain. For their bliſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
life, he propoſed no inviſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55817:71"/>
which over reacht their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
but proportioned to each of
their ſenſual thoughts. And promiſed
to thoſe which would keep his Law a
Paradiſe of all kinds of pleaſure, which
they themſelves moſt affected, to the
covetous wealth, to the ambitious Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
to the gluttenous Meats, to the
Virgins rich attire, and embraces of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
the poor ſouls were never ſo fitted;
and when he had thus for a long time
diſcourſed over his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> he took a
yoak from <hi>Sergius,</hi> and put it upon the
Bulls neck; for it was fore-told by an
Inſcription brought by his door, that
whoſoever could yoke the Bull, it
ſhould be a ſign to declare the man, as
one ſent from God, to govern his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>This huddle of Miracles put the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers
beyond all pauſe, ſo that in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
they cryed him up King, and held

Prophet, called themſelves <hi>Muſulmanni;</hi>
true believers, which the <hi>Turk</hi> ſtill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55817:71"/>
rather than his right name of <hi>Turk,</hi>
which imports baniſhment, and unpraids
him the diſgrace of his Original.</p>
               <p>And now he hath paſt the difficulty
of his attempt, an eaſie matter to draw
on Millions of followers, ſuch as would
like that Religion beſt which baulkt not
their pleaſures; yet at laſt he met with
an end anſwerable to his beginning, for
he was poyſoned by ſome of his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>He had long before propheſied, that

had framed an Iron Cheſt for his Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre,
which he purpoſed ſhould have

it is very rare to ſee any of them in
a ſtrange Country, nor will they eaſily
admit a ſtranger far into theirs; they
are addicted much to Manual Arts, for
they have excellent practick Wits, and
indeed for that go beyond any other
Nation: Much quarrel hath been about
the invention of Guns and Printing,
which ſeveral people have been ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
to take to themſelves, as the
Maſter-piece of Mans wit; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt they were both uſed here,
long before any of Europe pretended to
the knowledge of either. In their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
they make not their Lines from
the Right hand to the left, as the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi>
nor from the left to the right as
we do, but from the top to the bottom
of the page, and uſe all one Character
through the whole Kingdom. Their
ſpecial skill, which we much admire, but
cannot imitate, is in making the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlain
diſhes white as very Snow, and
tranſparent as Glaſs, formed up only of
Cockles found in the Sea-ſhore, mixt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55817:73"/>
with Egg ſhells, but lye buryed in the
Earth many years before they come to
perfection, and are ſeldom took up by
the ſame Artificer, which kneads them,
but are left as a portion to ſome of his
Poſterity.</p>
               <p>When they travel over the Plains,
they uſe a kind of Coach, yet not drawn
with Horſes or other Beaſt, but driven
with the Wind under-ſail as a Bark on
the Sea, which the people are as perfect
to guide which way they pleaſe, as the
Mariner is to direct his courſe unto any
Coaſt whither he is bound; as they ſail
upon Land, as if it were Sea; ſo they
dwell as frequent upon the Sea, as if it
were Land; for they have an incredible
number of ſhips and Boats, which are in

ſuch as are here born, live, traffick, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

their number exceed any part proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

Land is not ſufficient, but is forced to
borrow room out of the Sea, for their
habitation. Yet are they all governed
by one Monarch, whom they call the
Lord of the World, and Son to the
Sun. In matters of State they are very
Politick, in Peace wary, and in War Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant,
crafty and excellent Engineers.</p>
               <p>Their Laws are for the moſt part juſt,
and ſeverely executed, eſpecially againſt
idle drones which ſet not a hand to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
their State, or maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
they will not cheriſh the very
blind by Alms, ſince without eyes a
man may be fit for ſome corporal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;
but to the maimed and
lame, they deny not a charitable main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;

almoſt is left for Wonderers: and
briefly, as far as humane Laws can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide,

Marriages they chiefly ſolemnize at the
New Moon, and for the moſt part in
<hi>March,</hi> which begins their year.</p>
               <p>For their Religion, they are <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
but have a confuſed knowledge of God,
Heaven, and the Creation: When they
would decipher their great God, they
expreſs him by the firſt Letter in their
Alphabet, and in their Devotions; they
worſhip him as their chief (but not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
preſerver, for they have their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to the Sun, Moon, Stars, and to the
Devil himſelf, that he would not hurt
them. Their Prieſts are diſtinguiſhed

call them, for they much reſemble Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

               <p>Their Stature is different. The moſt

with a crooked noſe, deformed counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
ſwarthy colour, hollow eyes, hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and untrimmed beard, and head cloſe
ſhaved. Their ſpeech is boiſterous, and

<hi>Sodomites;</hi> and yet take liberty for as
many Wives which they can maintain,
which (contrary to our civil courſes) they
buy of their Parents, inſtead of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

indeed impatient to be ſetled, or rather
impriſoned (as they take it) within any

Bow and Arrows, which they uſe moſt

not any compact made upon terms of
peace, but follow their own ſenſe, and
commit what out-rages they can with

               <p>Their Religion is anſwerable to their
vile cuſtoms; Some are Pagans, others
Mahometans, yet will not be called
<hi>Turks,</hi> but <hi>Berſemany,</hi> and their chief

Dukes aſpire not above his knee, nor
the Nobles higher then his feet, the
reſt are happy if they can but reach at
his garment, his Horſe, his any thing;
ſo ſimple are they in their ſuperſtition.
And thus have they continued either
Atheiſts or falſe Idolaters, ever ſince

the manner how, with their

knife and gives him a ſlaſh or cut down
the back on one ſide from the ſhoulder
to the waſte, and preſently gave him
ſuch another ſlaſh, three inches from the
firſt, then on the top he cut the ſlaſhes
into one, and preſently taking pincers,
took hold of the croſs cut, and tore him
down like a Girſe below the middle,
letting it hang down behind him like a
belt, after which he took his burning
pincers, and pluck'd off the tops of his
fingers of one hand; then paſſing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place of the Town, his other nipple
was plucked off, the other ſide of his
back ſo cut and mangled, (which they
call by the name of rimming) his other
fingers nip'd off; then paſſing further, all
his Toes were nip'd off with the burning
pincers, after which he was inforced to
come out of the Cart, and go on foot
up a ſteep hill to the Gallows, where he
was broken with a wheel alive, one bone
after another, beginning at his leggs,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55817:82"/>

            <p>This was the manner of both their
executions, but I ſpeak of the greateſt
murther particularly, becauſe it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
that all theſe torments never
made him once to change countenance,
or to make any ſign or action of grief, to
call to God for mercy, or to intreat the
people to pray for him, but as if he had
been a ſenſleſs ſtock or ſtone, he did
moſt ſcornfully, and as it were in diſdain
abide it; whilſt the other Villain did cry,
rore, and make lamentation, calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God often. The difference was not
much in their lives, and manner of their
deaths, but the odds may be great in
their dying.</p>

haulter-maſter are many, as he hath the
emptying of all the Vaults or draughts
in the City, which no doubt he gains
ſome favour by. Beſides all Oxen,
Kine, Horſes, Dogs, or any ſuch beaſts,
if they dye themſelves, or if they be
not like to live, the hang man muſt
knock them on the head, and have
their skins; and whatſoever Inhabitant

accounted as a Villain without Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
So that with hangings, headings,
breakings, pardoning, and killing of
Dogs, flaying of Beaſts, emptying of
Vaults, and ſuch privy Commodities,
his whole Revenue ſometimes amounts
to four or five hundred pounds a year.
And he is held in that regard and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that any man will converſe and
drink with; nay, ſometimes the Lords
of the Town will feaſt with him, and it
is accounted no impeachment to their

               <p>A Poor Carpenter dwelling in the
Town, who having ſtoln a Gooſe,
and plucking it within his doors, a little
Girl (his Daughter-in-law) went out of
his houſe, and left the door open, by
which means, the owner of the Gooſe
paſſing by, eſpyed the wretched thief
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55817:84"/>
very diligently picking what he before
had been ſtealing, to whom the owner
ſaid, Neighbour, I now perceive which
way my Geeſe uſe to go, but I will
have you in Queſtion for them, and ſo
away he went; the Caitiff being thus
reproved, grew deſperate, and his Child
coming into his houſe, ye young whore,
quoth he, muſt ye leave my door open
for folks to look in upon me, and with
that word he took a hatchet, and with a
curſed ſtroak, he clove the Childs head,
for the which murther he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and judged to be broken alive upon
the wheel. Upon the day of Execution,
about the hour of 12 at Noon, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Town in great multitudes
flocked to the place of Execution, which
is half a mile Engliſh without the Gates,
the Priſoner came on foot with a Divine
with him, all the way exhorting him to
repentance; and becauſe death ſhould
not terrifie him, they had given him
many Rowſes, and Carowſes of Wine
and Beer; for it is a cuſtom there to make
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:55817:85"/>
ſuch poor wretches drunk, whereby they
be made ſenſleſs, either of Gods mercy,
or their own miſery, but being pray'd for
by others, they themſelves may die re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely,
or (to be feared) deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>But the Priſoner being come to the
place of death, he was by the Officers
delivered to the hang-man, who entring
his ſtrangling fortification with two
grand hang-men more, and their men, to
aſſiſt their <hi>Hamburghian</hi> brother in this
great and weighty work; the Priſoner
mounted on a mount of Earth, built
high on purpoſe that the people about
may ſee the execution a quarter of a
mile round about, four of the hang-mens
men takes each of them a ſmall
halter, and by the hands and the feet
they hold the priſoner extended all
abroad lying on his back, then the
Arch-hang-man, or the great Maſter
of this mighty buſineſs, took up a wheel
much about the bigneſs of one of the
fore, wheels of a Coach, and firſt having
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55817:85"/>
put off his Doublet, his Hat, and being
in his ſhirt, as if he meant to play at
Tennis, he took the wheel, and ſet it on
the edge, and turn'd it with one hand
like a Top or Whirly-gig; then he
took it by the Spoaks, and lifting it up,
with a mighty ſtroke, he beat one of the
poor wretches legs in pieces (the bones
I mean) at which he rored grievouſly,
then after a little pauſe he breaks the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
leg in the ſame manner, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
breaks his arms, and then he
ſtroke four or five main blows on his
breaſt, and burſt all his bulk and cheſt
in ſhivers; laſtly, he ſmote his neck, and
miſſing, burſt his chin and Jaws to mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocks,
then he took the broken man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
Corps, and ſpread it on the wheel,
and then fixed the poſt into the Earth
ſome ſix foot deep, being in height a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the ground ſome ten or twelve

               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:55817:86"/>
This was the terrible manner of the
horrid Execution; and at this place are
twenty poſts with thoſe wheels or pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of wheels, with heads of men nailed
on the top of the poſts; with a great
ſpike driven through the skull. The

faſhion is, that the priſoner
kneels down, and being blinded with a

               <p>THey have ſtrange torments and
varieties of deaths, according to
the various nature of the offences that
are committed; as for example, he
that counterfeits any Princes Coin, and
is proved a Coiner, his judgment is to
be boiled to death in Oil; not thrown
into the Veſſel all at once, but with a
pulley or a rope, to be hanged under the
Arm-pits, and let down into the Oil by
degrees; firſt the feet, and next the
legs, and ſo to boil his fleſh from the
bones alive. For thoſe that ſet houſes
on fire wilfully, they are ſmoaked to
death; as firſt there is a pile or poſt fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55817:87"/>
in the ground, and within an Engliſh
Ell of it is a piece of Wood nailed croſs,
whereupon the offender is made faſt ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
then over the top of the poſt is
whelmed a great tub or dry fat, which
doth cover or over-whelm the priſoner
as low as the middle. Then underneath
the executioner hath wet ſtraw, hay,
ſtubble, or ſuch kind of ſtuffe, which is
fired, but by reaſon it is wet and dank,
it doth not burn, but ſmother and
ſmoak, which ſmoak aſcends up into the
Tub, where the priſoners head is, and
not being able to ſpeak, he will heave up
and down with his belly, and people
may perceive him in theſe torments to
live three or four hours.</p>
               <p>Adultery there if it be proved, is
puniſhed with death, as the loſs of the
parties heads, if they be both marryed,
or if not both, yet the marryed party
muſt die for it, and the other muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
ſome eaſier puniſhment, either by
the purſe or carkaſſe, which in the end
proves little better then half a hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:55817:87"/>
One thing more: In <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
thoſe that are not hanged for
theft, are chained two or three toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and they muſt in that ſort ſix or
ſeven years draw a dung-cart, &amp; cleanſe
the ſtreets of the Town, and every one
of thoſe thieves for as many years as he
is condemned to that ſlavery, ſo many
bells he hath hanged at an Iron above
one of his ſhoulders, and every year a
bell is taken off, till all are gone, and then
he is a free-man again, ſome of the
thieves had ſeven bells, ſome five, ſome
ſix, ſome one, but ſuch a noiſe they
make, as if all the Devils in hell were
dancing the Morrice.</p>

               <head>A Pretty Story.</head>
               <p>THe Hangmans place being void,
there were two of the bloud (for
it is to be noted that the ſucceſſion of
the office doth lineally deſcend from
the Father to the Son, or to the next
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55817:88"/>
of the bloud) which were at ſtrife for
the poſſeſſion of this high indignity.
Now it happened that two men were to
be beheaded at the ſame Town, and at
the ſame time, and (to avoid ſuit in
Law for this great Prerogative) it was
concluded by the Arbitrators, that
each of theſe new hangmen ſhould exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
one of the priſoners, and he that
with greateſt cunning and ſlight could
take the head from the body, ſhould
have the place; to this they all agreed,
and the priſoners were brought forth,
where one of the executioners did bind
a Red ſilk thred double about his priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
neck, the threds being diſtant one
from another but the breadth of one
thred, and he promiſed to cut off the
head with a backward blow with a
ſword, between the threds. The other
called his priſoner aſide, and told him
that if he would be ruled by him, he
ſhould have his life ſaved, and beſides
(quoth he) I ſhall be ſure to have the
office. The priſoner was glad of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55817:88"/>
motion, and ſaid he would do any thing
upon theſe conditions, then ſaid the
hang-man, when thou art on thy
knees, and haſt ſaid thy prayers, and that
I do lift up my Axe (for I will uſe an
Axe) to ſtrike thee, I will cry <hi>Hem,</hi> at
which word do thou riſe and run away
(thou knoweſt none will ſtay thee if
thou canſt once eſcape after thou art de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
into my cuſtody; it is the faſhion
of our Country) and let me alone to
ſhift to anſwer the matter. This being
ſaid or whiſpered, the heads-man with
the ſword did cut off the priſoners head
juſt between the threds as he had ſaid,
which made all the people wonder at
the ſteddineſs of his hand, and moſt of
them judged that he was the man that
was and would be fitteſt to make a mad
hang-man of.</p>
               <p>But as one tale is good till another
be told, and as there be three degrees
of good, better and beſt, ſo this laſt
hang-man did much exceed and eclipſe
the others cunning; For his priſoner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55817:89"/>
on his knees, and he lifting up his
Axe to give the fatal blow, <hi>Hem</hi> (ſaid
he according to promiſe) whereupon
the fellow aroſe and ran away, but when
he had run ſome ſeven or eight paces,
the hang-man threw the Axe after him,
and ſtruck his head ſmoothly from his
ſhoulders: Now for all this, who ſhall
have the place is unknown, for they are
yet in Law for it, and I doubt not but
before the matter is ended, that the
Lawyers will make them exerciſe their
own Trade upon themſelves to end the

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55817:94"/>
murdered carkaſſes, the Temple with
unhallowed hands defiled; there was no
reſpect to any, to Man, Woman, or
Child.</p>
            <p>Thus this three headed multitude,
or helliſh crew did waſte themſelves,
till indeed they did at length ſubdue
themſelves: but you muſt note they
were not altogether neglective, ſome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy
they had upon their enemy, and
whilſt they were making their ſtrength
more ſure within, the <hi>Romans</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
with their dreadful Batteries,
made not only the City to tremble,
but the Walls to break, at which the
factious wiſely bethought themſelves,
and aſſembled themſelves together
with all their powers; and, as a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derment
it was united together like
good friends: And then like ſwoln Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
bounded in with Banks, they ſally
forth and fight their enemies, like as the
ambitious torrent breaks his bounds, and
over-runs whole Lordſhips; ſo did
theſe <hi>Jews</hi> out-dare and challenge any
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55817:94"/>
that would withſtand the fury of their
inſulting pride, whereupon they out of
the City came, and entred the <hi>Romans</hi>
Army like a flood, and in their deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
madneſs, all was overwhelmed that
durſt withſtand them; the Walls then
could not be aſſaulted, the enemies
fearful Engines was then by them ſet on
fire, and bravely fighting they bravely
made their enemies to retire!</p>
            <p>The Battel done, back go theſe hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braind
men, and divide again, and each
becomes the others foe, and then pell
mell they go to it, and begin to diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and bring all things to confuſion;
with fire their Corn and Victuals they
conſumed, all their proviſion in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſpoiled and waſted, which if well
kept, might have laſted them many
years; upon which the Famine, like a
Tyrant, roams and rages, and makes
all, both Old and Young, Rich and
Poor to ſtarve and dye with fleſhleſs A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:55817:95"/>
This was a Plague of Plagues, a Woe
of Woes, death on every ſide did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe
them; this being their condition,
they knew not what to do, to ſally forth
they durſt not, for then their lives they
were ſure to loſe, to ſtay within for
want of food they ſtarved, out they
could not go, for the Gates were ſhut
and ſtrongly warded, their throats were
cut if any ſtaid within; ſo that if they
ſtay or go, or go or ſtay, every way De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
they are ſure to meet with.</p>
            <p>But of all torments, hunger is the
worſt, for that will burſt through the
ſtony Walls; therefore theſe people
having been with War, Woe, and want
on every ſide beſet, do now begin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
and ſtrive how they might get to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> for there was their hopes, that
in their ſwords they ſhould find more
mercy, then their ſtill dying famiſht
ſtate afforded them: And indeed when
man is oppreſt, then is wit moſt ſharpeſt,
and then wiſdom amongſt evils, chuſeth
the leaſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:55817:95"/>
Now they knowing <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> for a
noble Prince, and one that did not glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in their Woe, they thought it beſt
to try his clemency, and not with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and famine to die, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing
of all hopes, reſolved with
Ropes to ſlide down the Walls, which
a number of them did, and fled to <hi>Titus,</hi>
who bemoaned the ſadneſs of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and relieved and took them to
his grace and favour. Thus when
all hopes failed, they were by their foes
preſerved, to the number of at leaſt
40000.</p>
            <p>The City Souldiers ſearched every
houſe where they thought any Victuals
were conveyed, and if they found
any, the owners were moſt certainly bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
for concealing it; but if they ſaw a
man look plump and fat, his throat they
would ſurely cut, for they thought
him too much pampered, and too full
fed; they would therefore ſtrike him
dead to ſave meat and drink. The
Richeſt and Nobleſt that was born both
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55817:96"/>
of Men and Women, gave all they had
for one poor ſtrike of Corn, and hid
themſelves and it under the ground in
ſome cloſe Vault, and there they would
eat it under the ground unground; if
any could get fleſh, they would eat it
raw: Thus the weaker were over-awed,
and kept under by the ſtronger.</p>
            <p>No reſpect of perſons where hunger
came; natural affection was then baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
then the Husband did his own Wife
reject, the Wife ſhe ſnatches the meat
from her Husband, all pity from the
Mother was exiled, ſhe from the Child
tears and takes the Victuals, the Child
plays the thief with the Parents, and
ſteals the food, though with grief the
Parents pine away.</p>
            <p>There was neither Free-man, nor
Bond-man, Fathers nor Mothers, Wives,
Husbands, Maſters, Servants, Brothers,
Siſters, be it propinquity or ſtrong affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
no Law, or reaſon, or rule could
bear ſway; and indeed obeyſance muſt
be given where ſtrength commands; the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55817:96"/>
pining Servant will not know his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
the Son will not ſhew his duty to
his Father, the Commons regardleſs to
the Magiſtrate, each for one, and but
for one he cared; diſordered, like the
cart before the horſe, force cauſed all
reſpect to yield.</p>
            <p>Theſe Miſcreants with vigilancy did
watch where a door was locked or latch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that they could ſpy, for there they
ſuppoſed the people were at meat, and
in their out-rage the doors they would
beat open, where entring if they found
them feeding, they would tear it in
haſte out of their throats, half eaten
and half uneaten; theſe wretches would
conſtrain the people to caſt it up again,
they hauld them about the houſe by the
ears, to force them to bring out their
Victuals, which they ſuppoſed they had;
ſome by the Thumbs they hanged up,
and ſome by the Toes, ſome had many
blows, others were pricked with Bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,
ſadly were they tormented to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
their meat when they had none to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55817:97"/>
conceal; and in truth all was fiſh that
came into their net, and all was food
that could be got by fraud or force.</p>
            <p>Graſs, Hay, Barks, Leaves of trees,
Cats and Dogs, Frogs, Worms, Rats,
Mice, Snails, Flies and Maggots, all
ſtinking and contagious roots, the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Coaches, Boots and Shoes,
and the dung of Fowls and Beaſts, were
Feaſts for theſe poor miſerable ſtarved
wretches; things loathſome to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in time of plenty, is now dainties
among theſe ſtarved diſtreſſed <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Famine run beyond all natures
bounds, (as before I have hinted) and
confounded all Motherly-affection, no
compaſſion was there had to bloud or
birth: It forced a woman to kill her on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Son, ſhe ript and diſ-joynted him, and
diſ-joynted him limb from limb, ſhe
dreſt, ſhe roaſted, ſhe broiled and boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, ſhe eat him, ſhe interr'd him in
her womb; his life by nature proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from her, and ſhe her ſelf moſt unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
did feed upon him, he was her
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55817:97"/>
fleſh, her bloud, her bones, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe eating him her ſelf, her ſelf
made food: No woe can equal her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
no grief can match her ſad cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
the Souldiers they ſmelt the
meat, upon which they ſtraitly aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
which when they ſaw, they trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and with ſtaring hairs, and ghaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
looks were thereat ſo affrighted and
amazed, that thereupon they preſently
left the houſe: This horrid action did
more with them, then any force of man
could ever do, for this ſad ſight over
came them.</p>
            <p>Oh then thou that doſt live like a
fatted Brawn, and cramſt thy guts as
long as thou canſt; thou that doſt eat
and drink away thy time, accounting it
no crime for gluttony to be thy God,
thou that muſt have fowl of all ſorts,
and haſt the bowels of the Ocean ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſatisfie thy appetite, and haſt thy
dainties from all parts and places, near
and remote, and all to ſatisfie thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
throat, whoſe pamper'd paunch
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55817:98"/>
never leaves to feed and quaff. Think
on <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> perhaps it will move
thee in the midſt of thy Diet and rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
courſes, to a more temperate and
ſober demeanor.</p>
            <p>And you brave Dames, adorned
with Jems and Jewels, that muſt have
Grewels and Caudles, Conſerves and
Marchpanes, &amp; that too in ſundry ſhapes
made, as Caſtles, Towers, Horſes, Apes,
and Bears; think on <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the
midſt of all your glory, and then you
will be more ſorrowful and leſs dainty;
poor <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had once Beauty,
Strength, Riches, ſpacious Buildings,
Authority and honour, yet theſe avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them nothing, wrong trode down
right, and Juſtice was quite forgotten,
which was their chiefeſt, their greateſt,
their only earthly good.</p>
            <p>But now one little piece of bread
they reckoned more upon, then ever
before they did of bags of Gold. Scraps,
parings, and fragments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which your
full ſed Corps did uſually fling away,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55817:98"/>
with them had been a ranſom for a
King, the loathſome garbage which our
dogs refuſe, had been amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi>
a diſh of ſtate.</p>
            <p>Whilſt within Famine plaid the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
the <hi>Romans</hi> Army ſtrived to win
the Walls, their Pioners, and all their
Engines were at work to batter and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
the Wall: Now note, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
had three ſtrong ſtone Walls, and long
it was ere the <hi>Romans</hi> could get one, but
the dearth ſo ſpread, and death of the
ſword, as that in the ſtreets the living
trod upon the dead, the Carkaſſes which
the Seditious kill'd, fill'd many great
houſes, ſo that with the ſtinck of bodies
putrefied there dyed a number number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
of people, for burial they afforded
none, but where they fell they let them
lye ſtink and rot, yet very unſenſible
were they of the ſad condition of each
other, by hundreds and thouſands: then
did the ſouldiers throw their liveleſs
Corpſes over the Walls, upon this and
their diſ-uniting, the <hi>Romans</hi> had high
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55817:99"/>
advantages, and could with more ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
batter and ſcale the Walls.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Romans</hi> ſaw their diſmal
fall from the Walls, they told it to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
which when he perceived he wept,
and lifted up his hands to Heaven and
called on God to witneſs with him this.</p>
            <p>Theſe flanghters ſaith he, were no
thoughts of mine, neither was it my
fault. Indeed thoſe wretches that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped
from out of the City, and came
amongſt their foes in my Army, found
both relief and pity, if any of thoſe that
fled to my Army had by the Seditious
been caught, they had without remorſe
ſtrook them dead.</p>
            <p>But another miſery I muſt unfold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, many <hi>Jews</hi> had ſwallowed ſtore
of Gold, which they ſuppoſed in their
need ſhould help them, but from
this treaſure did their bane proceed, the
Gold was the cauſe that many of them
periſht, amongſt them all, one unhappy
poor creature went privately to do the
needs of Nature, and in his dung he
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55817:99"/>
looked for his Gold, where being by the
ſtraggling ſouldiers took, they ript him
up and ſearched his Maw, to find what
Gold or treaſure there remained: In this
ſort was many a Man and Woman ript
and ſlain for the gain of Gold that the
ſouldiers gaped for. In ſome they
found Gold, in many none, but had they
Gold or not, it was all one with them,
they were unbowelled and ſearched
moſt barbarouſly whither they had any
or no.</p>
            <p>But my ſtory briefly to conclude, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſians</hi>
Souldiers had ſubdued the walls,
&amp; his triumphant banner was diſplayed,
and that in the midſt of the ſtreets, at
which the <hi>Jews</hi> were all diſmayed, and
upon which they deſperately did retire
to the Temple, which with ungodly
hands they ſet on fire; which noble <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
with great care intreated them
they would ſpare: Oh ſave the
houſe (quoth he) and I will ſpare you
for the Temple ſake, quench the fire,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:55817:100"/>
put out the flame! Oh let not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
report that you have burnt the
worlds unmatchable glory! For your
own ſakes, your wives, and your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens,
if from <hi>Veſpaſians</hi> hands you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
grace, if from <hi>Veſpaſians</hi> hands you
expect your lives; oh ſave your Temple,
<hi>Titus</hi> doth command you to ſave the
Temple.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> heard of the mercy they
might have had, but with hearts hard
they refuſed the offer, they refuſed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and themſelves regarded not; but in
their madneſs they burned, conſumed
and confounded to the ground King
<hi>Solomons</hi> great Temple, that Temple
which did coſt thirty Millions, was in a
moment loſt and conſumed. The bleſt
<hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> the holieſt place of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
bleſſed with <hi>Johovahs</hi> ſacred grace,
where as the Text ſaith, were 22000 Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
ſlain, and 12000 ſheep beſides, dyed
at the ſame time for an oblation.
That houſe of God whoſe glorious fame
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55817:100"/>
made all the World to wonder, was
burnt, and ranſackt, and laid level to the
ground, which when it was ſeen by <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſian</hi>
and young <hi>Titus,</hi> they cry'd kill,
kill thoſe wretched <hi>Jews,</hi> ſpare not to
kill, uſe ſpeedy and Marſhal Law; the
<hi>Roman</hi> ſouldiers then fell on and ſpared
none, they ſlew while they were weary
of ſlaying, and had no reſpect to Age or
Sex, the ſtreets were drowned in bloud,
and ſlaughtered-Carkaſes did ſwim in
in bloud, the ableſt men that were ſaved
they carryed away for ſlaves, <hi>John, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
and <hi>Eleazer,</hi> as they deſerved were
brought to violent ends.</p>
            <p>Now from that time that the <hi>Romans</hi> began
their ſiege, until the City was won by Sedition,
by the Sword, Fire, and Famine, were depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of their lives eleven hundred thouſand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
one hundred thouſand were taken as
beaſts and ſold for ſlaves, and from the time it
was firſt erected, till the <hi>Romans</hi> had take<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it,
it ſtood as appears in Hiſtories twenty one
hundred ſeventy and nine years.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:55817:101"/>
But before Gods vengeance was ſhowred
down upon them, what ſtrange prodigious
Wonders did he ſhew, as warnings how they
ſhould avoid their deſtruction, and cauſe them
to repent the wicked evils they had done.</p>
            <p>1. The Firmament ſhewed them a Comet
like a fiery Sword.</p>
            <p>2. Divers nights the Temple and the Altar
were environed with bright burning lights.</p>
            <p>3. In the midſt of the Temple though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a
Cow did bear a Lamb.</p>
            <p>4. No Bolts or Bars could reſtrain the
Temple-gates, but they would fly open of
themſelves.</p>
            <p>5. In the Air aſſembled Armed men and
Chariots, the pondrous Earth quaked, affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and trembled.</p>
            <p>6. To this ſenſe a voice cryed in the Temple,
&amp; the people cry'd oh let us from hence depart!</p>
            <p>Theſe ſupernatural accidents, foretold ſome
fearful Judgment was to come, but toyes they
were accounted to the <hi>Jews,</hi> or ſcar-crow-bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears
to fright children with, and not minding
them, nor no way by them being affrighted,
they did in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſecurely revell, they
thought theſe ſigns were againſt their foes, and
not them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:55817:101"/>
But when war, when death, when ſpoil, when
ruine had ſtorm'd them, appear'd the place ſo
deſolate as none could have known there had
been a City.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Juda,</hi> and thus <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> fell, which
Chriſt did foretell, and was now fulfill'd, that all
their joys they ſhould be bereft off, and that
one ſtone ſhould not be left to ſtand upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
