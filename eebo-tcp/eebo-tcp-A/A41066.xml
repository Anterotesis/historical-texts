         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE MAGISTRATES AND People of ENGLAND vvhere this may come.</head>
            <p>WHat is the matter with the Chriſtians of our Age, and of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, that hath been looked upon to be a Garden and a Nurſery in Chriſtianity and Religion, beyond all other Nations, that have made ſo great profeſſion of God and Chriſt, and of the Scriptures; and are they now turned Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors and Law-makers againſt Chriſtianity, and againſt thoſe that are in the ſame Spirit of God, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Fellowſhip, as they were in that gave forth the Scriptures, which the people of <hi>England</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth: And are thoſe now become the greateſt enemies that <hi>England</hi> hath? and for no other cauſe, but becauſe they worſhip God, and obey Chriſts Command, and abides in his Doctrine, and bears the ſame Teſtimony of Truth, and Reſurrection of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as the Apoſtles did; and all that they do, and act, and ſpeak, and ſuffer for, is according to Scripture, and nothing that they ſuffer for is contrary to the Scriptures. Is thoſe things become a crime in <hi>England?</hi> and is this the greateſt offence that <hi>England</hi> hath taken with the people of God, even becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and obey his Doctrine. Oh take up a Lamentation for <hi>England</hi>? Surely there is ſome heavy, ſad, and grievous Judgment waiting upon it. And is not hardneſs of heart, and a reprobate mind, and a feared Conſcience, one of the greateſt Judgments that can befall a people? and is not this already ſeized upon the Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of <hi>England,</hi> that have hardned their hearts againſt the Lord and his people, as if they had no other enemies but they, who never did them wrong nor hurt, nor never deſired nor intended any hurt againſt them, but hath ever deſired their good, and peace, and welfare, and that they might come to the true knowledge of the Lord, and to the true knowledge of his Truth, as it is in Jeſus, which they clearly manifeſt they are ignorant of, by their making of Lawes againſt thoſe amongſt them that fear God, and worſhip him, and gives Glory to his Name, though they be free-born <hi>Engliſh</hi> men and women, nor have they tranſgreſſed any juſt Law of <hi>England,</hi> until they were forced to make one to make them tranſgreſſors with, though they be of the ſame Religion that they themſelves profeſs; they profeſs Chriſt and the Scriptures in words: but they that come to the works of righteouſneſs, and to believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which is the work of God, ſuch they perſecute and make Lawes againſt.</p>
            <p>So that <hi>England</hi> appears now, as if it would ſhut Chriſtianity out of its Dominion: And what will they bring in and ſet up next, ſeing they baniſh out Chriſt, and his Members, and Servants, and Saints, and ſo makes them Slaves that be free born <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, which have been a bleſſing unto them, and to the Land wherein they lived, and no hurt to them; and if they had given them the liberty of their Conſciences, to have ſerved the Lord God, they might have been partakers of the bleſſings with them: but being that they have turned their hand againſt the Lord, and turned their Swords backwards againſt the righteous, ſurely the Lord will plead for this, and ſurely there will a recompence come, for its hard to ſtrive againſt the Lord, and to touch his anoynted, and to do his Prophets any harm: when they were but few in number, he reproved Kings for their ſakes; and he is the ſame now, he changes not, and his Arm and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is the ſame, and his Righteouſneſs is the ſame, which is to be revealed upon the Head of the wicked. And he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to plead the Cauſe of the Innocent, who hath no Pleader in the earth, and his Eye ſees and beholds all the actions of the children of men, and thoſe that act againſt him and his Servants he takes ſpecial notice of: And he ſaw the afflictions of his people formerly, when they were afflicted in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and heard their cryes, and knew their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And ſurely he is the ſame now as he was then; and as he hath ſaid himſelf, <hi>In as much as you do it unto my little ones you do it unto me</hi>: This he ſaid, when he knew that his next appearance would be in his Saints. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thoſe that perſecuted his Saints, even without a Law, when they had none, and contrary to ſeveral Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> as ſeveral of the Servants of the Lord have ſuffered; hath Chriſts Servants been perſecuted by thoſe that were in power formerly, and they that make new Laws? Certainly if Chriſt and the Apoſtles had been and were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, they would have done the ſame unto them. But all theſe things the Lord hath taken notice of, and they are written down where they cannot be blotted out; and all the righteous blood that hath been ſhed ſince <hi>Abel,</hi> and all the Saints ſufferings in all Ages, the Lord hath taken notice of, and all thoſe Chriſtians that have ſuffered by thoſe that have called themſelves Chriſtians in theſe latter Times, where ſeveral have been impriſoned till death for the Chriſtian Faith. All this the Lord hath in everlaſting remembrance; and when he comes to make inquiſition for the blood of his Saints and Servants, it will be a hard and a ſad day for the Actors and Fighters againſt God.</p>
            <p>So all you who are called Chriſtian Magiſtrates, beware what ye do and keep your hands out of the blood &amp; perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the innocent, and let that which is paſt ſuffice, for ye will find it heavy enoug<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and for the time to come dread and fear the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, that hath all your life and breath in his hand to give and take away at his pleaſure, and do not that which may incur the Lords diſpleaſure againſt you, by making Children fatherleſs, and Wives Widows, as there are already ſeveral in <hi>England</hi> at this day; it is better for you to offend men than God, and ſo endanger your immortal ſouls. So mind that which concerns your Eternal Peace, and the Eternal welfare of your Souls. And this I am moved of the Lord to forewarn you of, leaſt you bring woe and miſery upon your Souls, and a general Judgment on the whole Land; and this is true Love unto you, and the deſire of your general peace and good, and remember that you were warned from a Priſoner of the Lord in <hi>Lancaſter</hi> Caſtle.</p>
