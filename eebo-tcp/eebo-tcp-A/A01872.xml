         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

seduction of Elizabeth Barnes,
late of Battersey in the County of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey

Barnes her owne naturall Child.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Whole moneth, as shee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
in the publike hearing of
divers persons of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
this Savage continued
with this hellish fire kindled
in her breast, violently at the last breaking
forth into the unnaturall deprivation of the
life of the fruit of her owne wombe. The
subtill serpent Satan, that thus long time
had possessed her, putteth into her minde
the manner how to put in execution her dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall
execrable intention on the innocent
childe, without its least suspition, as you
may perceive by the sequele of the History.
To intice the childe unto its slaughter, and
to goe abroad with her, she provided the 24
day of <hi>March</hi> last 1637. very early in the
morning, an Apple Pye, a Herring Pye, Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19242:3"/>
of the Sun, and other fruits which shee
carried with her; accustomed baits, used by
loving Parents, to quiet and still their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in their unquietnesse, but this creature
otherwise, to destroy her childe by that
meanes. These things being thus prepared
before-hand, and the child beholding them,
did set an edge on its affections, willingly to
accompany her cruell mother, in her travell
towards her long home.</p>
            <p>The innocent Lambe and ravenous Wolfe
both spend out the day together; with joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
expectation, the one willingly endureth
the travell and heat of the day, to goe to be
placed with a kinswoman of hers, as was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
but alas this was but flattery to shed
innocent blood. Towards the evening of the
same day, these her alluring kind of deadly
junkets, she brings with her childe, into a
Wood called <hi>Wormewall Wood,</hi> being in the
Parish of <hi>Fulham</hi> in the County of <hi>Middle-sex,</hi>
some 4. miles distance from the place
where she dwelt; being there in secret, and
covered with darknesse, she faineth unto the
child this excuse, saying, that she was very
weary, and was not able to goe any further,
but must upon necessity stay a while, there
to rest and ease her self, the which the poore
childe, as shee said, most lovingly intreated
her to doe, being also glad of such repose.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19242:3"/>
Being set downe together, she taketh out of
her basket, the Pyes, and fruit, and sets them
before the childe, for to eate of them, which
did so.</p>
            <p>Thus having eaten of such things former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
provided for it, being tyred with going
so farre a journey, it being but of the age of
eight yeeres, afterwards sweetly falleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a fast sleep, which was very oportune for
her mothers accursed designe, for that same
night about the houres of xj. and xij. shee
drew out of her sheath a knife, and with that
knife barbarously did cut the throat of the
child. Soone after this bloody fact, being
done by her, her eyes were opened, that she
beheld her miserable condition, and that,
that by her bloody hands had beene done,
that could no way be again undone. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
before hand, how to dispose of her
selfe after the fact committed. For she car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with her the instrument of her owne
death, as she did the childs; for it a knife,
so a halter, wherewith to end her owne life,
and attempted it, but had not power to lay
violent hands on her selfe, being mercifully
thereof prevented by the all-powerfull hand
of heaven: after this first attempt, as she said,
she was strongly set on againe by the Devill
to drowne her selfe, but that prevailed not
against her, but forthwith brake out then
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19242:4"/>
into a great passion, as it were a fountaine of
teares, humbly and heartily imploring Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
mercy and forgivenesse for her bloody
crying-fact.</p>
            <p>Her guilty conscience, will no way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
her to rest, of shew her any place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
for safety; but according unto that
saying of the Psalmist, it falleth upon her.
<hi>Evill shall hunt the wicked person to overthrow
them,</hi> and so it did, to the full satisfaction of
all the beholders. For whither doth this
affrighted Creature, run or flee suppose yee,
but even unto the gates of Justice, crying, as
it were there, for Justice to be rendred accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to her demerit? From the wood she
flees into <hi>Kensington,</hi> and there hides her selfe
all in straw, in the Barne of one <hi>Disney:</hi> and
being there found, suspition of this murther
was laid unto her charge, which she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
to his wife and servant, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
shee was carryed unto Master Pen a
Justice in that Towne, unto whom she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
the same fact.</p>
            <p>This fact being rumored abroad, I went
unto New-gate to visit this miserable delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
who at my first view of her matron
like aspect, induced me to enter into present
discourse with her, to prevaile if I could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly,
to finde out the cause that moved her
unto such unheard of cruelty: shee answered
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19242:4"/>
me againe, none but the Devill alone temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her thereunto, and with teares fast trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
downe her cheekes, desired my selfe,
with the rest that stood by, to pray unto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, to take mercy on her poore
sinfull soule, to save that from hell.</p>
            <p>A second time I urged her, to discover the
cause of that fact, and disburden her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and somwhat then fell from her, thus
saying, that she had spent all the estate shee
had upon one that pretended love unto her,
and being by that meanes become poore and
indebted, knew not what would become of
her, but instantly resolved on this desperate
course, leaving such deep impression in her
mind, with the continuance of time in not
disclosing of it, that the temptation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
waxed daily stronger, and powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wrought on her. Being demanded what
she thought should become of her after the
fact done, thus replyed, that she attempted
to hang her selfe, but had not power, nor
doubtlesse could not have such a hard heart,
to kill the child, had it been but awake, as it
was a sleep. For that time I departed from
her, and freshly the third time indeavoured
to discover more but could not, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
she adhered to her former confession,
no whit varying.</p>

            <head>The last Caution is the neglect of Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
in not repairing unto him.</head>
            <p>SInne is like a spot in a garment, at the
first it may be easily expunged, but by
continuance, it gathereth more and more
soile unto it, making it so difficult that it
freteth the garment into peeces, before it can
be cleane. Ignorant people behold their sins,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19242:8"/>
through the spectactles of their owne
fantasies, they extend or extenuate their
sinnes as they please, thereby deceiving
themselves, some make sinnes lesser, and
and others greater than they are, and it
cannot otherwise possible be; because,
they are not able to judge of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
being ignorant and unlettered,
than a blinde man can distinguish co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
            <p>A stumbling blocke into this womens
way the Divell casts, not to goe unto
her Minister unto whom the Almighty
GOD had given the pastorall Cure
of her soule, to reveale her minde
unto him, for feare of revealing it
againe, what doth GOD intrust
us with your deare soules? and will not
you trust us with your filthy sinnes? to
discover them, to disburden your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
laded consciences, will you not
make nice to shew a noysome foule
ulcerated body, and shew the place
where it paineth you most to the chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion,
to have thereby ease, and bee
too too curious in the matters of your
soule; your abominable sinnes let them
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19242:8"/>
alone untouched, or not confessed at
all, which by confession may bee les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened,
and people made wary to walke
more circumspectly, and the hainous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of sinne being set before mens
eyes, may deterre them from commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of them againe. Beloved, a weake
slight and subtilty in the Devill, that
with-holds the poore pensive sinner,
from his ghostly comforter (Confession)
what then? oh no, by no menaes, I will
not doe it, hee will reveile mee, will
you not blush for shame, nor hold it
no blemish, to harbour wicked thoughts
in your hearts, which GOD knoweth,
and seeth, and in the open day of the
world exorbitantly commit them, and is
this a greater offence to confesse them,
and to turne from them, judge yee? Our
ayme of the Church of England is not
such, as that of Rome, to creepe into
mens secrets hearts, to hold them in awe,
but discover their sinnes, to save that
way their soules, and as for disclosing
of such kinde of persons, let mee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
them, not in the least manner to
doubt our secrecy, we have learned bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19242:9"/>
and desire our Auditors to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
perswaded of us. Whether is God
or men wiser? the holy Spirit adviseth
unto this duty of Confession, by that
meanes yee lessen sinne in you, and cast
out the Devill. Christ cured none but those
that shewed their disease, and beleeved
his power, by confession of sinne the way
for the Lord Iesus is prepared, and by the
prayer of the faithfull Minister unto God
for the poore penitent sinner, his sinnes
are forgiven him, Satan cast out, and his
soule better armed against his future
strong temptations. King <hi>Dauid</hi> resolved
saying: Palme 38. verse 18. <hi>I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse

thee, and mine unrighteousnesse have I not hid.
I said, I will confesse my sinnes unto the Lord, and so
thou forgavest the wickednesse of my sinne.</hi> These
were the ensuing comforts and favours of God to
the sinner; remission of sins for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessing of them.
Read the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chap. of <hi>Iames, ver. 6. Acknowledge
your faults one to another, and pray one for another,
that ye may be healed.</hi> Our blessed Saviour, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he
sent his Disciples into the world, as he gave them
a Commission for to preach, so likewise power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
uncleane spirits, to cast them out. In a word,
he gave them power of sinnes in the totall lumpe:
<hi>Whosoevers sinnes ye retaine</hi> (saith he) <hi>they are retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and whosoevers sins ye remit, they are remitted.</hi>
What greater comfort could Christ pronounce
then say, <hi>Son, thy sinnes be forgiven?</hi> and how did
the Iewes disdaine at those words, saying, <hi>Who can
forgive sins, but God only?</hi> Christ readily replieth,
and giveth-them a token of the truth thereof, by
the peraliptick man to rise up and walke before
them, <hi>That ye may know the Son of man hath power
to forgive sins here on earth, I say unto thee, Arise,
take up thy bed, and walk. Primus ad indulgentiam
gradus est agnoscere delictum.</hi> The chiefest way
to obtaine mercy at Gods hands for sinns past, is
to acknowledge the offences done. <hi>Dum agnoscit
reus, ignoscit Deus.</hi> and the sinner is not readier
to confesse his wickednesse, but God is as ready
againe for to forgive them. <hi>Novit Deus omnia,
vocem tamen tuam expectet, si taces Secretarius es
Diaboli,</hi> saith S. <hi>Ambr.</hi> God knoweth all things,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19242:10"/>
yet the voyce, and confession of penitent sinners,
he regardeth, and expecteth; If a sinner be at any
