            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO
THE KINGS MOST SACRED
MAIESTY.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT was one day, as I was Walking
in Your MAJESTIES Palace
at <hi>WHITE-HALL</hi> (where
I have sometimes the honour to refresh
my self with the Sight of Your Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Presence, which is the Joy of
Your Peoples hearts) that a presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Smoake issuing from one or two
Tunnels neer <hi>Northumberland-House,</hi>
and not far from <hi>Scotland-yard,</hi> did so
invade the Court; that all the Rooms,
Galleries, and Places about it were
fill'd and infested with it; and that to
such a degree, as Men could hardly
discern one another for the Clowd,
and none could support, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
Inconveniency. It was not this
<pb facs="tcp:51974:3"/>
which did first suggest to me what I
had long since conceived against this
pernicious Accident, upon frequent
observation; But it was this alone,
and the trouble that it must needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
to Your Sacred Majesty, as well
as hazzard to Your Health, which
kindled this Indignation of mine, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, and was the occasion of what
it has produc'd in these Papers.</p>
            <p>Your Majesty who is a Lover of
noble Buildings, Gardens, Pictures,
and all Royal Magnificences, must
needs desire to be freed from this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
annoyance; and, which is so
great an Enemy to their Lustre and
Beauty, that where it once enters
there can nothing remain long in its
native Splendor and Perfection: Nor
must I here forget that Illustrious and
divine Princesse, Your Majesties only
Sister, the now <hi>Dutchesse</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi>
who at her <hi>Highnesse</hi> late being in this
<pb facs="tcp:51974:3"/>
City, did in my hearing, complain of
the Effects of this Smoake both in her
Breast and Lungs, whilst She was in
Your Majesties Palace. I cannot but
greatly apprehend, that Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
(who has been so long accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m'd
to the excellent <hi>Aer</hi> of other
Countries) may be as much offended
at it, in that regard also; especially
since the Evil is so <hi>Epidemicall;</hi> indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
as well the Health of Your
Subjects, as it sullies the Glory of this
Your Imperial Seat.</p>
            <p>Sir, I prepare in this short Discourse,
an expedient how this pernicious <hi>Nui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance</hi>
may be reformed; and offer at
another also, by which the <hi>Aer</hi> may
not only be freed from the present In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency;
but (that remov'd) to
render not only Your Majesties Palace,
but the whole City likewise, one of
the sweetest, and most delicious Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations
in the World; and this, with
<pb facs="tcp:51974:4"/>
little or no expence; but by improving
those Plantations which Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
so laudably affects, in the moyst,
depressed and Marshy Grounds about
the Town, to the Culture and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of such things, as upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
gentle emission through the <hi>Aer,</hi>
should so perfume the adjacent places
with their breath; as if, by a certain
charm, or innocent <hi>Magick,</hi> they
were transferred to that part of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi>
which is therefore styl'd the <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,</hi>
because it is amongst the Gums
and precious spices. Those who take
notice of the Sent of the <hi>Orange</hi>-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
from the Rivage of <hi>Genöa,</hi> and
St. <hi>Pietro dell' Arena;</hi> the Blossomes of
the <hi>Rosemary</hi> from the Coasts of <hi>Spain</hi>
many Leagues off at Sea; or the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
and odoriferous wafts which
flow from <hi>Fontenay</hi> and <hi>Vaugirard,</hi>
even to <hi>Paris</hi> in the season of <hi>Roses,</hi>
with the contrary Effects of those less
<pb facs="tcp:51974:4"/>
pleasing smells from other accidents,
will easily consent to what I suggest:
And, I am able to enumerate a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of native <hi>Plants,</hi> and such as
are familiar to our Country and <hi>Clime,</hi>
whose redolent, and agreeable Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
would even ravish our senses, as
well as perfectly improve and melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the <hi>Aer</hi> about <hi>London;</hi> and that,
without the least prejudice to the Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and Proprietors of the Land to
be employ'd about it. But because I
have treated of this more at large in
another curious and noble subject,
which I am preparing to present to
Your Majesty, as God shall afford
me Leasure to finish it, and that I
give a Touch of it in this Discourse,
I will enlarge my Addresses no farther,
then to beg pardon for this Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have little here to add<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to implore thy good
opinion and approbation, after I have submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this Essay to his Sacred Majesty: But as it is
of universal benefit that I propound it; so I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a civil entertainment and reception. I have,
I confesse, been frequently displeased at the small
advance and improvement of <hi>Publick Works</hi>
in this Nation, wherein it seems to be much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to the Countries and Kingdomes which are
round about it; especially, during these late
years of our sad Confusions: But now that God
has miraculously restor'd to us our Prince, a Prince
of so magnanimous and Publick a Spirit, we may
promise our selves not only a recovery of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Splendor; but also whatever any of our
Neighbours enjoy of more universal benefit, for
Health or Ornament: In summe, whatever may
do honour to a Nation so perfectly capable of all
advantages.</p>
            <p>It is in order to this, that I have presumed to
offer these few Proposals for the Meliorating and
refining the <hi>Aer</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> being extremely
amaz'd, that where there is so great an affluence
of all things which may render the People of this
vast City, the most happy upon Earth; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did,
<pb facs="tcp:51974:6"/>
and accursed Avarice of some few Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Persons, should be suffered to prejudice the
health and felicity of so many: That any Profit
(besides what is of absolute necessity) should render
men regardlesse of what chiefly imports them, when
it may be purchased upon so easie conditions, and
with so great advantages: For it is not happiness
to possesse Gold, but to enjoy the Effects of it,
and to know how to live cheerfully and in health,
<hi>Non est vivere, sed valere vita.</hi> That men
whose very Being is <hi>Aer,</hi> should not breath it
freely when they may; but (as that <hi>Tyrant</hi> us'd
his Vassals) condemn themselves to this misery
&amp; <hi>Fumo praefocari,</hi> is strange stupidity: yet
thus we see them walk and converse in <hi>London,</hi>
pursu'd and haunted by that infernal Smoake, and
the funest accidents which accompany it whereso:
ever they retire.</p>
            <p>That this Glorious and Antient City, which
from Wood might be rendred Brick, and (like
another <hi>Rome</hi>) from Brick made Stone and
Marble; which commands the Proud Ocean to
the <hi>Indies,</hi> and reaches to the farthest <hi>Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
should wrap her stately head in Clowds of
Smoake and Sulphur, so full of Stink and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
I deplore with just Indignation. That the
<hi>Buildings</hi> should be compos'd of such a Congestion
of mishapen and extravagant Houses; That the
<pb facs="tcp:51974:6"/>
               <hi>Streets</hi> should be so narrow and incommodious in
the very Center, and busiest places of Intercourse:
That there should be so ill and uneasie a form of
<hi>Paving</hi> under foot, so troublesome and malicious
a disposure of the <hi>Spouts</hi> and <hi>Gutters</hi> overhead,
are particulars worthy of Reproof and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
because it is hereby rendred a <hi>Labyrinth</hi> in
its principal passages, and a continual Wet-day
after the Storm is over. Add to this the Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of so frequent <hi>Wharfes</hi> and Magazines of
<hi>Wood, Coale, Boards,</hi> and other course Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials,
most of them imploying the Places of the
Noblest aspect for the situation of Palaces towards
the goodly River, when they might with far lesse
Disgrace, be removed to the <hi>Bank-side,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
disposed with as much facility where
the Consumption of these Commodities lyes; a
<hi>Key</hi> in the mean time so contrived on <hi>London</hi>-side,
as might render it lesse sensible of the <hi>Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procation</hi>
of the Waters, for Vse and Health
infinitely superiour to what it now enjoys. These
are the <hi>Desiderata</hi> which this great City labours
under, and which we so much deplore. But I
see the Dawning of a brighter day approach; We
have a Prince who is Resolv'd to be a <hi>Father to
his Country;</hi> and a <hi>Parliament</hi> whose Decrees
and Resentiments take their Impression from his
Majesties great <hi>Genius,</hi> which studies only the
<pb facs="tcp:51974:7"/>
Publick Good. It is from them therefore, that
we Augure our future happinesse; since there is
nothing which will so much perpetuate their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories,
or more justly merit it. <hi>Medails</hi> and
<hi>Inscriptions</hi> have heretofore preserv'd the Fame
of lesse Publick Benefits; and for the Repairing
of a Dilapidated Bridge, a decaid <hi>Aquaeduct,</hi>
the Paving of a Way, or draining a foggy Marsh,
their <hi>Elogies</hi> and <hi>Reverses</hi> have out-lasted the
Marbles, and been transmitted to future Ages,
after so many thousand and Revolutions: But this is
the least of that which we Decree to our <hi>August
CHARLES,</hi> and which is due to his Illust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Senators;</hi> because they will live in our
Hearts, and in our <hi>Records,</hi> which are more
permanent and lasting.</p>

to pursue to the height it may possibly reach (as <hi>Diogenes</hi> and
<hi>Anaximenes</hi> were wont to <hi>Deifie</hi> it) after we are past the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therial,</hi>
which is a certain <hi>Aer</hi> of <hi>Plato's</hi> denomination, as well
as that of the lesse pure, more turbulent and dense, which,<note place="margin">In <hi>Timaeo.</hi>
                  </note> for
most part we live and breath in, and which comes here to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
as it relates to the design in hand, the City of <hi>London,</hi> and
the environs about it.</p>
               <p>It would doubtlesse be esteem'd for a strange and extravagant
<hi>Paradox,</hi> that one should affirme, that the <hi>Aer</hi> it selfe is many
times a potent and great disposer to <hi>Rebellion;</hi> and that <hi>Insulary
people,</hi> and indeed, most of the <hi>Septentrion</hi> Tracts, where this <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
is grosse and heavy, are extremely versatile and obnoxious to
change both in Religious and Secular Affaires: Plant the Foote
of your Compasses on the very <hi>Pole,</hi> and extend the other limb
to 50 <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Latitude:</hi> bring it about 'till it describe the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and then reade the Histories of those Nations inclusively and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51974:8"/>
make the Calculation. It must be confess'd, that the <hi>Aer</hi> of those
<hi>Climates,</hi> is not so pure and Defecate as those which are neerer the
<hi>Tropicks,</hi> where the Continent is lesse ragged, and the Weather
more constant and steady, as well as the Inclination and Temper
of the Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>But it is not here that I pretend to speculate upon these Causes,
or nicely to examine the Discourses of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> and <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
whether the <hi>Aer</hi> be in it self generally cold, humid, warm or
exactly temper'd so as best conduces to a <hi>materiall principle,</hi> of
which it is accounted one of the four; because they are altogether
<hi>Physicall</hi> notions, and do not come under our cognisance as a pure
and sincere Element; but as it is particularly inquinated, infected,
participating of the various Accidents, and inform'd by extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal
Causes, which render it noxious to the <hi>Inhabitans,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
and make use of it for Life. Neverthelesse, for distinction
sake, we may yet be allow'd to repute some <hi>Aers pure,</hi> compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
<hi>viz.</hi> That which is cleare, open, sweetely ventilated
and put into motion with gentle gales and breezes; not too sharp,
but of a temperate constitutution. In a word, <hi>That</hi> we pronounce
for good and pure <hi>Aer,</hi> which head not to sweats and fointnesse;
nor cooles to rigidnesse and trembling; nor dries to wrinkles and
hardnesse; nor moystens to resolution and over much softnesse.
The more hot promotes indeede the Witt, but is weak and
trissing;<note place="margin">Lib. de Aere Aqu. &amp; Lotis.</note> and therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> speaks the <hi>Asiatique</hi> people
<hi>Imbelles</hi> and Effeminate, though of a more artificiall and ingenious
Spirit: If over cold and keen, it too much abotes the heat, but
renders the body robust and hardy; as those who are born under
the Northern <hi>Bears,</hi> are more fierce &amp; stupid, caused by a certain
internal <hi>Antiperistasis</hi> and universal Impulsion. The drier <hi>Aer</hi>
is generally the more salutary and healthy, so it be not too sweltery
and infested with heat or fuliginous vapours, which is by no
means a friend to health and Longavity, as <hi>Avicon</hi> notes of the
<hi>Aethiops</hi> who seldome arived to any considerable old Age. As
much to be reproved is the moyst, <hi>viz,</hi> that which is over mix'd
with <hi>aquous</hi> exhalations, equaly pernicious and susciptible of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
faction; notwithstanding does it oftner produce faire and
tendes skins, and some last along while in it; but commonly not
so healthy, as in <hi>Aer</hi> which is more dry. But the impure and
Uliginous, as that which proceedes from stagnated places, is of all
other, the most vile and Pestilent.</p>
               <p>

Now, that through all these diversiries of <hi>Aer, Mores Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
do <hi>Corporis temperamentum Sequi,</hi> is for the greater part so
true an observation, that a Volume of Instances might be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
if the Common notices did not sufficiently confirme it even
to a Proverb. The <hi>Aer</hi> on which we continually prey, perpetually
inspiring matter to the <hi>Animall</hi> and <hi>Vitall</hi> Spirits, by which they
become more or lesse obfuscated, clowded and render'd obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious:
and therefore that Prince of Physitians <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> wittily
calls a sincere and pure <hi>Aer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Morb<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Sacro.</note>, The <hi>Internunce and Interpreter of
Prudence.</hi> The celestiall influences being so much retarded or
assisted, and improv'd through this omnipresent, and as it were,
universal <hi>Medium:</hi> For, though the <hi>Aer</hi> in its simple substance
cannot be vitiated; yet, in its prime qualities it suffers these infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
mutations, both from superiour and inferiour Causes, so as its
accidentall effects become almost innumerable;</p>
               <p>Let it be farther consider'd, what is most evident, That the
Body feedes upon <hi>Meats</hi> commonly but at certain periods and
stated times, be it twice a day or oftner; whereas, upon the <hi>Aer,</hi>
or what accompanies it (<hi>est enim in ipso Aere occultus vitae cibus</hi>)
it is allwaies preying sleeping, or waking; and therefore, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the election of this constant and assiduous Food, should
something concerne us; I affirme, more then even the very <hi>Meat</hi>
we eat, whereof so little and indifferent nourishes and satisfies
the most temperate and best Educated persons. Besides, <hi>Aer</hi> that
is corrupt insinuates it self into the vital parts immediately;
whereas the meats which we take though never so ill condition'd,
require time for the concoction, by which its effects are greatly
mitigated; wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap> the other, passing so speedily to the Lungs,
and virtually to the Heart it self, is deriv'd and communicated
over the whole masse: In a word, as the Lucid and noble <hi>Aer,</hi>
clarifies the Blood, subtilizes and excites it, cheering the Spirits
and promoting digestion; so the dark, and grosse (on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary)
perturbs the Body, prohibits necessary Transpiration for
the resolution and dissipation of ill Vapours, even to disturbance
of the very Rational faculties, which the purer <hi>Aer</hi> does so far il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate,
as to have rendred some Men healthy and wise even to
Miracle. And therefore the Empoysoning of <hi>Aer,</hi> was ever
esteem'd no lesse fatall then the poysoning of Water or Meate it
self, and forborn even amongst <hi>Barbarians;</hi> since (as is said)
such Infections become more apt to insinuate themselves and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51974:9"/>
betray the very Spirits, to which they have so neer a cognation.
Some <hi>Aers</hi> we know are held to be <hi>Alexipharmac</hi> and even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leterious
to Poyson it self, as 'tis reported of that of <hi>Ireland:</hi> In
some we finde <hi>Carcasses</hi> will hardly putrifie, in others again rot
and fall to pieces immediately.</p>
               <p>From these, or the like considerations therefore, it might well
proceed, that <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> and the rest who follow that <hi>Master-Builder,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 1.</note>
mention it as a Principle, for the accomplishment of
their <hi>Architect,</hi> that being skilfull in the Art of <hi>Physick,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
other Observations, he sedulously examine the <hi>Aer</hi> and
<hi>Situation</hi> of the places where he designs to build, the Inclinations
of the Heavens,<note place="margin">Aeres Locorum.</note> and the Climats; <hi>Sine his enim rationibus nulla
salubris habitatio fieri potest:</hi> there is no dwelling can be safe or
healthy without it. 'Tis true, he does likewise adde <hi>Water</hi> also,
which is but a kinde of condensed <hi>Aer;</hi> though he might have
observ'd, <hi>that</hi> Element to be seldome bad, where the other is
good; omitting onely some peculiar Fountains and <hi>Mineral</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which are percolated through <hi>Mines</hi> and <hi>Metalique</hi> Earths
less frequent, and very rarely to be encounter'd.</p>
               <p>Now whether those who were the Antient <hi>Founders</hi> of our
goodly <hi>Metropolis,</hi> had considered these particulars (though long
before <hi>Vitruvius</hi>) I can no waies doubt or make question of;
since having respect to the nobleness of the situation of <hi>London,</hi>
we shall every way finde it to have been consulted with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
Advantages, not onely in relation to Profit, but to Health
and Pleasure; and that, if there be any thing which seems to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
the two last <hi>Transcendencies,</hi> it will be found to be but
something Extrinsecal and Accidental onely, which naturally does
not concern the Place at all; but, which may very easily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
without any the least inconvenience, as in due time we
shall come to demonstrate.</p>
               <p>For first, the City of <hi>London</hi> is built upon a sweet and most
agreeable Eminency of Ground, at the North-side of a goodly
and well-condition'd River, towards which it hath an Aspect by
a gentle and easie declivity, apt to be improv'd to all that may
render her <hi>Palaces, Buildings,</hi> and <hi>Avenues</hi> usefull, gracefull and
most magnificent: The <hi>Fumes</hi> which exhale from the Waters
and lower Grounds lying South-ward, by which means they are
perpetually attracted, carried off or dissipated by the Sun, as soon
as they are born and ascend.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:51974:9"/>
Adde to this, that the Soil is universally Gravell, not onely
where the City it self is placed; but for severall Miles about
the Countreys which environ it: That it is plentifully and richly
irrigated, and visited with Waters which Christalize her Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
in every Street, and may be conducted to them in such far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
plenty, as <hi>Rome</hi> her self might not more abound in this liquid
ornament, for the pleasure and divertisement, as well as for the
use and refreshment of her Inhabitants. I forbear to enlarge upon
the rest of the conveniencies which this August and Opulent City
enjoies both by Sea and Land, to accumulate her <hi>Encomiums,</hi> and
render her the most considerable that the <hi>Earth</hi> has standing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her ample bosome; became, it belongs to the <hi>Orator</hi> and the
<hi>Poet,</hi> and is none of my Institution: But I will infer, that if this
goodly City justly challenges what is her due, and merits all that
can be said to reinforce her Praises, and give her <hi>Title;</hi> she is to
be reliev'd from that which renders her less healthy, really of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
her, and which darkens and eclipses all her other Attributes.
And what is all this, but that Hellish and dismall Cloud of SEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COAL?
which is not onely perpetually imminent over her
head, For as the Poet,
<q>
                     <l>Conditur in tenebris altum caligine Coelum.</l>
                  </q>
                  <note place="margin">Aeneid. 11.</note>
but so universally mixed with the otherwise wholsome and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<hi>Aer,</hi> that her <hi>Inhabitants</hi> breathe nothing but an impure
and thick Mist accompanied with a fuligimous and filthy vapour,
which renders them obnoxious to a thousand inconveniences,
corrupting the <hi>Lungs,</hi> and disordring the entire habit of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
so that <hi>Catharrs, Phthisicks, Coughs</hi> and <hi>Consumptions</hi> rage
more in this one City than in the whole Earth besides.</p>
               <p>I shall not here much descant upon the Nature of <hi>Smoaks,</hi> and
other Exhalations from things burnt, which have obtain'd their
severall <hi>Epithetes,</hi> according to the quality of the Matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed,
because they are generally accounted noxious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholsome,
and I would not have it thought, that I doe here <hi>Fumos
vendere,</hi> as the word is, or blot paper with insignificant remarks:
It was yet haply no inept derivation of that <hi>Critick,</hi> who took
our <hi>English,</hi> or rather, <hi>Saxon</hi> appellative, from the <hi>Greek</hi> word
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>corrumpo</hi> and <hi>exuro,</hi> as most agreeable to its destructive
effects, especially of what we doe here so much declaim against;
since this is certain, that of all the common and familiar mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
which emit it, the immoderate use of, and indulgence to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51974:10"/>
                  <hi>Sea-coale</hi> alone in the City of <hi>London,</hi> exposes it to one of the
fowlest Inconveniencies and reproches, that can possibly befall
so noble, and otherwise, incomparable City: And that, not
from the <hi>Culinary</hi> fires, which for being weak, and lesse often
fed below, is with such ease dispell'd and scatterr'd above, as
it is hardly at all discernible, but from some few particular Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells
and Issues, belonging only to <hi>Brewers, Diers, Lime-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
Salt,</hi> and <hi>Sope-boylers,</hi> and some other private Trades,
<hi>One</hi> of whose <hi>Spiracles</hi> alone, does manifestly infect the <hi>Aer,</hi>
more, then all the Chimnies of <hi>London</hi> put together besides.
And that this is not the least <hi>Hyperbolie,</hi> let the best of Judges
decide it, which I take to be our senses: Whilst these are bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
it forth their sooty jaws, the City of <hi>London</hi> resembles the
face rather of <hi>Mount Aetna,</hi> the <hi>Court of Vulcan, Stromboli,</hi>
or the Suburbs of <hi>Hell,</hi> then an Assembly of Rational Creatures,
and the Imperial feat of our incomparable <hi>Monarch.</hi> For when
in all other places the <hi>Aer</hi> is most Serene and Pure, it is here
Ecclipsed with such a Cloud of Sulphure, as the Sun it self,
which gives day to all the World besides, is hardly able to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
and impart it here; and the weary <hi>Traveller,</hi> at many
Miles distance, sooner smells, then sees the City to which he
repairs. This is that pernicious Smoake which fullyes all her
Glory, superinducing a sooty Crust or furr upon all that it
lights, spoyling the moveables, tarnishing the Plate, Gildings
and Furniture, and corroding the very Iron-bars and hardest
stones with those piercing and acrimonious Spirits which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
its Sulphure; and executing more in one year, then expos'd
to the pure <hi>Aer</hi> of the Country it could effect in some hundreds.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51974:10"/>
it is this which diffuses and spreads a Yellownesse upon our choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
Pictures and Hangings: which does this mischief at home;
is <hi>Avernus</hi> to <hi>Fowl,</hi> and kills our <hi>Bees</hi> and <hi>Flowers</hi> abroad, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
nothing in our Cardens to bud, display themselves, or
ripon; so as our <hi>Anemonies</hi> and many other choycest Flowers, will
by no Industry be made to blow in <hi>London,</hi> or the Precincts of it,
unlesse they be raised on a <hi>Hot-bed,</hi> and govern'd with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Artifice to accellerate their springing, imparting a bitter
and ungrateful Tast to those few wretched <hi>Fruits,</hi> which never
arriving to their desired maturity, seem, like the <hi>Apples</hi> of
<hi>Sodome,</hi> to fall even to dust, when they are but touched. Not
therefore to be forgotten, is that which was by many observ'd,
that in the year when <hi>New-castle</hi> was besieg'd and blocked up in
our late Wars, so as through the great Dearth and Scarcity of
Coales, those fumous Works many of them were either left off,
or spent but few Coales in comparison to what they now use: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Gardens and Orchards planted even in the very heart of
<hi>London,</hi> (as in particular my Lord Marquesse of <hi>Hertfords</hi> in
the <hi>Strand,</hi> my Lord <hi>Bridgewaters,</hi> and some others about <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bican</hi>)
were observed to bear such plentiful and infinite quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Fruits, as they never produced the like either before or
since, to their great astonishment: but it was by the Owners
rightly imputed to the penury of Coales, and the little Smoake,
which they took notice to infest them that year: For there is a
virtue in the <hi>Aer,</hi> to penetrate, alter, nourish, yea and to
multiply Plants and Fruits, without-which no vegetable could
possibly thrive; but as the <hi>Poet.</hi>
                  <q>

So as it was not ill said by <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> that of all things, <hi>Aer</hi>
only could be truly affirm'd to have <hi>Life,</hi> seeing to all things it
gave Life. Argument sufficient to demonstrate, how prejudicial
it is to the Bodies of men; for that can never be <hi>Aer</hi> sit for them

               <p>I have strangely wondred, and not without some just indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

sometimes beheld that stately House and Garden belonging to my

               <p>Now to what funest and deadly Accidents the assiduous inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of this Smoak exposes the numerous Inhabitants, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
touch'd, whatsoever some have fondly pretended, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that the constant use of the same <hi>Aer</hi> (be it never so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure)
may be consistent with Life and a Valetudinary state; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
if the Place be native to us, and that we have never lived
for any long time out of it; Custome, in this, as in all things else,
obtaining another Nature, and all Putrefaction, proceeding from
certain Changes, it becomes, as it were, the <hi>Form,</hi> and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that which is contain'd in it: For so (to say nothing of such
as by assuefaction have made the rankest poysons their most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
Diet) we read that <hi>Epimenides</hi> continu'd fifty years in a
damp <hi>Cave,</hi> the <hi>Eremites</hi> dwelt in Dens, and divers live now in
the <hi>Fens;</hi> some are condemn'd to the <hi>Mines,</hi> and others, that
are perpetually conversant about the <hi>Forges, Fornaces</hi> of Iron
and other Smoaky Works, are little concern'd with these trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
accidents: But as it is not (I perswade my self) out of
choyce, that these Men affect them; so nor will any man, I think,
commend and celebrate their manner of Living. A <hi>Tabid</hi> Body
might possibly trail out a miserable Life of seven or eight years by
a <hi>Sea-cole</hi> Fire, as 'tis reported the <hi>Wife</hi> of a certain famous
<hi>Physician,</hi> did of late by the Prescription of her Husband; but
it is to be considered also, how much longer, and happier she
might have survived in a better and more noble <hi>Aer;</hi> and that
old <hi>Par,</hi> who lived in health to an Hundred and fifty years of
Age, was not so much concern'd with the change of Diet (as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51974:11"/>
some have affirm'd) as with that of the <hi>Aer,</hi> which plainly wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
him, and spoyl'd his Digestion in a short time after his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
at <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is, I confesse, a certain <hi>Idiosyncrasia</hi> in the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of some persons, which may fit and dispose them to thrive
better in some <hi>Aers,</hi> then in other: But, it is manifest, that
those who repair to <hi>London,</hi> no sooner enter into it, but they
find a universal alteration in their Bodies, which are either dryed
up or enflam'd, the humours being exasperated and made apt to
putrifie, their sensories and perspiration so exceedingly stopp'd,
with the losse of Appetite, and a kind of general stupefaction,
succeeded with such <hi>Cathars</hi> and <hi>Distillations,</hi> as do never, or
very rarely quit them, without some further Symptomes of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Inconveniency so long as they abide in the place; which
yet are immediately restored to their former habit, so soon as
they are retired to their Homes and enjoy the fresh <hi>Aer</hi> again.
And here I may not omit to mention what a most Learned <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician</hi>
and one of the <hi>Colledge</hi> assur'd me,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Whistler.</hi>

<hi>London:</hi> that though he were a <hi>Merchant,</hi> and had frequent bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
in the City, was yet constrained to make his Dwelling some
miles without it; and when he came to the <hi>Exchange,</hi> within an
hour or two, grew so extremely indispos'd, that (as if out of his
proper Element) he was forced to take horse (which us'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
constantly to attend him at the Entrance) and ride as for his
Life, till he came into the Fields, and was returning home
again, which is an Instance so extraordinary, as not, it may be, to
be <unclear>parallell'd</unclear> in any place of <hi>Europe,</hi> save the <hi>Grotto del Cane,</hi>
nere <hi>Naples,</hi> the <hi>Os Plutonium</hi> of <hi>Silvius,</hi> or some such <hi>Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi>
habitation. For Diseases proceed not from so long a <hi>Series</hi>
of causes, as we are apt to conceive; but, most times from
those obvious, and despicable mischiefs, which yet we take lesse
notice of, because they are familiar: But how frequently do we
hear men say (speaking of some deceased Neighbour or Friend)
<hi>He went up to</hi> London, <hi>and took a great Cold,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which he
could never afterwards claw off again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I report my self to all those who (during these sad confusions)
have been compelled to breath the <hi>Aer</hi> of other Countries for
some years: if they do not now perceive a manifest alteration in
their <hi>Appetite,</hi> and clearnesse of their Spirits; especially such
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51974:12"/>
as have liv'd long in <hi>France,</hi> and the City of <hi>Paris;</hi> where, to
take off that unjust reproch, the <hi>Plague</hi> as seldome domineers,
as in any part of <hi>Europe,</hi> which I more impute to the Serenity
and Purity of the <hi>Aer</hi> about it, then to any other qualities which
are frequently assign'd for the cause of it by divers Writers. But
if it be objected that the purest <hi>Aers</hi> are soonest infected; it is
answered, that they are also the soonest freed again; and that none
would therefore choose to live in a corrupt <hi>Aer,</hi> because of this
Article: <hi>London</hi> 'tis confess'd, is not the only City most obnoxious
to the Pestilence; but it is yet never clear of this Smoake which
is a Plague so many other ways, and indeed intolerable; because
it kills not at once, but always; since still to languish, is worse
then even Death it self. For is there under Heaven such <hi>Coughing</hi>
and <hi>Snuffing</hi> to be heard, as in the <hi>London</hi> Churches and Assemlies
of People, where the Parking and the Spitting is uncessant and
most importunate. What shall I say?
<q>Hinc hominum pecudumque Lues.—</q>
                  <note place="margin">Lucan.</note>
And what may be the cause of these troublesome effects, but the
inspiration of this infernal vapour, accompaning the <hi>Aer,</hi> which
first heats and pollicits the <hi>Aspera Arteria,</hi> through one of whose
Conduits, partly <hi>Cartilaginous,</hi> and partly <hi>membranous,</hi> it
enters by several branches into the very <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the <hi>Lungs,</hi> violating, in this passage, the <hi>Larynx</hi> and
<hi>Epiglottis,</hi> together with those multiform and curious Muscles,
the immediate and proper Instruments of the <hi>Voyce,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
rough and drye, can neither be contracted, or dilated
for the due modulation of the Voyce; so as by some of my
Friends (studious in <hi>Musick,</hi> and whereof one is a Doctor of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick)
it has been constantly observ'd, that coming out of the
<hi>Country</hi> into <hi>London,</hi> they lost <hi>Three whole Notes</hi> in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of their Voice, which they never recover'd again till their
retreat; <hi>Adeo enim Animantes</hi> (to use the <hi>Orators</hi> words) <hi>aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione

               <p>Whether the Head and the Brain (as some have imagined) take
in the ambient <hi>Aer,</hi> nay the very <hi>Arteries</hi> through the skin uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally

of what consequence the goodnesse and purity of the <hi>Aer</hi> is, will
to every one appear: Sure we are, how much the Respiration is

perturb'd, and concern'd, when the <hi>Lungs</hi> are prepossessed

into them out of the <hi>Bronchia</hi> (together with the returning blood)
to the very Heart it self; so as we are not at all to wonder, at
the suddain and prodigious Effects of a poysonous or lesse whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<hi>Aer,</hi> when it comes to invade such noble Parts, <hi>Vessells,
Spirits</hi> and <hi>Humours,</hi> as it visits and attaques, through those
subtile and curious passages. But this is not all.</p>
               <p>What if there appear to be an <hi>Arsenical</hi> vapour, as well as
<hi>Sulphur,</hi> breathing sometimes from this intemperate use of <hi>Sea-Cole,</hi>
in great Cities? That there is, what does plainly stupifie,
is evident to those who fit long by it; and that which fortun'd to
the <hi>Dutchmen</hi> who Winter'd in <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> was by all <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians</hi>
attributed to such a deleterious quality in the like fuell, as
well as to the Inspissation of the <hi>Aer,</hi> which they thought only
to have attemper'd, as is by most esteem'd to be the reason of the
same dangerous <hi>halitus</hi> of <hi>Char-Cole,</hi> not fully enkendl'd. But
to come neerer yet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>New Castle Cole,</hi> as an expert <hi>Physician</hi> affirms,<note place="margin">Boetlus a Boot.</note> causeth <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions,
Phthisicks,</hi> and the Indisposition of the <hi>Lungs,</hi> not
only by the suffocating aboundance of <hi>Smoake;</hi> but also by its
<hi>Virulency:</hi> For all <hi>subterrany</hi> Fuell hath a kind of <hi>virulent</hi> or
<hi>Arsenical</hi> vapour rising from it; which, as it speedily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys
those who dig it in the <hi>Mines;</hi> so does it by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and little, those who use it <hi>here</hi> above them: Therefore those
Diseases (saith this Doctor) most afflict about <hi>London,</hi> where
the very <hi>Iron</hi> is sooner consum'd by the Smoake thereof, then
where this Fire is not used.</p>
               <p>And, if indeed there be such a Venemous quality latent, and
sometimes breathing from this Fuell, we are lesse to trouble our
selves for the finding out of the Cause of those <hi>Pestilential</hi> and
<hi>Epidemical</hi> Sicknesses (<hi>Epidemiorum Causa enim in Aere,</hi> says
<hi>Galen</hi>) which at divers periods, have so terribly infested and
wasted us: or, that it should be so susceptible of infection, all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51974:13"/>
manner of Diseases having so universal <hi>a vehicle</hi> as is that of the
<hi>Smoake,</hi> which perpetually invests this City: But this is also no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Learned Sir <hi>Kenelme Digby,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Discourse of Sympathetick Powder.</note> in confirmation of the
Doctrine of <hi>Atomical Essluvia</hi>'s and Emanations, wasted, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and communicated by the <hi>Aer,</hi> where he well observes, that
from the Materials of our <hi>London</hi> Fires, there results a great
quantity of volatile Salts, which being very sharp and dissipated
by the Smoake, doth infect the <hi>Aer,</hi> and so incorporate with it,
that, though the very Bodies of those corrosive particles escape
our perception, yet we soon find their effects, by the destruction
which they induce upon all things that they do but touch; spoyling,
and destroying their beautiful colours, with their fuliginous quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
Yea, though a Chamber be never so closely locked up,
Men find at their return, all things that are in it, even covered
with a black thin Soot, and all the rest of the Furniture as full of
it, as if it were in the house of some <hi>Miller,</hi> or a <hi>Bakers</hi> Shop,
where the <hi>Flower</hi> gets into their <hi>Cupboards,</hi> and Boxes, though
never so close and accurately shut.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Coale,</hi> says Sir <hi>K.</hi> flies abroad, sowling the Clothes that
are expos'd a drying upon the Hedges; and in the Spring-time (as
but now we mention'd) besoots all the Leaves, so as there is
nothing free from its universal contamination, and it is for this,
that the <hi>Bleachers</hi> about <hi>Harl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>em</hi> prohibit by an express Law (as
I am told) the use of these <hi>Coles,</hi> for some Miles about that
Town; and how curious the Diers and Weavers of <hi>Dammask,</hi>
and other precious Silks are at <hi>Florence,</hi> of the least ingresse of
any Smoaky vapour, whilst their Loomes are at work, I shall
shew upon some other occasion: But in the mean time being thus
incorporated with the very <hi>Aer,</hi> which ministers to the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
respiration of our Lungs, the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and
such as frequent it, find it in all their <hi>Expectorations;</hi> the Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and other excrements which proceed from them, being for
the most part of a blackish and fuliginous Colour: Besides this
acrimonious Soot produces another sad effect, by rendring the
people obnoxious to Inflammations, and comes (in time) to
exulcerate the <hi>Lungs,</hi> which is a mischief so incurable, that it
carries away multitudes by Languishing and deep <hi>Consumptions,</hi>
as the <hi>Bills of Mortality</hi> do Weekly inform us. And these are
those <hi>Endemii Morbi,</hi> vernaculous and proper to <hi>London.</hi> So cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosive
is this <hi>Smoake</hi> about the City, that if one would hang up

                  <hi>Gammons</hi> of <hi>Bacon, Beefe,</hi> or other Flesh to sume, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
it in the Chimnies, as the good <hi>House-Wifes</hi> do in the
Country, where they make use of sweeter Fuell, it will so
<hi>Mummifie,</hi> drye up, wast and burn it, that it suddainly crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
away, consumes and comes to nothing.</p>
               <p>The Consequences then of all this is, that (as was said) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
one half of them who perish in <hi>London,</hi> dye of <hi>Phthisical</hi>
and <hi>pulmonic</hi> distempers; That the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> are never
free from <hi>Coughs</hi> and importunate <hi>Rheumatisms,</hi> spitting of
<hi>Impostumated</hi> and corrupt matter: for remedy whereof, there
is none so infallible, as that, in time, the Patient change
his <hi>Aer,</hi> and remove into the <hi>Country:</hi> Such as repair to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
(where it is excellent) and other like Places, perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
of their health; which is a demonstration sufficient to
confirm what we have asserted, concerning the perniciousnesse of
that about this City, produc'd only, from this exitial and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
Accident.</p>
               <p>But I hear it now objected by some, that in publishing this
Invective against the <hi>Smoake</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> I hazard the engaging
of a whole <hi>Faculty</hi> against me, and particularly, that the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Physicians</hi> esteem it rather a preservation against Infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions,
then otherwise any cause of the sad effects which I have
enumerated. But, as I have upon several encounters, found
the most able, and Learned amongst them, to renounce this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and heartily with for a universal purgation of the Aer by
the expedients I propose; so, I cannot believe that any of that
Learned Society, should think themselves so far concern'd, as
to be offended with me for that, which (as well for their sakes,
as the rest who derive benefit from it) I wish were at farther
distance; since it is certain, that so many of their <hi>Patients</hi> are
driven away from the City, upon the least indisposition which
attaques them, on this sole consideration; as esteeming it lesse
dangerous to put themselves into the hands of some Country
<hi>Doctor</hi> or <hi>Emperic,</hi> then to abide the <hi>Aer</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> with all
its other advantages. For the rest, that pretend to that honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Profession; if any shall find themselves agreev'd and think
good to contend, I shall easily allow him as much Smoake as he
desires, and much good may it do him. But, it is to be suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and the answer is made (by as many have ever suggested
the Objection to me) That there be some whom I must expect
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51974:14"/>
to plead for that, which makes so much work for the <hi>Chimny-Sweeper;</hi>
Since I am secure of the Learned and Ingenuous, and
whole Fortunes are not built on Smoake, or raised by a universal
Calamity; such as I esteem to be the <hi>Nuisances,</hi> I have here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved:
I do not hence infer, that I shall be any way impatient
of a just and civil Reply, which I shall rather esteem for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
done me, because I know, that a witty aud a Learned man
is able to discourse upon any Subject whatsoever; some of them
having with praise, written even of the praise of <hi>Diseases</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
for so <hi>Favorinus</hi> of old, and <hi>Menapius</hi> since commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

               <p>But to proceed, I do farther affirm, that it is not the dust and
Ordure which is daily cast out of their Houses, much lesse what
is brought in by the Feet of Men and Horses; or the want of more
frequent and better conveyances, which renders the Streets of
<hi>London</hi> dirty even to a <hi>Proverb:</hi> but chiefly this continual <hi>Smoake,</hi>
which ascending in the day-time, is, by the descending Dew, and
Cold, precipitated again at night: And this is manifest, if a peice
of clean Linnen be spread all Night in any Court or Garden, the
least infested as to appearance; but especially if it happen to rain,
which carries it down in greater proportion, not only upon the
Earth, but upon the <hi>Water</hi> also, where it leaves a thin Web, or
<hi>pellicule</hi> of dust, dancing upon the Surface of it; as those who
go to bathe in the <hi>Thames</hi> (though at some Miles distance from
the City) do easily discern and bring home upon their Bodies:
How it sticks on the Hands, Faces, and Linnen of our fair <hi>Ladies,</hi>

and, that, because the most imperceptible transpirations, which
<hi>they</hi> send forth, are ventilated, and dispersed with the least
breath which is stirring: Whereas the <hi>Columns</hi> and Clowds of
<hi>Smoake,</hi> which are belched forth from the sooty Throates of
those Works, are so thick and plentiful, that rushing out with
great impetuosity, they are capable even to resist the fiercest winds,
and being extremely surcharg'd with a fuliginous Body, fall down
upon the City, before they can be dissipated, as the more thin

(which commonly take up a great space of Ground)
might be converted into <hi>Tenements,</hi> and some of them into
<hi>Noble Houses</hi> for use and pleasure, respecting the <hi>Thames</hi> to
their no small advantage. Add to this, that it would be a means

might so easily be brought to the Shambles and Shops from other

all that is offensive; at least let such, whose <hi>Works</hi> are upon

for the speedy removal of this universal grievance.</p>
                  <p>It is certainly of far greater concernment (however light and

another expedient, which I have here to offer (were <hi>This</hi> of
the poisonous and filthy <hi>smoak</hi> remov'd) by which the <hi>City</hi> and
environs about it, might be rendred one of the most pleasant
and agreeable places in the world. In order to this I
propose.</p>
               <p>That all low-grounds circumjacent to the City, especially
<hi>East</hi> and <hi>South-west,</hi> be cast and contriv'd into square plots, or
Fields of twenty, thirty, and forty <hi>Akers,</hi> or more, separated
from each others by Fences of double <hi>Palisads,</hi> or <hi>Contr'spaliers,</hi>
which should enclose a Plantation of an hundred and fifty, or
more, feet deep, about each Field; not much unlike to what His
<hi>Majesty</hi> has already begun by the wall from Old <hi>Spring-garden</hi>
to St. <hi>Iames's</hi> in that <hi>Park;</hi> and is somewhat resembled in the
new <hi>Spring-garden at Lambeth.</hi> That these <hi>Palisad's</hi> be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
planted, diligently kept and supply'd, with such <hi>Shrubs,</hi>
as yield the most fragrant and odoriferous <hi>Flowers,</hi> and are aptest
to tinge the <hi>Aer</hi> upon every gentle emission at a great distance:
Such as are (for instance amongst many others) the <hi>Sweet-brier,</hi>
all the <hi>Periclymena's</hi> and <hi>Woodbinds;</hi> the Common <hi>white</hi> and
<hi>yellow Iessamine,</hi> both the <hi>Syringa's</hi> or <hi>Pipe trees;</hi> the <hi>Guelder-Rose,</hi>
the <hi>Musk,</hi> and all other <hi>Roses; Genista Hispanica:</hi> To
these may be added the <hi>Rubus odoratus, Bayes, Iuniper, Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num-vitae,
Laevander:</hi> but above all, <hi>Rosemary,</hi> the <hi>Flowers</hi>
whereof are credibly reported to give their sent above thirty

whatsoever is odoriferous and refreshing.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Spaces,</hi> or <hi>Aera</hi> between these <hi>Palisads,</hi> and Fences,
be employ'd in Beds and Bordures of <hi>Pinks, Carnations, Clove,
Stock-gilly-flower, Primroses, Aurieulds, Violets,</hi> not forgetting
the <hi>White,</hi> which are in flower twice a year, <hi>April</hi> and <hi>August:

onely all that did approach the <hi>Region,</hi> which is properly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to be Flowery; but even the whole City, would be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the sweet and ravishing varieties of the perfumes, as well
as of the most delightful and pleasant objects, and places of
Recreation for the Inhabitants; yielding also a <hi>Prospect</hi> of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and masculine Majesty, by reason of the frequent plantations
of <hi>Trees,</hi> and <hi>Nurseries</hi> for Ornament, Profit, and Security:
The remainder of the <hi>Fields</hi> included, yielding the same, and
better Shelter, and Pasture for Sheep and Cattel then now;
that they lie bleak, expos'd and abandon'd to the winds, which
perpetually invade them.</p>
               <p>That, to this end, the <hi>Gardiners</hi> (which now cultivate the
upper, more drie and ungrateful soil) be encouraged to begin
<hi>Plantations</hi> in such places onely: and the farther exorbitant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of <hi>Tenements,</hi> poor and nasty <hi>Cottages</hi> near the City,
be prohibited, which disgrace and take off from the sweetness
and amoenity of the Environs of <hi>London,</hi> and are already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a great <hi>Eye-sore</hi> in the grounds opposite to His <hi>Majesty's

for <hi>Health, Profit,</hi> and <hi>Beauty,</hi> which are the three <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendencies</hi>
that render a place without all exception. And
<hi>this</hi> is what (in short) I had to offer, for the <hi>Improvement</hi> and
