            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In vaine doe the Ministers of Gods Word cry aloud, and lift up their voices like trumpets in preaching to you, except you also do conforme your selves in obedience to what is taught you. God requires of you <hi>knowledge and sanctification,</hi> according to the measure of means, that He hath <hi>afforded you:</hi> much, where he hath given much, more of those that have meanes, than, of those that have none, and more of those where the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10659:4"/>
Gospell of Christ is openly and freely preached, than of those, who living in times of persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have it only by stealth, and with many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and dangers.</p>
            <p>Lord what a measure then of knowledge and sanctification doth he require of us, who live in such a flourishing Church as ours is! where Hee hath planted the most faithfull Ministery; where wee have praying without ceasing (some thinke too much;) where wee have reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures without interruption (a priviledge denied unto our neighbours) and where we have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without contradiction. God hath planted us like <hi>a tree by the rivers of waters.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 1.3. Luke 13.8.</note> Hee hath <hi>dig'd about us and doung'd us,</hi> He hath used fair means, and foule means, and all means possible, to make us fruitfull: but what's the end of all this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? I am affraid God fails of his expectation, I am affraid that he looks for more fruit from us, than he is like to finde: and I have cause to feare it, seeing the poore successe of all our labour in <hi>your</hi> practice: for which of you have attained more <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>sanctification</hi> than you had ten, twenty yeeres ago? Which of you have <hi>mortified</hi> and <hi>subdued</hi> any <hi>sinfull corruption</hi> since that <hi>time?</hi> which of you were <hi>covetous</hi> then, and are not <hi>covetous still</hi>? which of you were <hi>slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers then,</hi> and are not <hi>slanderers still?</hi> which of you were <hi>lyars then,</hi> and are not <hi>lyars still?</hi> which of you were <hi>swearers then,</hi> and are not <hi>swearers still</hi>? which of you were <hi>unchast, untemperate, uncharitable, ungodly then,</hi> and do not remayne so to this very houre?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:10659:5"/>Thus, thus is that excellent and honourable calling of the Ministery made most miserable; whilest wee play labour in vain, preaching again and again, this week and the next, and all the yeer long, and all to no purpose.</p>
            <p>I remember a story of <hi>Tyresias</hi> the Southsayer. whom, when <hi>Iuno,</hi> (for the giving his verdict a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her) had stricken blinde, <hi>Iupiter</hi> to make him recompence, gave him the eyes of his minde, and made him a Prophet; then <hi>Iuno,</hi> inveterate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly malicious (the fault of most of that sex where they once fall out with any) being not able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe, what <hi>Iove</hi> had done, gave him this curse withall, that, although he prophecied the truth, yet whatsoever he should say, it should not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. This is just our case: after that wee have spent all our time in the University, in studying the Arts and Sciences, in learning the tongues, in turning over the Fathers, <hi>in searching the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>; in comparing places together, after all this pains and industry, we may cry out with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Quis credit praedicationi nostrae?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 53.1.</note> 
               <hi>Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arme of the Lord revealed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a partiall age is this we live in? men care not what burdens they lay upon the Ministers backs; they must preach and preach, once, twice a week, or else they plainly tell them, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> told the <hi>Israelites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 5.17. 1 Cor. 9.16.</note> 
               <hi>Desides est is, desides, yee are idle, yee are idle</hi> and <hi>Wo be to you if you preach not the Gospell,</hi> but what's the end of all this preaching? that's nothing to them; when wee
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10659:5"/>
have done, all's done. Thus like <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,</hi> they <hi>binde heavy burdens and grievous to be borne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 23.4.</note> 
               <hi>and lay them on our shoulders, but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers,</hi> they teach us our duty, when to preach and how to preach too, but they will not learne their own to practise what is taught them; they care not for a <hi>quod superest,</hi> for a <hi>Finally,</hi> for any thing to come, they have enough already.</p>
            <p>Wee'll leave them therfore in their plenty, and proceed to the next thing considerable, which is the title by which the courteous Apostle salutes the <hi>Corinthians:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Brethren.</note> 
               <hi>Brethren, quod superest fratres; Finally, my brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was well noted by Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> against <hi>Helvidius,</hi> that <hi>Brethren</hi> in Scripture, were so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med foure manner of wayes.</p>

            <p>Yet you must go further, and do good to those of your owne house, your kindred according to the flesh.<note place="margin">Gen. 13.</note> This was the bond that bound <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to <hi>Lot,</hi> because <hi>hee was his brothers sonne, Gen.</hi> 13.

               <hi>I beseech you Brethren, mark them diligently which cause divisions and offences, contrary to the doctrine, which yee have received, and avoid them; for they that are such, serve not the Lord, but their owne bellies, and with faire speech and flattering deceive the hearts of the simple.</hi> This is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10659:16"/>
that Satan beareth the Church of God, by suborning Hereticks and false Teachers to bring in damnable Doctrine to seduce men from the true Religion, this his practice from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; for no sooner had God finished his work and perfected man, but Satan sets himselfe incontinent to pervert him: In the two first Chapters of <hi>Genesis,</hi> you shall finde God alwayes speaking; <hi>Deus dixit,</hi> God said, thus and thus: but in the beginning of the Third there comes in, <hi>&amp; Serpens dixit,</hi> and the Serpent said; The Devill will have a word for evill, for every word that God shall have for good: yet it is to be marked, that howsoever errour be old, yet truth is elder; for first, <hi>Deus dixit,</hi> and then <hi>Serpens dixit,</hi> first, God said, and then the Devill said.</p>
            <p>If then the Devill were so malicious at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, Then how much more now, since his time is so short? like the birds of <hi>Norway,</hi> that because the dayes there are so short, make the more haste in flying: even so doth Satan, because his time draws on,<note place="margin">Jude 6.</note> when hee shall be <hi>bound in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting chains under darknesse</hi>; he doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the more rage and fury seeke to worke our destruction.

And if thou finde thy judgment weak, that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10659:16"/>
thou art not able to answer the cavils of these Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, these Brownists, Familists, Anabaptists, Papists, and the like, take my counsell, and give no eare at all unto them, lest thou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be perverted and brought to believe lies; and if thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest increase in knowledge, and be bettered in thy judgement, that thou mayst not be seduced, let me advise thee, to search the Scriptures dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and compare one place with another, not in private study only, but by conferring with the Godly. With all, pray unto Almighty God in true humility of heart, for the illumination of his holy Spirit, whereby thou mayst in minde rightly conceive of the truth, by Faith embrace it in thy heart, and by obedience honour it in thy life. If thou shalt thus do constantly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, thou shalt be sure to be preserved from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour both fundamentall and finall, and in due time shalt know the truth: for the promise is, <hi>Aske and you shall have,</hi>

               <hi>Be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as Brethren, be pitifull, be courteus, not rendring evill for evill, or rayling for rayling, but contrariwise blessing, knowing that you are thereunto called that you should inherit a blessing.</hi>

This, This was Christs legacy that he left his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples. <hi>Pacem relinquo vobis, My Peace I leave with you.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 14.27.</note> It was bequeathed from Christ to his Apostles, and from his Apostles to us, for so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they conclude their Epistles, <hi>Grace be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you and Peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Peace, it is the language of Heaven; the Angels speake no other, <hi>then, Glory be to God on High,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 2.14.</note> 
               <hi>on Earth Peace.</hi> The second thing in the World is Peace; one only thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, <hi>the Glory of God</hi>; yet Glory and Peace must be sung together, no Glory on High will be admitted without peace upon earth: no Gift on His Altar will be accepted, before Peace be made in the earth: first go your way and make peace on earth, and that done, come againe, and you shall be accepted to give glory to Heaven, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Have Peace therefore with all men, especially with those that are of the houshold of Faith:</hi> with all men? not absolutely, but upon these conditions. The Apostle tels us the first,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.14.</note>

I am sure I have a good warrant for't: the Prophet <hi>David</hi> was of this minde: hee accounted Peace <hi>a good and a comely thing,</hi> but it must be among <hi>Brethren,</hi> those that hate God, he will hate; they that are Gods enemies, shall be his Enemies. <hi>Doe I not hate them, O God, that hate thee,</hi>

               <hi>and am I not grieved with those that rise up against thee? Yea, I hate them with a perfect hatred, I account them my enemies, Psal.</hi> 139.21, 22 And yet <hi>cum odio habemus vitia,</hi>

            <p>Secondly, Harken to the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18. <hi>If it be possible, and as much as in you lies, live peaceably with all men.</hi>

behalfe, and then your dutie is discharged.</p>
            <p>Lastly, This must be understood as meant in a private or personall cause, that we are thus ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly to follow and pursue after peace. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise if the cause be publique, or doe concerne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if it tend to the undoing or betraying of our neighbour, in such cases as these, a man hath a Sanctuary provided him, even the Law, which hee may lawfully flie unto: yet so as hee still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to ensue Peace, and be as ready upon any reasonable termes to lay hold on it.</p>
            <p>This is a Doctrine never out of season, but especially at this time, when Kingdomes halfe disjoynted are united (I pray God continue it) especially at this time, when all the World are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the eares, and wee in safety; especially at this time, when you are to receive the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the body and bloud of our Saviour Christ; which is the Sacrament of Peace, and a Seale of our union and communion with Christ our Head, and with one another; where you are all to eat of the same spirituall meat, where you are all to drink of the same spirituall drink: when then should you be friends and at peace among your selves, if not now? I require and charge you before him that knoweth the hearts and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the reins of all men, that if any of you have a grudging against me against him, against anyone, that you doe not dare to approach that holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, before you disgorge your stomacks,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.24.</note> lay down your malice and be friends, <hi>First, goe and be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thy Gift.</hi>

               </note> at the end of the Liturgie ever to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse the assembly with a blessing: before which was pronounced, not a man of them would stir: like good <hi>Iacob,</hi>

               <hi>Non demittam te nisi benedixeris mihi, I will not let thee go till thou hast blessed me: Esau</hi> himselfe lift up his voice, and wept for a <hi>blessing</hi>;<note place="margin">Gen. 27.34.</note> yea, <hi>He cryed with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his Father, blesse me, even me also, O my Father.</hi> Such a vertue held <hi>they</hi> in it; but an evil custome hath prevailed with our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, away they go without blessing, as if it were not worth the taking with them. I marvell how they will be inheritors of the blessing hereafter, that seeme to set so little by it now: if they ever intend to heare, <hi>Come yee blessed,</hi> me thinks, they should not now runne from the blessing: none of the Apostles did so but one, and that was <hi>Iudas,</hi> and you know what followed, hee went out and hanged himself.</p>

               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:10659:22"/>But as this is a wish or blessing of the Apostle, so it is likewise a promise upon the performance of those duties: where you may observe, that as God is wont to proportionate mens punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to their sins, so doth he heer, their rewards to their vertues, if wee live in love and peace, the God of Love and Peace wil live with us. I would we were but truly possest of the greatnesse of this blessing, I would we did but know what it were to have God to be with us: not as hee was with <hi>Moses</hi> in a fiery Bush, not as he was with the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but as hee was with <hi>Elias</hi> in a still small voice; in Love and Peace. And, <hi>contrariorum ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem est ratio</hi>; If it, be so great a blessing to the godly to have God with them, then what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable curse is it, to the wicked, to have God from them: and so have all they that live in strife and discord; they are <hi>without God in the world</hi> here, and they shall be without him hereafter, if you will credit Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who saith, that they that live in <hi>hatred,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5.21.</note> 
               <hi>variance, emulations, strife, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, heresies, envyings, &amp;c. shall not inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be possible therefore, and as much as in you lies, live peaceably with all men; yea, seeke peace and ensue it, what ever it cost you, whither whether pleasure or profit, or credit, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever else, slack not, nor give over till thou hast at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved it.

of Love and Peace shall be with you.
