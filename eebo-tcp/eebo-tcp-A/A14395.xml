            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Many dayes togither there was no mention of diſputing, vntill in the meane-ſpace <note n="⸬" place="margin">i. the king</note> he had ſingled out the skilfulleſt and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedſt perſons, to the intent that by ſondry calumniations he make them away.

At laſt yet beganne the conflict of diſputation, at the place which the aduerſaries had choſen. Our Diuines therefore eſchewing all tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous clamour (leaſt the <hi>Arrians</hi> ſhould after ſay that they had by ſome of ours beene ouer-ruled) choſe certayne amongſt their owne company to anſwere for all. <hi>Cyrill</hi> placed aloft for himſelf and his <note n="⸬" place="margin">Satelliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</note> atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, a moſt ſtately throne, we ſtanding on our feete: whervpon our Biſhops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to ſay.

nowe who ſhall be the diſputer? who the defender? which with vpright ballance may eyther confirme that, which is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly auouched, or refell vnreaſonable aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

Neyther ſeruant, nor beaſt, nor garment to change, was
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19747:38"/>
left them. It was farther more forbidden, that any man ſhould harbour any one of them, or giue them ſuſteynance. And who ſo ſhould attempt for pity to doe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he with all his family ſhould be brent by fire. Prudently did the Biſhops, who were then caſt forth, in that (though begging) yet they departed not from thence. For had they gone their wayes, not only ſhould they neuer haue beene recalled: but they vvould haue belyed them (as they did) that they ſhunned diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; eſpecially becauſe when they ſhould haue retourned, their churches had no goodes left, all being rifled. While therefore the Biſhops lay round about the walles in the open ayre, it fell out ſo, that the wicked Tyrant went forth towardes the fiſh-pondes, vvhome they thought good to meete in the way, ſaying: Why are we ſo afflicted? For what euils com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſuffer we this? If called to diſpute, why are we ſpoyled? why are we ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred? why are we deferred, and driuen to remayne amongſt the dunghils here with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in the Country, afflicted with hunger and nakedneſſe, farre from our Churches and houſes? Whome he beholding with
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19747:39"/>
a fell regarde, before he heard their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, willed the horſe-me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ful courſe to ride ouer them, that by ſuch violence they might not only be trampled vpon: but be ſlaine outright. Many of them were then ſore cruſhed, eſpecially aged men. Then to the men of God was it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to preſent themſelues, and meete him at the Temple of <hi>Memory,</hi> vnwitting what treachery was there prepared.</p>

He was moreouer of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times haled along, and ſo cruſhed with the ſharpe pointed flintes, that you might haue ſeene (by reaſon the vtmoſt skinne was rent aſunder) the oflappes of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward partes, hanging at his ſides and bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This man had ſuffered not much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like matters, in the time of <hi>Genſericke,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then he would bewray the ſecretes of one of his friendes. Howe much more then, would he be furniſhed with conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy about Sacraments of religion? and if he ſhewed himſelfe ſo truſty to his friend,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19747:42"/>
which only loued him; howe much more did he owe to him, who ſhal fully rewarde his loyaltie?</p>
               <p>What outrages were done in the City <hi>Cluſe,</hi> it is not in me to declare; for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry number of Martyrs and Confeſſors, it is not poſſible to recount. One Matron amongſt them called <hi>Victoria,</hi> a true am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifier of her name, as ſhe hung burning ouer a ſofte fire in the face of the people, was thus intreated by her vngratious huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, her children ſtanding by. Why ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereſt thou, O wife? If thou deſpiſe me haue pity (thou hard harted woman) of theſe litle ones, whome thou haſt engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. Howe hapneth it that thou regardeſt not thine owne wombe, &amp; ſetteſt nothing by thoſe, whome groaning thou brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt into the world?

nor to the Serpents flatteries, caſting her eyes vpwardes from the ground, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned the world with the deſires there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Whome when the Executioners per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to be dead, after that her ſhoulders were with long hanging out of their place, tooke her downe fully bereft of life.

So great was his humility, that he neuer was delighted with doing miracles, neither deſired that grace. Requeſted to pray for others neceſſities, hee vſually receiued theſe words: <hi>Thou knoweſt (O Lord) what is our ſoules health, graunt of thy mercy vnto our neceſsity as farre forth as ſhal not hinder our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall profit.</hi> Whatſoeuer hee by prayer ſo obtained at Gods hands, he imputed it to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:19747:68"/>
their faith, ſaying God had granted it to them, not to him. Hee was wont to ſay that Miracles make not a man iuſt and righteous, but famous.</p>
            <p>Returning againe to <hi>Sardinia</hi> he began <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIX"/> a freſh foundation of a new monaſterie, aſſembling ſome 40.

To whom he any thing more diſtributed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the reſt, he willed them to be the more humble, ſaying. <hi>Who taketh of the common ſo much, becommeth debter to all: which debt onely humility ought to pay.</hi> He gaue to euery one what their neede or manifeſt reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; but if any preſumed to aske, hee denied it although there were happilie good cauſe. For (ſaid hee) <hi>Monkes ought to content with that which is giuen them: and they which aske; be it that they neede it, yet are they</hi>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:19747:69"/>
               <hi>in bondage to carnall deſires: and haue not their mind perfectly ſet vpon heauenly thinges; ſeeing what they cannot giue by worldly bargaining &amp; buſines, they labour to purchace by petition.</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleaſing was it vnto him, if any of the brethren propoſed a hard queſtion: and gladly heard hee the doubts of any bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were hee neuer ſo ſimple; neither would hee for wearineſſe or tediouſneſſe ceaſe to yeelde them reaſon vntill they confeſſed themſelues ſatisfied. In corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſo long would he appeare ſeuere, as the neceſſity of diſcipline did compell; remaining, euen when hee ſeemed moſt diſpleaſed and angrie, nothing at all in minde troubled or diſquieted.</p>

of people, that a ſhowre happening, they with their garments held hollow ouer his head as by a tabernacle, ſheilded him from the rayne.

But by importunity of the people, needing him and complayning of his abſence, he returned and ſhortly fell into greiuous pangues of ſikneſſe: lying ſo ſome 60. dayes he often cryed; <hi>O Lord, giue me here patience, and afterwards pardon.</hi> Phyſicions perſwading him to vſe a bath; <hi>Can bathes</hi> (quoth he) <hi>make that a man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing accompliſhed the courſe of nature ſhould not dye? if not; why then induce you me now at my laſt end to diſſolue the rigor of my long-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued profeſsion?</hi> Calling laſtly the brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about him, he thus ſpake vnto them. <hi>Careful of your ſouls helth (deare brethren) haue I perhaps beene auſtere and hard vnto you.

aboue others, among the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,</hi> was the holy man <hi>Cyprian,</hi> whoſe feaſt they yearly celebrate in the moſt goodly temple of the ſame Saint a litle without the Citie. This church had the <hi>Arrian</hi> hereticks taken into their owne charge, expelling the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing away the Prieſts with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche.

With great certainety expected the <hi>Africans</hi> this promiſed euent; vtterly to ſeek when or in what ſort it were to be expected.

The reſt of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> alſo when they heard of the good ſucceſſe at <hi>Decimum,</hi> haſtning to the ſame church lightned all the tapers, and lamps; aſſiſting the Prieſts to whom the function of all ſuch things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.

               <p>OPtion after this came to <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> from <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the Emperour, that either hee ſhould come to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> together with <hi>Gilimer</hi> and the captiue <hi>Vandals,</hi> either els ſtay behind them, at his diſcretion.
