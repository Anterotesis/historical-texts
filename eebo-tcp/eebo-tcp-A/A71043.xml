            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Cry againſt Oppreſsion and Cruelty, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IF we ſhould altogethet hold our peace, and not publiſh to the World what hard meaſure we have received from ſome who are in Authority, wholly, and without any juſt occaſion given unto them, as on our parts; yet doubtleſs the righteous God who ſees and beholds all the actions of men, and will juſtly recompence for the ſame, will in his own time clear our innocency, and plead our cauſe; for whoſe ſake we ſuffer, our Conſciences bearing us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect witneſs thereunto: Yet in regard of ſome who have been informed otherwiſe concerning the cauſe of our ſufferings, then indeed it is, as though we ſuffered in our own wills, and in contempt of Authority, and as though we were againſt all good Government, when the truth is much otherwiſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to wipe off ſuch aſperſions, that ſuch as have been miſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed concerning us, may underſtand the truth; this we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in our own defence.</p>
            <p>Firſt, We are brought to deny our ſelves from following our own wills, that we might do the Will of God in every thing, who hath called us to follow peace and holineſs with all men: And this we are taught to do by that Principle which God hath placed in us, and not only in us, but in all men, which is the Light which Chriſt hath enlightened every man withal, which lets them ſee their ſin, and wherein they are ſhort in what they ought to be. This is that which we ſay will lead even all people to do as they would be done unto, and to ſeek others welfare as their own, which every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought to do; and whoſoever they be that are ſhort in theſe things, though they be called by the Name of Chriſtians, yet not doing that which the Spirit of Chriſt leads unto, which is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57477:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to ſeek others welfare as their own, and to do as they would be done by; though they may call themſelves Chriſtians, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and really they cannot be ſaid ſo to be. Many Reaſons might we give for what we have affirmed, but this is ſufficient; It is ſaid in the Scripture, That ſo many as are led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, they are the ſons of God. And we ſay, Such as are Chriſtians indeed, do, and are made partakers of Chriſt's nature. But it may be queſtioned, What is the Nature of Chriſt? Anſwer, Meekneſs and humility, and lowlineſs of ſpirit, agreeable to his own words, who ſaid, <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O that thoſe who are the cauſe of our oppreſſion for the exerciſe of our Conſciences towards the Lord, even the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God of Heaven and Earth, becauſe we fear him, and do labour to keep our Conſciences void of offence towards him: We wiſh that they and all others whoſe day of Viſitation is not quite paſt, would take diligent heed to the pure Light of Chriſt which ſhines in their hearts, and ſo come to learn of Chriſt to be as he was, that their ſouls may enter into reſt, that the Kingdom of God they may know in them, which conſiſts in peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this we do from our hearts deſire on their behalf.</p>
            <p>Another thing charged againſt us by ſome is, That we do what vve do in contempt of Authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> God vvho knovveth our hearts, can bear us vvitneſſe to the contrary, unto vvhom vve do appeal, and to his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Witneſs in every mans Conſcience, vvhich vvill let them ſee that vvhat vve do, vve do it not in contempt of Authority, but for Conſcience ſake tovvards God; and if men require that from us vvhich God doth forbid to be done, vvhether it be not better in ſuch a caſe to obey God rather than man? Let his faithful Witneſs in every mans Conſcience give an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver.</p>
            <p>Another thing charged againſt us by ſome is, That vve are againſt all good Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Unto vvhich Charge vve ſay, Nay, for vve are for a good Government, and all juſt Lavvs and juſt Magiſtrates
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57477:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we own, and do honor ſuch as do rule for God, who are a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to the evil doer, and a praiſe to them that do well; ſuch bears not the Sword in vain, ſuch anſwers the Witneſs of God in every mans Conſcience, which is juſt. But ſuch as do govern contrary to God's Witneſs in every mans conſcience, doing that which is unjuſt and unequal in the ſight of the Lord, who is juſt, and whoſe way is equal, it is ſuch as the Light doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and condemn in their own Conſciences; and ſuch as theſe we cannot own, but muſt teſtifie againſt. And if by ſuch our ſufferings be continued, we ſhall not riſe up with carnal Weapons to work our own deliverance, but patiently endure what may be further laid upon us for the Truth's ſake, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting our Cauſe unto the Lord, in whom we truſt, and do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he will in his own time deliver us by his holy Arm of Power; unto whom be praiſes, and dominion, and thankſgiving for his mercy and loving-kindneſs, who keepeth Covenant and mercy with all who truſt in him from generation to generation for ever.</p>

                  <p>Friends, The things that are required at our hands, is, to deny that which to us are the Lords Truths; the one is, Not to ſwear at all; the other is, The aſſembling our ſelves together. Rather than ſo to do, I am not here onely ready to ſuffer, but alſo to ſeal thoſe Truths with my blood, if thereunto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Judge ſaid, <hi>God forbid I ſhould ſeek your blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then we were returned back again to priſon, till the next day; in the mean time ſeveral Bills of Indictment were drawn up againſt us; for we underſtand, that before ſome of us were called for to be brought into the Court, the Judge asked the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57477:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Grand Jury whether they had any Bills againſt the Quakers? Anſwer being made by them of the Grand-Jury, They had nothing to give in againſt us. Then the Judge ordered ſome of us to be ſent for, that they hearing our Anſwers to ſuch Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions as he put forth to enſnare us, might from thence have an occaſion to draw up ſome Bills againſt us. So the Judge put them in the way how to draw up Bills againſt us, whoſe dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions they were ready to obſerve, though it tended to the enſnaring of the innocent. Several Bills being drawn up againſt us, one againſt <hi>Robert Smith</hi> in particular, and ſix more againſt the reſt of us; whereof ſome were drawn up according to the common Law, which is in French, which the Jury did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. This being done, we were all ſent for to come into the Court.</p>
               <p>We have not written theſe things out of hatred to thoſe who are the cauſe of our preſent ſufferings, but that the truth might appear, and that ſuch who have not done juſtly towards us in theſe things, may for the time to come be careful, and repent of what they have done unjuſtly againſt us, and reſolve never to do the like in time to come, leſt they feel the Lords heavy diſpleaſure, who is juſt, and whoſe Ways are Truth and Equity, and will render unto all men a reward according to their Works.</p>
               <p>The <hi>17th</hi> day of the Month we were all brought into the Court, being in number twenty four perſons, being put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Felons; <hi>Robert Smith</hi> being called to the Bar, the Bill that was found againſt him was read, which was for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to ſwear: The Clark of the Range ſpake to him as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

               <p>Whereupon the Clerk of the Arraigners ſpake to <hi>Edw. Bourn</hi> and the reſt, as followeth.</p>

                  <speaker>Clerk.</speaker>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>You ſhall have liberty to morrow to ſpeak as much as you will when you come to your tryal, but now you muſt anſwer whether you are guilty or not guilty?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I would have ſpoke. I was interrupted, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.—</p>

               <p>Then the Clerk proceeded.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Clerk.</speaker>
                  <p>E. B. <hi>what ſay you, are you guilty or not guilty?</hi>

                  <p>I am clear from many things which are charged in the indictments againſt me.</p>

                  <speaker>Clerk.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then you are not guilty.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <p>Then the next was called, the indictment being read to him.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Clerk.</speaker>
                  <p>

                  <p>That I was at <hi>Rob. Smiths</hi> was true, but that I was there at a tumultuous meeting, or to the ill example of the Kings Subjects, that I deny.</p>
                  <p>So the reſt of us being queſtioned, after the reading of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments unto them: whether they were guilty or not, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their anſwer to the ſame effect as we had done before them.</p>
                  <p>We deſired copies of our indictments, that we might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter give in our anſwers upon our further tryal, which the Judge promiſed we ſhould; but when they were to be had, we could not have two copies of them, except we would give fourteen ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings for them, therefore we choſe rather to make our defence without them, then to pay ſo dear for that which might have been writ upon one ſide of half a ſheet of paper.</p>

               <p>Then <hi>Richard Fido, William Pitt, Tho. Ball, Abraham Roberts, Gervaſe Pierſon, Abra.

                  <p>The queſtion is very difficult, there being ſome things therein true, and many things falſe.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Then that which is falſe you are not guilty of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Geoffery Raſmos</hi> was called.</p>

                  <p>I am an innocent man, where are mine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers?</p>
                  <p>The reſt of us being asked the ſame queſtions, returned anſwer to the ſame effect as the other had done before.</p>
                  <p>Then we were all returned to priſon again till our further try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, which was the next day, when ſentence was paſſed on us, as aftervvards is mentioned.</p>
                  <p>The 18. day of the 5. moneth called <hi>July,</hi> vve vvere all brought into the Court again, being placed among the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons,

                  <p>
                     <hi>This is the ſentence and judgment of the Court concerning you: You are to be out of the Kings protection, and to forfeit your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal eſtate for ever to the King, and your real eſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> during term of Life, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>The Lord gives, and if he permits to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the will of the Lord be done.</p>
                  <p>On the 21 day of the ſame moneth the Sheriff ſeiſed on the goods of <hi>Rob. Smith,</hi> and did take an account or Inventory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as much as to the Ladle, Fleſh-fork, and Links, and a basket which coſt but three farthings.</p>

                     <hi>John Price, John Townſend, James Moor, Edw.

Then the Judge ſaid we were brought before the Mayor; unto which <hi>Suſanna Pierſon</hi> anſwered, it is utterly falſe; and ſaid fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he was not a competent Witneſs, who hath ſworn as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid, and alſo becauſe he had enmity in his heart againſt us. <hi>Suſan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pierſon</hi> ſaid, the Witneſs was utterly forſworn, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured man; upon which the Judge ſaid to <hi>Suſan.</hi> Take heed what you do, for he may bring his action againſt you; and ſo inſtead of reproving the evil-doer, his hands were ſtrengthened in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falſe Witneſs. And alſo herein it doth further appear, that the Witneſſes were forſworn, becauſe they ſwore that two of our friends who were with us at the place where we were taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, were not there at that time, who were, and alſo commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to priſon with us.</p>

                  <p>Whereas it is ſaid we went to our meetings by force of arms, that is falſe, for we go innocently, and have had dirt

                  <p>
                     <hi>That is a form of Law, and it is uſed as a form, as thus, If that two or three men ſhould aſſemble at one place, contrary to the Laws of this Realm, and although they have no viſible weapons with them, yet their ſo meeting together is by force of Arms, becauſe it is contrary to the Laws; and if they do but diſturb the peace, it is by force of arms, expreſſed in all indictments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let it be conſidered how that form of Law can be good and juſt, wherein things are expreſſed otherwiſe then it is, as to ſay the People are met together by force of Arms, when the leaſt appearance of ſuch a thing cannot be found amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>We being taken away, <hi>Edw. Bourn, Geo. Knight, Tho. Jukes, Rob.

               <p>Then the Witneſſes were called to ſwear to the indictments. <hi>Edw. Bourn</hi> ſpake to the Judge.</p>

                  <p>I not being permitted to ſpeak what I deſired to the Judge, and perceiving one of the Witneſſes had ſworn falſly, as to the time of our being taken priſoners; I enquired of him when it was that we were met together?</p>

                  <p>That is not ſo, for we had been five Weeks priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners then,—Afterwards the priſoner took another Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a lye, and ſpake to him concerning what he did inform the Judge, that it was falſe alſo; whereupon the Judge ſpake as followeth:</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If it be falſe you need not ſay ſo, that is unmannerly, but you may ſay it is an untruth then.</hi>

                  <p>That which is a Lye, is a Lye, I hope in meekneſs one may ſpeak the thing as it is, I do not ſpeak it in malice;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57477:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for indeed I was there in <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

                  <p>And further it was obſerved, that the Witneſſes durſt not ſwear that we were met together as in pretence to Worſhip God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they heard nothing read or ſpoke amongſt us, which the Judge and Jury was often minded of, but we were many times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, and not permitted to ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>One of us asked the Judge, whether it was not a point in Law to make vold the indictment, when the Witneſſes had ſworn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the time?</p>

                  <p>Many queſtions were asked of us that we by anſwering might enſnare our ſelves, which we underſtand by the Laws of the Land the Judge ought not to have done, but rather to have adviſed and counſelled us how to make our defence with ſafety to our ſelves. It was a ſaying of Judge <hi>Heath,</hi> that the Laws of <hi>England</hi> were merciful Laws, and that it was the Judges duty to be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and aſſiſtant to the priſoner, rather then to enſnare them.</p>

                  <p>But give me leave to inform them with the truth. The Judge ſpake to this purpoſe following, and would not allow <hi>Rich. Fidoe</hi> to ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen of the Jury, it is true, this witneſs makes nothing againſt theſe men; yet I ſhall leave it to you, that if you as believe they did meet together under pretence of religious worſhip, you may find the Bill.</hi>

Many things more were mentioned between other Friends &amp; the Iudge tending to the purpoſe before expreſſed, which are left out; ſo we were taken away, and not permitted to ſpeak what we would, although the Iudge ſpoke otherwiſe the day before, ſaying, we ſhould have liberty to ſpeak as much as vve vvould vvhen we came to our tryal; and ſaid he would do us us all the right he could; but let the Witneſs of God in every ones Conſcience anſwer whether it vvere ſo or not.</p>
                  <p>The Iury being returned to give in their verdict, found the Bills againſt us, notwithſtanding the evidence was made void in effect, as upon the examination of the Witneſſes doth appear before-mentioned, upon our tryal.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>John Price, John Townſend</hi> were called to the Bar, with <hi>Su. Pierſon,</hi> to receive the ſentence; alſo <hi>Edw.

                  <p>We expected ſome benefit by them—Which Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions tended to the giving liberty to tender Conſciences in matters of Religion, though differing from others in opinion therein, which do not diſturb the peace of the Kingdom, which we have not done.</p>

                  <p>Well, not only our Goods and our Liberties are we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to offer up in this matter, but alſo our lives if it be requir'd</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Then after our Trial, and ſentence was paſſed on us as before is expreſſed, we were taken away &amp; brought to priſon again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with peace &amp; joy in the Lord, whoſe pure love hath largely abounded towards us; bleſſed, praiſed and magnified be his holy &amp; glorious Name above every thing, for ever; <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus ſuch as are ſober-minded may ſee what hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure we have received from ſome in Authority, only and alone for the exerciſe of a good Conſcience towards the Lord, &amp; not for any injury or wrong that we have done unto any man, the <hi>juſt</hi> God can bear us witneſs herein; and thus the Scripture is made good, being fulfilled in us, which ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt ſuffer perſecution.</hi> And as there was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration in time paſt which ſought an occaſion againſt <hi>Daniel,</hi> but could find none except it was about the matter of his God, for which cauſe they laboured with the King <hi>Darius,</hi> until they had obtained a Decree againſt him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. But remarkable is the paſſage about the ſame; for the Lord delivered <hi>Daniel,</hi> but his Enemies fell into the ſnare which they had laid for him. And though it be ſo come to paſs concerning us, that a Decree is ſealed againſt us about the matter of our God, whom we fear, and dare not but hear his voice, and obey him in what he commands us, by which we do and may ſuffer for this only

               <head>A brief account of the impriſonment and tryal of ſome more of our friends, who are Inhabitants of Worceſterſhire.</head>
               <p>UPon the 20. day of the 5. Moneth 1662. came a party of Souldiers to the Town of <hi>Perſhore,</hi> where ſome of them were peaceably aſſembled in the fear of the Lord, and lay violent hands on them, drawing them forth from the meeting, and ſome out of their houſes, and off from their own ground with their ſwords drawn, and forcing them along the ſtreets, and forced them into an houſe, not ſhowing them any order for what they did, until they had been kept ſeveral hours in the houſe, where they were cloſe detained priſoners, and their friends not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to come to them; and afterwards took them to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> ſtriking them, and giving ſome of them fore blows: Some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate people ſeeing it, deſired them to forbear ſtriking them; then they fell a ſtriking and cutting the people with their ſwords, and ſo brought them to the priſon in <hi>Worceſter</hi> without any <hi>Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the 5. and 6. days of the 6. Moneth, <hi>Ed. Hall, George Fort, Henry Gibbs,</hi> with the reſt of our friends who were taken priſoners with them at <hi>Perſhore,</hi> vvere brought before the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at the Seſſions in <hi>Worceſter</hi> to be tried vvith ſeveral other of our friends who vvere taken from their peaceable meeting being aſſembled in the fear of the Lord at <hi>Dudly</hi> in <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> at the ſame time as friends in <hi>Perſhore</hi> vvere taken, vvhoſe names are, <hi>Richard Payton, John Newcomb, Thomas Denton,</hi> and <hi>Sutton Bagley.</hi> All theſe before mentioned, vvere tried at the Seſſions then holden, being made offenders about the oath of Allegiance, becauſe they did not ſvvear, the Jury finding them guilty, though in the ſight of the Lord they are innocent from the breach of any juſt Lavv; ſentence vvas paſſed upon them, as follovveth.</p>
               <p>Richard Payton <hi>being brought into a Premunire, his perſonal eſtate was forfeited to the King for ever, and his real eſtate during term of Life, and himſelf to be out of the Kings protection, and to remain in priſon during the Kings pleaſure,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The reſt of them, <hi>viz.</hi> Ed. <hi>Hall, George Fort, Henry Gibbs, John Newcomb, Thomas Denton, Sutton Bagley, John Johnſon, William Collins,</hi> and <hi>Ed. Gibbs,</hi> vvere fined five pounds a piece, and for
