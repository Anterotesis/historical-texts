            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Have read somewhere in Monsieur <hi>Rapins</hi> Reflections <hi>Sur la Poetique,</hi> that a certain <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobleman <hi>Andrea Naugeria</hi> by Name, was wont every year to Sacrifice a <hi>Martial</hi> to the Manes of <hi>Catullus:</hi> In imitation of this frolic, a Celebrated Poet, in the Preface before his <hi>Spanish Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> is ple<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>It is not to be deny'd, but that a Poet is as unfit to manage the serious part of a Controversie, as an <hi>Irishman</hi> is to write the Miracle Part of Church History: For besides that his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity is as much to be suspected as his Iudgment; the least Thought, or extravagant Fancy, is apt to lead him a Hundred Pages out of his way, and then 'tis Ten to One, he'll lye on a Fortnight in the Advertisements of a <hi>Gazette,</hi> before he recovers
<pb facs="tcp:65204:3"/>
the Road. But then on the other hand, I think <hi>Mr. Bays</hi> ought to be Acquitted for Treating his Subject in Rhyme, (which he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Iudiciously somewhere calls the Vehicle of Nonsense) and I am clearly of Opinion, That the chief Points in Agitation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweent he Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and Vs, are so easie to be decided (if the Party concerned could but once Disingage themselves from Prejudice, Pride and Interest) that they ought not to imploy the serious part of Mankind, or put <hi>Christendom</hi> to the Expence of Convening a Council, while a Synod of Poets may better Discuss and Determine them at their own Cost and Charges. Why cannot <hi>Purgatory</hi> be as well traced out of that Famous Verse in <hi>Virgil,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Infectum eluitur scelus, aut exuritur igni,</l>
               </q>
as out of the Dreams of some few Hypocondraic Authors, and a poor single misapplyed place of Scripture, that for fear of making a Blot, like a Solitary Man at Bacgammon, wants the assistance of another Text to bind him? Or the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Supremacy be made good from that Passage,
<q>
                  <l>Imperiumque Pater Romanus habebit,</l>
               </q>
as well as out of <hi>Pasce oves meas,</hi> and the Decretal Epistles? <hi>Virgil</hi> too may be considered as a Person that lay under to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation at all of Complementing the Christians, being himself of another Perswasion; and so whatever comes from him in favour of the Catholick Tenets, is to be look'd upon with extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and veneration. And perhaps <hi>Mr. Bays,</hi> after he has for some time Consulted the Fragments of the <hi>Sibylls,</hi> and begun a little acquaintance with <hi>Rabbi Galatinus,</hi> or any of his Relations, may be able to prove that <hi>Virgil</hi> had his Notion of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Supremacy, from the very same <hi>Sybill</hi> that help'd him to the Prophecy of our <hi>Saviours</hi> Incarnation in the fourth <hi>Eclogue.</hi> Certainly that good <hi>Eastern Bishop,</hi> who at the second Council of <hi>Nice</hi> urged that Text in the First of <hi>Genesis, And
<pb facs="tcp:65204:3"/>
God made Man in his own Image,</hi> in defence of Image-worship, was a very great Poet, though from so long a Devolution of time we have lost that part of his Character; and might as well, when his hand was in, as vigorously appear'd to have Man-Midwifery declar'd to be of Divine Right, because <hi>Vulcan</hi> play'd the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, when his Old Father was Delivered of <hi>Minerva.</hi> I am heartily sorry that this Iudicious Prelate had not the good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to live in our Age, where he might have made a more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Figure, and convers'd with Two able Disputants, exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his own Temper and Constitution, <hi>the Oxford Editor,</hi> and the <hi>Worthy Convert of Putney.</hi> I observe, that as there are two sorts of Prologues in the <hi>Rehearsal,</hi> the one Composed <hi>in Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorem,</hi> to frighten the Audience into Civility and good Manners, by Huffing and Railing at them; the other Imbellish'd with kind Language, and some pretty Surprizing Thought or other, in order to Steal and Insinuate into your Favour: So likewise the Modern <hi>Polemics</hi> have pitch'd upon Two different ways to reduce Vs, for either we are Accosted with such kind of Complements as these; <hi>Have a Care what you do Gentlemen, you are got within the Territories of Heresie and Sacriledge, and you had as good Ride your Horses full Gallop in a Coney-Warren, as continue in a Country where nothing but utter Ruine and Desolation can attend you:</hi> Or else the Scene is alter'd, and some humble Accommodator hangs out the White Flag, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses milder Conditions; <hi>Well Countrymen, there have been ill offices done on both sides; we have been misrepresented to you, and you have laboured under as bad a Character amongst our party; a little Christian compliance will set all matters streight again. Your Authors and ours are agreed well enough in the main; and therefore let us sacrifice half a dozen troublesome ill-natur'd distinctions to the Peace of mankind:</hi> But first we desire you of all loves to lock up that troublesome companion call'd Reason, for one quarter of a year, and if you could but prevail with your self to discard your five Senses, the business would be presently at an end. Of the two late Converts abovementioned, that have listed themselves in the
<pb facs="tcp:65204:4"/>
Service of the <hi>Western Patriarch,</hi> one has published a specious Treatise, to prove that the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> are agreed in their Notions of a Real Presence; the other pretends, That the <hi>Catholick Doctoas,</hi> and the <hi>Jewish Rabbies,</hi> are likewise agreed in the business of Transubstantiation: Indeed, after this rate of arguing they may very easily prove their Church to be Vniversal; which thing if rightly considered, I am confident will bring above three parts of the Globe into the <hi>Popes</hi> Chamber of Dependencies. I know there are some Malicious Persons in the World, who are apt to conclude, That this calling in the Gentlemen of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision to the Assistance of the Catholick Cause, is a very plain that they dare not hazard the fortune of a set Battel upon their own Forces: That Prince is in no good circumstances at home, who is obliged to employ an inveterate Foreigner to support his Dignity; and we have read (say they) how the <hi>Christians</hi> have taken the condition of the <hi>Holy Land</hi> into their consideration, have unanimously fought, and recovered it out of the hands of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,</hi> but we never hear to this day that the <hi>Jews</hi> retaliated the kindness, or gave 'em any thanks for their pains. The truth on't is, men that are disposed to talk, will, in spight of all the World, say what they please, tho they are sure to be as trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some as a <hi>Welshman</hi> when the Spirit of Genealogy possesses him: But I pray why may not a man that has kept <hi>Rabbi Solomon Iarchi, Ben Sira, Ben Manasses,</hi> and the rest of the Tribe, in Meat, Drink, Washing and Lodging, at his own proper Expence some Twenty Years, be as well allow'd upon an emergent occasion to draw them out in Battel-array, to confound us <hi>Protestants,</hi> as a Neighbour of ours on the other side the Water to call in the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> to humble the <hi>Emperour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I find this Speculation has occasion'd me to digress farther than I intended: therefore to return to Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> I must make bold to acquaint him, That of all men in the World he ought not to have interested himself in the quarrel, whatever his private sentiments were, since he had so publicly, and so virulently expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that party before. If he pretends he took his copy from <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobius,</hi> who was obliged to write his Learned Treatise <hi>Contra
<pb facs="tcp:65204:4"/>
Gentes,</hi> to satisfie the Christians, who somewhat doubted the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of his Conversion, that he had in good earnest quitted <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganism,</hi> much good may it do him. But I am afraid this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance won't do his business, for, I suppose, had <hi>Arnobius</hi> stood charged with half those scandalous ill things, which Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> is like to answer for, his admission into the Church had not been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased at the easie terms of libelling his old Friends, and Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that, which is lighter than the Honesty of a Bawd, the Chastity of a Midwife, the Valour of an Atheist, the Honour of a Pimp, the Integrity of an Vsurer, <hi>even a Poets Reputation.</hi> But I find a man may hold all the seven deadly sins in <hi>Commendam</hi> with a Saintship; and that there is a certain Society of men in the World, who to fill up their Numbers against the next Muster, make no scruple at all of entertaining such kind of Proselytes, as <hi>Romulus</hi> picked up when he opened his <hi>Asylum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Bays</hi> in his Life of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> occasionally discoursing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Report that <hi>Seneca</hi> Cuckolded his Patron <hi>Claudius,</hi> is very sorry that <hi>Petronus Arbiter</hi> was not the man, because he could better have bore it from a man of his Character (for you must know, <hi>Petronus Arbiter</hi> was a Poet, and consequently the fitter Person for such a business) and he can conceive nothing in the World next to an Elephant upon Stilts, so awkard in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of an Amour as a Philosopher in a Gown. The Truth on't is, Divines and Philosophers never had a good word from Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> since his Mother bound up his Head for him. Here was the finest opportunity imaginable for a Philosopher to have made his Market, The old Gentleman gone abroad to smoke a Pipe among his TÃ¨<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, the Lady consenting, the happy hour of Assignation come, the Chamber-maid upon duty at the door, the Sheets perfumed, the Curtains drawn, the trusty Brandy-bottle at the Beds-head: Nothing in the World, one would have thought, could have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated and spoil'd so promising, so hopeful an intrigue. But O the Fates! just in the Critical minute appears Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> forbids the banet, turns the poor Philosopher, with his Breeches dangling about his heels, down stairs; and in that surly humour nothing would serve his turn, but a Poet only must Cuuckold the Emperour.
<pb facs="tcp:65204:5"/>
Now to apply this story to Mr. <hi>Bays;</hi> as he seems concerned for his friend <hi>Petronius,</hi> that he had not the good fortune to be engaged in the affair we were now discoursing of, so I am sorry with all my heart, that since Mr. <hi>Bays</hi>'s Stars so order'd the matter, as to condemn him to the drudgery of Writing everlastingly, that instead of barren Controversie (which is not a province so capable of being cultivated by a Poet as other provinces are) he had not either set himself upon reforming the Anthems of his own Church, which exceedingly want such a charitable hand as his to Revise 'em; or employ'd his Talent in Spiritual Madrigals to good Saint <hi>Wilgefortis,</hi> or <hi>Apollonia,</hi> (who might perhaps have remembred him for it in a fit of the Tooth-ach) or lastly,
<q>
                  <l>Since he is read in Cares,</l>

that in his Old Age he had not chosen out for him self <hi>some peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Province in Acrostick Land</hi>: I make bold here to use his own Expression in <hi>Mac Flecno,</hi> if it is his I say; for <hi>Mr. Shadwell</hi> in the Preface before his Translation of the Tenth Satyr in <hi>Juvenal,</hi> has been lately pleas'd to acquaint the World, that he publickly disown'd the Writing of it, with as solemn imprecations as his friend the <hi>Spanish Fryar</hi> did the Cavalier <hi>Lorenzo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For to Deal Honestly with <hi>Mr. Bays,</hi> however in his other Composures he has obliged the World with the Delicacy of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and the Agreeableness of his Fancy; yet in his last Essay we only find such novel kind of Discourse between the <hi>Hind and Panther,</hi> as passes between the two Iudicious Grave-makers in <hi>Hamlet</hi>: In short, we meet nothing but a dull heap of Insipid stuff, so lamentably Ridiculous, that one could not in conscience desire to have an Adversary write worse: so that whatever advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages his Soul has made by the exchange of his Religion (though I wonder in my heart how that queasy stomach of his, which about <note place="margin">
                  <hi>See the Preface before the</hi> Religio Laici.</note> four years ago could hardly digest the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> Creed, should now be able to digest not only that, and <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s Creed, but a
<pb facs="tcp:65204:5"/>
more unpalatable one of <hi>Pope Pius</hi>'s making) his <hi>Muse</hi> I am sure is sensibly the worse. Were I his Confessor, who am only his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viser, I should prescribe him no other Pennance for every Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, than to make me a Copy of such miserable Doggerel <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties quoties,</hi> which I believe would be Mortification enough for him; and the reading of them, I'm sure would be sufficient Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to my self. But after all, perhaps <hi>Mr. Bays</hi> writ for the <hi>Irish</hi> Nation, and then he's to be excused, for he that writes to please the relish of that Noble Kingdom, must do the same by his Wit and Language, as <hi>Valerius Poplicola</hi> did with his House, even level it to the ground.</p>
            <p>I met the other day a certain passage in <hi>Monsieur Montaign</hi>'s Essays, which I little imagin'd to have found in an Author of his Gravity; he is pleased to be angry with Carvers and Statuaries, for making the nudities of their Images so large: for (says he) the Ladies who form an Idea of the Abilities of Mankind by such exterior representations, must certainly find themselves extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disappointed, when they come to consult the Originals. This so strange a passage, as I said before, one wou'd scarce expect to meet in <hi>Montaign</hi>; and indeed, with respect to the memory of so great a man, it is extravagant enough in all conscience. But <hi>Mr. Bays</hi> in his Preface, before the second part of the late <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Printed by</hi> Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. <hi>1685.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Miscellanies,</hi> has as much out done this, and any thing that was ever said in the World, as a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe of his own begetting, <hi>Almanzor</hi> by name, has exceeded all the Bullies before him. On one side of the page, he appears with extraordinary Zeal for the Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Soul. <hi>What considering Person</hi> (says he) <hi>who observes how Fools and Knaves batten in the World, while men of Merit and Integrity</hi> (meaning himself I suppose) <hi>starve and are despised, can suppose that there are not allowances to be made in another?</hi> That is, because <hi>Mr. Bays</hi> missed of his <hi>Eaton</hi>-preferment, he was humbly content to expect his reward elsewhere; and truly I am so much of his Opinion, as to think he is to expect it in another World: On the other side of the Leaf, as if his <hi>Petronius Arbiter</hi> had got the Weather-gage of <hi>Thomas
<pb facs="tcp:65204:6"/>
a Kempis,</hi> he makes you a very formal Apology for Translating a certain luscious part of <hi>Lucretius</hi> (he could not find in his heart, he tells you, to give it a worse name) though some people are apt to believe it ought only to keep company with <hi>Culpeppers</hi> Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, or the <hi>English</hi> Translation of <hi>Aloysia Sigea.</hi> If <hi>Mr. Bays</hi> would have been rul'd by me, that very moment when he fell from the highest step of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, and from a grave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Eternity could on the sudden condescend and truckle to the Patronage of down-right obscenity; he should not have made so small a leap on't, as to have vaulted over the little <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicon</hi> that parts the Reformed Churches, and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (for that had been too inconsiderable a performance for a man of his Agility) but have gone over in good earnest to <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi> Church, who makes that business he so pathetically there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes, one of the chiefest rewards for his Disciples in the next World: And who knows but this may come to pass, things were not brought to an extremity when I left the Story. The worthy Gentlemen that have set him upon the Heroick design of writing the <hi>Hind and Panther</hi> (for I must beg <hi>Mr. Bays</hi>'s pardon if I am so unmannerly as not to believe every thing he says in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face) have so far secured him to their Party, that he cannot in honour return to the Protestant Territories; they have cut off all hopes of a retreat from him; the back doors are shut, but the passage before is open enough, and the way to <hi>Meccha</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> as easie to be found as ever; and I dare lay a wager that <hi>Mr. Bays</hi> is too much a Poet, not to pass the same judgment of his newest choice in Religion, as of his newest Plays, that the last is always the best.</p>
            <p>To draw now to an end, <hi>Mr. Bays</hi> I hear has lately complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Wills Coffee-house,</hi> of the ill usage he has met in the World: that whereas he had the generosity and assurance to set his own name to his late piece of <hi>Polemick</hi> Poetry, yet others who have pretended to answer him, wanted the breeding and civility to do the like. Now because I would not willingly disoblige a person of <hi>Mr. Bays</hi>'s Character, I do here fairly, and before all the World, assure him that my Name is <hi>Dudly Tomkinson,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:65204:6"/>
that I live within Two Miles of <hi>St. Michaels</hi> Mount in <hi>Cornwall</hi> and have in my time been both <hi>Constable, Church-Warden,</hi> and <hi>Overseer</hi> of the Parish, by the same token that the little Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery next the Belfry, the new Motto about the Pulpit, the Kings Arms, the Ten Commandments, and the great Sun dial in the Church-yard, will transmit my name to all Posterity. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more (if it will do him any good at all) I can make a pretty shift to read without Spectacles, wear my own Hair, which is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what inclining to Red, have a large Mole on my left Cheek, am mightily troubled with Corns, and what is peculiar to my consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, after half a dozen Bottles of <hi>Claret,</hi> which I generally carry home every night from the Tavern; I never fail of a stool or two next morning: besides I use to smoke a Pipe every day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dinner, and afterwards steal a Nap for an hour or two in the old Wicker-chair near the Oven, take gentle Purgatives spring and fall; and it has been my custom any time these sixteen years (as all the Parish can testifie) to ride in <hi>Gambadoes.</hi> Nay, to win the heart of him for ever, I invite him here before the Courteous Reader to a Country Regale (provided he will before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand promise not to Debauch my Wife) where he shall have Sugar to his Roast-beef, and Vinegar to his Butter; and lastly, to make him amends for the tediousness of the Iourney, a parcel of Relicks to carry home with him, which I believe can scarce be matched in the whole <hi>Christian</hi> World; but because I have no great fancy that way, I don't care if I part with them to so worthy a Person: they are as followeth.</p>

            <p>The Ioynt-stool that <hi>St. Christophers</hi> Barber stood upon when he shaved him. Now to satisfie Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> of the necessity the
<pb facs="tcp:65204:7"/>
Barber had to make use of a Ioynt-stool in this affair, and that it was no foolish, malapert or arrogant humour in the Barber so to do, he is to understand that St. <hi>Christopher,</hi> if he were alive, could have drunk the Monument full of Mum for his mornings draught, with as much ease as the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Divines swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the Covenant; and if he wont believe me on my word, let him e'ne ride his Horse to <hi>Paris,</hi> and if St. <hi>Kits</hi> Statue in the <hi>Nostre Dame</hi> do not convince him of his error, I will give him free leave to swear before any Iustice of Peace that I am the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Author of the <hi>Letter to the Dissenter.</hi>

If Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> should quarrel with the Handle, by reason of its <hi>Pagan</hi> extraction, he is to be informed that a certain Author, who has lately obliged the World with a learned discourse concerning the Catacombs at <hi>Rome,</hi> has demonstrated that worse Reliques, in all probability, are adored and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped every day in his <hi>Mother Church.</hi>

               <p>As for the Tavern, I desire to be excused, I seldom appear at such unsanctify'd places; you might as soon Cajole the Plain-dealer into <hi>Westminster-hall,</hi> a Fanatick into a Play-house, or an Usurer into a Sureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as perswade me into a Tavern. Alas!

               <p>This renouncing of your Wine, Friend <hi>Bays,</hi> is a greater wonder to me, than the renouncing of your Religion; and I can scare fancy thee to be the same person thou wast formerly.</p>

               <p>Why, truly Gentlemen, I dare not say of my self, that I am the same individual-man I was some years ago; for let me tell you, Matter is in a perpetual Flux, and the whole Mass both of Accidents and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance are thrust away by the continual Succession of new ones. Now, as I have not one drop of the same Blood, nor one Particle of the same Clay about me which I had then, so I thank my Stars, I have not the least Tincture of that Religion left behind, which engaged my former state of Ignorance; that state I mean, which I may more properly call the <note n="*" place="margin">Ded.

                  </note> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis of my Life, than that wherein I was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Noble Lord to whom I dedicated my <hi>Limberham.</hi>

               <p>Faith, little <hi>Bays,</hi> I am so much of thy Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to believe that after so many changes thou hast as well shifted the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65204:8"/>
Christian as the man; and I am perswaded, we shall have more Religions contend for thee, after thou art dead and rotten, than Citys strove for the birth of a certain person of your own profession; from whose <hi>Achilles,</hi> you'd needs perswade the World that you copy'd the fierce <hi>Almanzor.</hi> I am told, your friends of <hi>Dukes Place,</hi> expect the next change you make should be to their Party, which I suppose may be the more easily effected, unless you are bribed beforehand by a Chiaux with the government of a <hi>Turkish</hi> Hospital, because two of their best Kings, and most of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were Poetically given; and I see no reason, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> after you have traded somewhat longer in Parable, and Allegory, but that you may step in among their Minor Prophets.</p>

               <p>O Sir, your Servant; But I'll allow men of your Perswasion to be Scurrillous, 'tis the distinguishing Character of your Church; and I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect e're long, your <hi>Bear-garden,</hi> and <hi>Bartholomew-Fair</hi> Men, will arrive to such a pitch of Brutality and Irreligion, as to discuss their Assemblies with an <hi>Ite Missa est.</hi>

You cannot imagine what a Mortification it is for a noble Author, who has, at the great expence of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65204:8"/>
his fancy, writ something which is vigorous and fine, to have his Song tagg'd with half a dozen gouty Stanza's, by a <hi>Grub-street</hi>-hand, then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced into a Ballad; and last of all, plaister'd up in a Country Ale-house, to confront the five Senses, and the four Seasons of the year.</p>

               <p>You may believe me Sir, 'tis one of the greatest afflictions in the World, for I have had most of my best words so served; and therefore if your friend finds him inclined to write, there are several places of <hi>Casimire, Urban,</hi> and <hi>Scribonius,</hi> that deserve his consideration. Oh! there's an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram in <hi>Scribonius,</hi> which I could repeat forty times a day, and never be weary on't; the subject so divine, the language so excellent, the thought so noble,

               <p>Faith Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> this, as you say, is the most surprizing secret imaginable. And now to return you one secret for another, I believe if this secret were communicated to the World, it would ruine the Ensuring Office, to all intents and purposes: For who the Devil wou'd give Money to have his Houses Ensured, and the Uuiversal Burnfire so nigh? But prithee, little <hi>Bays,</hi> tell me how you came by this Secret?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, you perfectly overwhelm your humble Servant with kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. But to proceed to the Relationâ€”You are to understand that in the year 1685. some three weeks before my Conversionâ€”</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Hold Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> were you no Christian at all before that time? What had become of your immaterial part, if you had dropt off before this late Conversion?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Lost assuredly, and in as wretched a condition as the poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman that wou'd have begged a little Small-beer of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Why then, I find Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> you have more Charity for the Heathens than most of your fellow Christians; for in a certain piece of yours, which shall be nameless, but may easily be known by a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able passage in the Preface, that says, you believe a <hi>Popish</hi> Plot: in this piece of yours, I say, you make no question at all of a Heathens Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, provided he live but up to the Principles of Nature.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>So I say still; but where did you ever find a <hi>Protestant,</hi> or a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan,</hi> live up to the sober Principles of Nature?
<q>
                     <l>The Iolly <hi>Luther,</hi> reading him, began</l>

                  </q>
But all this while we are beside our Storyâ€”and therefore, to begin it again, you must know that at the time above-mention'd, it was my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to go down the River as far as <hi>Greenwich,</hi> with some honest <hi>Irish</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of my acquaintance.</p>

               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Under favour Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> how durst you hazard your self among any of that Nation, since you had put so gross an affront upon them, in a certain <hi>Oxford</hi> Prologue?
<q>
                     <l>
                        <note place="margin">

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Truly, Sir, if I had said half so much of the <hi>Dear Ioys</hi> as this amounts to, I should have been as loath to have trusted my self in <hi>Irish</hi> Company, as I should be now to trust my only Bottle of <hi>Vsquebah</hi> with an <hi>Irish</hi> Servant.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Trust my self, quoth a! I perceive Mr. <hi>Eugenius,</hi> your friend <hi>Crites,</hi> is very ignorant in these affairs. Why, Lord Sir! No man that is acquainted with me, thinks the better of himself for my commending him, nor ought, I'm sure, to think himself a farthing the worse for my Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pooning him: Did you think I could have flatter'd so many quibbling, overgrown Lords, as I have done in my time, or have Libell'd so many honourable Persons of both Sexes, from whom I never received the least disobligement: And mean all really? No, noâ€” When I commend any body, it is either a little foolish Interest, or the gayety of my Humour, that inclines me to it: And when I touch upon the Coast of Satyr, 'tis not, I vow to Gad, out of any Malice (for a true Poet, like a true Jilt, is neither acted by real love, nor real anger) but only, as they say, Dr. <hi>Busby</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:65204:9"/>
sometimes whips his Boys at <hi>Westminster,</hi> for my Health Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> and the purging of Choler.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>I find then Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> the passing of an Illnatured Jest upon a man, is much like the passing away a bad Half-crown at a Tavern; you don't do it out of any particular spleen to the House, but only to shut your hands of a cumbersome piece. Bu<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, pray did not you mean really when you made that noble Panegyrick to <hi>Oliver Cromwel?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Not I, I protest to you Sir, 'twas my own advantage I consider'd, and not any kindness to the person which inflamed me; for you must note, 'tis much the same case with us Poets, as 'tis with the <hi>Iews,</hi> no sooner can a Heroe start up in any part of the World (let his quarrel be right or wrong) but both of us are apt to think him the Messias, and presently pitch upon him as the fittest person to deliver the Twelve Tribes, and the Nine Muses out of Captivity.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Then let me tell you, the Usurper was the less beholding to you<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> but methinks whatever your sentiments were of the man, you had a great kindness for your Subject: You spoke as many lofty things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, as any occasion you ever handled in your life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>That may be. But always observe this as an infallible rule, from your friend <hi>Bays!</hi> If you write Panegyric, tho you have done your utmost, and said ten times more than the person deserves, be sure to tell him that you have not passed through half the inventory of his Vertues, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Genius to manage so extraordinary an affair to any advantage. But if you Lampoon any party, forget not to make them sensible of the civil usage they have received from your hands; as your City Tradesmen, when they have exacted double the price of any commodity, stick not to tell you they have used you kindly: And though your stock is all exhausted, and you cou'd not say one malicious word more to save your life, yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that you cou'd go ten mile further, if you pleas'd to continue in that surly humour.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Why then, I tell you Sir, that the world would be very uncivil I<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>gad, and all that; if the World should offer to question the Sincerity of an Author who makes so open and so free a discovery of his own abilities. For between our selves, Gentlemen, I think an Authors bare word in his Preface, as Sacred as a Peers attestation upon his honour, and ought no more to be disputed than the Traditions of the Church, or the Priviledges of Parliament.</p>

               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>

               <p>How escaped you a hanging Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> you that have been so universal an Aggressor? Methinks the least that could be done to you, had been to have sent you a grazing to <hi>Malmsbury</hi> Common, among some of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s well-bred Citizens.</p>

               <p>A little private discipline I have met with I must confess; an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manac or so beaten into my Bones, but that's nothing at all to a man of a true passive constitution. But, as I told you before, no man of tollerable sense thinks either the worse of me or of himself, for having his name ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in any of my Satyrs; and that's the reason why so few people give themselves the unnecessary trouble to batter my Tabernacle. I bless my Genius for it, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> I have not that respect for any person breathing, as to lose a good thought for his sake; and I have almost as strong inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to suffer Martyrdom for my Wit as for my Religion: 'Tis the love to the jest, not any private picque to the man, that sets me upon such ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous undertakings, as Prentices on a <hi>Shrove-Tuesday,</hi> use to demolish Bawdy-houses, tho they have not the least disrespect to those noble places of pleasure and convenience. I have insisted upon this point the more largely, because I wou'd once for all, undeceive the world as to this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; and let them know, that a man may possibly lash three parts of the Creation with his Pen, who at the same time has not the least grudge or quarrel to any individual person thereof.â€” And now worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, if you please to afford me the hearing, I will recount my triumphs

               <p>No I can assure you Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> for I ever thought a Poet as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and unlikely a man to subdue Kingdoms with his Sword, as Convert Kingdoms with his Arguments.

               <p>Oh Sir, there was a great deal of reason for it; for much about that time, Mr. <hi>Eugenius,</hi> a certain <hi>Staffordshire</hi> Gentleman was pleased to Dedicate to me a very Ingenious <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Blunts Religio Laici.</hi>
                  </note> Book, I vow to Gad, in which Dedication, after several other Complements, he tells me that Monsieur <hi>Rapin,</hi> one of the greatest Criticks of this Age, had studied <hi>English</hi> on purpose to learn my Poems: Now this I thought was such a particular condescension, such an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary sign of respect shown to me and my works, that I found my self obliged in Conscience to speak all the tender pretty things I cou'd in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the <hi>French</hi> Nation. But when, after a long run, I was given to understand that it was only a complement of my Friend, and that Monsieur <hi>Rapin</hi> was not furnished with <hi>English</hi> enough to qualifie him for a City-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencers Secretary, or an Accomptant to a Mackarel-boat, I presently reassum'd my old temper, and gave the Messieurs no quarter at all, as may appear by a thousand passages since, too numerous to be cited at present: Nay, to pursue my malice to the utmost extremity, I prevailed with my acquaintance at this end of the Town to wear Shoulder-knots no longer, to discard the janty Cravat-string, and the ceremonious Muff, and what was the hardest case of all, I absolutely refus'd to naturalize one word that was of <hi>French</hi> extraction for the space of two years. The next that comes upon the Stage is the melancholly <hi>Spaniard,</hi> with a stride and a stand, like a Peacock in a backside; and the truth on't is, tho I ought to have shown him some civility for that divine, that immortal invention of making Snuff, yet when my hand is in, I neither spare friend nor foe; and I have not only maul'd the poor Don with the Quarter-staff of Prose, but also with the Back-Sword of Verse;

And now, because it would be a very unkind, not to say an uncivil part, in Madam <hi>Conscience</hi> to loyter, and squander away her time here amongst Mortals, when her Cousin-german <hi>Virtue</hi> was gone to better quarters in another World, I get a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> for her also, but at the same time was so civil to the modest Virgin, as to allow her the liberty of leaving a Reverend old Gentlewoman, <hi>Interest</hi> by name, to do her drudgery, and supply her place in her absence, which I gad I think she does every whit as well, if not better.

               <p>With all my heart Mr. <hi>Crites.</hi> Now there being but three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable places in the whole Island, that is the two Universities, and the great Metropolitan City; I shall consequently confine my discourse only to them: But first of all, I must tell you, that I am altogether of my Lord <hi>Plausibles</hi> Opinion in the Plain-dealer; If I chance to commend any place or order of men out of pure friendship, I choose to do it before their Faces; and if I have occasion to speak ill of any person or place, out of a principle of respect and good manners, I do it behind their backs. You cannot imagine Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> when I visit either of the two Universities in my own person, or by my Commissioners of the Play-house, how much I am taken with a Colledge-life. Oh there's nothing like a Cheese cut out into farthings; and my Lord Mayor amidst all his brutal City-luxury, does not dine half so well as a Student upon a single Chop of Rotten-roasted Mutton; nay, I can scarce prevail with my self for a month or two after to eat my meat on a Plate, so great a respect have I for a University-Trencher; and then their Conversation is so learned, and withal so inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, that I could sit a whole day together at a Coffee-house to hear them dispute about <hi>Actus perspicui,</hi> and <hi>Forma misti.</hi> From this beginning I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally fall a railing at <hi>London,</hi> with as much zeal as a <hi>Buckingbam-shire</hi> Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier who had his Pockets pick'd at a <hi>Smith-field</hi> entertainment, or a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Lady whose obsequious Knight has spent his estate among Misses,

               <p>With all my heart, for you cannot impose me a more grateful province than to recount my past labours, and acquaint you from what inconsiderable beginnings I aspired to my present Grandeur and Dignityâ€”In the first place, after some years spent in the University, I quitted all my preferment there to come and reside at the Imperial City, because it was likely to prove a Scene of more advantage and business, by reason of the great resort of strangers to it, and likewise because it was the fittest place in the whole Island for a Monarch to settle his Court, issue out orders for his Subjects at home, and entertain a commerce with his Allys abroad. At first I struggled with a great deal of persecution, took up with a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which had a Window no bigger than a Pocket-Looking-glass, Dined at a Three-penny Ordinary enough to starve a Vocation Taylor, kept little Company, went clad in homely Drugget, and drunk Wine as seldom as a <hi>Rechabite,</hi> or the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s Confessor. Much about this time Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> as you may very well remember, I made my first addresses in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyric to <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> and that puissant Usurping <hi>Phocas</hi> had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conferr'd the Title of Oecumenical Universal Poet upon me, if a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest had not hurried him out of the World before his time.â€”</p>

               <p>Refus'd it! No, not I'gad: I beg your parder Sir, a better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by far than your self was glad to accept the same Title from a worse hand, no dispraise to the Protectors, by the same token that his Successors have the grace to keep it to this present minute. Being unfortunately dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of my hopes in this place, I tack'd about with the times, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed my self to the Almighty Grandees at Court, flatter'd Lords whom no body else would flatter, but especially made it my business to win the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Ladies, who I knew had the disposal of their Husbands; and consequently would prove sure Cards in time of need. Finding some little encouragement here, and resolving to weather all storms that might happen, I began to reform the Theatre, and restore it (as I gave out) to its Primitive Splendour and Purity, receiv'd the appeals of my younger Brethren of the Stage, Coyned Heroes as fast as <hi>Brumingham</hi>-Groats, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To prevent, Sir, all storms that might have issued from that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I presently set me up an <hi>Index expurgatorious,</hi> by the virtue of which I so castrated these grave Old-fashioned Gentlemen, so disguised their true features by putting them in modern apparel, that upon the Stage, few, very few I'gad, could distinguish their works from my own proper Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate productions. Then I fulminated <hi>Iohnsons</hi> affected Style, his dull way of making Love, his Thefts and mean Characters: <hi>Shakespears</hi> Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, long Periods, and Barbarous Language: <hi>Fletchers</hi> want of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans Education; so often, you do observe me Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> that scarce one in a hundred had the assurance to offer one good word in their behalf. Having made these advances, I proceeded to Censure the living Poets with greater vigour and severity, acquainted the world with the nullity of their Ordination, and at the same time, published a <hi>manifesto</hi> wherein I declar'd that the right of Investiture, with a Playhouse Jilt and a Bottle, solely and wholly belonged to my self; that it should be lawful for a Poet to keep his Whore, but whosoever offer'd to marry, should <hi>ipso facto,</hi> forfeit his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance from the Theatre. That all the world besides lay under a mistake, but only Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> was in the right. That the Stage had two great lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> and Mr. <hi>Batterton,</hi> to enlighten it, but that Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> was just as much bigger than Mr. <hi>Batterton,</hi> as the Sun is bigger than the Moon, Finally, I owned my self to be <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Vicar here upon Earth, and <hi>Homer</hi>'s Successor in the ancient and unerring See of <hi>Parnassus.</hi> That the decrees of Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> ought to be observed with the same deference as the decrees of <hi>Apollo.</hi> That all other Writers were to be judged by Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> was only accountable for his mistakes to <hi>Apollo</hi> himself. And then I threatned to suspend all those Poets from Stew'd Prunes, Wine, Fire and Tobacco; nay, to confine them <hi>durante vita,</hi> to Temperance, Sobriety, and no Fornication, who should presume to convene any Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in <hi>Grub-street</hi> without my order, or appeal from my Sentence to <hi>Aristotle, Longinus,</hi> or any other person whatsoever.</p>

Furthermore, to prevent all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their errors, I directed my Monitory Letters to the Sieur <hi>Batterton,</hi> advising him to keep no correspondence, either directly or indirectly, with those aforesaid Apostates from Sense and Reason; adding, that in case of neglect, I wou'd certainly put the Theatre under an interdict, send a Troop of Dragoons from <hi>Drury-lane</hi> to demolish his Garrison in <hi>Salisbury-Court</hi>; and absolve all his Subjects, even the Sub-Deacons and Acolyths of the Stage; his trusty Door-keepers and Candle-lighters from their Oaths of Fealty and Allegiance.

Thus in my Life of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> when it lay in my power either to have wav'd the business, or at one words speaking, to have made as good a Christian of that Reverend Philosopher as ever lived; and I might easily have prevailed with good St. <hi>Ierome</hi> to set his hand to the Affidavit (for you must know that honest Father inserted a worse man, the Cuckold-maker <hi>Seneca</hi> by name, into his Catalogue) yet I'gad, I make him, in spight of his Teeth, to continue in his old <hi>Pagan</hi> perswasion, and present him with half a dozen objections against the Christian Religion, which I'm sure will never relish as long as the World stands, with a Philosophers critical palate. Thus also in the Conquest of <hi>Mexico,</hi> a foolish freak took me in the head, and I must make not only the <hi>Indian</hi> Priest, and <hi>Montezuma</hi> himself (who was in truth a very illiterate Prince) but even some of his Courtiers (who are a sort of men you know that seldom trouble themselves either with the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative or Practick part of Religion) so confound the <hi>Spanish</hi> Chaplain and the rest of his Countrymen, that they were forced in the Fifth Act, when other methods fail'd, to betake themselves to the Infallible Arguments of the Rack, in order to make the Emperour and his Priest set their hands to the Apostles Creed, and the Popes Supremacy.</p>

But to pursue the business in hand, the very same Spirit of Contradiction I was mentioning before, seiz'd me when I undertook to clear <hi>Miltons</hi> Paradice of Weeds, and garnish that noble Poem with the additional beauty and soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Rhyme. He, like a blind buzzard as he was, makes <hi>Adam</hi> perform his addresses so ungracefully, introduces him discoursing so unlike a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, with that negligence of Language, and stupidity of Spirit, that I'gad, you'd pitty his condition. And then for <hi>Eve,</hi> as he has drawn her

Character, she talks so like an insipid Country House-keeper, whose know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge goes no farther than the Still or the Dairy, who is as little acquainted with the tenderness of passion, as the management of an Intreague, that one cannot choose but wonder at it. Now when I came to fall upon this work, I was resolved to bestow a little good breeding upon our first Parents, to shew them the Gallantry of a Court, and the Discipline of an Academy, to give them a turn or two in the <hi>Mall,</hi> and the Galleries at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> to entertain 'em with a Play in the Kings Box at the Theatre, and afterwards with a fashionable Oglio at <hi>Lockets</hi> or the Blue-Posts, that so they might be prevail'd with to leave the contemptible frugality of feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Sallads, and shake off all that Clownish rust which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in a former Education. For this reason. Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> I have made that great Grand-mother of ours, discourse after another rate then she did before; she talks of love as feelingly as a Thrice-married Widdow, yet rails at marriage with the same concern as if she had seen the misfortunes of half her Daughters; tells her Gallant that it was the Practice of all his Sex to decoy poor Innocent Maids with sham stories of their Passion; and that he'd be as apt to forget her after the enjoyment was over, as a Sharper of the Town forgets the last friend he borrowed money of: In fine, she discourses of Flames, Darts and Transports, of the performances of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and the Fatality of Matrimony, (though God knows, the poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman had no occasion to understand them before) with as much familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as the Emperour <hi>Montezuma</hi> discourses of the Sea, who had scarce seen or heard of a puddle greater than a Horse-pond in all his life time. And then as for <hi>Adam,</hi> I have put my self to the charges of giving him a year or two's running at the University, made him as well acquainted with all the arguments of the <hi>Supralapsarians,</hi> as a Justices Clark is with all the She-traders in his Masters Dominions: So that when the Arch-angel <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi> came to pay him a visit at his Summer-house, he presently engages him before the second course was remov'd, in the Mysterious Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie about Freewill, Proposes Mediums, solves Objections, tells his guest that his Major was open enough to let a whole Shoul of <hi>Arminians</hi> in at the Breeches; that his Minor would not hold water; and sometimes I'gad, in plain downright English, assures him that his inferences had no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the premises, than the Alcoran to the Four Evangelists.</p>

               <p>That will do very well Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> to recover his lost reputation with the reader, and no question on't, but it will go a great way to encline him to better thoughts of your repentance: Put prethee little <hi>Bays,</hi> may I make so bold as to enquire the reason why you are so great an enemy to Freewill?

               <p>I must give you the same answer to this question, as a Country-Physician gave a friend of mine, who came to enquire of him how he cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himself of his last Ague; for you must note, that this same Blunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buss, by some accident or other, had dropt upon a right medicine: No Sir (said he) I beg your pardon, for I am under an obligation never to disclose the secret to any person breathing, but if you are so lucky as to name the true remedy, for our old acquaintance sake, I'll not conceal it from you. Is it (says the Gentleman) <hi>Octabis Hilarii? No I protest:</hi> Why then, I'll lay all that I'm worth in the World, continues he, that it is <hi>Quindena Paschae. Neither is it that upon my life, but for your comfort, it is something as like</hi> Quindena Paschae <hi>as may be; nay, to satisfie you farther in the case,</hi> Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena Paschae <hi>is one of the chief Ingredients.</hi> In like manner Mr. <hi>Eugenius,</hi> I must tell you, that you have not pitch'd upon the true reason why I am so bitter an enemy to Freewill (for that relates to a particular affront which I receiv'd from an <hi>Arminian</hi> Divine) but I can assure you upon my Integrity, that it comes as nigh the true reason, as any thing in the World can come nigh another. I am sure it is not only my own interest, but the interest of half Mankind, that we carry'd no such troublesome thing as Freewill about us, for then I know who must bear the blame of our extravagancies another day; it wou'd remove all those peevish Melancholly distinctions of good and evil, and score the frequent Sallies and Excesses of our life upon the unavoidable influences and failures of humane nature.

               <p>Very easily Sir, for all that we have hitherto heard concerning your story, only comes to this, That some Three Weeks before your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version in 1685. it was your fortune to go down the River as fas as <hi>Greenwich,</hi> with some <hi>Irish</hi> Gentlemen of your acquaintance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Right Sir, with some <hi>Irish</hi> Gentlemen of my acquaintance, where out of an excess of Friendship, and a mistaken principle of Honour, I drank a prodigious quantity of Wine for two days together, tho to deal honestly with you, the Wine was only sit to be drank in a Protestant Communion, or to Bury Prince <hi>Belzebubs</hi> Subjects.</p>

               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Have a care Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> you are always abusing some Princes Subjects or other; but pray Sir to what part of the Globe do these strangers belong, or what do you mean by Prince <hi>Belzebubs</hi> Subjects?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Why the Flyes Man! Oh Lord that you shou'd be so Ignorant: I hope Sir a Man may pass a jest upon the Flyes, without offending you, or any body else</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>No question on't Mr. <hi>Bays.</hi> But prithee Man, why so severe upon the Protestant Communicants?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Because it is so unseemly a sight to see a Fat Two-handed Layman, with a Face which you may divide as Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> has done the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> into the Champain and the Woody, overgrown with Beard, and looking like the Moon half recovered out of an Eclipse (pray mind the comparison) spill half the Chalice upon his Whiskers, and afterwards wipe 'em with his greasy Elbow.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Rather than break squares between both Churches as to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, I'le engage, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> that the Laymen shall all of 'em be shaved before they come to Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>It can never be done Sir, say what you will, or propose what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients you will; for a Laymans Face (and the experiment was made before no worse Company than the Council of <hi>Constance</hi>) can never be made so sleek and all that, as a Sacerdotal countenance: I have, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> since I was reduced, laboured in this affair to accomodate it, as much as any person whatever, for I wou'd not willingly pay for Wine and not have my Share, but it won't do. Another project I have thought upon, which is a great deal more feasible, may be of infinite advantage to the Kingdom, and I hope may meet with better success.</p>

               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>

               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>No, you may think and pump your imagination these forty years, and ne're be the wiser. Why, I intend â€” But you'll half kill your selves with laughing at the conceitâ€” I intend to get a Burying Act for the Muses.</p>

               <p>I will make my application to the Worshipful Members of the next Parliament, and represent to them the miserable condition of Nine Muses, which is more to be pittyed I'gad, than all the sufferings of the <hi>French</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants. In order to make my petition meet with better entertainment<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and move their compassion, I'll tell them a lamentable story of <hi>Apollo,</hi> the Father of these Girls, how I saw him the other day Eating Spoon-meat
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65204:18"/>
amongst Porters in the <hi>Stocks-market,</hi> in a little greasy old-fashion'd Black Cloak, which hung about his Shoulders like a <hi>Heralds</hi> Coat without sleeves, and scarce reach'd so low as one of your Sub-deacons Surplices at <hi>Sumerset-house</hi>; likewise with a little Extinguisher-like Hat on, and that when I enquired of him, how it came to be so unmercifully paired and circumcised, he should answer that he parted with a Groats worth of the brim, to equip a Basket-hilt in <hi>Lincolns Inn Fields</hi>; nay, to secure my self from all possible dangers of a disappointment in the case, I design to acquaint them with what the Old Gentleman had informed me concerning his Daughters; that unless their relief came presently, they must be forced like the City Orphans, to marry below themselves, and take up with Lawyers Clerks, Penny-Chroniclers, and <hi>Smithfield</hi>-Sonnetiers, for want of better; that they durst not make their appearance at any places of publick resort, because they wanted the necessary accommodation of <hi>Night-rails</hi> and <hi>Top-knots</hi>; and that the trusty Keepers of <hi>Westminster</hi> had discarded 'em, ever since they retrenched their families, and turned out their Servants to Board-wages. And then as for himself, he protests that he has not tasted a drop of Wine since the Conduits pist Claret at the Coronation; that he could not be trusted a week ago in <hi>Pauls Church yard</hi> for half a dozen strings to his <hi>Welsh</hi> Harp, tho he was amoagst so many of his own Tenants, the Booksellers; and lastly<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to use his own expression (by which you may perceive his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities have made him profane as well as desperate) that he has subsisted of late years like the poor melancholly Accidents in <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a subject to quarter upon.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing certainly will prevail upon 'em, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> if this story won't.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Nay you may let me alone to move the hearts of any assembly in Christendom. After I have prepossess'd 'em with this doleful Tale, I will humbly offer to their charitable considerations these following Proposals.</p>
               <p>That for encouraging the manufacture of Poetry, (pray observe me Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, I call it a manufacture, because to my self it is more the trouble of the fingers than the labour of the brain) which has of late years, to the ruine of several Families, the decay of Trade, and the loss of the Kingdom in general, been discontinued; both Houses of Parliament think fit to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the future;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That no person above the Degree of a Lord shall presume to be buried under a dozen Stanza's of good lawful Pindaric Poetry; for which his Heirs, Executors, and Administrators shall pay a Crown a Stanza.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites:</speaker>
               <p>But why not, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> as well be buried in good Heroic?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>For a certain reason Sir, which I am sure will make you bepiss your self, 'tis so extreamly diverting. You know Sir, that Princes, Dukes, and Earls (I can't help reflecting for the heart of me) are a sort of lawless, ungovernable people: Now what kind of Poetry is so suitable, do you think, for these persons, as that which defies all rules, leaps over all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, and, in fine, does what it pleases.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:65204:19"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That all people, from the condition of a Lord down to a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet, shall be embalmed in twenty pair of Heroic Verses, for which they shall pay a Noble. Now the reason why I am for burying these worthy Gentlemen in Heroic is this, That as the <hi>Nile</hi> seldom mounts above the 18th figure, and seldom ebbs below the 14th, so true Valour rarely rises above a Lord, and rarely falls below the quality of a Baronet.</p>

               <p>Why could you not, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> have borrowed your instance from the Quick-silver in a Weather-glass, as well as travelled for one as far as <hi>Egypt.</hi> I find you are for hedging a stake in your old age amongst the men of Valour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That Country Squires, Heads of Houses, Doctors of Divinity, and the Civil Law, Prebends of Cathedrals; all Mayors, Bailiffs, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall be buried in their dearly-beloved Acrostics, (you see I am tart upon half the Nation) for which they are to pay seven Groats (cheap enough I'gad) and that the Poet shall be bound to bait the last distich either with pun or quibble; otherwise to receive nothing for his labour; any thing in this Act or Statute to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Methinks Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> you ought in Conscience to have excepted the Mayors of <hi>Wooden-basset</hi> and <hi>Queenborough,</hi> I dare engage the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates there had rather be interred without the solemnity of an Epitaph, than go to the charges of paying for it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>No, no, they must pay, if it were only for representing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That all others of meaner rank and families, shall be content to lye wrapt in a wholesome short ditty, to the melancholly Tune of St. <hi>Sepulchers</hi> Chimes, for which they must pay one single Tester.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That whereas Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> has done the Nation such important ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and gratified all parties; that is, libelled the Priests to please the Laity, and railed at the Laity to get himself reconciled to the Priests; lampoon'd the Court to oblige his trusting friends in the City, and ridicul'd the City to secure a promising Lord at Court; exposed the kind Keepers of <hi>Convent-Garden</hi> to please the Cuckolds of <hi>Cheapside,</hi> and drolled upon the City Do-littles to tickle the <hi>Convent-Garden Limberhams</hi>; drawn his Pen against the <hi>Romanists,</hi> to win the hearts of <hi>Fanatics</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> and afterwards attack'd all the herd of Dissenters, to retaliate the injury done to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi>; railed at Matrimony to ingratiate with the superannuated Maids of Honour, and damn'd a single life to get a Dinner amongst the fond Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands: That in consideration of these, and several other important ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, the Members of both Houses think fit to settle the priviledge of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencing all Poets whatsoever, from the humble dealers in Tobacco-box-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrip<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A certain Gentleman came accidentally into the room where we were drinking, and desired to be admitted into the company; we told him any civil person was welcome, and so he was receiv'd. Some short time after there happen'd a little occasional discourse concerning Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and this Spark was so unfortunate to say he disbelieved it; now to the everlasting shame of all those persons who have the assurance to deny Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, I maul'd him so by dint of Argument, and Wit, sheer Wit I gad, that he had not one syllable to say for himself.</p>

               <p>Troth Sir I must needs own that I had no over-great opinion of the place till this lucky passage confirmed me. Indeed I had little dawning of the Gospel upon me for a fortnight before, but it was a doubtful glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering sort of a light, and as I may say, just like that by which <hi>Corinna</hi> obliged her Gallant,
<q>

               <p>Is not that comparison of yours, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> somewhat of the lewdest? Methinks you might have resembled the dawning of the Gospel to something else.</p>

               <p>Tho it is a little luscious, it is exceeeding witty, and that is all as I desire in a simile: Sir, said I to the Gentlemen, you don't believe Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory it seems, because it was not discovered before the 11th Century, by the Abbot of <hi>Clugny.</hi> Right, says he. Why don't you as well, Mr. <hi>Wiseacre</hi> (rejoyn'd I) believe there's no such place as <hi>America,</hi> because it has not been discover'd above two huudred years ago; upon which we all fell a laughing, and the poor Gentleman looked with as mortifyed a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Baker, of famous memory, when his dream was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to him.</p>

               <p>Lord, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> I have a hundred times more to say in behalf of Purgatory than this comes to, and all I'gad, my own <hi>Iuvat ire jugis qua nulla priorum orbita</hi>â€” I can't endure to follow any mans footsteps, and that's the reason I so mortally hate your <hi>Ficulnea Argumenta,</hi> your Artillery drawn out of the Bible. What do you think I design at this very present, but to write a Play call'd the discovery of Purgatory, and to bring in the Abbot of <hi>Clugny</hi> in the first Scene; with these lines in his mouth.

There's a thought for you, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> match it me if you can in the whole Universe, 'tis all flame and Spirit, and nothing but a Soul that has run through a course of Chymistry and Purgatory, could have utter'd it. After this follows one of the finest Scenes you ever read, but because it is somewhat of the longest, I will only give you the heads of it: As soon as the Monk had done speaking these last words, a Messenger comes in from the Podesta of <hi>Pensylvania,</hi> to acquaint the Abbot of <hi>Clugny,</hi> that his Master and the Superintendent of <hi>New-England,</hi> did intend that morning
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65204:20"/>
to try a brace of Congregational Bull-Dogs, at an Episcopal <hi>Panther</hi> in the <hi>Bear-Garden,</hi> in the <hi>Ecliptic,</hi> and afterwards fully resolved to give him a meeting at his Toleration-apartment in Purgatory, and that if they liked the scituation of the Country, the temper of the Clymate, the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Trading, and found the place capable of being improved and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, they would presently send him a Colony of huge Mortals, with large Hats and no Cravats, to inhabit it. Whereuponâ€”</p>

               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>Under Correction, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> this same Abbot of <hi>Clugny</hi> is a very uncivil person to put you out of your road thus. Come Sir, your half hour is already past, aud we won't be so unmannerly as to hinder your Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make you more matter for the next Confession.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Goodsookers, Mr. <hi>Eugenius,</hi> are you going already? Why, I am but just enter'd upon my story, and the best part of it is still behind: I'll trespass this once on Father what d'ye call himâ€”If you'll sit down on the next Bench and hear it out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>With all my heart, provided it will be no injury at all to you, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> for I should be as loath to hinder a Poets Devotion, as an Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Alms, or a Souldiers Sobriety, the Reformation of a Player, or the Loyalty of a Dissenter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>'Twill be no injury at all I'gadâ€”Now once in my life, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> I'll borrow my method from a Country Parson. You know 'tis the way of those dull, formal, insipid Animals, after they have made a long tedious harangue in the Morning, to serve it up in the Afternoon as peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do their cold Meat, the better to imprint it in the memory of their Flock, as they pretend; but I'gad, I say only to wiredraw the Afternoons discourse, and save themselves the expence of a little Candle-light and thinking. Even so, Gentlemen, if you please to remember, I told you that in the year One Thousand Six Hundred Eighty Five, I chanced to go down to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> with some <hi>Irish</hi> Gentlemen, where for the space of two days (pray observe the expression, because it came from the other side <hi>Wapping</hi>) Drinking had got the Weather-gage of Sobriety. But now I am come to tell you, that the next morning after, I looked as ill as a poor Gentleman of the Town, who has past through a System of Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy some half a dozen times at the <hi>Bagnio</hi>; I was all over in a flame, and so very sick (that though I am far from complementing the place) yet I should be very well content to have no other punishment inflicted on the Council of 25 at <hi>Geneva,</hi> than to share that illness between them, which I endured in my own person.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites</speaker>
               <p>I thought Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> that the man who could endure such a brunt for two days, was a confirm'd season'd Debauch, and that nothing could hurt him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Alas Sir, I seldom us'd to engage upon such hot service, unless an extraordinary occasion happen'd, and then I was sure to do sufficient Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the next morning. But to proceed Sir, my Wife would of all loves perswade me to repair the breaches of Nature with a little Dyet-drink:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65204:21"/>
No, reply'd I, not for all the World, I scorn to be indebted to scandalous Dyet-drink for my health, as much as I do to steal Verses from a Grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, to purchase the Reputation of a Poet: nay (continued I) I scorn it more than a <hi>Fanatick</hi> does to bind up his Bible in the same Calves-skin with the Common-Prayer-Book and <hi>Apocrypha.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>What relation, pray, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> has the Common-Prayer-Book and <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> to your Wifes Dyet-drink?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>None at all, how should it? It is only a Comparison, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> and a Comparison always ought to be surprizing: Well, after I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted my constitution a little, I was resolved to relieve my self with Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which accordingly I did, in a Corner-shop of the Street, and there fell into the most profound contemplation, that ever any uninspired person was possess'd with: But, pray, Gentlemen, what do you think it was that employ'd my meditation?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Why Hell-fire, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> for any thing I know to the contrary; if, as you say, your contemplation was so very profound.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Well, I protest to you, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> you are enough to make any body split with laughing: Hell-fire! I can assure you such a thought never came into my Head since my Nurse bound it up for me. Gad forgive me, that you cou'd ever imagine a Poet should mortifie himself with such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration; I am sure I have made more advances this way than any of my Tribe, yet cou'd never, for the heart of me, travel further than Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory. But to deal honestly with you, I thought of a certain business that was full as terrible I gad, and that was this: I considered with my self that the general conflagration of the World could not be above ten years oft at the farthest; which made me resolve to part with<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> all my dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling sins on the sudden, and betake my self to the protection of that Church, which cou'd give me the most convincing assurances of Salvation.</p>

               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>But pray, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> upon what ground was it that you believed the day of Judgment was so nigh?</p>

               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>If you have a mind to edify, Gentlemen, by what I am going to relate, I must entreat you to be very attentive; for, as the affair we treat of is exceeding nice and delicate, so if you lose but one chain of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, you had as good have heard not one Syllable<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> I consider'd with my self, that from the first peopling of this Island till the Reformation, a little Ale, encouraged with Sugar and Rosemary, passed for an universal Cordial all the Nation overâ€”This is my <hi>Principium</hi>â€”Which Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> now and then interposed; and I can exactly tell you how long the Eclipse endured; that is, how the Ale laboured under a disrespect, and likewise how many digits were obscured; that is, how many Counties were guilty of using modern <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> instead of primitive ancient Ale: but this being a nicety, which perhaps needs not be so curiously examined, twill be better to wave it, and therefore I shall only desire you to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that Ale, prepared after the above-mentioned manner, continued in very good repute and credit till the Reformation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:65204:21"/>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, yes, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> and as I take it, this Oecumenical Cordial of yours, was confirmed in half a dozen Provincial Synods, held in <hi>Cutlers</hi> Theatre, in <hi>Warwick-lane.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>As for that, I cannot pass my word, friend <hi>Crites,</hi> nor am I willing to say any thing but what I have from unquestionable Tradition â€” Now when the heat of Controversie and Enthusiasm had set the body Natural of the body Politick in a ferment, it was observ'd, that Ale and Beer were too cold for the Constitutions of the people, and that they could no longer pass for Cordials.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>Alas! Poor discarded Ale, how do I pity thee! That thy old companion Rose-mary, the reliever of thy Infirmities, and the support of Old Age, should be forc'd to abandon thee! But pray, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> is Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion so great an Inflamer? I never understood that piece of Philosophy before.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Your Protestant Religion inflames as much, or rather more than a Hectic Feaver; which I can make good by an undeniable demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to you, if you'l both of you promise not to forget the foundation I have hitherto been laying down.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Why then I have this question to ask you, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> Were you ever at a <hi>Quakers</hi> meeting?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Very frequently Sir.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Then tell me <hi>bona fide</hi> whether you ever saw a handsome Woman of that sullen perswasion? Come confess the truth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>That I have, I can assure thee, little <hi>Bays.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>You may take it from me, she was a Novice then, or else the heat of her zeal had certainly discoloured and sowr'd her countenance, and made her look like the rest of her Sex in those <hi>Pagan</hi> Assemblies. It is an Article of my Faith, that it is as impossible for a Woman to be a <hi>Quaker</hi> any time and handsome, as 'tis impossible for one to be a man of business and not dull: If you take a Barrel of Ale and place it to the Sun-shine of your back-side, perhaps in the first week you'll find no alteration, but in two or three months it certainly turns to Vinegar.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Very right, Mr. <hi>Bays</hi>; but prethee shut your hands of this simile as soon as you can.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>So likewise a She-<hi>Quaker</hi> for the first half year may make a shift to preserve her Beauty; but afterwards, in spight of all <hi>Spanish</hi> Wool and Pomatums, the heat of her Religion will contract the Muscles in her face: Which is the reason that all your thorough-paced Women of that opinion have an awkward grinning sort of a look, (for grinning, whether you know it or no, is nothing else but a contraction of the Muscles) and are as easily known by it all the World over, as the men are by their set looks, formal Hats, and short Cravats.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>If you have done with this point, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> pray let me entreat you to reassume the business of the Cordial.</p>

disbanded, we were forced to travel to the <hi>Canaries</hi> for a Cordial, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly brought over Potent <hi>Catholick Sack; Sack</hi> had not long danced about in Thimbles and Spoonfuls, but it desir'd to acquit the <hi>Apothecaries</hi> Shop, was very ambitious to inhabit a Tavern-Vault, and long'd extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to converse with men of Wit and Gayety, instead of Gossips, Nurses, Mid-wifes, and decrepit Aldermen: But as familiarity makes every thing in the World contemptible, so in a short time <hi>Sack</hi> grew out of fashion, ceas'd to perform its ancient office of a Cordial; and towards the latter end of the late Usurpation, when we took <hi>Iamaica</hi> from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> was forced to resign it self to potent <hi>Brandy. Brandy</hi> having had a large uncontroll'd, but a short reign, stands now upon its Tiptoes, and is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king way for the Spirits of Wine.</p>

               <p>From what signs is it, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> that you conclude the downfal and overthrow of <hi>Brandy?</hi> To my poor judgment now, it seems as puissant and well-beloved a Monarch as ever.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Because it has of late years removed out of the City into the Country, where I am sure it must, like the Goddess of Justice, take its last farewel of Mortals. Now after we have accustomed our selves to Spirits of Wine one half a score years, and consequently, heated our Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Clay, our bodies, to the highest degree imaginable, if, as I told you before, the Conflagration does not then happen, according to this sure Infallible Calculation, mind me, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> I give you free leave before your fuiend here, to post me up in a Gazette, for as scandalous an Author as the Modern Dealer in Natural History; or, if that won't serve your turn, as the whole litter of Narrative-mongers, bound up in a Volume.</p>

               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> this is a very astonishing, strange notion of yours, as I ever heard in my life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>I must needs value my self somewhat upon it, because it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the product of my imagination, and no person in the World ever thought of it before. But, Gentlemen, you'l entertain more favourable thoughts of this discovery, I'm confiden<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>, if you'l do me the honour to judge impartially of these two following collateral arguments, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, I am extremely deceiv'd in passing my opinion of things, very strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly back, and confirm the aforesaid Hypothesis. The first is the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and excessive taking of Tobacco, which pestilent, noysome weed, was brought into <hi>Europe</hi> much about the time when <hi>Calvin</hi> tapp'd his Anti-Hierarchichal Hogshead of <hi>Presbytery</hi> at <hi>Geneva.</hi> You are sensible that Children smoak more now-adays, than even Souldiers and Carmen did heretofore; and that more of this nasty stuff is spent at a beastly City-feast, than would have served the whole Kingdom formerly. Now Tobacco drys the Brain, inflames the Blood, encreases Choler, and takes away all that radical moisture, which even the Brandy had the generosity to spare. So much for the firstâ€”</p>

               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Before you proceed any further, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> pray what do you think of the mighty request that Snuff and Coffee are in? You know both
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65204:22"/>
of them are exceeding dryers; will not this hint now serve to illustrate your Cause?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>You may say what you please of Coffee, but not a word of Snuff, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> as you value your reputation, 'tis too sacred a thing to be jested with; you have free liberty from your Friend <hi>Bays,</hi> to make bold with every thing in the world, excepting Snuff and the dispensing Power. The other thing which confirmed me in this opinion, is likewise very shrewd and convincing, I could not but observe, Gentlemen, the great use of Deal within these few years every where.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>And what of that, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> you have no quarrel sure to the <hi>Norway</hi>-Company, for importing so much of the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> Timber.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Not the least Sir; but Deal, you know, by reason of its unctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous resinous substance, is the soonest fired, and the hardest to be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished of any Timber in <hi>Dodona</hi>'s Grove, and therefore it seem'd to me a flat design of providence, to engage mankind in this tickle, short-lived sort of building, to fit their Houses as well as their Bodies, for the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Conflagration: You know <hi>quos vult perdere Iupiter dementat</hi>; and I am sure, those that <hi>Iupiter</hi> intends to destroy by fire, those will <hi>Iupiter</hi> by several methods and qualifications prepare and fitten for that business; for it is not the way of providence to do things on the sudden, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by degrees, to dispose every particular circumstance for the ensuing affair, and stay till there's a joynt concurrence in all the parts to advance the mighty Catastrophe. Thus, Gentlemen, you have my opinion of the whole, and if you think it deserves the name of an Essay, perhaps I may have it published amongst the curiosities of the next Bibliotheque Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, or printed by way of Appendix, or Suppliment to <hi>Burnets Theoria telluris.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>I must confess, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> it deserves a publick appearance, if you please to oblige the world so far, which however you seem'd very loath to do; but under favour, Sir, how came this same Speculative point to bring you over to the Catholick party.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>I'll tell you Sir, hoping that the reasons I am going to ennume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, which were of that efficacy as to reduce me, may be able to prevail upon both of you to quit your erroneous perswasion: I must confess my unskilfulness in a business of this nature; and that I have not taken upon me the weighty province of gaining Converts long enough to say I shall make no mistakes in the management; and therefore I must secure my self of your pardon before I advance into so intricate an undertakingâ€”After I had thus faln upon this metaphysical contemplation, I found my self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to make the best provision for my Soul that I could, and that it was high time to consider the circumstances of my wretched condition. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon the unhappy miscarriages and over-boilings of my Youth, the solemn transgressions of my manhood; the passion, pride, and complicated sins of my Old Age; I call'd to mind the injuries I had done both Church and State, and all those unlawful, brutal attempts, which in my former days
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65204:23"/>
of Ignorance, I had made upon all the degrees of mankind, and which I have so copiously related to you. At last, after an impartial unprejudiced scrutiny into all the visible Churches of the Universe, I found that the Catholicks only proceeded upon sure grounds; that theirs was the well constituted Church which maintain'd Infallibility at its own cost and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, while all other Assemblies declined the expence; that it had the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion to keep an Ensuring Office in the <hi>Camera Apostolica,</hi> and for a small consideration wou'd secure a mans Tenement, with setting a Papal Phoenix upon it, from all damages of Fire hereafter. â€”Wherefore, at that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment I shifted my party, and betook my self to that Primitive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Mother, which heretofore converted our Ancestors from Paganism, and has ever since been attended and adorned with a continued series of Miracles.</p>

               <p>I hope however, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> you'll preserve a charitable thought of the establish'd Religion, for all it came from King <hi>Henry</hi>'s incontinence, since your own Reformation proceeded from a Debauch, and had its birth, growth and full maturity in a Brandishop.</p>

               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>I might be enclined Sir, to do such a thing, if it could be allow'd with any tolerable convenience, but if you once forbid a Romanist to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with that Topic, he has as little to say as a Bully when you tye him up from swearing; or a Poet, when you debar him the liberty of repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 'Tis not to be granted, Mr. <hi>Crites.</hi> But now, because I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed regularly in my discourse, you shall first of all hear those exceptions which I made to the Protestant Assemblies; and secondly, the reasons which confirmed and settled me in the bosom of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church.</p>

               <p>With all my heart, but I think we had best retire to some more convenient place in the Walks, for I see some company coming forward.</p>
