            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>Qui Perjurii immunis eſſe cupit, &amp;c. He, who deſires to
preſerve himſelf from Perjury, ought diligently to weigh

               <hi>THE Words of the Oath
are theſe;</hi> 1 A. B. do ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
promiſe, and ſwear,
that I will be faithful, and
bear true Allegiance to their
Majeſties, King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,
So help me God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this compendious Form of Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
It is ſaid there is great Ambiguity,
which lies principally in the doubtful
ſignification of the Words <hi>[Faithful, and
True Allegiance;]</hi> which may import ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
            <p>1. That kind of Fidelity, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
which Captives may promiſe to
their Conquerors, or oppreſſed Subjects
to Uſurpers; and oblige them only to a
quiet, and peaceable ſubmiſſion, while
they are under their Power, and does not
debar them from aſſiſting their Lawful
Sovereign in the Recovery of his Crown:
or,</p>
            <p>2. All that Fidelity and Allegiance,
which was formerly ſworn to the Kings
of <hi>England,</hi> whereby their Subjects were
obliged to defend their Crown, and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
againſt all Perſons whatſoever; not
reſerving any Branch of their Allegiance,
as Due to any other.</p>
            <p>It is upon this Diſtinction, that two
different Interpretations of the Oath are
grounded, and the higheſt conſtruction
is this; I <hi>A. B.</hi> am ſincerely reſolv'd to
adhere faithfully to King <hi>William</hi> and
Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> to perform all the Duties
of Allegiance, and Subjection unto them
alone, and to defend their Crown and
Dignity with my Life and Fortune to
the uttermoſt of my power againſt all
Perſons whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And the loweſt conſtruction is to this
effect; Whereas <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> are actually
in poſſeſſion of the Regal Power, ſo long,
as they continue in the full poſſeſſion of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58004:2"/>
it, I do ſwear, that I will pay them that
Obedience, and Submiſſion, which may
be lawfully paid to an Actual Sovereign,
not engaging hereby to uphold them in
the poſſeſſion of the Throne againſt the
K. <hi>de Jure,</hi> nor debarring my ſelf from
exerting my ſworn Allegiance to him
upon any emergent opportunity for the
recovery of his Right.</p>
            <p>I am not certain that this laſt Clauſe
of aſſiſting the K. <hi>de Jure,</hi> is the Senſe of
them, who have taken the Oath with a
Declaration of living peaceably under
the preſent Government; yet there is
this reaſon to believe that it is, becauſe
(if any thing can be inferr'd from an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planatory
Declaration, more ambiguous,
and obſcure, than the Oath explain'd)
we may reaſonably infer from thence,
That the Declarers thought the Oath in
the higher Senſe unlawful, becauſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contradictory to their former
Obligations to K. <hi>J.</hi> But if thoſe are
ſtill in force, then they are ſtill obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to an actual aſſiſtance of him; and
then their Declaration muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
in ſuch a ſenſe, as ſhall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
it. In ſhort, if their former Oath
be obligatory, then they are obliged to
aſſiſt <hi>K. J.</hi> If it is not, then the preſent
Poſſeſſors are undoubtedly our Lawful
Sovereigns, and we are conſequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to pray that they may have Victory
over all their Enemies; and if this be our
duty, it is a manifeſt Sin not to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
our Actual Aſſiſtance in our reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Stations for the obtaining of it.
Wherefore chuſe they which they will,
either that their former Oaths are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
or not; the One, or the Other
of the Kings they are bound to aſſiſt, and
therefore they cannot be preſum'd to
bind themſelves by Oath to a ſinful Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality;
which is plainly contradictory to
their former Oath, and if that be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd,
to their manifeſt Duty to the
preſent Poſſeſſors.</p>
            <p>But nevertheleſs, becauſe what ſeems
ſo improbable, may yet be poſſibly true,
that they intended to bind themſelves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to an exact Neutrality; it ſhall be
ſhewn in the enſuing Diſcourſe, That the
true Notion of Allegiance is abſolutely
inconſiſtent with it.</p>
            <p>To return therefore to the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Interpretations of the Oath, it is
manifeſt, that they are contradictory to
each other. By the former we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to pay all our Allegiance to <hi>W.</hi> and
<hi>M.</hi> By the latter, not All, but an Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
qualified, and limited: in the one,
to uphold them to the uttermoſt of our
power in their Crown and Dignity; in
the other, we profeſs we will not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to do it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the one, we engage to
defend them againſt all Perſons whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and in the other, a Power is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
to aſſiſt K. <hi>J.</hi> againſt them. And
if there be any, that take the Oath in a
middle ſenſe of Neutrality, it is evident
from the very Term of Neutrality, that
it is plainly contradictory to the firſt
conſtruction alſo.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſeveral Interpretations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being contradictory to each other,
it is certain the Swearer cannot be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
unto more than one: nor is it to
be imagin'd, that the Impoſors intended
either to oblige us to contradictory, and
impoſſible Duties; or to leave us at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to chuſe in which of thoſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
ſenſes we will be obliged. For
this Oath is exacted by a Law; and a
Law is nothing elſe but the declared will
of the Legiſlator. Now if a Law ſhould
be ſo fram'd on purpoſe by the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
as to be fairly capable of two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
conſtructions, and to leave
the Subject to his choice in which he
will obey it; it is manifeſtly no Law at
all, becauſe it does not contain the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
declar'd Will of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
and the Subject being allowed to
take either part of the Contradiction, is
not determin'd, as by a Law he always
is, to any Act of Obedience. And if
this be true in all Laws, much more
will it hold in thoſe by which Promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory
Oaths are eſtabliſhed: for a Promiſe
equally capable of contradictory ſenſes,
is indeed no Promiſe: And it is nor to
be ſuppoſed, that our Legiſlators intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58004:2"/>
to frame a Promiſſory Oath, that
ſhould contain no Promiſe at all; and
to make a Law for the moſt ſolemn
mockery of God, that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>
            <p>It is therefore preſum'd, That the
Impoſers of this Oath intended to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
us to one determinate meaning of
it; and that thoſe Words, by which
they choſe to declare their Intention,
cannot be reaſonably ſo interpreted, as to
declare the quite contrary alſo: and then
it muſt be granted, that one of theſe
Conſtructions is both intended, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
expreſſed in the Oath; and
that no doubt is the ſenſe, in which we
are obliged both to take, and keep it.</p>
            <p>We are therefore now to enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theſe Conſtructions is the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and declar'd meaning of the Impoſers.
And here there appears at firſt view an
invincible prejudice againſt the lower
Conſtruction of the Oath, <hi>viz.</hi> that this
Oath being undeniably intended for the
ſecurity of the preſent Poſſeſſors againſt
the diſpoſſeſſed; if that Conſtruction be
admitted, though it be never ſo well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
it can be no ſecurity at all unto
them. If it be not intended for their
ſecurity, it is a vain, and inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
Oath: but if it be intended for any
thing, it is certainly deſigned to ſecure
them from the greateſt, I may ſay, the
only, danger they are in, and that is,
from the attempts of K. <hi>J.</hi> But after all,
if we affix this Senſe upon the Oath,
that great, and wiſe ſecurity amounts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to this, <hi>[That we will ſubmit to the
Power of the preſent Poſſeſſors, as long as
there is no help, but a Halter for it; but
as ſoon as ever it becomes ſafe, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to attempt it, we will then with all
our might endeavour to dethrone them, and
reſtore the lawful King to his Crown, and
Dignity; in ſhort, that we will <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t attempt
to deſtroy K.</hi> W. <hi>till we have <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>bable hopes

            </p>
            <p>And can it be imagin'd <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſo great
and wiſe a Body, as is the Parliament of
<hi>England,</hi> ſhould after great labour, and
ſtrugling in its Birth, produce a thing ſo
Iudicrous? Will K. <hi>W?</hi> Will any K. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth be content with ſuch Security
as this? Will he not rather look upon
it as an open Declaration of Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him? Is this to ſwear True Faith
and Allegiance to him? Namely, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
till we can prudently rebel againſt
him? Was there ever any ſuch Oath
exacted from Subjects ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Government? In ſhort, if this
be the Senſe of the Oath, as none but
Mad men would have enacted it, ſo it is
fit to be propos'd to Mad-men only to
take it: for it is certain none elſe will
contrive, or execute any attempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him without hopes of ſucceſs. And
yet this muſt be the Senſe of thoſe, who
take it with a reſerve of their old Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to K. <hi>J.</hi> for by that Allegiance they
are obliged to aſſiſt him in the recovery
of his Crown, to the utmoſt of their
power, whenſoever their aſſiſtance may
be uſeful and ſerviceable to his Cauſe.
But to ſwear Allegiance in this ſenſe, is
plainly to ſwear nothing at all; 'tis only
the Phantom of an Allegiance, and will
not only deceive, but deſtroy them that
were intended to be ſecured by it. Here
therefore I may appeal to the common
ſenſe of all men, whether that can be
preſum'd to be the meaning of the Oath
which does directly contradict the whole
End and Intention of it; and whether
it be not a thing incredible that the King,
Lords, and Commons ſhould enact an
Oath to ſecure the preſent Government,
and in the ſame Oath allow the Takers
leave to attempt the deſtruction of it;
and whether laſtly, I had not reaſon to
affirm, that this is an invincible prejudice
againſt that Conſtruction, and may not
now have leave to add, that it is a plain
demonſtration againſt it.</p>
            <p>And the ſame reaſoning will in ſome
meaſure hold againſt a Neutrality alſo;
becauſe that alſo does defeat the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
intended in this Oath for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of K. <hi>W.</hi> The only difference is,
That the former Conſtruction does per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Swearers to be ſtill Enemies to
the Government: But this leaves it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58004:3"/>
any Friends to ſupport it. The one
does in effect arm the Subjects to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
it; and the other leaves it naked
and defenceleſs to be deſtroyed by them.
Both are highly pernicious to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Governors, and abſolutely incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with the prime and immediate
Intention of the Oath to ſecure them.
Perhaps it will be ſaid, that a peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Neutrality, were it ſworn and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
by all the Subjects, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
ſecure the Poſſeſſors againſt
all Attempts to dethrone them; and
that however if ſuch Attempts be made,
ſince the greateſt part of the Subjects
do think themſelves obliged by the Oath
to an Active Aſſiſſiſtance, the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
will be effectually ſecured by it.
But</p>
            <p>1. The Impoſers knew well enough,
that there were great numbers, that
would neither ſwear, nor obſerve a Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality;
but would actually aſſiſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed
K. againſt them; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in ſuch a dangerous Conjuncture, a
bare Neutrality of all the Subjects could
be no tolerable Security againſt them. And</p>
            <p>2. If they intended to oblige the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
only to an exact Neutrality, it was
a groſs Prevarication ſo to frame the Oath
on purpoſe, that in the Opinion of moſt
Men it might import an Obligation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
to it. And beſides, if that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
were the preciſe Intention of the
Impoſers, then the Government will be
ſecured, not by the Oath it ſelf, but by
a falſe Conſtruction of it. Wherefore this
ſingle Conſideration of the chief End and
Intention of the Oath does clearly evince
the firſt and higheſt Conſtruction to be
the true meaning of it: And that it is
ſo, I will further endeavour to prove by
all the Medium's, by which the meaning
of an Oath is capable of being proved, and
thoſe are only theſe two; the Words
which the Impoſers have made choice of
to declare their meaning; and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
otherwiſe ſufficiently expreſſed by
Circumſtances, and other Actions, which
may ſerve as a Comment upon the Oath,
and may aſcertain us of the meaning of
it. And</p>
            <p>1. I conſider the ſignification of the
Words <hi>[faithful, and true Allegiance,]</hi>
which contain all the promiſſory part of
the Oath, and have occaſioned all the
different Conſtructions of it.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that Words generally
ſpeaking have their ſignification only from
the Inſtitution of Men; and thoſe that
are vulgarly uſed, and underſtood in any
Language, from the common conſent of
the People of that Language; and thoſe
that are underſtood only by a few, ſuch
as are called <hi>Terms of Art,</hi> from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of the ſeveral Arts and Sciences.
The Words <hi>[faithful and true Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance]</hi>
may be conſider'd in both reſpects,
as they are vulgarly taken, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by the generality of the People of
this Nation; and as they are Law-terms,
which are to be underſtood according to
the Senſe of Lawyers. And firſt I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what is the ſignification of thoſe
Words according to the Laws and Lawyers.</p>
            <p>1. I obſerve, that the Lord <hi>Coke</hi>
in <hi>Calvin's</hi> Caſe does affirm, that Faith
and Allegiance have only one ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and there he produces ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
to ſhew, that <hi>Eſſe ad Fidem
Regis</hi> ſignifies only to be in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of the King: accordingly the
ſame Oaths are ſometimes called Oaths
of Fidelity, and ſometimes Oaths of
Allegiance without any diſtinction. And
Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> in his Gloſſary defines
Fidelity to be <hi>[Fidei, obſequii, &amp; ſervitii
ligamen]</hi> which is neither more nor leſs
than Allegiance. So that even in this
ſhort Oath there is ſtill a Word too much,
ſince Faith and Allegiance do ſignifie the
ſame thing, and expreſs the ſame Duties
of Subjection.</p>
            <p>2. The Subjects of <hi>England</hi> may in two
reſpects be ſtiled <hi>Fideles Regis.</hi> Firſt as
they are Members of the Body Politick,<note place="margin">Spel. in v<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r. Fideles.</note>
and are therefore obliged to pay the K.
that Fidelity and Subjection which is due
to the Supreme Head and Governor of
it, Secondly, As they hold their Lands in
Fee of the K. and ſo are obliged to pay
Fealty and Allegiance to him. A Fee is
thus defin'd by the <hi>Feudiſts, That it is a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58004:3"/>
free and benevolent Grant of a thing immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Feudum eſt benevola, &amp; libera rei immobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, &amp; aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollentis conceſſio, cum tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlatione uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis Dominii, proprietatè retentâ ſub exhibitione ſervitiorum honeſtorum.</note>
               <hi>or ſomething equipollent with a convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Right to all the Profits of it,
the Propriety being ſtill reſerved to the Lord;
and the Grant made upon Condition of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
and the performance of honeſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,]</hi>
So that in this Feodal Contract
it being expreſly provided, that even
the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tile Dominium</hi> ſhould revert unto the
Lord upon breach of Fealty; the Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
was hereby obliged in point of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
as well as Gratitude to an exact
performance of it: and conſequently all
the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> being Vaſſals to
the K. are beſides the common Duty of
Subjects under the ſame Additional Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
of Fidelity to him.<note place="margin">Feud. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratio an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te lib. Feud.</note>
            </p>
            <p>3. From this Tenure of Lands in Fee,
they who held them, were ſometimes
called <hi>Fideles,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Ligii a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gando;</hi>
and the Bond or Obligation they
were under <hi>Fidelitas,</hi> and <hi>Ligeantia;</hi> and
the Oaths they took to perform it, Oaths
of Fealty and Allegiance. For ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ligeance was not appropriated to the
Sovereign only, but it denoted in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
the Obligation of a Vaſſal to any Lord
whatſoever. Thus <hi>Hotoman</hi> in his Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
Dictionary tells us,<note place="margin">Diſp de Feud. c. 7.</note> That <hi>Liegeman was
but another word for a Vaſſal:</hi> and in his
Diſp he ſpends a whole Chapter to prove
it. Thus <hi>Du Freſne</hi> diſtinguiſhes between
an <hi>abſolute Ligeance due to a Supreme Lord,</hi>
and a <hi>Ligeance paid to an Inferior,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gloſs. in ver. Ligium.</note> 
               <hi>with
exception of the former.</hi> So alſo <hi>Bracton,
Glanvil,</hi> and <hi>Fleta</hi> do ſpeak of <hi>Ligeance
as due to any Capital Lord beſides the King.</hi>
               <note place="margin">lib. 2. c. 35.</note>
And <hi>Spelman</hi> in his Expoſition of the word
ſhews by ſeveral Inſtances,<note place="margin">fol. 79.</note> That <hi>private
Perſons had their Liegmen alſo.</hi>
               <note place="margin">l. 9. c. 1.</note> But tho'
Ligeance had anciently ſo large a Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;<note place="margin">l. 3. c. 16.</note>
yet</p>
            <p>4. It was at length confin'd to denote
only the Obligation of a Vaſſal to the
Sovereign Lord of the Fee. Hence that
Diſtinction in the Feudiſts <hi>inter Feudum
ligium,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Inſt. jur.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; non ligium;</hi> which is thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
by Dr. <hi>Cowel</hi> in his Inſtitution;<note place="margin">Ang. l. 2. tit. 2.</note>
               <hi>viz. [That the former is properly ſo called,
when an Oath of Fidelity is taken without
exception of any one; and the later, when
it is ſworn with exception of another Fealty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The one is due only to the K. and the other
even to common Perſons.]</hi> In ſhort, the
one was held immediately of the Crown,
and the other mediately under an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Lord; and therefore it was but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable,
that in the Oath of Fealty
to him, exception ſhould be made of
the King, who was the Original Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and Sovereign Lord of the Fee.</p>
            <p>5. Two conſiderable Prerogatives may
be obſerved from the Lawyers, which
were peculiar to the Sovereign Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
Firſt, That whereas the Inferiour
Lord had only <hi>propter rem</hi> a right to the
Fealty of his Vaſſal, from which he might
free himſelf by ſurrendring his Eſtate,
the Sovereign Lord had a Right to it
<hi>propter perſonam</hi> alſo; and conſequently,
tho his Liegeman did part with his Eſtate,
yet Allegiance was ſtill due by vertue of
that inalienable Juriſdiction, which the
Sovereign had over his Perſon. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
Whereas between an Inferior
Lord and his Vaſſal, there was ſuch a
a ſtrict reciprocal Obligation to prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
on the one part, and Fidelity on
the other, that (as the Tenant loſt his
Fee upon breach of Fidelity;<note place="margin">Feud l. 2. tit 26:</note> ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe)
the Inferior Lord, if he refuſed
protection to his Vaſſal, or committed
any enormous Offence againſt him,<note place="margin">Car. Mol.</note> did
forfeit [to the Sovereign Lord] all his
right to the Fee.<note place="margin">tit. 1.</note> Yet, as <hi>Molinaeus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
<hi>[this Penal Forſeiture of Dominion
extended only to Inferior Lords;</hi>
               <note place="margin">de Fi. S. 3</note> 
               <hi>the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
being exempted from it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Glo. 4. n. 17</note>] For tho
the Liege-Sovereign was bound to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
his Liegemen; yet there was no
proviſion that he ſhould forfeit his right
to their Fealty, if he did not perform
his Obligations to them. Indeed there
can be nothing more irrational, than to
imagine ſuch a Proviſion; when Fee-Lands
were Originally owing only to
the Munificence of Kings, and even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that new Obligation of Fealty, they
had an antecedent right to the Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Subjects; <hi>when the Kings
Lands</hi> (as the Lawyers ſpeak) <hi>were
held under God alone, and therefore could
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58004:4"/>
not be forfeitable to any; when the K.
himſelf could not be reſponſible for any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
for want of a Superiour Juriſdiction;
[and if any were done to the
Subject,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bracton. l. 1 c. 8. Si autem a rege petatur, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>there was no other
remedy, but only humble
Petition, that the K. would
correct and amend his Fact;
which if he refuſed to do, it
was once thought a ſufficient
Puniſhment for him, that God
was to be his Avenger.]</hi> This
I have here obſerv'd, becauſe
the Aſſertors of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican
Doctrines have maintained, that
Kings may forfeit their Crowns, not
only from the nature of that Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Contract, which they ſuppoſe was
made at the firſt Origine of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but alſo from that Contract which
was made between the Sovereign, and his
Vaſſals, and which they ſuppoſe to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaily
on both ſides Conditionate.</p>
            <p>6. Though theſe Feudal Laws are now
in a great meaſure antiquated; yet the
Fealty by which a Vaſſal is bound to his
Lord is ſtill in force. Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi>
ſays,<note place="margin">In v. Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litas.</note> 
               <hi>[That Fealty in</hi> England <hi>is inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
from all Tenures, and though it be
now but ſeldom exacted, yet it can by no
means be releas'd without deſtruction of the
Tenure; ſo that the taking of the Oath
ſeems rather to be remitted, than the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
it ſelf to be diſſolv'd.]</hi> And much
more does the Obligation of Fealty to
the K. continue ſtill in force-upon all
the Subjects by virtue of their Tenures
from him. The ſame great Antiquary
affirms, <hi>That the Feudal Law was firſt
brought into</hi> England <hi>by</hi> William <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,
[Qui lege eâ è Normannia traductâ

And hence it is, that all the Lands of
<hi>England</hi> being originally derived from
the Crown, are ſtill held of the King in
nature of a Fee, which implies Fealty to
him. And this is a true, and eaſie account
of thoſe Aſſertions of the Lawyers:
<hi>[That the King is the Sovereign Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coke 1.</note> 
               <hi>or
Lord Paramount,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Inſt. <hi>l. 2. c.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>either mediate or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

Realm;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cowell.</note> 
               <hi>and that the Subjects have not a
direct and plenary Dominion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Inſt. Jur. <hi>l. 2. tit.</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>but only a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciary,
and conditionate property in their
Eſtates,]</hi> which are ſtill forfeitable by the
common Law, and upon breach of Feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
do revert to the Original Donor.
Which Law, according to the nature of
the Crime, does alſo vary the forfeiture:
as in caſe of Felony the K. hath a Year,
a Day, and the Waſt; after which it
paſſeth down to the Heir: But in caſe
of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> which is the higheſt breach
of Fealty, after Legal Conviction of the
Traytor, the Fee is for ever forfeited,
and all his Lands and Tenements are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
at the King's diſpoſal. And
though a Statute was made 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> III.
to determine what was preciſely Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
yet this was only declarative of
what was truly Treaſon by the Feudal
Laws, which were then a part of the
Common Law of <hi>England.</hi> And hence
it appears, how neceſſary it is for the
underſtanding of the true meaning of
Faith and Allegiance, to enquire into the
nature of Fealty; whence the Subjects
are called <hi>Fideles &amp; Ligii Regis;</hi> and
from which all our Oaths of Fidelity,
and Allegiance derive their Birth, and
Original.</p>
            <p>7. As the word Allegiance was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to expreſs the Obligation of
a Liege Vaſſal to his Sovereign: ſo was
it alſo at length enlarged to comprehend
all the duties of Fidelity and Subjection,
which (not only they, who hold Lands
in Fee, but alſo) every individual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58004:4"/>
of this Realm was bound to pay
unto the King. Thus <hi>Zouch</hi> out of <hi>Dua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus,
[The Fidelity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deſcrip.</note>

               <hi>is by the Feudiſts called Lige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and as many as live within his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
are ſtiled Liege-men; who are bound
to the Sovereign not only by reaſon of their
Eſtates,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Feudales pars 1. § 2.</note> 
               <hi>but alſo in reſpect of their Perſons,
and his Protection of them.]</hi> The reaſon
then why all the Subjects of this Realm
are called the King's Liege-men is, becauſe
their perſons being under his Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Protection, they are therefore
bound to pay due Fealty and Allegiance
to him.</p>
            <p>This univerſal Allegiance of all the
natural Subjects of this Realm,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Caſe.</note> is by the
Lord <hi>Coke</hi> diſtinguiſhed. <q>1. Into natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Ligeance; which is ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is originally due by Nature, and
Birthright. And, 2. Legal Ligeance;
ſo called, becauſe the Municipal Laws
of this Realm preſcribe the Form and
Order of it: and this, ſays he, is that,
which the Law requires upon Oath at
the <hi>Leet.</hi> This Oath of Allegiance in his
Inſtitutes he ſays expreſly, is the ſame
with <hi>Homagium Ligeum,</hi> which he thus
defines in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>[Quod ſoli Regi
debetur ſine ſervitio;]</hi> and oppoſes it
to <hi>Homagium Feudale,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In v. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magium.</note> which hath it's
original by Tenure.</q> And to this Sir
<hi>Henry Spelman</hi> ſeems to agree; who tells
us, <hi>That Liege, or Sovereign Homage is due
only to the King in right of Sovereignty.</hi>
And they both differ herein, from the
Feudiſts; who define Homage to be
<hi>Sponſionem fidelitatis propter Tenuram;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mol. ibid. Glo. 3.</note>
and from our ancient Lawyers, who do
intimate, <hi>that Liege Homage was made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
private Perſons alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. The word Ligeance is yet further
in our Laws, and Lawyers enlarged to
denote the duty, not of natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
only, but alſo of Deniſons, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liens.
Thus we are informed likewiſe in
<hi>Calvin</hi>'s Caſe, that beſides natural Lige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
there is alſo <hi>Ligeantia acquiſita,</hi>
which is due by acquiſition, or Deniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and <hi>Ligeantia Localis,</hi> and that is,
when an Alien, who is in amity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
into <hi>England,</hi> becauſe he is then
within the King's Protection, he does
therefore owe a Local Allegiance to
him.</p>
            <p>9. Laſtly, Allegiance is ſometimes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in a ſignification yet more general,
and extenſive to expreſs the mutual,
and reciprocal Obligation between the
Liege Sovereign and his Subjects; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Sovereign is bound to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
and juſt Government of his
Subjects; and they again to pay due Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
and Subjection to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.
And thus it is defined in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
by <hi>Skene</hi> in his Book <hi>De Expoſitione
Verborum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Calvin<hi>'s Caſe.</hi>
               </note> who is herein followed by
the Lord <hi>Coke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In v. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantia.</note> and Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi>
alſo.</p>
            <p>It appears then in how great a Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
the word Allegiance is taken, and
how variouſly it has been applied to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
different Obligations to different
Perſons. The various ſignifications of
it (as far as I can obſerve) may be
reduced to theſe ſix. Firſt, It ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
denoted the Service, and Fidelity,
that any Vaſſal owed to the Lord of the
Fee. Secondly, It was confin'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the duty of a Liege Vaſſal to the
Sovereign Lord. Thirdly, It was then
enlarged to comprehend the whole duty
of every natural Subject to his natural
Sovereign. Fourthly, It ſometimes ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
that Oath of Fidelity, which the
Law requires of every Subject, and is
therefore call'd <hi>Legal Ligeance.</hi> Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
It is ſaid to expreſs the Obligation
of a Foreigner, as of a Deniſon; and
of an Alien while he is in the Realm.
And laſtly, It is applied to expreſs the
reciprocal Obligations, that are between
a Liege Sovereign, and his Subjects.</p>
            <p>As for this laſt ſignification of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,<note place="margin">Page 4, 5.</note>
we have already conſider'd it,
where we diſcourſed of the Prerogatives
of the Sovereign Lords: for here we
are to conſider the duty of Allegiance,
as it relates to Subjects only: and there
would be nothing more abſurd, than
to ſay, That when Subjects ſwear Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
to their King, they do ſwear
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58004:5"/>
that he alſo ſhall diſcharge the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a Liege Sovereign towards
them.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe when Allegiance is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to Aliens, the very nature of the
thing does ſhew, that it muſt ſignifie on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thoſe branches of the duty of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
which an Alien is bound to while
he is in <hi>England,</hi> viz. conformity to the
Laws, and an obligation not to attempt
any thing againſt the King, while he is
within his Protection. So alſo when it
is applied to a Deniſon, who is made
free of the Kingdom, but not entitled to
all the Liberties, and Priviledges of a
Natural Subject, it can then ſignifie only
thoſe duties of Allegiance, which a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon
is obliged to, whatſoever they are.
For as the Duties of Allegiance are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified
by the different qualities of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Subjects; and a Clerk, a Soldier,
and Artificer are not bound to the ſame
particular acts of Allegiance: ſo likewiſe
the different degres of Allegiance muſt
be determin'd by the different degrees
of ſubjection: and therefore a Natural
Subject, who enjoys all the Liberties, and
Priviledges of the Kingdom, and owes
the higheſt degree of ſubjection, muſt be
in reaſon obliged to a higher degree of
Allegiance than a Deniſon, who, though
he be to ſome intents incorporated into
this Kingdom, is yet the natural Subject
of another Sovereign: and he again is
obliged to more than an Alien, who is
only a Subject <hi>in Tranſitu,</hi> and enjoys
nothing but Protection from Injury. But
we have now nothing to do with Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
as it is applied to Foreigners.
Allegiance in the Oath before us is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
and impoſed upon all the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Subjects of this Realm; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it muſt be that, which is due from
Natural Subjects, and not ſuch as is due
from Foreigners. We are bound to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
God, and the King, and Subordinate
Magiſtrates, our Spiritual Rulers, our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
all our Superiors, and in ſome ſenſe
all our Inferiors. Honour is due to all
theſe, but in different kinds, and degrees
according to the nature of the Duty,
as it is applied by different Perſons to
different Objects. Now it would be a
groſs abſurdity, when we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to honour God, or the King, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
it of ſuch a degree of honour, as is
due to a Pariſh Prieſt, a Conſtable, or a
Beggar, becauſe honour is due reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to every one of theſe. So it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
abſurd, when Allegiance is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
required of all the Natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
becauſe the word is ſometimes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in a lower ſenſe, when it is referr'd
to Aliens, to argue from thence, that the
Law, which requires Allegiance from all
Natural Subjects, requires no more, than
an Alien is bound to. To argue thus,
is at once to do violence to common
ſenſe, and Language; for as no one that
underſtands either, can imagine that the
Precept which enjoyns Sons to honour
their Parents, requires leſs than filial Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Obedience, though the word ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
often ſignifies leſs: ſo neither can
it be reaſonably imagin'd, that Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in the Oath impoſed does ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
leſs, than all that Fidelity, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
which a Natural Subject owes to
his Natural Sovereign, though the word,
as it relates to Aliens, may ſometimes
ſignifie leſs.</p>
            <p>But however, if Allegiance muſt needs
be underſtood in that ſenſe; as if by
the force of that word we were obliged
to no more, than what even an Alien
may ſwear to perform: yet it is to be
conſider'd, that even the Local Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
which an Alien owes to the King
in whoſe Dominions he is, does at the
leaſt oblige him not to attempt againſt
his Crown and Dignity, as long as he
reſides in thoſe Dominions. Whereas
he, who conceives his Oath to K. <hi>J.</hi>
to be ſtill Obligatory, muſt conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
think himſelf obliged to attempt the
dethroning of the K. <hi>de facto;</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
therefore ſwear even a Local Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to him.</p>
            <p>It remains then to conſider the other
Applications of the word Allegiance,
which are all reducible to theſe two;
that Allegiance, which was requir'd of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58004:5"/>
thoſe who held Lands in Fee; and that
which is required of all the Subjects
in general, which is alſo diſtinguiſhed
into Legal, and Natural Allegiance. And
theſe ſeveral kinds of Allegiance are not
thus diſtinguiſhed, becauſe they import
different Duties; but in reſpect of the
different Grounds, from whence their
Obligation is derived. For I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
undeniable proofs, that they do all
concur in obliging us to the ſame Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
and that, which I undertake to
evince, is this; That Allegiance in thoſe
ſeveral acceptations does import, not
only that Obedience, and Submiſſion,
which may be lawfully paid to an Uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
with a Reſervation of Fidelity to the
lawful King; which is the ſenſe of the
loweſt: nor yet a meer peaceable Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality,
which may make a middle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:
but that it always imports an
Obligation to defend our Sovereign's
Crown and Dignity, to the utmoſt of our
power, againſt all Perſons whatſoever,
without any exception; and never to
give any aſſiſtance, or ſupport to any of
his Enemies againſt him; as the firſt,
and higheſt Conſtruction of the Oath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
it. And firſt, for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Obligation of Feudal Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance;
it is requiſite to enquire into
that Fidelity, which every Vaſſal was
bound to pay unto his Lord. And there
can be nothing more evident, than that
it obliged him not only to abſtinence
from all Injuries, but alſo to an active,
and vigorous aſſiſtance of him. This is
abundantly evident from the Feudal
Books annexed to the body of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Law: out of which I ſhall produce
ſome demonſtrative proofs to evince it.</p>
            <p>

that in ſuch, and other Caſes he

ſhould forfeit his Tenure for his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
and Ingratitude.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary here to obſerve, That
the ſame Obligations of a Vaſſal to his
Lord, which were required by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Feudal Law, were alſo admitted,
and exacted by the Common Law of
<hi>England.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 9.</note> It is evident from <hi>Glanville,

               <hi>and if he held of more,
than one, to fight in his Perſon with his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital

knows, that there were anciently ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Tenures among us, which were pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Military: and though Tenures upon
condition of Services purely Civil were
alſo introduced, ſuch as Soccage, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
yet even in theſe the Vaſſals were
obliged to perform Homage, and ſwear
Fidelity to their Lords. And from that
ancient form of Homage, which we
have in the Statute Book, and in <hi>Bracton,
Fleta,</hi> and <hi>Littleton,</hi> it is evident, that
the Vaſſal was not only obliged to a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
Fidelity, which conſiſts in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining
from Injury; but alſo to poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
ſervices, and aſſiſtance of him. The
form runs thus, <hi>[I become your Man from

bear you Faith for the Tenements, that I
claim to hold of you; ſaving the Faith,
which I owe unto our Sovereign Lord the

               <note place="margin">1. Inſt. l. 2. c. 1.</note> [Foial, <hi>and</hi>

               </gap>al, <hi>(which are words equivalent to
faithful and true Allegiance in the Oath

theſe words,</hi> Foial <hi>and</hi> Loyal. I become
your Man, of Life, and Limb. Therefore he
muſt never be armed againſt, or oppoſite to
his Lord: but both his Life and Member
muſt be ready for the lawful Defence of his
Lord.]</p>
            <p>And this is ſufficient to ſhew, that by
the <hi>Feudal</hi> Law, as it is received in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
every Vaſſal is obliged to an
active Fidelity and Aſſiſtance of his Lord.
Where fore.</p>
            <p>2. If this was the Obligation of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Vaſſal to his Lord; is it poſſible for
Men of ſenſe to imagine, that a lower
degree of Fidelity was due to a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Lord, who had a double right to
the Service of his Vaſſals, a property in
their Eſtates, and a Juriſdiction over
their Perſons? Has the Law ordain'd,
that the Servant ſhall be above his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and the Subject above his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign?
Has it provided for the ſafety of
an inferior Lord, and left the Sovereign
defenceleſs? Given the one a right to
the utmoſt ſervice of his Vaſſal, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
the other to be content with a
peaceable Indifferency, and a cold Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality?
Or laſtly, Can it be ſuppoſed,
that Sovereign Princes, who enacted, or
introduced theſe Laws, did intend that
their own Subjects ſhould have ſuch a
Superiority above themſelves in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
of their Vaſſals? This ſurely muſt
be neceſſarily falſe, as it is plainly irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.
And to ſhew that it is ſo, it will
be ſufficient to obſerve,</p>
            <p>1. That in the Homage, and Oaths of
Fealty made by Vaſſals to inferior Lords,
the Sovereign Lord was expreſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
<hi>Spelman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In v. Ligii.</note> and others tell us,
<hi>[That</hi> Frederick Barbaroſſa <hi>made a Law,
that the Emperor ſhould be expreſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
in all Oaths of Fidelity; and that
this Law was univerſally received in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;]</hi>
And that it was here obſerved
in <hi>England</hi> is evident from the form of
Homage here inſerted,<note place="margin">L. 3. p. 207.</note> and the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

Liege Vaſſals of the Sovereign were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
obliged to aſſiſt, and defend him
againſt all Perſons whatſoever without
any exception. This is evident from
the very definition of Liege Homage in

that they were bound for their Fee

So <hi>Glanvile</hi> informs us, <hi>[That
a Vaſſal at the Command of the Prince, was
bound to fight againſt his own immediate

and as he had appointed them to
do by the common Council of the Kingdom;
and for that conſideration had given them
Lands in Fee for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto therefore it appears, that
Ligeance in its Original ſignification im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
an obligation to aſſiſt the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
againſt all his Enemies without
exception. And ſince all our Oaths of
Allegiance are manifeſtly derived from
the <hi>Feudal</hi> Oaths, it muſt needs be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that the Ligeance univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of all the Subjects, is not much
different from the <hi>Feudal,</hi> to which it
owes its original. And this univerſal Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
I ſhall firſt conſider in General;
and endeavour to ſhew the Obligation
of it out of our Laws, and Lawyers, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
I ſhall conſider it, as it is ſtiled
Legal; And Thirdly, Natural Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>1. I am to conſider the obligation of
Univerſal Allegiance in general.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hotoman</hi> obſerves,<note place="margin">De ver.</note> that there are two
kinds of Fidelity;<note place="margin">Feud. <hi>in v.</hi>
               </note> the one perform'd by
Vaſſals,<note place="margin">Fidelitas.</note> and the other by Citizens, or
Subjects: And for this he cites a Law of
the Emperor <hi>Frederick,</hi> to this effect;
<hi>[Let our Vaſſals ſwear Fealty to us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">c. 24.</note> 
               <hi>as Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals,
and all others as Citizens, from ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years to ſeventy.]</hi> And in his Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
he proves from ſeveral Forms of
Oaths of Fidelity exacted by ſeveral
Princes, of all their Subjects, that they
do oblige to the ſame Duties with thoſe
required of Vaſſals: and the Forms he
there produces, do particularly oblige to
an active Fidelity and Aſſiſtance of the
Sovereign againſt all men living.</p>
            <p>Agreeably, in this Kingdom, as all
the Subjects are therefore called Liege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
beccauſe they are bound unto their
King, as Vaſſals to their Lord; ſo the
Oaths they were required to take, and
the Allegiance they were bound to pay
unto the King, are the ſame in ſubſtance
with the <hi>Feudal</hi> Oaths, and Obligations
of a Vaſſal to his Liege Lord and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.
The late Interpreter of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terms,
tells us,<note place="margin">Tho Manly.</note> 
               <hi>[That Ligeancy is moſt
commonly uſed for that Duty, which every
good Subject owes to his Leige Lord the
King.]</hi> And ſays after <hi>Cowel,</hi> That it is
thus defined in the Great <hi>Cuſtomary</hi> of
<hi>Normandy,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ligeantiae eſt, ex quâ Domino tenentur Vaſſalli ſui contra om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes qui mori poſſunt, &amp; vivere; proprii corporis prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere, conſilii &amp; auxilii Juvamentum; &amp; ei ſe in omnibus innocuos exhibere, nec ei adverſantium par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem in aliquo confovere.</note> [That <hi>it is an Obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Vaſſals to take part with their Liege
Lord againſt all men living, to ſerve him
with their Perſons, Aſſiſtance and Advice;
to do him no Injury, nor in any thing to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
his Adverſaries againſt him.]</hi> So that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58004:7"/>
hence it is obvious, That this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
took the Allegiance of a Vaſſal and
every good Subject to be exactly the
ſame; and thought this to be a good
Definition of it; which is as abſolutely
inconſiſtent with a pure Neutrality, or a
Reſervation of an higher degree of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
to another, as Words can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs.
The ſame Learned Interpreter
has yet added out of the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more modern Explication of it;
<hi>viz</hi> [That <hi>it is the true and faithful Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Subject to his Sovereign.]</hi> But
neither will this import a meer Neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
or only a peaceable Conformity to
the Laws, if we will take the ſenſe of the
Author from his own Account of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Allegiance. He gives us this Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Caſe: But in the ſame
Caſe he poſitively aſſerts, [That <hi>all the
Subjects of this Realm are bound by their
Allegiance to diſcover and oppoſe all Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
againſt the King, to aſſiſt him in his
Wars, and even to ſpend their Blood in his
Defence.]</hi> He gives the ſame Deſcription
in his <hi>Inſtitutes</hi> alſo; but he had before
explain'd what was ſignified by Faithful
and Loyal; which, according to him,
do imply poſitive Duties of actual Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and Aſſiſtance. So that by True
and Faithful Obedience in this Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
muſt be underſtood all thoſe poſitive Duties
of Fidelity and Obedience which
every Subject owes his Sovereign by
virtue of his Allegiance: And what
thoſe are, may be clearly underſtood
from the known Laws of the Land, which
do plainly intimate and inform us to
what Duties true Allegiance does bind
us.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here out of many, produce

               <hi>and his Royal Progeny and
Poſterity for ever.]</hi> By Loyalty, here is
meant nothing but Allegiance, to which
it is equivalent; and hence we may
obſerve, firſt, That the <hi>Parliament</hi> here
obliged themſelves to the utmoſt poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
aſſiſtance and defence of his Majeſty
without any Conditions and Reſerves;
even until the laſt drop of their Blood
was ſpent. Secondly, They call this
Obligation the firſt Fruits of their Faith
and Allegiance, and therefore certainly
contained in them. And, Thirdly, As
far as a Law can do it, they oblige not
themſelves only, but their Heirs and
Poſterity for ever, and that not to the
King then in being only, but to his Royal
Progeny alſo and Poſterity for ever.</p>
            <p>The other Paſſage is,<note place="margin">So alſo, 7 <hi>Ed. 1. 11 H.</hi> 7. c. 1.</note> 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. c. 18. Where
it is plainly and expreſly declared, [That
<hi>every Subject by the Duty of his Allegiance
is bound to ſerve and aſſiſt his Prince and
Sovereign Lord at all Seaſons when need
ſhall require; and in particular, againſt
his Rebels and Enemies, for the Suppreſſing
and ſubduing of them.]</hi> This is ſo expreſs
and authentick a Declaration of the true
Duty of Allegiance, that no Art nor So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry
can poſſibly evade it. And upon
this Statute among others, did K. <hi>Charles</hi>
the Martyr juſtifie his Commiſſions of
Array in his Proclamation againſt Levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Forces; and in another, for ſetting
up his Standard, he required all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
on the North-ſide of <hi>Trent,</hi> upon their
Allegiance to repair to his Royal Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> for his juſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
defence. So that this is not an
obſolete and antiquated Notion of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
but ſuch as our Laws both ancient
and modern have ever exacted, ſuch as
the Sages of the Law have often inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
ſuch as our Kings have always claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and their Loyal Subjects have yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them in their neceſſity.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only obſerve further, That it
ſeems to be a Maxim univerſally receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all the Feudiſts and Lawyers;
<hi>Quod nemo potest eſſe Ligius du<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>um;</hi> or as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58004:7"/>
               <hi>Cowel</hi> after <hi>Skene</hi> expreſſes it, [That <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geancy
is ſuch a Duty or Fealty, as no man
may bear to more than one Lord.]</hi> And this
Rule is founded on that Aphoriſm of even
Truth it ſelf, <hi>No man can ſerve two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;</hi>
that is, two abſolute and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Maſters at once: For if one be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
to the other, then both may be
ſerved faithfully in a due ſubordination;
and thus the ſame perſon may be a Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
to an Inferior and a Capital Lord, to
a Subject and a Sovereign: But Ligeance
being now conſtantly taken for the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of Fidelity to a Sovereign Lord
againſt all men living; it would be a very
groſs contradiction to ſay, that the ſame
perſon may be the Liegeman of two So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Princes at once, becauſe it is
impoſſible he ſhould adhere to both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all men living; and this will be yet
more abſurd, if the two Sovereigns be
in open hoſtility, and mutually endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to deſtroy each other; for then
adher<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce to the one muſt neceſſarily be
Treaſon againſt the other; and the
Liegeman will be bound to aſſiſt, &amp; to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
to defend, and to deſtroy them both.
The reaſon of that Maxim therefore is
very evident. And hence it appears,
how abſurd it is to make Allegiance
ſignifie Neutrality; whereby the Subject
becomes the Liegeman of two Sovereign
Princes; or to ſpeak properly, of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
or elſe to ſignifie Fidelity to one
King with a Reſerve of aſſiſting ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
King to deſtroy him. But the Law
has no where obliged us to ſuch croſs
and contradictory Obligations: And as
for thoſe ſubtle Diſtinctions between a
higher and lower kind of Allegiance; an
Allegiance due to a King <hi>de facto,</hi> and
another at the ſame time to a King <hi>de
jure;</hi> an a ſolute and a conditioaate, an
active and an unactive; a reſerving and
an unreſerving Allegiance; I may ſay
concerning them (as Judge <hi>Jenkins</hi> did
of Acts of Parliament without the Kings
Aſſent, [That <hi>no man can ſhew any Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable,
L<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>er, or Line to au horize them in
the Books of the Law, or Printed Acts of
Parliament in any Age in this Land.]</hi> For
ſince it is not yet done, I preſume that
that it cannot; and it is another Maxim in
the interpretation of all Laws, Civil and
Divine <hi>[ubi Lex non diſtinguit, ibi non di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiirguendum
eſt.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such is the nature of that Allegiance
in general, which is univerſally due from
all the Subjects; and this is next to be
conſidered, as it is ſtil'd <hi>Legal Ligeanc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi>
and this doth not import, as the Word
ſeems to intimate, an Allegiance bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and circumſcribed by Law; but it is
therefore ſo called,<note place="margin">Calvin's Caſe.</note> becauſe the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
it of every Subject upon Oath, and
has preſcribed the Form and manner
of it.</p>
            <p>Though Allegiance be univerſally due
by all Laws, Civil, Natural and Divine;
yet the ſecurity of the Sovereign Power
being of ſuch vaſt importance to the
preſervation of Peace and Juſtice, and
even to the very Being of Law, and
Political Society, as that they cannot
poſſibly ſubſſſt without it: the wiſdom
of the Law has thought it neceſſary to
tie all thoſe Obligations faſter by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
bond of a Religious Oath, and to
aſſure the fidelity of the Subjects to their
Sovereign, by making God himſelf the
Guarantee and Surety of it. And hence
it is, that in all Ages, ſuch Oaths of true
Allegiance have been ever exacted of
all the Subjects of this Realm to the
Kings thereof: which, as it is the moſt
demonſtrative proof, that the Sovereign
Power was always acknowledged to be
theirs, Allegiance being an Eſſential
Right of Sovereignty, and never ſo much
as pretended to by any others; ſo it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
evident from the very Forms of thoſe
Oaths, (which have been different in
Words, but the ſame in Subſtance,)
that the Subjects were always bound to
an active, unconditionate, and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
Fidelity to their Princes.</p>

            <p>To this ſucceeded that, which the
Lord <hi>Coke</hi> calls <hi>Legal Ligeance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Calvin's Caſe.</note> or the
Common-Law Oath of Allegiance, which

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coke</hi> informs us, that Five things were

               <hi>[Firſt, That for the time of its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,

ſhall neither know nor hear of any ill, which
you ſhall not defend.]</hi> Such is the Ligeance,
which the Law has preſcribed in that
ancient Oath, which is ſtill in force. It
is neither circumſcribed by time nor
place; it is unconditionate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſerved;
it is not a lazy Paſſive Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
requiring nothing but pure Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion;
but an active and vigorous Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
exacting all that is in the Sphere
of Moral Poſſibility, and engaging us to
ſpend our deareſt Blood in the defence
of our Sovereign's Perſon, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of his Crown and Dignity to

            <p>

               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>that by the
Law all this Allegiance is due to the King's
Perſon. So the Lord</hi> Coke <hi>ſays it was
then reſolved by all the Judges,</hi> [That
Ligeance was due to the natural Perſon of
the King, (which is ever accompanied with
the Politick Capacity; and the Politick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
as it were appropriated to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Capacity) and not due to the Politick
Capacity only. And he adds, that when
the <hi>Spencers</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
this damnable Opinion, That Homage
and Oath of Ligeance was more by reaſon of
the King's Crown, that is of his Politick
Capacity, than by reaſon of the Perſon of
the King: this with the Conſequences they
deduced from it, was condemned by two
Parliaments as execrable and deteſtable
Doctrines; one in the Reign of <hi>Ed.</hi> 2.
and the other <hi>Anno</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Ed. 3. c.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And what was then reſolved,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Works, p. 71.</note> 
               <hi>Judge</hi>
Jenkins <hi>out of</hi> Plowden <hi>affirms was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
by all the Judges</hi> 1 Eliz. <hi>as the
Law of</hi> England, viz. [That the Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick,
and the natural Body make one Body,
and not diverſe, and are inſeparable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible.]<note place="margin">Ibid p. 16.</note>
               <hi>And hence the ſame Learned
Judge thought he had reaſon to infer,</hi>
[That the natural Perſon of King <hi>Charles</hi>
the Firſt being at <hi>Holmby</hi> (though under
Cuſtody, and <hi>de facto</hi> diveſted of his Regal

               </gap> was
there alſo, becauſe both did make but one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible
Body.] <hi>And hence it was, that
King</hi> Charles <hi>himſelf required all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Procl a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note>
[to take notice of the Law, that
Allegiance is due to the natural Perſon of
their Prince, and not to his Crown, or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
diſtinct from his natural Capacity;
and that by the Oath of Ligeance at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law, they were bound to be faithful
not to the King only, as King, but to our
Perſon, as King <hi>Charles.] Therefore I
conclude this Obſervation with that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion
of the ſame Judge</hi> Jenkins [That
Ligeance is due to the Natural Body,<note place="margin">Ibid p. 22.</note> and is
due by Nature, God's Law, and Man's Law,
cannot be ſo feited, nor renounced by any
means; it is inſeparable from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.]</p>
            <p>To return then to the Oaths of Lige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
preſcribed by the Law, it is further to
be obſerved, that tho the Common-Law
Oath was never yet aboliſhed, yet it has
been almoſt totally ſupplanted by that
larger Oath of Allegiance, which was
enacted <hi>Anno</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt;
and which many of us have taken to
K. <hi>J.</hi> the Second. And though this Oath
upon the diſcovery of the Powder Plot
was particularly framed, and deſign'd
to ſecure the King againſt the Treaſons
of the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> yet as K. <hi>James</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
does affirm in his Apology, that it
exacts no more, than what the ancient
Oaths of Allegiance did require; ſo it is
certain it exacts no leſs. For it is not
to be imagin'd, either that true Faith
and Allegiance in that Oath ſhould be
deſign'd to ſignifie leſs, than they always
did before; or that a leſs Security was
requir'd, when a greater was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But to prevent all Subterfuge, even
the expreſs Words of the Oath do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
oblige to the higheſt Duties of
Ligeance that can be. <hi>[I will bear true
Faith and Allegiance to the King, his Heirs,
and Succeſſors; and him, and them will
defend to the uttermoſt of my Power againſt
all Conſpiracies, and Attempts whatſoever,
that ſhall be made againſt his, or their

armatâ,</hi> who treating of the Protection
given by Sovereign Princes, ſaith [That
<hi>verbum protegere, neceſſitatem Deſendendi
cum armis importat;]</hi> and tells us, <hi>That
Subjects are in the ſame ſenſe reciprocally
bound to defend the Honour and Dignity of
the Sovereign:</hi> it may be underſtood
likewiſe from the Feudal Laws, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Vaſſal was obliged to a Military
defence of his Lord, and from the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal
Laws of this Kingdom alſo: which
oblige all the Subjects that are capable
to take up Arms for the King, when
need ſhall require. This therefore was
the Defence to which capable Perſons
were ſworn in that abrogated Oath; and
others were obliged to give him that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
which they were able, every<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>one
to the utmoſt of his Power in his
reſpective Capacity as the expreſs Words
of the Oath do require.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given a brief Account of
the ſeveral Forms of ſwearing Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
which have been ſucceſſively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of all the Subjects of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and upon the whole, I think it
ſufficiently appears, that the Laws have
been always Uniform, and conſtant in
obliging the Subjects to an Allegiance,
that requires not a peaceable Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
only, but alſo an actual aſſiſtance
of our Sovereign to the utmoſt of our
Power againſt all Perſons, and all At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
whatſoever without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            <p>And this is laſtly included in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of <hi>Natural Allegiance</hi> alſo; which
is not ſo called meerly becauſe the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
obliged by it are ſuch as have
their natural Birth within the King's
Dominions: For Perſons born without
the Realm may be his natural Subjects,
as are the Children of Embaſſadors born
beyond Sea;<note place="margin">Calvin<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               </note> and the Children of <hi>Aliens</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:58004:9"/>
born within the Kingdom are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Natural Subjects of the King: So
that the meer Circumſtance of Birth does
not entitle any one to the Priviledges
of a Natural Subject, nor conſequently
bind him to all the Duties of Natural
Allegiance. But it is therefore called
Natural in our Laws; becauſe, as great
Lawyers have affirm'd,<note place="margin">As Coke, Spelman, Jenkins, Vaughan.</note> it is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Law of Nature, which gives the
Sovereign Power a Right to the Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of every one, who is born under
the Juriſdiction of it. As every Son is
born a Subject to his Parents, and is by
the Law of Nature obliged to honour,
and obey, aſſiſt, and ſupport them: So
alſo is he born a Member of the Body
Politick, and by conſequence a Subject
to the Soveraign of it, and accordingly by
the ſame eternal Law is bound to pay
all Faithful Service and Obedience to
him, when he is in a Capacity to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them.</p>
            <p>By the Law of Nature here I mean,
that light of reaſon, which is given us
by the Author of Nature to direct us in all
our actions: and this light, when it is
ſufficiently attended to, and not dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with Paſſions, will clearly ſhew us
how we ſhould demean our ſelves in the
ſeveral capacities, and relations we ſtand
in. As it ſhews us what Obedience and
Fidelity a Servant owes to his Maſter, a
Wife to her Husband, and a Son to his
Father: ſo it plainly directs us what Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
every Member of a Civil Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
owes to the Supreme Governor of
it: and that this Law of Nature directs
us to pay the higheſt degree of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to him; <hi>viz.</hi> an active aſſiſtance to
the utmoſt of our power, is evident
both from reaſon, and from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
conſent and practice of almoſt all
civilized Mankind, the two only ways
of demonſtrating any Law of Nature.
And firſt it ſeems evident from theſe
following reaſons.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe ſuch aſſiſtance is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neceſſary to preſerve the head of the
Community, and conſequently the whole
Body alſo: for to every Political Body
a Sovereign Head is ſo Eſſential, as that
it cannot poſſibly exiſt without it. And
therefore ſince the natural reaſon of all
Men does dictate the neceſſity of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
into Societies; it muſt likewiſe
teach them the neceſſity of contributing
their actual aſſiſtance for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thoſe Societies, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of that Sovereign power, which is
Eſſen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ial to the very Being of them.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe every Subject has received
actual Protection, and in effect his very
Life and Being from the Sovereign
Power. For not only Property, and all
the Bleſſings of it, but the Conſervation
of even Life it ſelf are derived from
Civil Government: and therefore both
Juſtice and Gratitude do oblige us, to do
all we can, to preſerve the Being, and
the Rights of that Sovereign Power,
from which we derive our own. Our
Parents are the Inſtruments of our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Production, and for that reaſon we

               </gap>o honour and ſupport
them, though they prove never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
to us; becauſe it will be always
true, that we have received our Being
from them, and the Obligation of that
benefit will laſt as long as our lives.
Such is our Obligation to the Sovereign
Power. We have received our Lives,
and Properties from it; and it will be
always true, that we owe them to it:
and therefore, though it become never
ſo Tyrannical, ſtill the Obligation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying,
and aſſiſting it will remain. Our
gratitude muſt continue as long as we
enjoy the benefit; and civil oppreſſion
can no more ab<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>olve Subjects from their
Allegiance, than Domeſtick Cruelty can
diſcharge Children from the Duty of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
            <p>3. It may be proved alſo from the
Obligations of Equity and Juſtice, which
are certainly founded in the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Now the grand Fundamental Rules
of Juſtice are theſe. That we do to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as we would be done to our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58004:9"/>
ſelves; and that we give to every one
his due: and by both theſe equitable
Rules all Subjects are bound to aſſiſt and
ſupport their Sovereigns. By the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
becauſe every Subject does expect an
actual Protection of his Perſon and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
from the Sovereign power; and
that when he is diſabled, from contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
his aſſiſtance to ſupport it; and
therefore he is bound in Equity to give
the like aſſiſtance to his Sovereign in
times of neceſſity, and even when he
cannot actually exert his Power for the
protection of his Subjects. It is alſo due
by the latter; becauſe the Sovereign has
a Right to ſuch aſſiſtance of his Subjects
(I will not here ſay by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
for that is the thing, which I am
proving, but) by the poſitive Civil
Laws of this Kingdom. The Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
requires, that every Man ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
his Rights; and that is truly a Man's
Right, which is ſuch by a Politick Law;
and therefore ſince the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by the Political Laws of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
have a Right to the actual aſſiſtance
of their Subjects, to deny it them is a
violation not only of thoſe Laws, but
even of the Law of Nature alſo. But,</p>
            <p>4. There is yet a higher reaſon for
it, which reſpects the Author of all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty.
For even the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth teach us, that an infinite Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made the World, and that he ſtill
governs it; that from Him all lawful Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
is derived; and that Kings are
his Miniſters, and Vicegerents. And
hence it is obvious to infer, that every
Subject is bound not only to ſubmit, but
alſo to ſupport, and defend them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is every Mans duty to<note n="*" place="margin">Tertull. Apol. c. 32. Nos Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium Dei ſuſpicimus in Imperatoribus, qui Gentibus illos praefecit, id enim in eis ſcimus eſſe quod Deus voluit, ideoque &amp; ſalvum ipſum eſſe volumus, quod Deus voluit.</note> ſupport
that Government, which God himſelf
has eſtabliſhed over him.</p>
            <p>2. It is evident alſo from the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
practice, and conſent of almoſt all
Nations. This might be evinced from
an Induction of particulars. But I think
it will not be denied by any, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Civil Government has been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
and in what from ſoever, it has
been always thought the Duty of every
good Citizen, or Subject, to adhere to
the Sovereign power of his Country, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all his Enemies, and even to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
his own life for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it. And hence it is, that there is
hardly any Government in the World,
wherein every individual Perſon, that is
capable of bearing Arms, is not obliged
upon ſome great occaſions perſonally to
aſſiſt the Sovereign Power, and hazard
his life in its defence. And this is a
manifeſt Indication, that the Duties of
Allegiance were firſt taught Men by the
Light of Nature, ſince the univerſal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
of them can be aſcribed to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, but ſuch an univerſal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
            <p>Wherefore Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> had reaſon
to affirm,<note place="margin">The Caſe of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.</note> 
               <q>[That the Bond of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
doth not ariſe Originally from the
Oath of Allegiance; but it is ſo intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal,
proper, and eſſential a Duty, and
(as it were fundamental to the relation
of a Subject <hi>quà talis)</hi> as that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Whence he affirms theſe Inferences will

            <q>
               <p>1 That the Bond of Allegiance (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>2. That it is ſo inſeparable from the

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:58004:10"/>
3. That no Subject of <hi>England,</hi> that
hath either by taking the Oaths of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
and Allegiance acknowledged,
or otherwiſe believeth, that the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Power, to whom his Natural Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance

            </q>
            <p>And what was aſſerted by this great
Caſuiſt,<note place="margin">Calvin'<hi>s Caſe.</hi>
               </note> is for the ſubſtance of it deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
by the great Oracle of the Law;
who in the aforementioned Caſe reports,
that theſe Poſitions were debated, and
reſolved on by all the Judges. <q>[Firſt,
That the Ligeance of the Subject is due
by the Law of Nature. Secondly, That
the Law of Nature is part of the Law
of <hi>England.</hi> Thirdly, That the Law
of Nature was long before any Munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Law. Fourthly, That it is immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
It appears, ſays he, by demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative
reaſon, that Ligeance of the
Subject to the Sovereign was before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Municipal or Judicial Laws. Firſt;
For that Government and Subjection
were long before any Municipal Laws.
Secondly, It had been in vain to have
preſcribed Laws to any, but to ſuch as
owed Ligeance before: <hi>fruſtr à enim fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runtur
leges, niſi ſubditis, &amp; obedientibus.</hi>
Seeing then, that Ligeance is due by
the Law of Nature, it follows, that the
ſame cannot be altered, or taken away.
For albeit Municipal Laws have in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times and places impoſed ſeveral
puniſhments for Breach of the Law of
Nature; yet the Law of Nature it ſelf,
never was, nor could be changed: and
this, ſays he, appears plainly, and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
in our Law-Books.]</q> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he argues thus upon the ſame
Principle. <q>Whatſoever is due only by
Law and Conſtitution of Man may be
alter'd; but naturally the Ligeance of
the Subject to the Sovereign cannot be
alter'd; therefore it is not due only by
the Law and Conſtitution of Man. [And
again, Whatſoever is due by the Law
of Nature cannot be altered: but Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
is due by the Law of Nature:
therefore it cannot be alter'd.]</q> Thus
far that famous Lawyer; and thus far
have I conſider'd the ſignification of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,
as it is founded in the Laws,
and explained by Lawyers.</p>
            <p>I am further to conſider it, as a word
of vulgar ſignification alſo; and as it is
taken, and underſtood by the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the People of this Nation. For
all the Subjects of this Kingdom being
obliged by Law, and immemorial Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom,
to ſwear Allegiance to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
it is not credible they ſhould be
ignorant of the true meaning of it.
Thoſe Law terms, in which few are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
are by few underſtood: but ſuch
as are of univerſal concernment muſt
of neceſſity be alſo univerſally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.
Who knows not the meaning of
<hi>Parliament, Jury, Aſſizes,</hi> that is of any
underſtanding? The word <hi>Allegiance</hi> is
of more near, and univerſal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to all Men; it is therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd,
that no Subject can be ignorant
of it. The Oaths themſelves, which the
Subjects have ever been enured to have,
ſufficiently taught them the Duties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by it. That they muſt pay due
Obedience to the King; that they muſt
never aſſiſt his Enemies; that they muſt
uphold his Crown, and ſometimes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
even their Lives and Fortunes in
his Service. Thus much Nature it ſelf does
teach them, as it teaches Children to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the ſame Duties towards Parents.
But there is no need of proving a thing
to be that, which it is. Moſt certain it
is, that all Men of tolerable underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
even among the common People,
do know, that all theſe Duties are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in true Allegiance. Ask any
Man of common ſenſe, whether he, who
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58004:10"/>
has ſworn true Faith and Allegiance to
K. <hi>W.</hi> does not violate his Oath, if at
any time he aſſiſt K. <hi>J.</hi> to dethrone
him? Whether he is not bound to be
faithful to him againſt all his Enemies?
To diſcover all the deſigns of K. <hi>J.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, that ſhall come to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?
And when it is in his power, and
neceſſity requires it, to contribute his
actual Aſſiſtance alſo to oppoſe his Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the Crown? I make no Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
but he will anſwer, that his Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
binds him to all this; and that
he is plainly perjur'd, if he does not
perform it.</p>
            <p>The Underſtandings of the common
People, as they are not capable of thoſe
Subtilties, which men of Learning are
enur'd to; ſo are they ſeldom pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with thoſe nice and ſophiſtical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions,
by which men of Subtilty
perplex things plain and eaſie in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
A Mechanick, and a Peaſant
apprehend what Motion is, and what is
Perjury, as well as the acuteſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
or the deepeſt Divine; and they
know what Allegiance and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
imply, as well as the ableſt Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer;
and if you go about to blunder
their underſtandings with Diſtinctions,
and Objections, they are but where
they we<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, and will ſtill clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
what they underſtood before.
And if all men would act with the ſame
plainneſs, and ſincerity; if they would
be true to their own ſenſe, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
aud not diſguiſe them with
Artifice, and Subtilty, there would poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
have been no need of the preſent
Enquiry; nor of proving, that Faith
and Allegiance are not capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
ſenſes; that they ſignifie the
ſame Duties now, which always they
have done; that, when they are ſworn
to one Sovereign, they are incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable
at the ſame time to any other;
that we muſt not bind our ſelves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
Obligations; and cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be faithful to K. <hi>W.</hi> againſt all his
Enemies, and to K. <hi>J.</hi> againſt all his
Enemies alſo.</p>
            <p>And now I hope, it appears, That
the Words, <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>true Allegiance,</hi>
in the Oath, do not ſignifie meer
Submiſſion and Obedience only; but
alſo faithful Service, and actual Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of our Sovereign againſt all his
Enemies. True it is, that <hi>the Oaths of
Allegiance</hi> are in the Law ſometimes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Oaths of Obedience:</hi> But Obedience
then does import the whole Duty of a
Subject to his Sovereign, and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
a peaceable conformity to the
Laws, abſtracting from all the other Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of a Subject. And this I think
may be proved from theſe Reaſons. Firſt,
Becauſe Obedience, in its utmoſt Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
does comprehend the Duties of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and Aſſiſtance alſo. For every act of
Duty is an act of Obedience; and therefore
if actual aſſiſtance be a Duty to diſcharge,
it is Obedience. Secondly, The ſame
Oath is more often called the Oath of
Fidelity, and the Oath of Allegiance:
And therefore if Fidelity and Allegiance
do (as I have ſhewn) imply more than
peaceable ſubmiſſion, and conformity
to the Laws; it will not follow, that it
does not imply ſo much, becauſe the
ſame Oath is ſometimes expreſſed by
another word. Thirdly, Peaceable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
and Obedience to the Laws, do
amount to no more, than ſuch a Local
Allegiance, as is due from Aliens; and I
am pretty certain, that the Laws re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
ſomething more of natural <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Subjects by virtue of their Allegiance,
than they do from <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi>
while they are in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This confounding of Allegiance and
preciſe Obedience to the lawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of a Sovereign <hi>de facto,</hi> is a very
common and obvious Miſtake. Thus the
Author of the <hi>Paſtoral Letter,</hi> brings
this Argument to prove the lawfulneſs of
taking this Oath in Queſtion; <hi>[If it is
lawful to obey the King, it is lawful to
promiſe to do it; and if ſo, it alſo is lawful
to ſwear it;]</hi> therefore it is lawful to
take the Oath of Allegiance. Which is
juſt ſuch an Argument as this: If it be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58004:11"/>
lawful to bow before the King, it is
lawful to pay Divine Adoration to him;
and if ſo, it is alſo lawful to ſwear,
that I will pay Divine Worſhip to him.
For as Religious Worſhip implies a great
deal more, than Civil; ſo does Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
contain more, than preciſe Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
I may lawfully obey a High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-man,
and I may lawfully ſwear it;
but I ſuppoſe it will not follow thence,
that I may lawfully ſwear to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and bear true Allegiance to him.
It was lawful to ſwear Obedience to
<hi>Cromwel</hi> in all lawful things; but I
think there were few, even in that Age
of Uſurpations, that were ſo hardy, as
to aſſert the lawfulneſs of ſwearing Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
to that Unnatural Uſurper.
Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> proves, that it may be
our duty to obey the Laws of an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper,
not out of any regard to his
Authority, which, he ſays, is none at
all; but upon other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations:

againſt ſwearing Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
to Uſurpers. Both
he, and all the Conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Divines of that Age,
could eaſily diſtinguiſh Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
from Obeying; and
ſo may any one, that is not
abſolutely reſolved againſt
it. The <hi>Paſtoral</hi> Author adds indeed,
[That <hi>Allegiance, in our preſent acceptation,
is Obedience according to Law,]</hi> Which is
true, if Obedience be taken in its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
latitude; but then it will include
an Obligation to aſſiſt K. <hi>W.</hi> againſt all his
Enemies; and in this ſenſe, they, who
refuſe the Oath, will I preſume, refuſe
alſo to obey him.</p>
            <p>It has been objected further, <hi>That,
whereas the actual Aſſiſtance of the King
againſt all Attempts whatſoever, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
either expreſly, or in words equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
in all the former Oaths of Allegiance;
but in the preſent Oath it is wholly omitted,
and therefore it may reaſonably be preſum'd,
That where leſs is expreſſed, leſs is required;
and that, if the Impoſers had intended ſuch
actual Aſſiſtance, they would probably in
plain words have required it.</hi> What the
Reaſons were of making this, and other
Alterations in the new Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
as I have no means of knowing,
ſo neither is it of any moment to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
To the Objection propoſed, it
will ſuffice to anſwer, That the Duty of
actual Aſſiſtance againſt all men living,
is ſufficiently expreſſed in it: For in
the Oath we are required to ſwear true
Allegiance, and that does <hi>vi termini</hi>
import ſuch an Obligation: and as no
particular Duties of Allegiance are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in the Oath, ſo neither are any
excepted; and therefore we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to all the Duties of it: and what
thoſe are, may be underſtood from the
Laws, and the common acceptation of
the Word it ſelf; which, as I have ſhewn,
has always ſignified an adherence to the
Liege Lord againſt all men living. And if
the bare omiſſion of particularizing this
Duty, is an argument, that it was not
intended; then was no particular Duty
intended, for there is none expreſſed:
and ſo the reſult will be, that when we
ſwear Allegiance, we take God's Name
in vain, and ſwear to nothing at all.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>But there is one Objection more,
which muſt be conſidered,</hi> viz. <hi>That</hi> this
is an Oath impoſed upon Clergy-men, as
well as others: and that ſince the Laws
have ever exempted them from Military
Services, it is certain their Allegiance doth
not bind them to it; and therefore the
Allegiance required in the Oath, is not ſuch,
as I have hitherto aſſerted, becauſe it does
not univerſally bind the Subjects to an
Active Military aſſiſtance of the Sovereign
againſt all his Enemies.</p>
            <p>But this Objection will be of no
force, if it be conſidered,</p>
            <p>1. That Allegiance binds in general to
the defence of the King's Crown, and
Perſon; which implies many other po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
Dutie<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>-beſides Military Aſſiſtance;
as, Aids of Money, and Advice, Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of Conſpiracies, and the like. Now
if the Laws, which have obliged Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in general, do exempt Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks
from the Military Duties of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
then there is an expreſs exception
of them as to thoſe Duties; and this very
Exception does ſhew, that they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to all the other Duties of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
which are as abſolutely inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
with a peaceable Neutrality, as
the Military Aſſiſtance can poſſibly be.
But,</p>
            <p>2. Though the Laws have ordinarily
exempted Clergy-men from taking up
Arms in the Defence of their Sovereign,
yet it was never doubted, but that in
Caſes of extream neceſſity, when the
Life of the Prince is in imminent danger,
and there are no other Perſons to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it, and it is in the power of a
Churchman to ſave it, though with the
hazard of his own, that in ſuch an Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
he is bound by his Allegiance to a
Perſonal and Military aſſiſtance of him:
and therefore it is ſtill true, that all the
Subjects are bound by their Allegiance
to a Military defence of their Soveraign,
when neceſſity ſhall require it. And
yet further.</p>
            <p>3. Though Spiritual Perſons are not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
obliged to defend their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
with ſecular Arms; yet their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
binds them to do it with Arms
more prevalent, and efficaſious, <hi>viz.</hi>
Prayers, and Interceſſions with God for
their ſafety, and Victory over all their
Enemies. Thus <hi>Zouch</hi> tells us out of the

a Branch of Allegiance moſt eſpecially
incumbent upon them, who wait at the

be required of them, and a greater, and
more beneficial Service cannot poſſibly
be perform'd by any one. And it was
never yet heard, that a Church-man
could with a good Conſcience ſwear Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
to a Prince; and yet could not
pray, that he might have Victory over
all his Enemies. This is a branch of
Allegiance, which our Church has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
required of us in her Liturgy;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V. Comber</hi> upon the Litargy. p. 242.</note>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58004:12"/>
be the duty peculiarly of Churchmen,
then it is their duty undoubtedly in their
Stations to contribute all other actual
Aſſiſtance alſo; and if this be a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
branch of Allegiance; then it is
evident, that we cannot ſwear Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with a deſign of Neutrality, or a
reſerve of Allegiance to K. <hi>J.</hi> for then
we ſhould be obliged to pray recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
backward, and forward, that <hi>J.</hi> may
vanquiſh <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>W.</hi> vanquiſh <hi>J.</hi> and
that both may have Victory over all
their Enemies, when they are irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable
Enemies to each other.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to conclude this Point.
If it be true (as I have endeavoured to
prove) that Faith, and true Allegiance
in the Conſtruction of the Law; and the
common Senſe and Underſtanding of the
People, do ſignifie ſuch an Allegiance,
as is expreſſed in the higheſt Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Oath; it is evident, that
this Conſtruction is the true declared
meaning of it. For the declared mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
muſt be expreſſed in Words, and
Words muſt be underſtood according to
the known, the uſual, and genuine Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of them; and if Men will
take a liberty of impoſing a quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſenſe upon them at their pleaſure,
there is an end of all Promiſes and
Oaths, of all Faith and Commerce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Mankind; and then I know not
why in the preſent Oath <hi>W.</hi> may not
ſignifie <hi>J.</hi> and Allegiance Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have been proving, that
the Reaſon and Intention of the Oath,
and the words themſelves in which it
is expreſſed, do neceſſarily oblige us to
the higheſt Conſtruction of it: And
where there is a manifeſt concurrence
of both theſe in the Interpretation of
an Oath, than there is nothing wanting
to induce a Moral certainty of the true
meaning of it. But becauſe the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Impoſer may be ſearched
into by other means, beſides the
naked force of the Words, as by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
Conjectures grounded upon Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances;
and their other Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Proceedings, which have ſome
relation to the Matter of the Oath; I
will proceed to ſhew, that even theſe
alſo do afford reaſonable grounds to
perſwade the Senſe, I have here aſſerted,
to be the true meaning of it.</p>
            <p>But here there are two Cautions to
be premiſed. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That when the
words of the Law do according to the
Vulgar, Cuſtomary, or legal Acceptation
of them, evidently expreſs the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Lawgiver,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr</hi> Taylor <hi>Ductor du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit.</hi> p. 123. Suarez <hi>de leg.</hi> p. 190. n. 7.</note> then the Enquiry
into the ſame Intention by Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Appendages, is of no impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
for the Words are the firſt and
principal Sign of the Intention, and
when they do clearly repreſent it, the
Conſcience of the Subject is obliged to
the very Words; otherwiſe it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
we ſhould be aſcertain'd of the
meaning of any Law; if no words, how
clear ſoever, can expreſs it; and ſo to
make a Law would be a thing impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,<note place="margin">Taylor <hi>ibidem.</hi>
               </note>
becauſe the Will of the Lawgiver
could not poſſibly be expreſſed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Secondly, The Words of the Law
being the beſt and ſureſt means of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
the Intention; unleſs clear,
and manifeſt Evidence can be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to ſhew,<note place="margin">Suarez. p. 418.</note> that the Intention of the
Lawgiver is quite different from what
the natural ſenſe of the words does
import; the genuine Signification of
them is always to be adhered to. So
ſays the Civil-Law expreſly <hi>[non aliter a
ſignificatione verborum ejus recedi, quàm
cùm manifeſtum aliud ipſum ſenſiſſe.]</hi> and
the neceſſity of this Rule is evident; for
if it were allowed to recede from the
words but upon manifeſt Evidence of
a different Intention, every one might
wreſt the Law as he pleaſed, and the
Law would not be the meaſure of Duty,
but the Subjects Arbitrary Gloſſes on
it.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing therefore, not granting, that
the words of the Oath do not clearly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58004:12"/>
repreſent the Intention of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
proceed we now to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the true meaning of it, from Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
and other Actions of the
Impoſers. And,</p>
            <p>1. I conſider, that the Parliament, in
the Act declaring the Rights, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the Subject, and ſettling the
Succeſſion of the Crown, have impoſed
[this and no other Oath] upon their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Officers and Soldiers: And it ſeems
very abſurd to imagine, that they ſhould
intend to oblige them only to a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Neutrality; or leave it lawful for
them, notwithſtanding the Oath, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
K. <hi>J.</hi> againſt themſelves. But if
on the contrary it be reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that they intended to oblige their
Soldiers to an active aſſiſtance of K.
<hi>William</hi> againſt all his Enemies; then
of neceſſity, according to the Intention
of the Impoſers, the very words of the
Oath do oblige them to it: And if ſo,
I cannot comprehend, why the ſame
words ſhould not oblige all others alſo
in their reſpective Capacities to the like
aſſiſtance: Or why the Legiſlators
ſhould intend the Oath to be taken by
different Perſons in contradictory Senſes,
and bind one to be a Neuter, another
to be Active for the Government, and
allow a Third to be active againſt it.</p>
            <p>2. It is certain, that the Preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
has exacted of all Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
an actual aſſiſtance of it (as great
at leaſt as that which is required of
Soldiers) even againſt K. <hi>J.</hi> For they
are obliged under great Penalties, to
inſert K. <hi>W.</hi> in the Liturgy, and to pray
that he may have Victory over all his
Enemies; among whom his greateſt,
and moſt implacable Enemy, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
that is actually endeavouring to wreſt
his Crown and dignity from him, muſt
needs be comprehended. And thus to
pray, is the greateſt aſſiſtance to the one,
and oppoſition to the other, that can be
imagined. And hence it ſeems natural
to infer; that they, who have exacted
this, would not afterwards Enact an
Oath to oblige them to a meer Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality;
or leave them a reſerve of their
old Allegiance to K. <hi>J.</hi> What reaſon
can there be poſſible aſſign'd for this;
that they, who were antecedently bound
to more, ſhould be afterwards ſworn to
leſs; or that our Preſent Governours
ſhould oblige Clergymen to pray againſt
all their Enemies, and then allow them
to aſſiſt thoſe Enemies, or diſcharge
them from aſſiſting the Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them.</p>
            <p>3. Though every breach of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
is not puniſhed as Treaſon by the
Law, yet all Treaſon is certainly a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Allegiance; therefore whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
is branded, or puniſhed as Treaſon
by the Lawgivers, and Impoſers of this
Oath, is very probably intended to be
forbidden by it. Whether this Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
be not reaſonable, I appeal to
the common Senſe of all Men; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any thing can be more natural,
than to conclude, that the Lawgivers
intended in this Oath of Allegiance to
prevent, what they deſign'd to puniſh as
a violation of it; and to bind the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to Fidelity, not only for Wrath,
but alſo for Conſcience ſake. But it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
to all Men, that the Impoſers of
this Oath, have treated the Aſſiſters of
K. <hi>J.</hi> as guilty of High Treaſon; that
Bills have been propoſed for the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of their Eſtates, and Tryal of their
Perſons; that they have impriſoned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
upon ſuſpicion of ſiding with K. <hi>J.</hi>
and actually Arraigned others for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſing
his Proclamations: And have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Condemn'd and hang'd one, for ſaying
he rais'd Men to aſſiſt him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we cannot but conclude; that they,
who puniſhed ſuch aſſiſtance, as a breach
of Allegiance, did deſign, when they
obliged us to ſwear Allegiance to debar
us from it. Thus it is evident the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of K. <hi>J.</hi> is forbid in the Oath;
and it will be further evident, that ſo
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58004:13"/>
is a Neutrality alſo; if it be conſidered,
that there is no doubt, but even the
not diſcovering of any deſigns of K. <hi>J.</hi>
againſt the Crown and Dignity of K. <hi>W.</hi>
that ſhould come to our knowledg,
would be puniſhed by the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
as an Offence contrary to our
due Allegiance to him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſince ſuch a diſcovery is plainly
inconſiſtent with an exact Neutrality;
it is obvious to infer, that a Neutrali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which in the Judgment of our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers
is againſt our due Allegiance, is
forbidden by them in the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance.</p>
            <p>4. Laſtly, The higheſt Conſtruction
of the Oath ſeems to be moſt agreeable
to all the Principles, and Proceedings of
the Impoſers. This might be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
by many particulars, but moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
from the very <hi>Inſtrument of
Government,</hi> wherein this Oath had its
Birth. There they firſt declare, That
K. <hi>J.</hi> had abdicated the Government,
and that the Throne was thereby va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant:
then they confer the Royal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
upon <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> as King and Queen
of <hi>England;</hi> and then annex the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Oath of Allegiance to be ſworn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them. So that if we take all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we may probably conclude, that
they intended a full, abſolute, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſerved
Allegiance to them. By their
firſt Declaration it appears, to be their
Intention, that no Allegiance ſhould be
paid to K. <hi>J.</hi> for to No King, No Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
is due: By the ſecond, That all
our Allegiance ſhould be paid to <hi>W.</hi> and
<hi>M.</hi> for there being no other Sovereign
according to this Declaration, it muſt be
all due unto them alone. And the new
Oath being then immediately added, is
it not rational to interpret it in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity
to thoſe Declarations; which do
manifeſtly diſcover it to be the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Impoſers, that all our Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
ſhould be paid to the preſent
Princes, without any reſervation of the
ſame Duty to K. <hi>J;</hi> who according to
that Inſtrument has no more Right, than
the <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary</hi> to it. And I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
it will not be denied, That the
Intention of the Oath is the ſame in
the Law, as it was in the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But to this it is replied, That though
it be true, that in the Judgment of the
Impoſers, all our Allegiance is due to K.
<hi>W.</hi> and none at all to K. <hi>J:</hi> yet if it
be conſider'd, that when the Form of
the Oath was under Debate, the word
<hi>Rightful</hi> was ſtruck out, upon excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made, that many ſcrupulous Perſons
would thereupon refuſe to take it; and
ſo the Form was paſſed without it.
This may be well taken for a ſufficient
Indication, that it was the Intention of
the Impoſers, that we ſhould ſwear Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
to the K. and Q. only as ſuch
<hi>de facto;</hi> and conſequently, that they
did not intend to oblige us to ſuch a
high degree of Allegiance as is due to a
K. <hi>de Jure:</hi> and therefore that it is not
neceſſary to take the Oath in the higheſt
Conſtruction of it.</p>
            <p>This ſeems to be the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
reaſon, that is urged for the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the old ſenſe of Allegiance;
and I hope to give a ſatisfactory Anſwer
to it. And I Anſwer,</p>
            <p>1. That though the deliberate omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the word <hi>Rightful</hi> does neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
infer, that we are not obliged in
this Oath to a Recognition of the right
to the Crown: yet it does not infer,
that we are not obliged to pay as high
a degree of Allegiance, as to any Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
King whatſoever. That omiſſion is
an argument, that the word <hi>King</hi> in the
Oath does not neceſſarily ſignifie a King
<hi>de jure:</hi> but it is no argument, that true
Allegiance does not ſignifie true Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
that is, an Obligation to adhere
to the King againſt all his Enemies. For
there was uo Debate, that we know of,
about the Senſe of the word <hi>Allegiance;</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:58004:13"/>
neither is there any Intimation given,
that they deſign'd to reſtrain it to a
lower ſignification, though it was plainly
neceſſary to do it, if they intended to
alter the commonly received meaning
of it. Wherefore as the ſtriking out
the word <hi>Rightful</hi> would not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that they did not intend to oblige
us to an active aſſiſtance of K. <hi>W.</hi> againſt
all Men living; if thoſe words had been
expreſly inſerted in the Oath: ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will it prove, that the ſame Duty
is not now required of us, if the word
<hi>Allegiance</hi> do, as I have proved, <hi>vi ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi>
import it; and that as fully, as if
it had been in expreſs words required
in it.</p>
            <p>2. That an abatement of Allegiance
is not neceſſarily inferr'd in that omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
does appear from hence; becauſe
it might be the Judgment of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers,
that a plenary, and unreſerved
Allegiance was due by the Laws of this
Kingdom even to a K. <hi>de facto;</hi> as much
as if he were K. <hi>de jure</hi> alſo: and if
that were their opinion; then we have
a rational, and eaſie account of that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<hi>viz.</hi> that ſince the higheſt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
was thought due to a King <hi>de
facto,</hi> it was not neceſſary to create ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
by inſiſting on the word <hi>Rightful,</hi>
ſince the work of the Law might be as
effectually done without it, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Governors ſecured by obliging the
Subjects to ſwear Allegiance to them.
And that this was probably the true
reaſon of that Omiſſion muſt needs be
granted, if it be conſider'd how that
opinion is become almoſt univerſal, and
has been publickly countenanced, and
aſſerted not only in ſo many Licens'd
Pamphlets, but by our Lawyers and
Judges, and even by our Law-givers
themſelves. However it clearly ſhews,
that the Omiſſion of the word <hi>Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
does not manifeſtly prove their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to oblige us to a lower degree of
Allegiance: And the rule of the Law
is here to be applied, that we muſt
not recede from the Cuſtomary ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the words of the Oath,
when there is no manifeſt Neceſſity
for it.</p>
            <p>Further, If it be objected, That many
Members of both Houſes of Parliament
have declared, that the Oath was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
only to oblige us to live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
under the Government; I anſwer,
That thoſe words ſeem more ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
than the words of the Oath; that
the utmoſt extent of them may reach
to a full and unreſerved Allegiance;
that probably there are not many that
will ſay, that they did not intend to
debar us from paying any Allegiance
to K. <hi>J.</hi> and if they ſhould, there are
more who will declare the contrary;
and that laſtly, the Declaration of thoſe
Members is no authentical Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for when the Aſſembly of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
is ended, they are not to be
conſider'd, as Law-givers, but as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Perſons; and they have no more
Authority to interpret Statutes, than
they have to make them.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, If it be yet further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
That the Government not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the Declarations, which have
been publickly made by many, <hi>[That
they took the Oath in no other Senſe, but
that of a peaceable Submiſſion,]</hi> does
imply a tacit approbation of it. The
anſwer is obvious: That the not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
thoſe Declarations does not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to the approving of them, as
the Senſe of the Impoſers; but only
to a connivence at them for ſome Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
end, and deſign: And in ſhort,
no Man will ſay, That not oppoſing
is approving; or, that the Government
does always allow of that, which it does
not puniſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:58004:14"/>
And thus have I ſomewhat more
largely, than at firſt I intended, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
the Nature of Allegiance, and
aſſerted the higheſt Conſtruction of the
Oath to be the genuine meaning of
it. And, I hope, it will be allowed,
that this diſcourſe has ſufficiently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
if not the certainty of that
Conſtruction, yet at leaſt the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of the other Interpretations
of it.</p>
            <p>And then if any one, after all that
has been here offered, ſhall remain
doubtful about the true Senſe of the
Oath; I ſhall only put him in mind
of that neceſſary Caution of Dr. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon,</hi>
