         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64054:3"/>I will let pass the curious Questions of the Schools, as what God did before the World was created, in what time of the Year, upon what Day it was Created: why God did not create the World sooner, &amp;c. 'tis knowledge enough to know, that God did create the World.</p>
            <p>Now God hath drawn and framed all things out of nothing; for that is properly to create, <hi>viz.</hi> to make something of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The School-men observe this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>inter Genita, Facta, &amp; Creata,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween things begotten, things made, and things created: Things are begotten of their own matter; they be made of another mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; they be created of no matter. We and all things are said to have been created by God, because he made us of nothing, that is, of no pre-existent matter, but <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, of things that were not before, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beeing to that which had not beeing: now when I say, God made all things of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; <hi>Nothing</hi> is to be taken <hi>negative,</hi> nor <hi>privative,</hi> that is, God created all things out of pure nothing. The Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have a maxim indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>ex nihilo nihil fit</hi>: but (as one well distinguisheth) that is to be understood, <hi>de generatione Physica, non Creatione Divina;</hi> of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Generation, not of Divine Creation. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:64054:4"/>
must have something wherewith to work, something whereon to work; God had neither of both when he created the first matter, out of which afterwards he created other things, called by <hi>Moses, Tohu vabohu;</hi> by Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, <hi>Chaos:</hi> he had neither Instrument to work with, nor matter to work upon; <hi>he commanded only,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>and all was made; spake the word only, and all was Created. God said, let there be Light, &amp;c.</hi> Which supposeth no matter to work upon but God by the Power of his word created it: Omnipotency can effect things without matter, Creation is an act of Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency. Angels, and the Souls of Men were created of nothing, without matter, because immaterial; God therefore can as well cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, other things. If God created the World from some matter, then that matter had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it self, or from another: if from another, then that was created of nothing; if from it self, then should it be the same with God, because only God is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from himself; to affirm that, were Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</p>
            <p>Now God only can, and did create, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God only is Omnipotent, and Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency is an incommunicable attribute: there is an infinite distance between <hi>ens &amp; non ens.</hi> Besides, every thing that is created

is good only by participation; therefore it is necessary all things receive their goodness from that which is essentially good, which is God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Moreover, if God created some, and not all Creatures, but left the Creation of inferiour creatures to any else, then it was either because God was weary, or because God takes no care of smaller Creatures; but it is neither; God being Omnipotent, did by a Word Create; What more easie? and he takes care of all inferiour things.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There is no express mention made of an immediate approbation of this Days work. <hi>1.</hi> Because this work of distinguishing and setling the Waters in their place, was then imperfect, but was compleated on the third Day. <hi>2.</hi> Because on this Day (as some think) Hell was created, which simply in it self is not pleasing to God; or because the Angels fell on this Day, and became Devils by their apostacy, as others imagine.</p>
            <p>It is also observable, that in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the lights that were dispersed for three days, were on the fourth day all found in the Sun.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest. 2.</hi> It may in the next place be demanded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Why God, between the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Plants, and of Animals, did interpose the Creation of the Stars?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, that he might shew, although ordinarily the Sun and other
<pb facs="tcp:64054:7"/>
Stars do concur to the generation of Plants as well as of Animals; yet the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things is not simply to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Sun and Stars, but to God; who before the Stars were created, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Earth to bring forth Herbs and Plants yielding seed, and the fruit-Tree to yield fruit after his kind. <hi>Gen. 1.11.</hi> Before the Creation of Animals, he would create the Light, because for the most part they have need of the light in a special manner. Moreover, ye may take notice, that when God made the Fishes of the Sea, and the Fowls of Heaven, he blessed them, saying, <hi>Be fruitfull and multiply, and fill the Waters in the Sea, and let Fowl mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply in the Earth, &amp;c. Vers. 22.</hi> But when he made the brute Beasts of the Earth, we do not read that he gave any such blessing at all to them; intimating to us, that he that will get that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing which God giveth unto good Men, he mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:64054:7"/>
Stars, and the Earth, and all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he saw that they were all good: but when he created Man, he doth not so particularly pronounce this of him, as he doth of other Creatures; he doth not say, that he was good or bad; yet are not these Creatures better than Man, but inferiour to Man, being all made for the use of Man: the reason is, because God would leave him to his choice to choose good or evil to him self,<note place="margin">

            <p>

               </gap>; noting out to us, that Man was partly from the dust of the ground, in regard of his body, partly from Heaven in regard of his Soul, but the Beasts were only created of the dust of the ground. The Antients called the fabrick of Man's body, <hi>Librum Dei,</hi> the Book of God, because much knowledge is taught to Man out of Man. And Man's

being created after the Image of God, is to put him in remembrance, that he should continually work after that Original Copy which God gave him from Heaven. I shall discourse no farther upon these things, because this ensuing Treatise of our Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Author will furnish you with variety of most excellent Meditations upon the whole Story of the Creation.</p>

                  </gap>t which was created, to which it was coexistent
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64054:14"/>
But as the distinction of Creatures began, so did the distinction of Time: so the Light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>— In the beginning of Time confused, and not distinctly measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, was the Creation of that confused Mass, and lump of things not distinctly ordered: In the beginning of Time distinctly measured, <hi>viz.</hi> on the first Day of Time, was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the distinct and orderly Creation of things; the Light which was the first distinct Creature, and the first Day of Time begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together. So we have it, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Thou Lord in the beginning hast laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. Who made all things?] The Text saith, <hi>God.</hi> Here two things are to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. 1, The Persons in the God-head which did Create. 2. The manner of working.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st, we must note that all the Persons in the Holy Trinity did create: there is no doubt of the Father, who as he is the first Person in order of subsisting, so is he always the first in order of working. The second Person is plainly mentioned. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the begi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ning was the Word, &amp;c. By him all things were made, and without him nothing was made that was made,</hi> Verse 3. Of the Holy Ghost
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64054:15"/>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> speaketh in the second Verse of this first Chapter of <hi>Genesis. And the spirit of God mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon the Waters</hi>; or hovered and sate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a Bird upon her Egges; by his divine vertue, framing the several distinct Creatures out of the common Mass, as she by her natural warmth bringeth forth her young ones after her kind, with all the distinct parts of their bodies, out of the shapeless lump of matter in the Egge; according to this sense do the best Expositors take that metaphor: so saith the Psalmist, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 104.30. <hi>Thou send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est forth thy spirit, they are created.</hi> So that the Father createth by the Son, through the vertue of the Holy Ghost. And therefore, albeit we use to call God the Father the Maker of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, as is expressed in our Creed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet must we not exclude the Son and the Holy Ghost, although the Father be first in order of working. Thus you see that <hi>God</hi> made all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 16.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now we must consider in what manner all things were thus wrought by him. 1. <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily,</hi> of his own free will. 2. Without the help or use of any Instruments. The Psalmist saith, <hi>Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in Heaven and in Earth, in the Seas, and all deep places. Psal.</hi> 135.6 Now we see, the more excellent any Creature is, the more free in its works. The Trees and Plants grow up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all liberty, by a natural necessity, having no sense of that which they do, and without any freedome of choice or voluntary manner of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64054:15"/>
doing. The sensible creatures, Beasts, Birds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. As they are of a more excellent nature than the former; so they have some shadow of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, doing that which is pleasing to them, and refusing things distastfull: yet this is no true and perfect liberty, because they have not the light of reason to guide them to liberty or freedome of will in choosing things, or refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. But Man at his Creation, and the blessed Angels that kep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> their first estate, have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect liberty in their kinds, though subordinate to him that gave it, yet vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>untarily choosing or refusing, according to the Light of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now then it must needs f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llow, that God who is infinite perfection, is perfectly and absolutely free in all his works, and so in this work of Creation: he cannot be imagined to have any to command him, he being the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Commander, and absolute Soveraign over all: he cannot be conceived to have any need of any thing created, and by it to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to make them, (as some are constrained to work for need<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who otherwise would be idle) sith he is infinitely and absolutely All-sufficient, to whose eternal happiness and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection nothing can be added, no not by ten thousand Worlds. And as he made all things voluntarily; so likewise without the use or help of any Instruments: only by his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Word. So you see all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>long in this Chapter; <hi>He said, let there be light, and there was light, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Psalm.</hi> 148.5, <hi>He command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they mere created.</hi> So that by his spirit,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64054:16"/>
the eternal Word, he made the World, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the use or help of any Instrumen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Of what matter they were made] Of nothing. In all the artificial works of Men, we look to the stuff or matter, out of which they were made: but here was none; God made all things meerly of nothing; there was no matter preceding his work. It is true! there was a common, rude, unwrought lump of things, before the distinct and orderly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things, out of which distinct and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Creatures were framed: but this also was created by God; so that originally all things were created of nothing. <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.3. <hi>All things were made by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>im.</hi> And therefore that thing, out of which all other things were made, was made of nothing by him: for it is impossible that any thing can be of it self, but God who is <hi>the Beeing of Beeings,</hi> and the Fountain of all things else.</p>
               <p n="4">IV The form or order of the Creation is seen in the orderly placing of all things crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; the Heaven in the highest place, as the roof of this glorious building, decked with the Sun, Moon, and Stars: under these (as some say) an Element of Fire [we are sure] an Element of Ayr, being of a pure invisible substance, coming n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

is the proper place of the Waters: but the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Creator did shut it up in narrower li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, commanding the Waters which cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole Earth, to gather themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into one place of the Earth, for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that the dry Land might appear for the use of Men and Beasts, &amp;c. which he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to live upon the Earth, <hi>Genes.</hi> 1.9. yet so, that he giveth it leave now to overlook the Earth, (as it were) in lieu of that right which it hath to stand above by its Creation; as you may see, if you look on the Sea where the Shore is level, and not mountainous: yet hath the Lord by his decree (as it were) barred and bolted it up, <hi>Iob</hi> 38.10, 11. saying, <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto shall you come, but no farther</hi>; and <hi>here shall thy proud Waves be stayed. Psal.</hi> 33.7. <hi>He gathereth the Waters of the Sea together as an heap, he layeth up the depth in Store<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular survey of the comeliness of several Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we may consider of afterwards: thus briefly of the main Frame.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The end why God created all, could not be his own encrease of happiness and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment; for he was All-sufficient of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;

and sith the Creatures were mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>To communicate his goodness.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. He did it to communicate his goodness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He made all things, that he might give unto them Beeing, and perfection of Beeing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their kinds; Himself being <hi>the Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Beeings,</hi> infinitely perfect; not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from them who are nothing without Him.</p>

And as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our speaking of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prophesie, concerning

And what if I should say, it were expedient herein to follow the same order in considering of the Lords works, as the Lord himself did in their Creation; that is, to bind our selves to do the work of the Day in its Day, namely on the same Day wherein each work was done, to meditate on the work of that Day? I will not say, that he sinneth, who doth not follow this order, I know no such warrant. But this I say, considering our weakness, who must have time to make a distinct consideration of things, considering how apt we are to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with idle, impertinent and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable musings, and so to look away f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. Again. Consider, that as Light was the first thing which was made, when the Earth was without form and void; so when any Souls in the state of natural corruption, are without Christ formed in them, void of grace, full of pollutions; the first thing wrought in us is a light of sanctified knowledge, sound illumination, before we can bring forth any duty pleasing to God. And therefore be not deceived, like those, who think that <hi>Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion</hi>: Ignorance is as great an Enemy to the Soul, and its salvation, as utter darkness was to the World, and to the Creatures in it: and that spiritual light is as needful for the former, as this other light was for the latter. They therefore that are in their natural blindness, are as far from the new Creation, as the Earth was from its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural perfection, while darkness was upon the face of the deep.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As God alone by his Call did bring forth Light; so think you, that all the knowledge which thou hast (especially in Heavenly things) is wholly from God, without which nothing was in thee but utter darkness; and therefore thou hast no more cause to be proud of thy knowledge, than that muddy heap of Earth in the beginning had to brag of the Light which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64054:38"/>
shined upon it by the command of God; whereas of it self it was altogether dark and covered with darkness.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Consider the benefits which thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivest by this Creature; it giveth <hi>thee</hi> the use of thine eyes, it delighteth that sense: it freeth <hi>thee</hi> from many fears, which darkness doth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally suggest unto thee: it sheweth <hi>thee</hi> things in their right colours; it helpeth <hi>thee</hi> in avoiding many dangers, in ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. Consider, that as without this Ayr the natural Man cannot live, so neither can the spiritual Man, without the blessed spirit, which giveth an heavenly breathing to the Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, as the Ayr doth to the Body.

manner into the minds of the faithfull; but is visibly breathed forth again (as it were) in regard of its fruits, in holy speeches, and heavenly actions, that Men may see the good works which he bringeth forth in the godly, and glorify their Father who is in Heaven. Wonderfull are the effects of the Ayr, and according to it our Bodies are usually enclined and disposed; yea, and our Souls too in some respect, by reason of the neer Neighbourhood between the Soul and the Body, and the special affinity between the Ayr and the Spirits in the Body, which are the immediate instruments of the Soul. We of this Kingdome have speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al cause to bless God for one of the sweetest and most temperate Ayres in the World, se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We may further consider, that as such stoppings as hinder the Ayr from passing too and fro, do endanger the natural life: so those sins that stop the lively working, moving and breathing of the sanctifying spirit, do endanger the spiritual life. The Wind (which is the Ayr stirred and moved) and is (as it were) the same in the Ayr, which the Waves are in the Sea, is of wonderful force and strength: it beareth down Trees, Buildings, and things of wonderfull strength and bigness; it tosseth the Seas, and rouleth in the Waves, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

And here consider what wonders are in this deep, what number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less swarms of Fishes swimming and floating up and down: of which af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Consider, how admirable is the Power of God seen in bridling the Waves of the Seas, and by his invisible, but most mighty hand, holding them, in that they shall pass no farther. And thus also doth the Lord restrain the Enemies of his Church, both Devils and wicked Men, who otherwise would soon bring down a deluge of misery upon the people of God, and swallow up his little Flock: and therefore, as when thou seest the Waves beat furiously against the shore, as if they would return to their old place again; thou dost not fear it, because the hand of God keeps them in: so when thou seest the rage of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies against the Church at the highest, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the Covenant which God hath

So also we, who receive all from God, should return all to him again. It were a monstrous thing in nature, for a stream to wheel about, and come home, and sink into its own Spring again, not emptying it self into the Sea from whence it came. No less mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous is it, but much more common, for us to run thus in a Circle, and to reflect wholly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our selves, to aim at our selves, our ease, our credit, carnal contentment, and not seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and effectually to bend our hearts and thoughts, to direct our aimes, to employ our gifts and talents of several kinds, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory of the giver. A sin that will fall most heavy at the last day, if not repented of, and forsaken. How can we cross and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Lord more (who made us for himself
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64054:42"/>
alone) than when we make our selves only to aim at our selves? These Rivers run into the Sea, yet is not the Sea indebted to them, nor over-filled by them: when we have done all that we can for God, yet are we unprofitable servants; we cannot give him a recompence answerable to that which we have received; much less deserve any thing at his hands.</p>

                  <p>FRom the Third<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I come to the Fourth day, which we usually call <hi>Wednesday,</hi> which was the first day that had a Sun to give it light, to which were added the Moon to rule the N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, and the Stars to attend her; which glorious work of a most glorious God should raise our thoughts to some holy meditation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Now consider on this Day, how that as the Waters, which were before dispersed all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad upon and about the Earth, were on the third Day gathered into one store-house, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Seas</hi>; so the light, which was before dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, through the huge spaces of the Creation, was now (as it were) drawn together into one Body of <hi>the Sun,</hi> as a full and common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury. Consider here, that the Lord, who is in himself infinitely more bright than the light it self, needed no light in respect of himself: and therefore it was for us, that he made the light: and we should bless him for it: so in regard of himself, he needed no word, nor revelations of heavenly mysteries, being infinite in all knowledge and wisdome; and therefore it was for us, that he gave his Word to be a Light, and caused by his Spirit the bright beams of holy truths to be cast abroad into
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64054:45"/>
the dark World: therefore we may conceive, how shamefull our sin and unthankfulness is, that we must be entreated to turn our eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward this light, and to come to Church to hear the Word, whereas (if need were) we should beg a place in the house of God upon our knees, rather than go without this light.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Consider, that although the Lord was pleased to give light to the World, yet there needed no Sun whereby to do it: witness the light of the three first Days, wherein no Sun shined: so when it pleased the Lord to give the light of Heavenly knowledge to his Church, yet he needed no Books, no written Word to do it by: witness those two thousand years, and more from the beginning of the World till <hi>Moses</hi> wrote the Holy Text, by inspiration of the Holy Ghost: and then consider, that as after the third Day, the Sun was made to give light to the World, which before was il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened without a Sun; so after many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, the Lord placed the Books of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and then other Holy Writings, as a Sun in the Firmament of his Church, to give light unto the same: And, as after the Sun was made, Men had no want of that light, which was given without a Sun in the former three Days: so you may consider, that now the Books of Scripture are written, and the light of Gods truth plentifully shining in them, there is no need of unwritten Traditions to give light unto us in any way or work of God: and therefore conclude, that the dotage of the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64054:46"/>
Papists, in pleading for unwritten Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (now we have the written Word) is as gross, as if a M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n should complain for want of that wandering light of the three first days, now when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is fully seated, and firmly fixed in the body of the Sun.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Consider, that as one Sun giveth light to the whole World: so one Word to the whole Church scattered throughout the World. And here see the absurdity of some unsound ones among us, who being more than half Papists, are not ashamed to condemn the study of those worthy writings of many forreign Divines, upon this poor pretence, because they lived in other Kingdomes and Common-wealths; and so their Doctrine doth not so well suit with our State and Kingdome. As if the same Sun could not serve all Nations with light; but that we must have one in <hi>England,</hi> and they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in <hi>France, &amp;c.</hi> So if the Sun of holy truth do shine in the writings of these holy Men, why cannot we see and walk by this light, as well as out-landish Men?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Consider, that the light is still like it self; that light which was before the Sun, is of the same nature with that which now is in the Sun: so the truth and word of God is still the same, not contrary to it self. The light of holy truth, which was before the Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and this which shineth in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is the same: and therefore the Papists, are yet more shameless, when under pretence of the unwritten Word, they thrust upon the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64054:46"/>
Church such idle forgeries, as are contrary to the Word written, as if light could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to light; or darkness might be called light. If the light of the written Word doth shew us, that marriage is honourable among all Men, and therefore not only among the Laity; then know it is no beam of this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly light, which makes Men think they see much sin and shame in it, when it is used by the Ministers of the Word, but that it is even a dark vapour of the bottomless Pit; and so S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, it is <hi>a Doctrine of Devils.</hi> If the Word written, by its light do shew the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship performed to Images to be gross, and shamefull Idolatry, then that Doctrine which commendeth this as a special point of devotion, and condemneth to the Fire those that refuse it, cannot be any beam of light issuing from the Word of God unwritten, but rather a dark shadow, caused by the Prince of darkness: so you may think of many other Popish fopperies. The Seas, the Trees, Grass, Herbs, &amp;c. which were on the third Day, appeared to be of the same colour, by that light which then was, without a Sun, as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>he Word, before it was written.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Consider also, that as the Lord could have given light without a Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleased to make a Sun, doth also require,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64054:47"/>
that we should see by this Sun: so the Lord, who could have given us knowledge without a word preached, and have taught us immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by his spirit being pleased to set up the Ministry of the Word, and to teach us by it, doth req<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ire that we should learn and profit by it. And therefore we must not think that we may neglect the Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because God can teach us without it: we must be taught as God will teach us; and not as he can, but will not. God spake immediately to <hi>Saul</hi> from Heaven, condemning his cruelty against the Church; but yet sent him to a Man to learn what he should do. The Lord striketh down a sinner with the apprehension of his wrath for sin, but sendeth him to Men, even to the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his Word, to learn what he ought to do. And therefore they, who in regard of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge despise the preaching of the Word, and think it needless, may as well despise the Sun in regard of outward light for the eye of the Body, and think it may well be spared.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Again consider, that as the Sun in his circuit, passeth from East to West; so the light of the Word issuing by the special providence of God from the East, hath come toward the West. It is probably thought that <hi>Adam</hi> was created in the Eastern parts of the World, to whom the Word was at first delivered. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever! it is certain, that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, whence the Law did issue, and the Gospel proceed unto these Western parts: and now toward the end of this great Day
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64054:47"/>
of the World, this light is bending towards those poor Western <hi>Barbarians</hi> of <hi>America.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the rising Sun is most looked at, being especially welcome after the dark Night, and not so much regarded at Noon, though then it shineth brighter: so the Word Preached is most affected ordinarily by a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at its first coming; but afterward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If you finde this in your selves, let your hearts smite you for it, and be earnest with God to renew your affections to his Word, that you may gather an appeti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Consider, that as any Man well in his wits, accounteth it a blessing to have the Sun once in 24. hours, so should any one who is wise unto salvation, and taught of God, account it a blessing to have the word twice in a week, although it be the less regarded by earthly spirits, because it is ordinary.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Moreover, think with thy self, that as he that is stark blind cannot see the light when the Sun shineth most brightly: so he that is in natural blindness, cannot rightly see the divine vertue, and saving excellency of the Word; therefore call upon God with the Psalmist. <hi>Teach me O Lord, open mine eyes, &amp;c.</hi> and

Again consider, that as there is great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the cleerness of the light, between such a Day, when the Sun-beams are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by a thick Mist or dark Cloud, and then when it shineth brightly through a cleer Ayr: so when the light of heavenly truths was dimmed by a thick mist of <hi>Iewish</hi> Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, when a Cloud was in the most Holy Place, even before the Oracle and Ark of Gods presence, when the Vail was whole, and not rent asunder, the means of grace were not so cleer, the mysteries of grace not so plainly unfolded by many degrees, as now since our Saviours coming, when there are no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and this should stir thee up to thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness; every Sun-shiny day should make thee lift up a thankfull heart with feeling af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64054:50"/>
so when the gospel is preached, as it hath been with us a long time, we must think it time to rouze up our selves from the beds of security, and awake by repentance out of the sleep of sin and impenitency, and to being forth fruits answerable to the gospel, and the means of grace.

sweet and pleasant commonly which grow toward the Sun-rising, and have the morning Sun to ripen and bring them to perfection: so the zeal and obedience of the Christians, who lived presently after our Saviours resurrection in the primitive Church, and in the times of the Apostles, was most excellent: and so the graces and obedience of such as remember their Creatour in the days of their youth, and consecrate the first f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the Sun setteth at night, and leaveth us in the dark, we doubt not but that he will return again: so when <hi>Christ</hi> seemeth to withdraw himself from a faithful soul on which he hath cast the sweetest beams of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and refreshment: let such a one know for his comfort, that he will rise again: this night will not always last, though it be a long Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters night, a tedious time of desertion, yet a dawning; yea a perfect day will follow it, when the face of <hi>Christ</hi> shall shine again upon it. Again, as the Sun never so setteth, as not to shine at all, but when it setteth to one part of the world, it ariseth to another: so <hi>Christ</hi> never withdraweth his light from the whole world, but although he removeth from one nation, yet he shineth upon another; he hath a Church in all ages.</p>

Oh learn to contemn all the glory of the earth in comparison of his infinite excellency, who made the Sun it self of nothing, which is more worth than the whole earth, and all its golden mines. Learn to humble thy self before him, whose eyes are ten thousand times brighter than the Sun, who knoweth many more faults in us than we can see in our selves, be we never so watchful, who is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things. Let it not seem incredible unto thee, that God should be every where present, and see all things in all places, seeing the Sun, which is one of his Creatures, and but apart of his fourth day's work, doth at once shine many hundred thousand miles, if you reckon how his light reacheth downward from heaven to earth, and that Northward, Southward, East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Westward; yea from heaven to heaven: for, when it is on the other side of the earth, it shineth on the Moon on this side the earth, and causeth it to shine; yea it shineth upon every tree, upon every little grass, and doth (as it were) in its kind, look upon the smallest thing. Is it then to be doubted, that God, who can make a thousand Suns as excellent as this, with a word, should be in all places at once, and see all things at one view? Even reason may teach us, that it is more strange, that the Sun being a Creature, should shine so far, and on so many Creatures at once, than that the Infinite God should be thus every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,

and see all things. Yea, thou maist assure thy self, that as the Sun is not polluted with the loathsome puddles and dunghils on which it shineth; so neither is the Lord by filling all places, even there where are the greatest pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions. He is no farther from happiness in Hell than in Heaven; for himself is Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When thou thy self lackest means to pass away the time, or hearest others complain in this regard, look up to the Sun, and think with they self, doth not the Sun go fast enough? surely time goeth along with it, and never laggeth one inch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it; is it not a madness then to call for more help to drive it forward? Is there not much more cause to labour by all means to make hast after our time which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready lost, which hath long since out-run us? let us take time to bewail our loss of time, and be ashamed any more to complain of it, as if it were too slow-paced.</p>

What a poor Creature is the Moon! how dark is it when the Earth cometh between the Sun and her! how empty would the Church be of all light, grace, comfort, if Christ should be hidden from her! when the Moon is most enlightened by the Sun, yet there are some dark spots to be disce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ned in her: so when the Church is most replenished with the beams of this Sun of righteousness, <hi>viz.</hi> the graces of <hi>Christ-Iesus,</hi> yet she hath her spots in this life, which shall never wholly be done away until the life to come, when she shall be presented by Christ to the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not having spot or wrinckle, or any such thing: and therefore, to imagine a Church on Earth free from all
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64054:55"/>
blemishes, is, to fancy a Moon without spots.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As the Moon having received light from the Sun, giveth light to others, so that they see by the light of the Sun shining in the Moon, and then reflecting from the Moon upon the Creatures here below: so the Church, and every true member of it, having received the light of heavenly knowledge and sanctification from the Sun, must cause this light to shine before men, that they may see his good works, and so be moved to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify his Father which is in Heaven; yea, to glorify <hi>Christ-Iesus,</hi> who is the Sun from whom the light which shineth in their hearts, is derived and received. And to be wholly dark, and voyd of the fruits of holiness, is an argument that we have no communion with <hi>Christ-Iesus:</hi> you must therefore shine to others by an holy Example, that they which will not see by the Sun-shine of the word, may yet see by the Moon-light of their lives deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from this Sun.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Again, as thou seest the Moon to shine in a very dark night; as it cannot chuse but shine having received light from the Sun; so in the midst of a most crooked generation in evil times, in places that abound with chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of darkness, and works of darkness, a Christian must not forbear to shine in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, having received light from <hi>Iesus-Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Moon careth not, though thee vish persons hate her light, because it discovereth their works of darkness; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>either doth she cease
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64054:55"/>
to shine because the dogs bark at her: so a Christian having received light from Christ, must not care though the wicked are offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that light which shineth in his life, whereby their contrary practises are discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the more clearly to be hateful works of darkness: neither must he cease to shew forth this light, because the doggish tongues of wicked railers and scoffers be moved against him: keep on in thy course, as the Moon doth all this while, and let thy light shine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, that even the night-Walkers and Children of darkness may be converted and convinced by it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. As the Moon by being Eclipsed, doth shew that the light it hath, is not its own, but is received from the sun, in as much as the body of the earth coming between the sun and it, is seen to take away her light; which if she had of her self, she needed not to look toward another for it: so also the Eclipses and intermissions of the Acts of grace and motions of the spirit in a Christian, do often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make it manifest to himself, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to others too, that the light which he hath is not of himself, but received from Christ, at whose pleasure it is either imparted or denied. Therefore learn thou to work this good out of that evil, even by thy failings to see thy emptiness, and to give glory to him by whose free grace thou art what thou art.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Again, as the Moon is unconstant, and full of changes, and yet still receiveth some
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64054:56"/>
light; so the Church hath been in an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant unsetled condition, is full of changes, yet never without some light: she is sometime waxing, somtimes waning; somtimes flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing in grace, and in the purity and plenty of the word preached, like the full Moon; and then again declining, then again renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; so that though the Moon be always visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet is she at somtimes but darkly visible; so the Church is always visible unto them who have eyes to see her, but at somtimes she maketh a dimmer appearance than at other.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Moreover, as the Moon when she is in conjunction with the Sun, doth then shine less unto us, than when she is in opposition, one half space of heaven distant from it; for when she is joined with the Sun, she is at the change; but when there is this diametrical opposition, she is at the full: so when Christ was here in the flesh conversing with the Church, it was then but in a mean condition, even in the change from Judaism to Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism; so that now presently it became a new Moon, changed from a Jewish Synagogue to a Christian Church: but in short time after his ascension, through his spirit abundantly poured down upon it, when there was a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical opposition between Him and It, then it was at the full; and therefore he told them aforehand, that it was expedient he should go away from them, and then he would send the Comforter, even his blessed Spirit, whereby they should be made to shine more brightly in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64054:56"/>
knowledg and graces than before whilst he was with them.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Consider that neither Moon nor Stars do carry any special brightness in the presence of the Sun; and though the Moon be seen. yet she shineth but dimmely, or not at all; but the Stars are not apparent: so the Church in general hath no excellency in comparison of the Excellency of Christ: and as for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular members, they are like stars after Sun rising; their beauty is scarce to be discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:64054:57"/>4. Remember our Saviours comparison, who calleth the Ministers of the Church, <hi>Stars which he holdeth in his right hand.

                  <p n="5">5. Consider those Comets or Blazing-stars; though they make a greater blaze than the true stars of heaven, yet were they never fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the heavens, and therefore are soon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished: so those hypocrites, that make but a blaze for a time, they were but Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors wandring in the air of unstable affections, not fixed in the Church, nor engraffed into Christ.</p>

                  <p>COme we now to the fifth day, which with us is usually called <hi>Thursday</hi>; the story of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64054:57"/>
which days work we have laid down in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22, 23. Wherein the waters were furnished with fishes, and other Creatures that live there; and the air with fouls, and such creatures as live in it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here consider, that after those four days, when the heavens were furnished with lights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the earth beautified with plants springing out of it by vertue of the word of God; yet all this while there was not one creature throughout the whole Creation, that had sense, or power to move from place to place; not one fly, or the least thing moving in the air; not one fish swimming throughout the seas, rivers, or other waters; not one worm creeping on the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here then admire the wonderful power and wisdom of God, who on the fifth day by his All-commanding word filled the air with multitudes of Creatures fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, the waters with abundant of fish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s swimming there: this was done even in a moment. Consider what numberless swarms there were both of fouls and fishes brought forth on the fifth day; whereas the very day before, there was not one of any kind to be found in any part of the Creation. And as the wisdom of God joined these two sorts of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures together, so he made in many respects a special affinity between them; as the fouls are covered with feathers, so the fishes with scales: as the fouls move in the air, so do the fishes in that element which cometh nearest the nature of the air: as the fouls have wings
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64054:58"/>
to fly withall, so the fishes have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>innes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they swimme; and that is a motion ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry like to that of flying: yea some of either kind do communicate with each other in their element for, as we have water-fouls, so there have been flying-fish in great abundance: so that here you may magnifie the wisdome of God, who in the day that these creatures were made, did imprint upon them such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and qualities, as should be evidences to the end of the world in some sort, that they were but the work of one and the same day.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Consider here, that as the Lord hath appointed the fouls to fly in the air, and the fishes to swimme in the sea, confining each to his own element for the general, though some few particulars be suffered to live in both; this should teach us to walk within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of our callings, and not to think we shall mend our selves in a different element, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of course, without some special cause. Some few may have some special warrant to change their callings, as <hi>Amos</hi> to leave his flock, and teach the people; and <hi>Peter</hi> to leave his nets, and fish for men. These had an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate call from God; and so I dare not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that in case of great necessity, when the Church is destitute of able Ministers, some well-studied in the Scriptures, and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the mysteries of grace, may take upon them the office of the Ministry, being lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly separated unto that function: yet this will prove no more that every one may at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64054:58"/>
run from the shop to the pulpit, than it will follow, that all the fishes in the sea may fly up into the air, because some few do so. And this should especially <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>each Christians, who are called unto holiness, to take heed how they leave their element. They are bidden to walk in the spirit, even as birds fly in the air, and in this element they must keep: for as the air giveth breath unto the fouls that fly in it, so the sanctifying spirit giveth the new life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those that walk in him; the waters would choak and drown the fouls if they should fall into them: so sin is that which endangereth the spiritual life, when a christian falleth into it. The air giveth a speedy flight and motion to the Birds, whereas the waters would wet their wings, and cause them to move but slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they fall into it: so the spirit, when a Christian walketh in it, carrieth him along with winged-affections, and setteth his heart in a speedy motion upon the things of God, making him ready unto every good work; but if he fall into sin, which is like the waters of the dead sea, that Lake of <hi>Sodom,</hi> his heart is like a bird drenched in water, his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are deaded, his heart moveth but slowly; yea many times he lieth for dead, and there is scarce any motion of the spirit to be discerned in him. And as in such cases, a foul had need of more than ordinary means to help, as to be held over a warm fire, &amp;c. So a christian, that he may recover his wings again, and have his heart spiritually affected, and enlarged toward
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64054:59"/>
God, had need of special humiliation, special meditation, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aier, and other warming and quickening means to raise him up.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As the air giveth breath and motion, so also it giveth support to the birds,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The Beasts find no support in the air, but sink to the earth.</hi>
                     </note> and it carrieth them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as the earth doth the beasts, which go up and down upon it: so doth the spirit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so give support unto all that are born of the spirit. <hi>They are kept by the mighty power of God through faith unto salvation.</hi> If it were not ordinary, it might seem strange, that the air which none can see, being so thin a substance, should carry so many millions of souls as there are in it fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down; wonderful is the power of the blessed invisible spirit, who supporteth so many thousand christians by his sanctifying vertue against all the powers of darkness.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As these birds do now live in the air, so were the fouls created in the air at the first: so whosoever walketh in the spirit, was also born of the spirit; he had his begining in this element.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Consider, that as the Birds, although they live and move in the air, yet they come down to receive some refreshment from the earth: so the Lord alloweth his children to receive some nourishment from the earth, and to partake of its refreshments; yet so, as they must not delight in the earth as in their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor in the things of the earth as their
<pb facs="tcp:64054:59"/>
chiefest contentment: but like the birds of heaven, having supplied their necessities, must be ready to soar aloft again, and not in their affections be still groveling here below.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. You see how sparingly the birds take of the water; a bird doth not drink like a beast, it rather sippeth: so should a christian sparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly use the pleasures of this life; rather sipping like the bird, than swilling like the swine. As for those that give themselves to drink down iniquity like water, and to commit sin with greediness, they are none of those who have their conversation in heaven; nay, those that glut themselves with earthly pleasures, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no better contentments than in such things as please the senses; the appetite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the eyes, ears, tast, &amp;c. They are none of those that are born up by the spirit of God above the earth. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how little contenteth one of these creatures, and then learn to be ashamed that thine appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite is so much beyond thy necessity, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise mortification. As far as we can guess, the birds take more delight in flying and singing, than they do in feeding, and therefore they have soon done with this: so should a christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an be more delighted in conversing with God, in walking in the spirit, in running the ways of his commandments, than in serving the necessities of nature: yea, it should be his meat and drink to do the will of God, as it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to the bird to sing and soar aloft. Again, as the bird useth not these things, so as to make her unfit to fly; so a Christian must not abuse
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64054:60"/>
meat and drink, so as to clogg and dull his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and make him more dull and dead in the service of God; but so to refresh himself, that he may be the more chearful and lively in his heavenly flight.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As the Bird not sowing nor gathering into Barnes (as our Saviour telleth us) yet is fed by our heavenly Father; so should a child of God depend upon his providence without distrustful eares against the providence of God, though not without moderate and chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian cares, which serve the providence of God.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. As the Bird having found somwhat to satisfie its hunger, by its chirping, calleth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to partake with it: so should christians chearfully invite others to partake with them of those things that God hath given them, and not like the hog, grunt and wrangle at any that feedeth near them.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. As the Bird doth not so much as light upon the ground without the All-guiding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. So should a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian learn to depend upon the providence and protection of God, who is of far greater price in the esteem of his heavenly father, than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sparrows: know certainly, that thy hairs are numbred, and that none of them can fall to the ground without thy heavenly Father.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Consider, that as when the Bird flyeth highest, it taketh least notice of earthly things, and is least moved with them, and affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them; so when a Christian is most rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64054:60"/>
in spiritual affections to the greatest height of heavenly-mindedness, keeping nearest hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then is the earth farthest out of sight, and he is least moved with the things here below, and best able to contemn earthly vanities: he is too far above these to be much affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them. Therefore this should make us think of the exhortation of the Apostle, <hi>Mind the things which are above</hi>: and this should teach us to help our selves against earthly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and fleshly lusts. Think with thy self, what is the reason that I am so earthly-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that my affections are so engaged to this or that in the world, yet I cannot come off, nor free my self, that I can scarce perswade my own heart to be without these and these things; it is this, because my heart is not carried aloft; it draweth too near the ground, it withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth too much from God: if I should keep up my heart closer to God, these things would be out of sight; the earth would seldome be in my thoughts, at least not so as to work much upon my affections. On the other side, you see that those Birds which use so much upon the ground, they fly but softly, as may be seen by those that use about our houses: so also those Christians, that are much taken up with the dealings and business of the world, they fly but softly, have but slow affections, and sluggish motions to the things of God; they go but coldly about good duties: and therefore we should pray for a greater measure of the spirit to bear us upward.</p>
                  <p n="11">
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:64054:61"/>11. Consider also, that as the Bird can mount up into the air, and yet light upon the earth too, and receive some refreshment there; whereas the Beast cannot mount up and live in the air: so a Christian can, and may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the natural comforts and refreshments of this life, though in a moderate manner and measure, as well as the natural man. But the natural man cannot mount up to heaven, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live in the air, cannot live by the spirit, he hath no relish of spiritual things. The spiritual man judgeth all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he can discern what is in nature, but himself is judged of no man, his excellency cannot be discerned by the eye of nature.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Again, as the Birds live in a stormy ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and feel much alteration of weather, heat cold, winds, &amp;c. as the air is the most unsetled of all other parts of the Creation: so Christians do live in a condition subject to manifold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, subject to many stormes of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and temptation. And as the Birds are then especially in danger by snares and ginnes, when they are upon the earth; to which they are not subject, when they are aloft in the air; so a Christian is then in danger to be ensnared and entangled when he dealeth with earthly things, and is most affected to the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: when he is most heavenly-minded, then is he most out of danger of these snares.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. The Birds in the air meet with Birds of prey there also, which are ready to seize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and destroy them: so the Devil, who
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64054:61"/>
is called the prince that ruleth in the air, doth especially chuse to assault those that walk in the spirit, even then when they are most spiritual, endeavouring to pull down those that are highest in the favour of God, as <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. therefore special watchfulness must be used by such.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. As the Birds are of all other living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the most chearful: as they are highest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the earth, and nearest heaven: so should a Christian labour of all other men to be most chea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ful, &amp; replenished with heavenly joys, as he is nearer heaven, and farther from the earth than others: God is infinite in all goodness and happiness; and the nearer to God, the more happy, and the greater cause of chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness. As the Birds are most chearful in a clear sun-shiny day: so is a Christian, when the light of Gods countenance shineth on him. As the Birds sing most chearfully after a sweet refreshing showr; so should a Christian go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way most cheared from the word of God, when it hath distilled upon him as the dew of heaven. As the Birds are merry in the spring; so a Christian is, when there is a spring and encrease of grace in his soul, and a nearer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the sun of Righteousness, and a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial warmth of Gods love is shed abroad into his heart. As the birds by chirping do set o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on singing, and many join together in consort: so one christian should draw ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by example to yeild up sweet songs of praise to God, and many should join toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64054:62"/>
with one spirit to glorifie the Lord. As the Birds sing, although they know not where to have their next supply of food: so should a Christian labour, out of the providence, love, and promise of God, to gather matter of chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and contentedness, even then when he seeth no special means for supply in outward things. Moreover, as the Bird singeth although she be in the Cage; so a Christian must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in his afflictions, and like <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> sing in fetters: as it is reported of the <hi>Nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingale,</hi> that she setteth her breast against a thorn to keep her waking, that she may not through sleep cease to sing: so a Christian must even enforce himself to spiritual watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, and use special means to keep his heart awake, that he may shew forth, and sing out the praises of God, even in the night; that is, at such times when others sleep in sin, and care not to honour the Lord. Finally, as a bird preferreth her liberty in the Wood or Hedge, before a dwelling in a princes pallace, where she hath her meat continually brought unto her: so a Christian preferreth that spiritual li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, whereby his heart is freed from the fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of sinful lusts, above the greatest earthly estate in the world, with thraldome under sin, and want of an enlarged spirit.</p>

So the <hi>Turtle</hi> may teach conjugal love between Husband and Wife, these (as it is reported) being so so constant and entire unto each other. <hi>The Pellican</hi> may teach special love of Parents toward their children, who is said to feed her young wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. As those Birds of Prey, and ravenous fouls, make use of that advantage which they have in height and strength, to seize upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things here below; so many oppressours, and greedy worldlings abuse that advantage which they have in wealth and power, to seize upon the estates of others that are below them, and not able to make resistance. And as those ravenous Birds are of all other the most hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; so these greedy and over-bearing oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours do carry the curse and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64054:63"/>
Country with them. Again, as some Birds hate the light; so some men, in love to the works of darkness, cannot endure the light that shineth in the Ministry of the word, or in the conversations of the Godly.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Consider also, that as the fouls do gather and cherish their young ones under their wings; so the Lord doth shrowd his children under the wings of his protection: and as the little ones are thereby safe against the raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Birds; so the Godly are thus sheltered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst cruel enemies and manifold dangers. As the young ones are cherished and refreshed by this means with a kindly warmth; so the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are wonderfully refreshed in the bosome of Gods love, with a lively and most comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble warmth from the presence and favour of God. And as the young ones, after a storm, are apt to stray abroad, and play about in the sun again, untill the Kite be ready to seize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: so the Children of God, in time of prosperity, are apt to withdraw themselves from that near communion with God, untill that Prince of the air flying all about, and seeking his Prey, do fall upon them with some dangerous temptation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As the Birds are affrighted and driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the corn when one of them is killed, and hanged up there for terror to the rest. So should men learn by others punishments to abstain from things forbidden. Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon many swearers, drunkards, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressours, adulterers, scoffers at godliness, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64054:63"/>
persecuters, unnatural children, &amp;c. should skare away others from those sins which have proved so deadly and dangerous to the former. When <hi>Herods</hi> carkass was eaten up with worms, it was a fair warning to all the enemies of Gods Word and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, such as <hi>Herod</hi> was. And He that not long since hanged himself in this parish, after he had continued long in a course of railing against the Minister that then was, may justly be thought to be hanged up by the special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, as a dreadful skare-crow to all other tongues set on fire of hell in the like kind.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Again, we may here think of <hi>Solomons</hi> comparison; as a Bird, when it is in hand, may soon make an escape, and never be seen again: So <hi>Riches get themselves wings</hi>; saith he, Riches vanish away many times like a Bird in the air, and the owner can never catch them nor come near them again: if the father hold fast, the son lets them fly; or if the son be as sure of his hand as the father, yet the next heir letteth go his hold; or the Lord himself by some special judgment or other cutteth the string, and they are gone; especially when men get wealth as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oulers catch Birds with snares, nets or ginns, by unlawful means, or too much niggardly sparing. This should teach us not to make much account of these things, much less to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase them with the loss of everlasting life.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In a word! we may here consider the wonderful wisdom and excellency of the Lord,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64054:64"/>
in the abundant variety of these winged Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in the beauty of many of them, in the swiftness of many and most of them; the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of kinds, of colours, of quantity, of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. And to those we must refer those lesser sorts of creatures, viz. <hi>Bees, Flies, Wasps, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, Locusts, Caterpillers</hi>; yea, the least <hi>Gnats,</hi> or whatsoever flieth in the air; all which might yeild us much matter of meditation and admiration. Gloriously doth the wisdom and goodness of God appear in the little <hi>Bees,</hi> which are said to have their King whom they follow and obey, which out of many flowers suck that which they digest into honey, and set it into such a frame of the Comb, as no wit of man can make the like. This honey, as sweet as it is! yet every child of God must get such a spiritual relish, that like <hi>David,</hi> he may find the word of God more sweet than it. And as the honey is both pleasant and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> is the word to that soul which hath a spiritual appetite. But in one respect the Bee may put thee in mind of the nature of sin, which carrieth honey in the Mouth, but a sting in the tail: therefore we should hereby learn not to be deceived with the seeming sweetness which sin bringeth at the first, but to beware and tremble at that venemous and smarting sting which it leaveth behind. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as flies are most busie in the sun, so are temptations in prosperity: and as the flies are apt to light upon that part of the body where there is a fore; so is Satan wont to assault the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64054:64"/>
soul where it is weakest, and to take advantage of those corruptions that do most prevail in in the heart. And as when flies are beaten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, they come again very speedily; so when Satans temptations are resisted, and put back, another swarm of flies is at hand, other temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are ready to assault: and of this espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, Christians have experience when they are pestered with blasphemous thoughts cast into their minds by Satan: against which they must take comfort, in that by the power of the spirit they are enabled to renew their resistance, even as the assaults are renewed.</p>

                  <p>THe other sort of Creatures made this day were the Fishes, wherewith the sea and rivers were wonderfully stored: Admirable were these works of the Lord, and his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the deep; and it is thought, that of all sensible creatures in the world, there is the greatest numbers of fishes; yea, and some kinds of them of the greatest Bulk and bigness of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other creature that liveth and moveth; their abundance appeareth in the story of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.20. <hi>And God said, let the Waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life</hi>; and ver. 21. it is said, <hi>the Waters brought forth abundantly.</hi> And again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And as the Lord gave this extraordinary power of multiplication to the fishes of the sea, so they enjoy this grant of his unto this day; and as may be seen by the rowes of fishes, they bring forth thousands at once, insomuch that it hath been used as a Phrase of speech, <hi>To encrease as the Fish,</hi> imploying an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary encrease.

                  <p n="1">1. THe greatness of some fishes is as admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as the multitude. <hi>Pliny</hi> in his Natural History reporteth, that about <hi>Arabia</hi> have Whales been found six hundred foot in length,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Plin. Nat. Hist. Lib.</hi> 32. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.</note> and three hundred and sixty foot in breadth; so, that if his report be true, the length should seem to be above the sixth part of a mile, six hundred foot ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king two hundred paces, and a thousand pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces making a mile. Howsoever! the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of these fishes is admirable, as the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience sheweth of our Merchants daily traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficking toward <hi>Greenland</hi> to take them; and they are far greater than any other living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the world, which should make us to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64054:65"/>
magnifie the admirable power and infinite greatness of him that made them. <hi>Oh Lord our God, how wonderful are thy works in all the world!</hi> And the holy Text it self takes notice in special of this creatures greatness, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.21. <hi>God created great Whales.</hi> Admirable it is in these fishes, that whereas the Beasts and Birds cannot live, if they be kept any long time under water: These on the other side, cannot live unless they be under water. So whereas a Christian liveth by the spirit, and it is the life of his life, and the joy of his heart to partake of the spirit, and to be conversant in the ordinances of God: on the other side, it is even death to a Carnal heart to be exercised this way, and he thinketh not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a free man, untill he is let loose from these. The fish, though it live, yet it is not lively, but lieth almost for dead when it is in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen air out of the waters: and the natural man, though he be alive, not yet dead, yet is he not lively, but like one as good as dead when he is taken out of his element, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained by any means from his beloved sins, and tyed to holy duties in publick or in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate: He hath no life in these things, his heart is dead toward them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as the fish living in the salt waters remaineth fresh, so a carnal man living in the Church, and in the middest of the means of grace, remaineth in his unsavoury natural condition, not having the salt of mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby to eat out his corruptions and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64054:66"/>
dead flesh, and make him an acceptable sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto God (as it is said, every sacrifice must be salted with salt) though he live under the word, yet he carrieth no relish of the word in his heart and life. Therefore we must not onely look what means we have, but how these means do work upon us, whether we be transformed into the word: for a man to imagine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he is therefore a Christian, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he heareth Christ preached, is as idle as to say, the fish must needs be salt, because it liveth in the salt waters.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Again, in that the Lord feedeth such innumerable multitudes of Fishes in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by what means we cannot imagine: so should we be confident that he will provide for us, though the means as yet seem to be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from us: for, though some of the greater fishes do feed upon the lesser, yet it cannot be imagined, how such an admirable number of them should be continually supplied; but the Lord Al-sufficient openeth his hand of boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and filleth them with good things.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Wonderful is the work of God in the strange variety of kinds, in the strange shapes of these creatures: insomuch that it is thought there be few Beasts on earth, but that there be fishes in the sea which resemble them: so they speak of sea-calves, sea-horses, &amp;c. Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful strange are the properties of some fishes,<note place="margin">

                     </note> which the Al-mighty Creator hath given them. <hi>Pliny</hi> speaketh of a little fish like a great
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64054:66"/>
snail, which by cleaving to a Ship under sail, and driven with strong winds, will stay it, that it shall not be able to go forward; and that even about his own time, the Gally of the Emperour <hi>Caligula</hi> was held fast by one of these against the uttermost endeavour of four hundred Mariners with their Oars. It were strange, that a Man of his dignity and place in the Common-wealth, should expose himself as a laughing-stock to the Common people in reporting so notorious a lie concerning a thing done in his own time, and his own countrey: Therefore for my part, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to be true, and being supposed to be true, how wonderfully doth it set forth the admirable power and wisdom of God! and in this particular example it is to be thought, that the great God did purposely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fool the madness of this arrogant Emperour, who would take upon him to be God, and required (among other people) the Jews also to yeild him divine honour: here now let this wretched man take notice of his own Godhead, that cannot stir against a poor fish like a snail, with the help of the winds, and four hundred Oars, when the true and living God shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point it to stop his course. Wonderful also is that property given to the fish called <hi>Torpedo,</hi> which, if it be taken with a Net, so soon as the Fisher takes hold of the Net wherein this fish is, though he doth not touch the fish it self, yet presently, it is said, his hand will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numed, and he shall lose the use of it for
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64054:67"/>
the present, as if it were taken with a dead pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey. This is not only reported by <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> in the place fore-cited,<note place="margin">

The wisdome of the Creator is notably seen in this, and we may consider of it, that those who with Nets of fraud, and indirect means, do fish for things of this life, their wealth proveth to them like this Fish; it worketh a kind of dead pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie in their consciences, which in such men usually become seared and past feeling; it worketh a kind of dead palsie also in their hands, which do not freely open to receive the necessities of others; for, commonly they who are unjust getters, are also niggardly keepers; this <hi>Tropedo</hi> in the Net, taketh away that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable use to which their hands should be put; they come hardly by that which they have, <hi>viz.</hi> with the loss and forfeiture of their own souls, and therefore are loath to part with it to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply others.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The unseemliness appearing in some Fishes going backwards, should make us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, how shameful and unseemly it is for a Christian to go backward in the ways of God, cooling in zeal, slackning his pace begun: the Lord saith, <hi>If any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him, Heb.</hi> 10.38. We must therefore stir up our selves with St. <hi>Paul, to reach and press forward toward

               <p>I Proceed to the sixth and last Day of the Creation, with us usually called <hi>Fryday,</hi> wherein the Lord made those Creatures that furnish the earth, namely the Beasts and creeping things, and then <hi>Man</hi> in the last place, as the Lord of the rest. First of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, those unreasonable creatures; for of <hi>Man</hi> I purpose to speak afterwards more at large<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And in these creatures brought forth out of the earth, the admirable power, wisdom and goodness of God is manifested.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Consider with astonishment, how in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at the word of the Lord, out of the dead womb of the earth issued multitudes of beasts,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64054:68"/>
great and small, and creeping things: Lions, Bears, Tygers, Unicornes, Horses, all sorts of Cattle, &amp;c. And that of a just size, every way in their several kinds for strength, sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and other properties. And here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that the least creature that crawleth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, is a part of Gods own work; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>every creeping thing,</hi> as the Text saith. And in these the Lords omnipotency appeareth, the least worm being a work of an Al-mighty power; yea doubt not, but as the least are the works of his hands, so the least are within the compass of his Al-guiding providence. And if the least creeping thing be within the Lords care, and receive its maintenance from him, <hi>Wherefore are ye doubtful O ye of little Faith</hi>? Will God feed the worms, and let his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren starve?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wonderful is the strength, wonderfull is the swiftness of many beasts; wonderful is their variety in kind, bigness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quality, voice, &amp;c. Consider the wonderful strength and courage of the Lion; and then consider the excellency of that glorious <hi>Lion of the Tribe of Iudah,</hi> Christ Jesus, <hi>who</hi> (as the Prophet saith) <hi>travelleth in the greatness of his strengtb, and is mighty to save, Isa.</hi> 63.1. He is as a Lion unto his enemies to destroy them; Therefore <hi>kiss the son, left he be angry</hi>; submit to Christ, lest he tear you in pieces as a Lion, and there be none to deliver: He is as a Lion to defend his people against their enemies; this <hi>Lion</hi> is too strong for that old <hi>Red-Dragon,</hi> and will
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64054:68"/>
crush his head, and tread him under his feet. And as <hi>Sampson,</hi> having killed the Lion, found sweet refreshment in the dead Carkass of the same, which occasioned his riddle wherewith he posed the <hi>Philistines: Sweetness came out of the strong one, and meat out of the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iudg.</hi> 14.14. So our Saviour, this Lion of the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> being slain for the sins of the world, yeilded sweet nourishment and refreshment to those who feed on him by faith; so that out of this strong one cometh sweetest meat for hungry souls: yea, as the Lion yeilded plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant nourishment to him that slew him; so doth Christ to the faithful, who slew him by their sins: yea, many of those, who in a more special manner did join in sheding his blood, did feed on him by faith, as appeareth by the fruit of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the Lords voice in the ministry of the word, is compared to the roaring of a Lion. <hi>When the Lion roareth, who doth not tremble? When the Lord speaketh, who will not prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie? Amos</hi> 3.8. This voice of the Lord should rouze up sleepy sinners from their pillows of deep security, and make them tremble at the word of the Lord with an holy fear, and not trample it under foot, nor cast it behind their backs with an hellish scorn. Miserable is their folly, who are more afraid of the barking of <hi>Dogs,</hi> than of the roaring of <hi>This Lion</hi>; more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to do those duties, which the wicked scoffe and rail at, than to do those sins which the Lord in his word forbiddeth and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64054:69"/>
upon pain of everlasting destruction.</p>
               <p>Read at large, how the Lord in the book of <hi>Iob,</hi> setteth forth the excellency of the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,</hi> or <hi>Behemoth of the Unicorn,</hi> of the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <hi>Horse,</hi> and that of purpose to over-awe <hi>Iob</hi> with an apprehension of his infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, by a due consideration of the excellency of these Creatures. These things were not spoken to him alone, but to us also.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Consider what multitudes there be of cruel savage beasts in the world, which the Lord so restraineth, that they do not over-run man-kind; which should make us admire his infinite power in curbing them, his infinite-goodness in preserving us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Consider of what use many of these crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are to us; especially those which are most common among us. What supply of Milk do the <hi>Kine</hi> afford us? what Fleeces of <hi>Wool</hi> do the <hi>Sheep</hi> yeild us? what store of strong, wholesome, and pleasant nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do their bodies yeild us? and what la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is bestowed about these? when we have eaten of these and are full; when we are cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed by these and are warm, then should we take heed lest we forget God, of whom we have received all.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Among other things, we should observe the Lords goodness in giving us divers of these creatures to do our work, to carry our bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, to bear our selves. What benefits do we daily receive by the labour of the <hi>Oxe,</hi>

plowing our ground, and doing us necessary services many ways? How serviceable is the <hi>Horse</hi> unto us, both for speed and ease; carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us from place to place? wonderful is the goodness of God in making these creatures, far stronger than our selves, to yeild to us; not using their strength to resist us, but to do us service. Therefore we should not at any time use any of these creatures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that we should be moved to lift up thankful hearts to God for this mercy, which we would think wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of much admiration, if they were not so common among us; but on the other side, we should think, the more we have of them, the more thankfulness we owe to God for them.</p>
               <p n="6">6.

                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:64054:70"/>7. Again, seeing the Beasts have those pleasures whereof the senses are capable, this should perswade us, that these are not the most excellent delights, but that there are purer, higher, more heavenly delights, which suit better with an intellectual immortal soul: and this should teach us to bewail our brutish affections, which carry us so strongly after sensual delights of the eye, the ear, the taste, &amp;c. as if we had no better souls than the Beasts. <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>The spirit of a beast go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth downward, and the spirit of a man goeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How wouldest thou rage, if thy Beast should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually fling and cast thee, and those things which thou layest upon it! and are not we herein worse than Beasts that perish, when with froward spirits we fling and kick at the Lords commandements, and do not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and obediently submit unto them?</p>

                  <p>The Creation of mans body is but briefly laid down, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. <hi>And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground</hi>; that is, his body: where, though the dust of the ground be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, yet I conceive that the matter of mans body was tempered with the other elements, although the earth was that which bare the greatest bulk, and made up the greatest part of the substance in the body.</p>
                  <p>Now to set forth the excellency of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, it may not be amiss briefly to consider of the notable workmanship of mans body, whereof the Psalmist speaketh, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15, &amp;c. and in it may be considered,

But in that state of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this exactness both of temper and proportion, made up the perfect beauty and comliness, which God gave to the body of man in his Creation.</p>

                  <p>NOw come we to the particular parts, and therein let us consider,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Those that are contained in the rest, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Spirits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the <hi>blood,</hi> you know it is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent part of the body, and of absolute neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, insomuch that the blood is said to be the life of the body, which must not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood directly, as the words seem to imply, as if the life of a man were nothing but his blood, for that is not possible: if that were so, then nothing could live which hath no blood: but this is certain, that Bees, and many other like Creatures have no blood, and yet have life: it would also follow, that so many drops of a mans blood as he loseth, so much he loseth of his life; whereas many times the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuation of blood is the preservation of life. And (that which is most absurd) it would follow, that a mans life might be severed from him, and yet remain for a time after such se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration: for so you see, that the blood of men, and of other creatures, may be kept a long time in vessels after it is severed from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And besides all this; the Angels, who have neither blood, nor other bodily parts, have life in greater perfection than a man.</p>
                  <p>Thus then we understand these places that speak of the the Blood, that it is a special in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64054:72"/>
of the soul, whereby life is convay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the several parts of the body by reason of the spirits, which are a kind of airy invisible substance (yet bodily) arising like vapours <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rom the purest part of the blood: for although it be said, the life is in the blood, yet this is because the blood is a thing which is more obvious to the senses than the spirits; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, because it is the nursery, and as it were the fuel of the spirits, whereby (as by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious oyl) the lamp and flame of life is che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished and maintained: so that life is more immediately in the spirits than in the blood. Again, life is lost by the shedding of the blood, because the spirits (the immediate Instruments of the soul whereby it communicateth life to the body) are extinguished by the shedding of the blood, even as the flame goeth out when the wood is qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e taken away; and so in this respect also the blood is said to be the life of the Creature.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, consider the spirits, whereof somewhat hath already been spoken by the way. These are called spirits, not, but that they are bodily substances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, because they have the least grossness in them of all other parts of the body, and come nearest to a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual nature. And these are indeed the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate instruments of the soul, and being as it were of a middle nature between the soul and body, they are a common tye or bond between them both, uniting both together. These are of most excellent use in the body
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64054:73"/>
throughout the parts, they convay life, sence, and motion to them all: they are in special manner employed in the more retired and spiritual actions of the soul, in the exercise of reason and understanding, in the serious thoughts and meditations of the heart: by it the pain or delight of one part of the body is convayed and imparted to the rest, and a sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy or fellow feeling is derived from one to the other; and in these the singular wisdome of the Creator is notably manifested.</p>

                  <p>THe parts containing these, are in the next place to be considered; where first, the <hi>Head</hi> is that which is set in the highest place, and is full of most curious workmanship: it is the seat both of the outward and inward senses; and as all the outward senses are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced there, so none of the five are to be found in any other part of the body, except that of the touch or feeling, which is the lowest and grossest of the rest. There is the <hi>Eye,</hi> of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and most curious making, which is the instrument of seeing; the very window of this house, that letteth in light to the soul, which otherwise would dwell in a dark dungeon. It is an admirable thing to consider, how by the wonderful power and wisdome of God, all colours have his property to caff sorth a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance and image of themselves, whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> by the air is convayed into the Eye: if this were
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64054:73"/>
well considered and understood, it would be found one of the most wonderful works of the Creation, setting forth the Creators glory. But ye may conceive it thus: When a Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glass is held before the face, instantly there is an image of the face in the glass: now the glass cannot frame such an image in it self, for then it should be there as well when the face is turned away: wherefore it must be of necessity, that the face doth at all times in the light cast forth an image of it self: and the glass doth only hold it by reason of the lead at the backside, whereby this image is stayed, and not suffered to pass through, and vanish. And so doth every thing that hath colour, cast forth an image of it self at all times, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received into the eye, presently the thing is seen, and perceived by the eye: which is an admirable thing to consider, that all things that are; Trees, Plants, Men, Beasts, &amp;c. whatsoever can be seen, do every way cast forth Images of themselves into the air, and that these are severally and distinctly convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the eye, and discerned by it.</p>
                  <p>There are the <hi>Ears,</hi> whereby we hear, which take in sounds and noises in a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner: wherein also the admirable power and wisdome of God appeareth, in that one voice issuing out of one mouth should enter in at many hundred ears: for this must needs be granted, that we cannot hear any voice or noise, unless it truly enter into our ears; for if the noise could be heard without
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64054:74"/>
such an entrance, then were those open pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages needless, which are in the ears: but these open passages are as needful to let in sounds, as a door is to let a man into an house: Now one man cannot enter in at many doors at once; and so one voice remaining one, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter in at many hundred ears at the same moment; and therefore it must needs be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied in the air; and so that which is but one in the mouth of the speaker, is manifold in the air, and is taken in by many ears.</p>
                  <p>There is also the <hi>Nose,</hi> which is the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of smelling, another part of the body, which serveth us both for necessity and delight: it is a means to prove the wholsomness or unwholsomness of many things which are good, and which are hurtful to us, and yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth delight and refreshment in presenting us with many pleasing and fragrant smells.</p>
                  <p>There is also the <hi>Tongue</hi> and <hi>Palate,</hi> the instruments of <hi>Tast,</hi> but especially the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late or upper part of the mouth, the Tongue having another and more proper use. This is a sense of greatest use for the nourishment of the body, and so for the preservation of life; and this also yeildeth abundant matter of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and refreshment. <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>Doth not the ear try words, and the mouth or palate tast his meat? Iob</hi> 12.11. That is, doth it not by tasting, try it? for God hath given this abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Creatures, to try what is agreeable to their bodies, and what is displeasing.</p>
                  <p>In the last place, the <hi>Touch,</hi> or <hi>Feeling,</hi> is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64054:74"/>

EVen this earthly frame of the body proveth it an hard thing to put off earthly affections, and therefore care and stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving should be used in it. The body being made of dust, it will return to dust again, not onely in the final dissolution, but also in the present inclination; it now leaneth to the earth, and resteth on the earth; Man is deeply in love with his own Element, and strongly tyed to it in his affections. It is said of one, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of Three, who demanded of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle which should be chief, and hearing that he should be the man that first should kiss his Mother, he fell down and kissed the earth, as accounting it the common mother of all; men are so in love with the Earth, that they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, and as it were, kiss it in their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as a Mother, out of whose womb they had their beginning, although the Oracles of Gods word condemn this folly, and teach them, that thus doing, they shall be least in the Kingdom of God, and that this doting love of the world is enmity with God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we should pray earnestly to God, that he would change this earthly temper of our souls
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64054:75"/>
into heavenly affections. How needful is it for us to practise that of our Saviour, even to forsake our selves; our selves being earth, we must renounce our earthly selves, and deny our selves; for though we could restrain our selves somwhat from outward earthly courses, yet so long as we keep our earthly affections, our hearts will cleave to the earth. Special cause we have to study that book of the Wise man throughout, which teacheth us the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and vexation of spirit that is in earthly things, and to see and admire the treasures and riches of Gods Kingdome; that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending better things, we may make better account of these.</p>

He made not the body for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, nor for the world, nor for lust, nor for drunkenness, but for Himself; let us well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider this, and learn to give God his due. The Idolater will bow with his body to Idols, and say, that he keepeth his heart to God; but he must know, that God made the body as well as the soul; and if he made all things for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, then the body as well as any other thing.

But be not deceived; God made this Body for Himself; and therefore we must not abuse any part of the Body to his dishonour, nor make any member of it <hi>an Instrument of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness,</hi> but to give up the members of our bodies as Instruments of righteousness unto holiness: let us not think a little pains of the body too much to bestow in the service of God, in hearing the word, in prayer, in humiliation, &amp;c. but let us glorifie God (as in our souls especially, so) in our bodies also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they are Gods as well as our souls.</p>

IN that God made the body, care must be used to preserve, and not to destroy thine own body, or thy brothers: we must not pull down this tabernacle which God himself hath pitched, but must leave it to his disposing, using all lawful means to keep it up, and to preserve it strong, untill he please to

dissolve it: shun intemperancy and excess in things that please the appetite in meats and drinks, &amp;c. Use those means which God hath given thee to repair this house, which God Himself hath builded for thy soul to dwell in. let the life and body of another be precious in thy sight, and do thy endeavour to preserve it. And let us know that in some case not to save life, is to destroy, <hi>viz.</hi> when there is spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial means, calling and opportunity to do it; in times of necessity some means must be used to prevent the famishing of many, therefore at such times we should freely give without grudging, to the relief of others. Remember that it is for the preservation of those bodies which God hath made. And let this keep thee from laying violent hands on thine own body: it is a loud crying sin to destroy ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers body, because God hath made it; but most horrible to destroy thine own, sith God hath made it, and hath given thee a special charge to keep it.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, sith God hath made the body, let us rely upon Him for the maintenance of the body: He hath made it, and he will keep it: he hath given a mouth, and he will give meat; he hath given a back, and he will cloath it: Thus may a Christian, that hath recovered his forfeiture in Christ, reason from the love and promise of God. And therefore in hard times our wants should be special motives to drive us home to God through Christ, that being in him we might
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64054:76"/>
assure our selves of all needful supply for the body from his hand that made it: there is not the poorest among us, but if they would effectually turn to God, and depend upon him, they should find they have no cause to despair in regard of bodily helps; they should find him supplying or supporting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and one way or other providing for them.</p>

There is many times an upright body, and <hi>Curva interras anima,</hi> a Crook-backed soul leaning toward the earth: so that whereas the soul should raise the body, and make it the better because of its Union with an immortal Spirit, it rather pulleth it down, and makes it the worse, the more earthly and fleshly. An earthly mind maketh the very posture of the body raised toward heaven, to become hypocritical and counterfeit: sith God hath given thee the body of a man looking upward towards heaven, do not take to thy self the spirit of a Beast, grovelling on the earth here below.</p>

               <head>CHAP. 4. Of the Creation of Mans Soul.</head>
               <p>I Now come to speak of the Creation of mans Soul; the story whereof is briefly laid down in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. <hi>And breathed into his nostrills the breath of life, and man became a living soul.</hi> Where you must not conceive, that the Lord did breath like a man; but the intent of the Holy Ghost (I conceive) is to shew, that Man had another kind of Soul than the Beasts or Birds: they were brought forth out of the material Elements, but Man, though his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy were drawn out of the Dust, yet his soul was in a peculier manner given him of God,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64054:78"/>
and not composed of any earthly, waterish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or aiery substance, but that it was a spiritual sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance immediately created of God: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this breathing in of the soul implieth (as may seem) that the soul was not first created without the body, and then put into the body, but that at once it was both created and infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into the body.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. 1.</head>
                  <p>NOw let us here speak a little of the nature of the Soul, and then of its powers and faculties.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the nature of the soul, it is a spirit, and herein most like unto the Angels of any other Creature; and though the wise man doth communicate this name to the life of a beast, yet he sheweth a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two sorts of spirits, saying, <hi>The spirit of a Man, that goeth upward; and the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a Beast, that goeth downward.</hi> The spirit of a Beast (or that which giveth it life) vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and dyeth with the body, being a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that riseth out of material or bodily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances tempered and composed together: but the spirit of a man being of an higher nature than any of these gross material bodies, and not rising out of them, but being created im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately of God the Father of Spirits, it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upward: it is presented before the Lord in judgment after its departure from the body.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is such a spirit as can subsist alone of it
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64054:78"/>
self out of the body: so the Apostle maketh mention of <hi>the spirits of just men made perfect, Heb.</hi> 12. the Spirits of the Saints now in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, whose bodies rest in the dust; and this sheweth the excellent matter of mans spirit, far above the life of the beast, or any unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creature, that it can subsist, when it is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the body. This sheweth that it doth not depend upon the body, nor was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted out of it, but rather that the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body dependeth on it: it can live without the body, but the body without it, rotteth, putrifieth and mouldereth away into dust. <hi>Dust returneth to Dust as it was,</hi> saith the wise man; <hi>and the Spirit returneth to him that gave it, Eccles.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is an immortal Spirit: so this very place sheweth, that when dust returneth to dust; when the body dissolveth, then the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit liveth, and yieldeth up it self into the hands of God. And so the Scripture sheweth both in the case of the godly, and of the wicked; the one shall go into life eternal, and the other into everlasting punishment.</p>

the soul, although for mine own part I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve them not to be properly inherent in the reasonable soul, but rather in the temper of the body: for the intellectual soul being a Spirit, I cannot see how these brutish affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (such as many of these are) can be inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in it; especially because many of them, as the faculties of attraction, retention, expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, augmentation, &amp;c. are ordinarily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, not only without the command, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so without the knowledg of the reasonable soul, which I know not how it could be, if they were inherent in it immediately, it being a single, spiritual and intellectual being.

                  <p>

to be evil. These two may be expressed by hunger and thirst on the one side, and on the other, a loathing of meat in the Stomach, when the heart riseth with dislike at some thing which as yet is absent, but is tendered to it, or may hereafter be presented to it. When our Saviour told <hi>Peter</hi> that he would fall into that fearful sin of denying his Lord and Master, his heart rose against it, and he detested it: this was not only a simple and meer hatred of it as a thing evil, which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to love: but also a detestation of it, as an evil that might happen, or was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told should happen to him, though now he were free from it, which is an affection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to desire.</p>
                  <p>In the next place is <hi>Ioy,</hi> which is an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the heart, pleasing and rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self in some good thing Enjoyed.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioy.</hi>
                     </note> In this affection there must be some good, [true, or seeming] in possession, which doth so affect the heart, as to rest it self with some contentment in it: opposite to this,<note place="margin">

                     </note> is <hi>Sorrow,</hi> which is an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heart, distasting some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil already felt. Now I cannot see, how this affection should be exercised in the state of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocense, because man had no cause of sorrow, unless it may be supposed, that he knew of the Angels fall and rebellion against the Lord, which is not likely.

                     <hi>The will</hi> is another principal faculty of the soul, chusing or refusing freely good or evil.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The Will.</hi>
                     </note> And as the understanding is (as it were) the eye; so the will is (as it were) the heart of the soul. For although the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing see never so clearly what is good, yet unless the Will agree, and give its consent, it is not followed. The Understanding is like one that giveth good counsel, but if the will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate, it is not followed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>He that knoweth his Masters will, and doth it not, to him it is sin</hi>; so that you see, a man may know, and not do. Now in such a case, a mans understanding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64054:83"/>
with Gods Will; for he both know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what God will have done, and knoweth it to be Good. But his Will crosseth both the Will of God and his own Understanding; which is the aggravation of sin, and encreaseth the Stripes. Now the Acts of the Will are in general two:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>To Will, or to Chuse.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>To Nill, or to Refuse.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in these two faculties, there are two others seated, as
<q>Free-Will and Conscience.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Free-Will</hi> is a faculty of the mind, whereby the Will without constraint doth willingly chuse or refuse what the understanding disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth to be good or evil; for all the power of man cannot compell the will to embrace or refuse what it will not refuse or imbrace. The outward man may be forced against the will, the Tongue may be forced, the Hand may be forced, but no Tyrant in the world can force the Will. And hence cometh that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable resolution of Gods Children in the profession of the gospel, even from the invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble freedome of the will, sanctified by the spirit of God; it is true! it is the spirit of God is the cause, but the Spirit is pleased to make this use of mans will, and of that liberty which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self gave man at his Creation: Again, on the other side, the will of man may be brought to cover its own inclination, and outwardly be brought to conform to the constraining pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of others; but the inward bent of it none can
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64054:83"/>
force a contrary way. Again, the will, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, by reasons discovered unto it, by bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter informations may be inclined to alter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but never violently turned by compulsion: when it is altered, though the preparatives and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of its alterations come from others, yet the alteration it self must come from it self. I speak not now of God's Act in renewing it by his Spirit, who being the Maker of the Will, hath that power over it, which no Creature can possibly have: yet the Lord will not compell the <hi>Will</hi> (for that were to destroy it and make it no Will) but by sanctifying and new-making it, he makes it willingly embrace that which it shunned before, and resolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reject what it embraced before.</p>
                  <p>Now although the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> did actually take away mans Spiritual life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in the Image of God, and the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Nature; yet it did but forfeit for the present, and not actually bereave him of his natural life, nor the natural pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his Soul, by which he lived; so then there is no question but man in the State of sin hath free Will. But the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, Wherein? I answer, in things natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and moral, not in things supernatural and spiritual. In natural things a man in his natural estate hath free-will to chuse or to refuse; in eating, and drinking; in eating or not eating; in walking or not walking, &amp;c. So in moral actions, a man in his natural estate may do many good moral acts, and hath liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64054:84"/>
of will to do them; as to use abstinence, to exercise temperance, to shun drunkenness, &amp;c. yet with exception, that many particulars through custome and company<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c, may be so enthralled to some lusts, that the exercise of this freedom of will is even wholly smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in them, and cannot shew it self, but is strongly clogged and kept down: but yet that which their will chuseth, it freely chuseth still. But now on the other side, it hath not liberty unto spiritual and supernatural things. It may freely entertain the use of outward means and ordinances, but it hath not free power to believe aright, to change it self, to purge it self from the stains of nature; to repent, &amp;c. All these must come from above: None but God can make his Image in Man, when Man and Satan hath defaced it. <hi>But if the Son shall make you free, then are you free indeed.</hi> If the Son of God shall by his spirit of liberty infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into us, deliver us from the thraldome of Sin and Satan, and renew the Image of God in us, then are we free indeed. This which is, spoken of free-will, doth not cross the sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of Gods will, nor the certainty of his decrees, sith mans will is brought about free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and willingly to embrace what God hath certainly purposed; whose purpose being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, He did not in the beginning of Time make such a Creature as should disappoint him of his eternal purpose.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of Conscience.</head>
                  <p>IN the next place followeth <hi>Conscience,</hi> about which it seemeth, that both the <hi>Understanding</hi> and the <hi>Will</hi> are exercised.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Conscience.</hi>
                     </note> This is an application of general Rules unto particular Cases, and points of practice; and this it performeth both by the <hi>Understanding</hi> and the <hi>Will</hi>; and that both concerning things not yet done, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning things already done. Conscience by vertue of the understanding judgeth such and such particular actions to be good, and such as it ought to practise, because it seeth them agreeable to those general rules of duty and of goodness, which it hath already conceived. Our Saviour knew that he must fulfill all Righteousness; therefore when <hi>Iohn</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to baptize him, he applieth that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to this Particular, He must fulfill all, therefore this part of Righteousness. St. <hi>Peter</hi> had laid up this general direction that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour gave him; <hi>Feed my Sheep</hi>; and so his sanctified Conscience made application of it on all particular occasions. Therefore when a multitude were gathered together won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring at the miraculous gifts of Tongues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on the Disciples; his Conscience tells him, now Thou must practise what thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster hath commanded; and so at that time he
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64054:85"/>
gathered some three thousand lost sheep into the fold of Christ.</p>
                  <p>In the second place, Conscience by vertue of the Will, Stirreth up the faculties of the soul to practise this particular duty, which is thus found agreeable to the general rules of duty and goodness. Now in that these things are not practised, this commeth from that disorder which sin hath made in the soul, and that preposterous confusion of the affections leading Conscience in a slavish captivity under the power of lust: so on the other side, it is for evils not yet done: The world promiseth a fair reward many times, if men will use foul means to obtain it: if riches begin to trade with the world about the matter, covetousness (like <hi>Iudas</hi>) saith to the world, What wilt thou give me, and I will betray my Masters honour, profane his Day, defraud my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, oppress my poor brother, &amp;c? But now Conscience cometh in, and laboureth to ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the bargain; and having laid up this general rule, That it shall not profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul, it applieth this to the case in hand; therefore it will be a most miserable bargain for me to gain this which is now proposed with the hazard of my soul. This doth conscience by vertue of the understanding, and then calleth up the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the will to help, which withdraweth from the thing as unlawful and dangerous, and riseth against it, and disliketh it with reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. So <hi>Ioseph</hi> had laid up this in his heart,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64054:85"/>
that adultery must not be committed, no not in secret, because it is a sin against the All-seeing eye of God; therefore, when his Mistriss tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him, he applieth this General to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occasion, and by the force of a sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied conscience biddeth defiance to her temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. <hi>How shall I do this great wickedness, and so sin against God?</hi> so <hi>David</hi> having laid up in his heart that precept in General, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother,</hi> and knowing that under this Title <hi>of father,</hi> was comprehended the King, and other Magistrates: and then again, <hi>Thou shalt do no murther</hi>: now he happeneth to come into a cave, and there meeteth with <hi>Saul,</hi> and hath him at advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: <hi>Saul</hi> sought to murther him, pursuing him without cause against his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, who was to succeed him in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and one that was annointed by the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial appointment of the King of Kings; yet <hi>David</hi> will not touch him, nor suffer <hi>Abishai</hi> to fall upon him, who was ready to have slain him, had <hi>David</hi> given way to it; for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all these provocations, conscience cries out, <hi>God forbid that I should lay my hand upon the Lords Annointed</hi>; and so prevaileth nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly against all these motives. <hi>So David stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his servants with these words, not suffering them to rise against Saul.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.7. It is in the original, he clave his men asunder; it seemeth his followers began to run together, desiring every one to lend his helping-hand to dispatch the mortal enemy of their Master
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64054:86"/>
                     <hi>David,</hi> but <hi>David</hi> by the force of an upright conscience, brake through them all, and put them aside, not suffering them to accomplish their bloody intendment But another time ye shall see when <hi>Nabal</hi> had dealt currishly with <hi>Davids</hi> Messengers, the news of this base abuse came (it seemeth) somwhat unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to <hi>David,</hi> and found his Conscience not well awakened; and so while Conscience slumbereth, and mindeth not what is in hand, passion condemneth <hi>Nabal,</hi> and all his family to present death. And whiles Anger maketh an hasty march for blood, and whetteth it self, as it goeth, <hi>Abigail</hi> meeteth it upon the way, and with a well-tempered voice, not so loud and violent as to enrage fury more than alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it was, yet loud enough to awake Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; she sheweth him his errour, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently Conscience being awakened, soundeth a retreat; maketh all lay down arms, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Instrument by whom it was shaken out of slumber, and kept from wallowing in innocent blood, or encroaching on Gods Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by self-revenge. But with wicked men Conscience many times prevaileth not in such cases, she cannot be heard; or being heard, is not regarded; Satan, the flesh, the world stop her mouth.</p>
                  <p>Now besides all this, Conscience hath its employment also about the things already past: if good, it excuseth and acquitteth the party, cheareth, comforteth, and is peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, unless mis-informed: so in performing
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64054:86"/>
good actions, and so in overcomming sinfull temptations; so <hi>Abigail</hi> telleth <hi>David,</hi> that when he should be King, he should have no trouble of Conscience for not shedding blood, if according to her petition he would spare <hi>Nabals</hi> family, Conscience should never accuse him for it, but should hold him guiltless. So you see <hi>Psal.</hi> 7. when he was falsly accused by a <hi>Benjamite</hi> for an evil he never commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, how boldly conscience pleadeth his cause before the Lord, and proclaimeth him inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
                  <p>Again, for evils done, or good duties omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Conscience accuseth, yea somtimes won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully rageth and terrifieth: it accused <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Psal.</hi> 51. I have sinned, &amp;c. yea it break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his bones (as it were) and grievously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth his soul.

Nature it self might teach even a natural man to be more careful of the natural good of the soul, than of the body, which yet is contrary to the practice of man. You will say the <hi>Natural man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not the things of the spirit, neither can he discern them, because they are spiritually discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> But I speak now of such natural good things, as tend to the enriching and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the soul and mind of man; namely, such knowledg in Arts and Sciences, as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the things of this life. How many do preferre the things of the body above these?

These things which are the most excellent endowments of the most excellent

part of man, are less regarded and sought for, than those that are the meanest appurtenances of the body, which is the meanest part. The least saving grace, being a thing belonging to the perfection of the soul, is worth more than the whole body; which without the soul, is but a dead lump of earth. <hi>Can a Maid forget her ornament, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

care is used to have it cured: nay, he that shall desire to cure it, or perswade them from these desperate courses tending to the destruction of their souls, shall be hated as an enemy. Our very creation should make us ashamed of this folly, that all the care is taken for the body framed out of the dust, and the soul is utterly neglected, which the Lord himself breathed into the body. <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">III. THis should teach us also that the greatest good which one man can do for another, is that which is done for his soul. The feeding, cloathing and refreshing of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers body, is a good work if rightly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; but the good which is done to the soul is a better work, as the soul is better than the body. This therefore should reform a gross folly among us, whereby it is conceived, that there is no good work in a manner besides that which is done to the body. It is true! that he who hath this worlds good, and yet doth no good in this kind, doth not truly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any other good work; but yet this on the otherside is a gross errour to conceive, that the best thing that a man can do, is to help the outward man; and that the doing of this is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to excuse him from doing good to the souls of others. This is a gross carnal conceit; it is as much as to affirm, that the body is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the soul; earth than heaven; mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty more excellent than immortality; and a lump of flesh more worth than a spiritual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now men are so far from esteeming that best which is done for the good of the soul,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64054:89"/>
that they account those admonitions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, which are tendered to them for this purpose, the greatest signs of ill-will, that any man can shew to others: no man is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a worse neighbour than he that will seek to pluck mens souls as brands out of the fire of Gods wrath by shewing them the danger of their sins. If men want for the body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what outcrys are there made against the hardness of others hearts? men are so hard-hearted now a days, that they will not give a poor man a bit of bread, they will see him starve first; and somtimes that is true which is said, though of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten false. But on the other side; one is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, he hath a blind soul; Another hath a graceless, profane, and unsanctified soul, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with many sins, in great danger to perish for ever: but when shall ye hear such a one complain of his neighbours for hard-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness toward his soul, in not pittying his spiritual misery, in not instructing him in his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. When shall ye hear one of these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, oh, I have a neighbour that hath know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, he knoweth that I am ignorant of God; but alas he is hard-hearted, he doth not pitty my soul! he will sooner see me damned in my ignorance, than once open his mouth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct me in any matter of salvation. Or when shall we hear one that goeth on in sin, cry out of another in this respect! I have a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour seeth my soul in a fearful case, he perceiveth me to go on in the stubbornness of my heart, and he knoweth that the wrath of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64054:90"/>
God will one day smoak against me for it, and yet his heart is hard, he hath no pitty upon me; he did never once open his lips to bring me into the right way, to reprove me for my sin. Nay, if any in zeal to Gods glory, and love to the souls of such, shall labour to do them good, what is their answer? meddle with your own business, I shall answer for my self, you shall not answer for my sin. I pray mark what sensles speeches these be: it is as if a man should see another fallen into a dangerous pit, where he could not live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out help<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and should go to help him out; or to direct one that is going in some dangerous place in in the dark, where he is like to break his neck; or to succour one that is in need, and like to starve, and should have such an answer from him as this? Why do ye trouble me? look to your self, if I perish, I perish, you shall not perish with me: Why do ye feed my body, if I starve, it is nothing to you, you shall not be famished by it: No verily, this help is for the body, and therefore it is welcome at all times; but the other that is for the soul, that is distasted as unseasonable and troublesome.</p>

But most lamentable is the sin of such in this case, whose care is onely for the bodies of their Children, but care not how they betray their souls; how they leave them in their sins which they see to grow upon them, and use no means to cure them of these deadly evils.

But the strength of the Soul lies in the Will when it is sanctified, and firmely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to obey its Maker in all things. When <hi>Barnabas</hi> saw the good affections of the new Converts at <hi>Antioch, be exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord,</hi> Act. 11.23. So <hi>David, I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgments, Psal.</hi> 119.106. there was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute spirit, and such should be the bent of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very sanctified will. The affections may be stirred, and yet may be no more but as a few loose sticks, which Satan will soon break a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and bring to nothing; but the will, when it is throughly bent and confirmed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it is as a common bond to tye up all the affections, and to strengthen all: let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray to the Lord, that he would give us both the Will and the Deed.</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

That is an happy soul, that is sick of this heavenly love. It is not enough to wish well to God and

his glory, and coldly to desire that things might be amended; but the heart must be carried after him in strong and stirring passions of Love; that as the heart of a fond lover is passionately carried, and overcome with the love of the person beloved; so should a Christian Soul not content it self with an ordinary cold temper of love, but should labour to have it self possessed with fervent affections, yea to be overcome. The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, saith the Apostle; now that (I hope) will work an affectionate love to God, when his love is poured abundantly into the heart; this will make a man love out of a pure heart fervently.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This will draw desire after it, which is another affection; oh how the Soul will pant, long, hunger and thrist for God, if once it fall in love with him, and be truly joyned unto him, having, tasted of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and found how Good the Lord is: I have lifted up mine eyes to the hills, saith the Psalmist. Travellers, at the foot of the hill look up to the top; and now oh that I were there with a wish! so a Christian, in the valley of humiliation, and in the sence of his own wants, lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up to God, and his holy Mount: and now, oh that I were with the Lord! oh that I were neer to him, and could more fully enjoy him! oh that I had more of his Spirit, more of his fulness, more of his

graces; my soul thirsteth for the Lord, even for the living God. And when once thou comest to this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how canst thou chuse but from thy heart loath all sin tendered or suggested to thee by Satan, the world, or the flesh; if once thou thus lovest God, thou wilt not make league with any enemy of His.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then thou wilt rejoice in the Lord with joy unspeakable and full of glory: then the worlds joys will seem poor, heartless, unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury flashes; and now a world for my part in that blessed feast of fat things, of wine upon the lees, of wine upon the lees well refined. No delicates so sweet as the Paschal Lamb, Christ Jesus; no feast so excellent, as that which the soul maketh on him by Faith. Now I can relish Christs sweetness in the Word, in the Sacraments, in private Meditations.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And now also must thy sorrow be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and nothing be so grievous to thee as that which is displeasing to thy God: thy heart should ake when his spirit is grieved; all should be godly sorrow, that bringeth repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: give not way to that sorrow for which thou must sorrow again, but to those tears af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which thou shalt reap in joy.</p>

               <p>I Come now to the second point, and that is, that God made both Sexes; <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,</hi> Man and Woman; which is here laid down in general, but more particularly set forth afterwards in the second Chapter from the eighteenth verse to the end. So that first you see, as was shewed before, that the Mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was framed out of the Dust, and the breath of life was breathed into him, as hath been shewed.</p>
               <p>Now in the next place we may observe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The necessity of the Creation of Woman after that Man was made.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The manner of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The conjunction of Both together.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A special consequent of the Image of God in both; and that was, that their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was without shame, being without sin. The first of these is laid down, Chap. 2. verse 18. &amp; 20. and therein two things are to be noted. 1. That man was alone. 2. That it was not good for him to be alone, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord would make him an help Meet for him. 1. He was alone; therfore it was noted, that when all the other living creatures were brought before him, there was not among
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64054:95"/>
them all, when they were in that best estate of their creation, any one that was an help meet for him; or fit to be joined in neerest society with him: There was not any among all the Creatures to which he gave Names, that did bear the Image of God, and so no fit match for him. 2. It was not good for him to be thus alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be objected, that then all that was made was not very good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> It was very good when it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, but not whilest it was in hand, before it was finished: An house is not very good for habitation before the roof is laid, &amp;c. when it is but an imperfect frame: So mans estate was not yet perfected, till the Lord had made him an help meet for him; and that was all done upon the Sixth day, and then the Lord said of all that he had made, That it was very good. But to the point; It was not good that man should be alone.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because it was needful that Mankind should be encreased for the glory of God; that as the other Creatures did encrease<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so men should multiply also, and bear rule over them. Therefore <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28.

But yet,</p>
               <p n="2">2. A second may be, that as God needing
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64054:95"/>
no creatures, yet did make creatures to which he might communicate his goodness; so he might be pleased to make such a creature, as should be sutable unto <hi>Adam,</hi> to whom he might communicate his love, and with whom he might take such an holy, undefiled, mutual contentmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. In the second place followeth the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Creation of the Woman; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The preparative, which was a Deep Sleep falling upon the man to take away the present u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. He took a rib out of his body, and left no breach nor wound in the body, but closed up the flesh again, and left it whole. And of this Bone he made a Woman, which should be joined unto him as an help meet for him.</p>

                  <hi>Adam,</hi> but among them all he found none that was an help meet for him, and therefore he brought the woman to another end; and in bringing her, did join her to him in marriage: and <hi>Adam</hi> on the other side, with a glad and thankful heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> accepteth her at the hands of God; giveth her a name answerable to her beginning, which he alleadgeth as a reason of the name, and of the near affinity between him and her. <hi>This is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she was taken out of man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The law of marriage was enacted, <hi>vers.</hi> 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where is shewed: 1. That the conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between Man and Wife should be most near. 2. That it should not be dissolved. 3. That it should be between one Man and one Woman.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It should be most near: for it should be nearer than that between the child and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother, which is nearer than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther besides this of Marriage. Therefore in marriage, the father is said to give his child; so that now the husband is the wifes, and the wife is the husbands. They must be near in cohabitation, or in dwelling together; most near in affection, near in a mutual communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of bodies and goods; so near, that they must be one: even as the woman was a part of the man being taken out of him, so it must be conceived, that each man must judge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self one with his wife, and not esteem her as a person divided from himself; not take her for
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64054:96"/>
another, but account her a part of himself.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It must not be dissolved, because they are become one: for a man to fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore our Saviour giveth not way to any divorce, except it be for Adultery, for then the party that committeth adultery doth rent it self from that Union wherein they were knit together; every adulterous act being a divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Marriage-bond.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It must be between one man and one woman; and not between one, and more than on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By the Creation it self when the Lord made but one woman for one man, which is the argument used by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Malach.</hi> 2.15. and if ever it had been expedient to have had many wives, it had been then fittest that the earth might have been more speedily replenished. 2.

The last thing is a consequent of Gods I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in both; which was, that their nakedness was without shame; the cause whereof, was, because they were free from sin.

               <p>
                  <hi>Use</hi> 1. THis condemneth the folly of those that use to say, that women have no souls; which though it be a most sottish speech, yet no Opinion is so sottish, which hath not some to embrace it. Howsoever! though men think not so, but speak it many times in an idle jesting humour, yet is it worthy of reproof in publique; both because it is to be reckoned among those idle words for which the speaker must give account at the day of Judgment, and also because it is a notorious lie and falshood, which no Christian tongue should utter in jest or earnest. And that which the Apostle speaks in another case, may be applied to this, <hi>That evil words corrupt good manners.</hi> But if it were worthy of a confutation, it were easily shewed, that the blessed Virgin began her song of praise thus; <hi>My soul doth magnifie the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. It is said, that <hi>Lydia</hi> (another woman) had her heart or soul opened to attend to the word of God. It is said, that the Woman whose Daughter had a Devil, had a great Faith, which is always seated in the soul. It is said, that the woman who washed our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours feet with tears, had many sins forgiven her; but without a soul she could not have sinned, nor have received forgiveness of sins. But some that will take upon them to carp at Sermons or Catechisms, though themselves
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:64054:97"/>
have need to be catechized, will say, it is an idle thing to speak of this: let their wisedomes know then, that in mine own experience I have found such as could not tell whether Christ were God or man, or an Angel &amp;c. Therefore there is need that the plainest things should be taught, and that they which know them should also know some arguments whereby to stop profane cavilling mouths; but <hi>Moses</hi> tells us, that both male and female were made after the image of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both the one and the other had an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Soul; both were made Rulers over the Creatures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This sheweth God's tender care over man, he would not suffer him to want that which was good for him: thus tender is his love when sin maketh no breach. This should therefore teach Thee, <hi>O man,</hi> to lament thy sins, and the sins of the land, when any evil befalleth thee or the land. Hadst not thou wronged him by thy sins, as <hi>Adam</hi> then had not, he would have been as tender over Thee as over Him. Had it not been for sin, the Lord would have said, It is not good for man to be punished with famine and scarcity, I will provide him food convenient for him. It is not good for man to be sick, I will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue health unto him. It is not good for him to be made a Slave, or a Prisoner, whom I have made Lord of the other creatures, I will give him liberty. It is not good to bring him under any affliction, I will keep him free
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64054:98"/>
from sorrow. It is not good that he should die, I will give him immortality. Thus would the Lord have dealt with man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had not sin confounded that happy peace between God and man complain not then so much of thy afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as it is a cross to thee, as of thy sin which is a cross to God, and which hath moved him to bring the cross of affliction upon Thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In that woman was made to be an Help meet for man at her creation, and at the first appointment of marriage, this sheweth, that, So far as she is an hinderance to him, or neglecteth to help him, So far she erreth from the right end of marriage. As she is an hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to him in Spiritual things, and a means either to draw him from God, or to cool his Zeal for Gods glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to lessen his care for his service, or to make him more backward in good du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ies, or to discourage him from a sincere constant course of obedience; so far doth she grievously cross the very rules, the true end and original institution of marriage. Again, so far as she helpeth him forward in these things, as she provoke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h him to grow in grace, and to be more and more fruitful in good works, so far she sheweth her self to be a wife, even a wife of Gods making, an help meet for man; for indeed she is no farther a wife then she is an helper. Again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So far as by her wilfulness, negligence, or wastful riot she impaireth his estate, So far she faileth of those accomplishments that should go to the making up of a wife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And, so far as by moderate care,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64054:98"/>
diligence and discretion she furthereth him this way, so far she approveth her self to be a true wife, that is, <hi>an help meet for him</hi>; So it is in regard of his true comfort and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment every way, <hi>sc.</hi> of his credit &amp;c. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wives should labour to be Wives, that is, helps in every respect: for although infirmities sithence the fall wil not permit them to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly helpful in the highest degree, yet should they labour to do their best in every several kind, wherein they ought to be helpful.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The neerness of the marriage-bond which is shewed by the original of the woman taken out of Man, and the law of marriage enacted by God, whereby they are become one flesh, should move them both to knit their hearts in most intire and mutual love, accounting each other, and affecting each other, as a part of him or her self.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This condemneth the pride of the whore of Babylon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which accounteth the state of marriage polluted and thinketh her shave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings too good and holy to enter into that order, which yet the Lord thought a fit and helpful estate for Adam in his first estate, when the image of God shined b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ightly and perfectly in his Soul without all spot of lust, or stain of corruption.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In that nakedness it self was not shameful, until naked Man and woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came sinfull; this should make us not so much ashamed of any thing as of sin; no meanness of condition, no defects or deformities, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64054:99"/>
of lving and idle Tongues should make us so ashamed as any sin against God; for shame is as proper unto sin as the shadow to the Body, and we may call shame the shadow of sin. For as there is no shadow without some light, yet the shadow cometh not from the light but from the Body; So shame doth not follow sin without some light to discover it, yet the shame cometh not from the light but from sin; there must be either the light of the Word, or of Conscience, or nature &amp;c: to discover sin before the shame of it (which is its shadow) will appear: and therefore men that are wholly in darkness and blindness, and come not to the light, they go on without sense of the shame of sin. And that is the reason why Men hate the light and those that hold it forth, because it maketh their sin cast shadow, it maketh the shame of their sin to appear, which was hidden before in the dark.</p>

That God made Man in his own Image,</hi> which cleerly appeareth, both in the story of the consultation between the glorious persons of the blessed Trinity, and also in the relation of the execution of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation here in my Text. Now for the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this point, two things are to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. What is an Image in General.</item>
                     <item>2. Wherein this Image of God in Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>An Image is such a likeness of a thing, as doth bear a special relation to the thing resembled by it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>An Image what it is.</hi>
                     </note> either as flowing from its Beeing, or fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med according to it: so that every Image of a thing is like unto the thing whose Image it is; but every thing that is like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is not an Image of it. Any thing that is of the same colour wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h another thing may be said to be like unto it, but not an Image of it. But in an Image, besides likeness, there is
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:64054:100"/>
required one of these two things; either that it be expressed by the essence of that whose Image it is, or els that it be purposely fashioned according to it. In the former sense, none but the Eternal son of God is the true Image of God the father, as he is called <hi>the Brightness of his Glory, and the express Image of his</hi> person.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.3.</note> And so a Son may be said to be the Image of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as Adam is said, after his fall to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten a Son in his own likeness, after his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. In the other sense, an Image is that which is made like to another, framed of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to resemble it: So is a picture or a statue made by Art to represent some person: and such was the Image of God in Man, for the Lord did purposely, as you see by the consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, make Man like himself, to resemble him, and to bear his Image</p>

                  <p>IN the second place I come to shew, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Image of God in Man consisteth, and what it is.</p>
                  <p>This was in general, that Perfection which God gave unto Man in his first Creation,<note place="margin">

                     </note> for God is a most perfect Beeing, infinite in all divine perfection: therefore that perfection which Man had above all other Creatures here below, was the Image of God in Man. Now this perfection was two-fold.</p>

                  <p>Principal in the Soul: this is fully laid down unto us in these two places. <hi>Colos.</hi> 3 10. <hi>Yee have put off the old Man, and have put on the new Man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the Image of him that created him</hi>: and that <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.24. <hi>That yee put on the new Man, which after God is created in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and true holiness</hi>: where we see the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral powers of the Soul had their several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and there is no faculty of the Soul which may not be made perfect by these, so that in these did the Image of God consist.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be said, that in those two places. St <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of regeneration, or the new birth, and not of that old and first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the beginning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> It is true! and this maketh for our purpose; for the Apostle sheweth here, that the Image of God consisteth in these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; now the Image of God restored by regeneration, is the same which was given by Creation at the first, and that building which <hi>Adam</hi> pulled down by his sin, our Saviour built up again by his obedience and mediation. <hi>As in Adam all die, even so by Christ shall all be made alive.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. That is, Christ shall make up that which was undone by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>: there cannot be any thing named for matter of substance that <hi>Adam</hi> lost, but Christ restored it, and therefore he is called the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> and in the comparison between
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64054:101"/>
them and the first <hi>Adam,</hi> it is said, <hi>the first Man Adam was made a living Soul, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Adam was made a quickning Spirit,</hi> ver. 45. That is, the first <hi>Adam</hi> was made a living soul, by Creation, living the life of nature, by the substance and faculties of his Soul united to his Body, and a supernatural life too, by the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God in his Soul: and, had he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in that estate, he should have conveyed the same life, both natural and supernatural to his posterity: but losing that supernatural life, consisting in the Image of God, he remained a meer living Soul, and no better, one that had but only the life of nature left him, arising out of the essence and natural powers of the Soul and so could only convey this natural life to his posterity, whose Souls were dead in sin, to whom he could not impart any quickening vertue, to raise them unto that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural life in holiness and righteousness. But Christ was a quickening Spirit, not only having this supernatural life in himself, but also quickening those with a new principle of supernatural life, to whom he is joyned by the Spirit: and so he is called a second <hi>Adam,</hi> as being the founder of a new generation of Men; for as all Men by nature do spring of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> so all Christians by grace do come of the second <hi>Adam,</hi> and receive that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life from him again, which the first <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> received, but lost. Now if the first <hi>Adam</hi> had continued in his first estate, and kept the Image of God, there had been no need of the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64054:101"/>
second <hi>Adam</hi>; for all Men by their natural birth should have received from him that superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural life, together with the natural. But this first <hi>Adam</hi> having lost the Image of God, was now but the Author of an imperfect genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Men, naturally alive, but spiritually dead; and therefore there was need of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> who should be the Author of a new birth, and should give a new, a second, a spiritual life and Beeing to those who were naturally dead in trespasses and sins: so that by this it is plain, that that new Beeing and spiritual life, which Christ by his spirit resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to his Members, is that very Image of God, which God made in Man at the first; and this you see, doth principally consist in knowledge holiness, and righteousness; which are the perfections of the understanding judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conscience, will and affections.</p>

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:64054:102"/>
have such a knowledge of God, as was a full declaration, and apprehension of an infinite God; but it was perfect in its kind, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had so much knowledge of his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, as was sufficient to make him admire him, love him, magnify him above all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so much as was sufficient cleerly to direct him in any duty, which by the first Covenant and Law of his Creation he owed unto him: so that as God knew himself, so Man had a cleer knowledge of God, and therein did bear his Image.</p>
                  <p>Then had he also a <hi>perfect knowledge</hi> of the Creatures, <hi>sc.</hi> of Himself and Others. <hi>Himself</hi> he knew both soul and body, and well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the nature and vertue of each faculty in the one, and the temper and use of each mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or parts in the other.

And those things which we call now <hi>hidden qualities</hi> in the Creatures, were not hidden from him, and are now covered from us, not in regard of their own natures, but in respect of our blindness, contrary to that light which was natural to us in the Creation.</p>
                  <p>But all this while, Man had <hi>no knowledge of evil</hi>; he knew not what ignorance or error meant; he knew not what a stubborn will, an hard heart, a polluted conscience was: he had no knowledge of the nature of diseases nor of their remedies; no nor of the cure of sin, nor of the washing away of its guilt and pollution: Therefore the promise of this new kind of knowledge, made by Sathan, caused the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Ear to itch, and her Heart to long, as imagining her self capable of some higher per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which God had not given her; for this knowledge concerned not that estate of Man, or did it make for his happiness.</p>

If he had any actual <hi>desire,</hi> it was most holy: but I see not what he could actually desire in that estate, unless it were the continuance of that happiness which he had, and that neer communion with his God; for he was full already, and had as much joy, holiness, and happiness, as he was capable of: so that his desire of good, was not,<note place="margin">

                     </note> to have it increased, but only to have it continued to him: but he had not the least desire of any evil; his <hi>Ioy</hi> was wholly in God, who was his happiness, and in whom he found most sweet and full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. He had no matter of <hi>grief</hi> within, or without him, nothing that should lessen his joy, or imbitter his comfort: sin, which is the fountain of <hi>sorrow,</hi> was not then found in the World. As for sorrow, he had none actually stirring in him, though an ability he had, which afterward he had much cause to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy. His <hi>trust</hi> and confidence was in God,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64054:103"/>
and he believed that which he revealed to him. So long as he stood firm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that threatning; <hi>In the Day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt die the Death.</hi> And when Sathan by his lying suggestion brought him from his stedfast belief of this Truth, then his Feet were more than almost gone, his steps had more than well-nigh slipped. But while he remained in his state of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he believed without doubting; yet had he not actually faith in Christ, as a Redeemer, which is that grace whereby the Elect in this new Covenant of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are saved; for being free from sin, he needed not a Redeemer to satisfy for his guilt by his Death: yet I doubt not, but that he had an ability to believe whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God should reveal unto him, and so to have believed this truth, if it had been revealed.

Of the things belonging to the Body, you have heard before, when <hi>I</hi> spake of the Creation of the Body, <hi>sc.</hi> the beauty and excellent temper of the Body: for though the Lord hath no Body, being an infinite, and most glorious Beeing; yet these things, as they were excellencies, and things that made somewhat for the happiness of Man, they were in some sort resemblances of the divine glory and excellency of God: To

But you will say, all in the World come short of <hi>Adam</hi>'s perfection: True and

therefore all must strive to grow in grace more and more, and none must condemn another that goeth beyond himself: but yet there is a great difference in this case, for some are not sensible of their failings; at least, not so, as to be carefull to reform them, but rather dislike those that give them the best examples, and keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves most close to the Rule of the Word. These have not the Image of God at all restored to them, they have no part of that spiritual life which <hi>Adam</hi> had. But others there be whom the Lord hath new-mold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and once again by his Spirit hath breathed into them the breath of spiritual life, who see themselves to come short of that perfection which <hi>Adam</hi> had; and mourn, and strive, and pray, and use all holy means and helps to this purpose, who are willing to be shewed, wherein they come short of this Image of God in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> wherein they are unlike unto it, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be reproved by the Word; These have some degrees of his Image renewed in them, and these strive after farther per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. But now compare thy self with this Image of God in <hi>Adam</hi> before his Fall, and see what thou hast to do, how much is amiss in thee, and must be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. When a Man hath lost a great estate, and by some means beginneth to recover again, he will scarce think he hath enough, until he hath gotten as much as
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64054:106"/>
he had before; he would fain be as rich as ever he was: Men are too greedy of these things; but as the Apostle saith, so say I, <hi>Covet yee the best things.</hi> Thou wast rich in <hi>Adam,</hi> our first Parent had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of riches to leave us; but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Treason, and so all was forfeited into the hands of the Lord. Now we should never think our selves well, until we have recovered the same degree of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency which we lost. Thou that think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou knowest enough, consider how far thou comest short of <hi>Adam,</hi> who knew the Lord perfectly; but thou art ignorant of many things in the Word of God, and those things which thou dost know, thou knowest it very imperfectly. How far art thou from that full purpose of heart in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying God, and cleaving to him that was in <hi>Adam</hi>? How far from that uprightness, that perfection of holiness, those Heavenly affections, that strong love to God, that ravishing constant joy in him, which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had? How unsetled are thy affections? How dead is thy heart? How little art thou affected toward Heavenly things? How far in love with the Earth, and Earthly things? Therefore think with thy self, in these and these things I am unlike to God, I bear not his Image, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his purity, and so resolve upon present reformation: And beware thou art not of the number of those, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead

               <p>THus much of Visible or Corporeal Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: now let us speak something of the Invisible or Spiritual; where observe, from the Text, that God Created all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible substances. These are called <hi>Spirits,</hi> or <hi>Angels,</hi> and all of them (I conceive) have the same natural Essence or Beeing, though in regard of their present moral en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to good or evil, there be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull difference between them.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:64054:107"/>1. For their nature, they are called <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>: so the good Angels are called, <hi>He hath made his Angels Spirits, Psal.</hi> 104. So the evil Angels are often called <hi>unclean Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> in the Holy story of the Evangelists; and in that story of <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>King. ult.</hi> there is mention made of <hi>a lying Spirit.</hi> Now in that they have appeared in a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily shape, this is no proof that their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not spiritual: but this they might do, sometimes by the Lords command, sometime by his sufferance for special ends; for if some excellent Artificers can amaze the minds of others with strange inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and artificial performances, how easie is it for these excellent Creatures, even of any matter, Ayr, or Water, &amp;c. to frame shapes for any purpose?</p>
               <p n="2">2. For their Original, here you see they were created, as the Text maketh it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, but not as many other Creatures, so as to propagate others of their own kind; but all those that now are, we suppose were at first created, and their number shall not be encreased to the end of the World: for the Day when they were created, it is uncertain: some think it was the first Day with the Light, and that is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely; but we must not speak perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily where the Scripture is silent: howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, both Scripture and Reason do prove that they were made, though the time of

their Creation, as well as many other things concerning them be hidden from us, because not necessary for us to know.</p>

               <p>THeir Knowledge is either natural, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them at the first Creation, or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural by revelation from God, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and gotten by experience: that they had excellent knowledge at their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is no question, being made more excellent than Man, who yet at the first had an admirable measure of knowledge given unto him. The knowledge which they have of God, and of his works, is admirable from their very Creation, though yet it is not infinite: it doth not reach to things to come, unless it be indirectly by a consideration of some things present, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by collecting what will follow, or by see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things in their causes: otherwise they have no certain natural knowledge of things meerly future; for that is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of God denyed to the Creatures. But besides this, they have a supernatural knowledge revealed of God unto them, and thus they come acquainted with many things to come, when the Lord is pleased to give them knowledge of them: So the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> knew that Christ should be
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64054:108"/>
conceived in the Womb of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> because the Lord had revealed this to him, and sent him to acquaint her with it: So on the contrary, the lying Spirit knew that <hi>Ahab</hi> should fall at <hi>Ramoth-Gilead,</hi> because the Lord had revealed so much to him. Besides this, there is no doubt, but that they have wonderfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased their knowledge these many years, which have passed since their first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Consider this, that being Spirits, and not having their understandings dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by any gross Vapours arising from the Body, nor interrupted in their specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by any Bodily pains or sickness, nor being subject to weariness, nor in any sort hindered or disabled by old Age, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted by seeking necessary supplies for the Body (all which are impediments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to Bodily substances;) and besides all these, have had many thousand Yeares, wherein to increase their knowledge; it is beyond our imagination to think to what an height they are grown by this means. The Apostle sheweth that the holy Angels did encrease their knowledge in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, by the Preaching of the Apostles. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Unto me who am less than the least of all Saints is this grace given, that I should Preach among the Gentiles, the unsearchable riches of Christ</hi>; that Men might learn, as he saith, <hi>Vers.</hi> 9. But this was not all; there were Scholars also of an higher
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:64054:108"/>
forme in the School of Christ, <hi>sc.</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels themselves. <hi>To the intent that now unto Principalities and Powers in Heavenly places, might be known by the Church the manifold wisdome of God.</hi> Vers. 10. This may seem strange, that Angels should learn of Men; but this we must know, that it was not <hi>Paul,</hi> nor any mortal Man, that of himself could teach these immortal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits any knowledge which they had not: but it was the Holy Ghost himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who is infinitely above Men and Angels, that spake by the Apostles to the Angels, and out of the Mouths of Men, did teach these glorious Spirits. But there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the end of this knowledge, in Angels and Men: for Men must learn the mysteries of grace, both that they may believe and be saved, and also that they may admire, and magnify the riches of Gods grace in the work of Redemption. But the Angels do not learn this, for their own Redemption, who never fell into Sin, and therefore need no pardon, but that they may glorify God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Salvation of the Elect. And as God the Son did choose to unite to himself, not the Nature of Angels, but of Man: So God the Holy Ghost did choose rather to speak by Men to the Angels in this mystery, concerning God the Son, (being God and Man) than by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:64054:109"/>Now there is no doubt, but the evil Angels also do learn the Gospel-mysteries, which they also believe, and tremble: they are constant hearers; and it may well be thought, that there is never a Sermon which is likely to bring any danger to their Kingdome, but that some of them are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, though for no good intent: yea, when they hinder others from learning, yet they learn themselves, though they never mean to practise. And as the Angels, good and evil, have increased their knowledge in the mystery of Christ; So (I doubt not, but) they have done the like in other things by their long experience. Now yee must not think there is an essential or natural dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the good and evil Angels, though they differ exceedingly in regard of moral good or evil, no more than there is between good and evil Men. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> were both Men, though the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence were great in their ends, and in their dispositions.</p>

               <head>CHAP. 3.</head>
               <p>NOw I come to speak briefly of both these sorts apart: and first of the good Angels (such as all were at the first;) for, as for the evil Angels, they are not so by their Creation; and therefore as they are evil, they are not to be reckoned among the Creatures: we may safely say, that God made no Devils; for though he made those Creatures which now are wicked Devils, yet he made them not Devils, but Holy Angels, excellent and glorious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; but I shall not speak of them here. Now for the good Angels.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Consider their perfection, which is both of Nature, and of Grace. The Lord at the first gave them an excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Nature, whereby he made them good, perfect, and compleat according to their kind, so that they wanted no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, which belonged to created Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and perfect intellectual Natures: So doubtless they had naturally admirable po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and strength given them, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.20. <hi>Bless the Lord yee his Angels, mighty in strength.</hi> One Angel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadeth a whole Camp of Souldiers, and in one Night slayeth 185000 Men: their
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:64054:110"/>
agility, speed and quickness is extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; how swiftly doth the Wind fly through the Ayr, but these Spirits are far more quick and active; and therefore the <hi>Cherubins</hi> are described with Wings, and so the <hi>Seraphims</hi> also; yea, they are called <hi>a Flame of Fire,</hi> in regard of their infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med love to God. No doubt, they had a fulness of all perfection answerable to their Natures, Power, Knowledge, quickness, perfect holiness, love to God, joy in him unspeakable and glorious; and especially a most happy habitation in the glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, and Kingdome of Heaven. To this natural perfection which all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels had at first, and which the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels still have, we suppose must be added a perfection of free Grace, whereby the Lord was pleased to confirm some of them in their first estate, leaving some to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as he might justly have done all: for although the Lord did give natural per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection unto all, yet he was not bound in justice to add his grace of confirmation unto all or any; for that which is of grace, cannot be a due. This I doubt not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was done in and through the Son, though not through his Incarnation; not through him as made Man: for as God the Father made all things through his Son; so he doth all his works through him, and especially this work of confirming the blessed Angels in
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:64054:110"/>
their happiness; and therefore in this respect he is the Head of the Angels also.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The number of the Angels is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great: the Scriptures makes mention of many thousands, and there are multitudes employed for the good of the Church in all parts of the World. Howsoever! the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of these Stars of the third Heaven (the blessed Angels) is as uncertain to us, as the number of those Stars which are in the second Heaven: we must therefore leave it to God, as one of his concealed secrets, who telleth as well the number of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, as of the Stars, and calleth them all by their proper Names.</p>
               <p n="3">III. As for the Office and employment of Angels, it is:</p>
               <p n="1">1. To attend on the Lord, and give him praise: <hi>I am Gabriel that stand in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Lord,</hi> said the Angel, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. So in the Vision of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> the Angels stood with their Wings, covering their Faces, and singing before the Lord, <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts, all the Earth is full of his glory. Isai.</hi> 6. So in <hi>Luke</hi> 2. the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels joyn together in praising the Lord, and in many places of the <hi>Revelations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To go at the command of God: and so they are called Angels, that is, Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: and the Angels both in the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:64054:111"/>
and <hi>Greek</hi> are called Messengers: so An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were sent to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Lot,</hi> to the blessed Virgin, to <hi>Zachary,</hi> to our Saviour: they are ready at a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p n="3">3. To defend the Church: <hi>He shall give his Angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways. Psal.</hi> 91.11, 12. <hi>They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest at any time thou dash thy Foot against a Stone:</hi> So the Angels defended <hi>Elisha,</hi> against the Host of the <hi>Syrians</hi>; and there were more with him than against him. Doubtless, the Church of God, and particular Members of it, do receive great assistance, and protection from the holy Angels: and that (as I conceive) not only in regard of outward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but also in respect of spiritual Enemies. For I cannot conceive, but that the good Angels should as well suggest good thoughts, as the evil Angels do evil thoughts: and as a Man hath his own corruption, and the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the evil Spirits on the one side to draw him into sin, so I am verily perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he hath the graces of the holy Ghost, and the assistance of the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, to help him against sin, and to stir him up to obedience. And as Sathan pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth not in tempting us to sin, unless our Corruptions joyn with him: so I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:64054:111"/>
these holy Angels prevail not usually in provoking us to good, unless the grace of the Spirit shall make their perswasions effectual; these things we may conceive by Analogy, considering the practices of evil Angels. And it may be thought, that those restraining thoughts, which many times do bridle the rage of the wicked, so that it breaketh not out against the godly, even then when they have intended, and begun to attempt mischief against them, are cast into their minds by the Angels.— As for the godly, I am perswaded, they are many times directed strongly, by the secret sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions of the Angels, for the avoiding of dangers, and the obtaining of good: but whether every particular Christian hath one particular Angel, I cannot so well resolve you, though I know some there are, that understand that place of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. to imply so much; where Christ speaking of young Children, saith; <hi>I say unto you, that in Heaven there Angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And here, by the way, you may observe a special charge which the Angels have of Children, helping those which are most helpless: and for my part, I am resolved, that the Angels do especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally guard young Children against a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of dangers, that they are apt to fall into; yea, that they stand about our Beds,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64054:112"/>
and keep us sleeping; then especially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending us when we are most subject to danger.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Their Office also is to execute God's Judgments: so did an holy Angel on <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib</hi>'s Army: so did two holy Angels on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi>

                  <hi>Use</hi> 1. HEre meditate upon this excellent work of the All-sufficient Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who being an Eternal Infinite Beeing, made these Immortal, but finite Spirits, most like to Himself of all the Creatures that he made; therefore he rather chooseth to call himself by the name of these Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures [<hi>a Spirit</hi>] than by any other; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though indeed he is more properly called <hi>Iehovah,</hi> a Beeing in general, than by the name of any Creature in special.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Admire him who hath so many glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Angels to attend him, whereof the least is far more excellent than the greatest Earthly Monarch: admire his Majesty, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ho hath so many thousand glorious mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring Spirits. Admire his Goodness, who notwithstanding the multitude of these, is yet pleased to take poor Men into his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64054:112"/>
yea into the number of his Children, to partake of his Inheritance for ever. Think then, if God call me to his service, it is for my good, he needeth me not. He that hath thousands of Angels ready to do his meanest service, needeth not a Worm of the Earth to do his work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In that these Angels are Spirits, and without Bodies, you may be assured, that the spiritual delights and contentments are of all other the most excellent: for the Angels have sweeter delights than all the Earth can afford; and yet no delights of Eyes, of Ears, of Tast, Feeling, Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, &amp;c. Nothing whereof the Flesh is sensible; yet these have most abundant ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of joy. Labour therefore to get above these dull, earthly, sensual delights, and to feast thy Soul with those sweetest, purest, highest contentments of the holy Angels, in enjoying God, and walking with him, so shalt thou have thy Conversation in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moreover, let the perfections of the Angels teach thee humility of spirit: let their knowledge keep thee from being proud of thine; let their holiness make thee bewail thy pollutions; their speed and readiness make thee to lament thy back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness: And as thou prayest, so endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:64054:113"/>
to do the will of God on Earth, as these holy Angels do it in Heaven: do it readily and willingly, as they do with wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed affections: do it heartily and sincerely, as they: do it universally in all things, and do it spiritually in the power of the spirit, as these blessed spirits, who have no flesh at all to dull them in the work of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let the hope of their society in that glorious Kingdome stir thee up to seek this Kingdome; Oh that blessed day, when I shall for ever keep company with so many glorious Spirits: let me despise all fleshly companions in comparison of them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Again, being Creatures, they are not to be worshipped; <hi>See thou do it not,</hi> saith the Angel to St. <hi>Iohn</hi>: yet must they be reverenced, as the most excellent servants of God, full of admirable graces; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially we must reverence them in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves at all times publickly and secretly, as becometh such as will keep company with the holy Angels: so saith St. <hi>Paul</hi>; the Woman must not carry her self in unseemly manner, contrary to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, <hi>Not come with her Head uncovered into the Congregation, because of the Angels,</hi> for they are present in the Church-Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:64054:113"/>7. We must take heed (as not to grieve the blessed Spirit of God) so not to grieve these his Ministring Spirits, who as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at the conversion of a sinner, so they abhor the obstinacy of a sinner going on in his sins. Doest thou not do those things among thy sinfull companions which thou wouldest be ashamed to do in the sight of some grave and sober Persons? How da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest thou then do them before the Angels? Nay, why art thou not ashamed to do them before the very face, and in the presence of God?</p>
               <p n="8">8. Be thankfull for that Protection which the Lord giveth thee by these; and with a thankfull heart, bless Him for this Guard in thy Journeys, upon the way, in thy Bed when thou sleepest, in many sudden dangers; and believe assuredly, that thou receivest much good by their means, which thou dost not take particular notice of, that thou escapest many dangers by their help, which thou never fearedst.</p>
