            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THere have been lately printed, and made publick, Two ſcandalous
Pamphlets; the one under the Title of [<hi>The Proceedings before
the Houſe of Lords, between the Duke and Dutcheſs of</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk:]
The other is called [<hi>The farther Depoſitions and Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
in the Houſe of Lords, in the Affair of the Duke and
Dutcheſs of</hi> Norfolk; <hi>with the Bill of Divorce.</hi> Now theſe two Papers are ſo
far from a faithful Narrative of the ſaid Proceedings, that what with confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Order of the Tranſaction, and diſguiſing the Truth of Things, by induſtrious
Omiſſions, groſs Imperfections, and wilfal Miſtakes. This pretended Account has
made it abſolutely neceſſary, even for the ſake of common Juſtice, to ſet the World
right in the Story: To which end the entire Series of this Affair is here ſet forth,
from Point to Point, juſt as it paſſed before their Lordſhips, and ſtands upon their
Journal; with ſuch Notes upon the Evidence on both ſides, as the Nature of the
Caſe requires, and as the Reaſon of it will fairly bear.</p>
            <p>The Reader will obſerve here, upon this Relation, that the two Principal Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
produced againſt the Dutcheſs of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> are <hi>Rowland Owen</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet
Ellwood,</hi> for they ſwear poſitively to the ſtreſs of the Queſtion, whereas all
the reſt is but Circumſtantial, and made uſe of only for Aggravation, Prejudice,
and Clamour: So that upon invalidating their Teſtimony, the main Cauſe falls
effectually to the Ground, ſaving only the unavoidable Misfortune of many an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Perſon, that ſuffers under the Impoſſibility of proving a Negative; there
being no Fence againſt uncharitable Preſumptions. Now taking this for granted,
(as it is not to be denied) the Reader is only deſired to lay ſeriouſly to Heart the
Impoſſibility of the Fact that is ſworn againſt the Dutcheſs, in ſome Caſes, and the
utter impoſſibility of it to be true in others: The Tampering and Practice that has
been uſed, the Inconſiſtency of the Witneſſes with themſelves, their Character, and
Credit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (one of them (<hi>Ann Burton</hi>) being trapt in a falſe Oath, out of her
own Mouth, upon the very place of Examination.)</p>
            <p>The Reader will alſo take notice, that of <hi>Twenty Six Witneſſes</hi> produced in
Favour of the Duke; one half of them are <hi>Principals,</hi> and the other only <hi>Seconds.
Peter Scriber, Andrew Anderſon, Robert Hemming, John Reynolds,</hi> and
<hi>Margaret Foſter,</hi> are five of the former Number; but ſpeaking little or nothing
to the Merits of the Queſtion, it was not thought worth the while to offer Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to their Teſtimony, though to the other Eight, that is to ſay, <hi>Owen, Ell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
Hudſon, Burton, Varelſt, Tho. Foſter, Lloyd</hi> and <hi>Wadſworth;</hi> there
were ſeveral Witneſſes on the behalf of the Dutcheſs to invalidate their Credit (<hi>viz.</hi>)
Two to the Firſt, Six to the Second, Two to the Third, Four to the Fourth, One
to the Fifth, Two to the Sixth, Two to the Seventh, and Six to the Laſt. It
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150331:3"/>
is very remarkable alſo, after all theſe Exceptions to every one of the Duke's prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Witneſſes, that the Teſtimony of the Dutcheſs's Witneſſes paſſed current
without any contradiction, ſaving only that <hi>Henry Daggley,</hi> and <hi>John Hoskins</hi>
were examined againſt the Credit of <hi>John Hall,</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>Jane Wadſworth</hi>
(leaving four Witneſſes more in the ſame Caſe untouch'd); and <hi>Edith Sawbridge,</hi>
againſt the Teſtimony of Mrs. <hi>Judith Stourton,</hi> which Depoſitions the Reader will
find to be of little or no moment, as to the matter in hand. This puts it paſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute,
that they had nothing more to ſay againſt the Witneſſes for the Dutcheſs,
but ſtopt at theſe three for want of farther Pretence. The Reſult in ſhort is this,
that all the material Witneſſes to the Charge are Impeached, and the Evidence
on the other ſide ſtands untainted. To ſay nothing of the unanſwerable Reaſons
that prevailed with the Lords finally to reject the Bill, eſpecially conſidering the
Solemnity of the Proceedings: For the Cauſe was kept on from the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi>
to the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> following. All the Lords in and about the Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſummon'd, by an Order of the Houſe bearing Date <hi>Die Veneris Feb.</hi> 12. 1691.
to attend at Twelve of the Clock on the <hi>Tueſday</hi> following. And the Officers
that ſummoned them to give an Account of what Lords they ſummoned; purſuant
to which Order their Lordſhips met according to the Appointment: and after
ſome previous Debates, Adjourned till the next Day, when the Depoſitions on
both ſides were read at the Table by the Clerk, as will be ſeen more at large up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the following Journal. And after a long and ſolemn Debate, The Queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put, <hi>Whether the Bill entituled An Act to Diſſolve the Marriage of</hi> Henry
<hi>Duke of</hi> Norfolk, <hi>Earl Marſhal of</hi> England, <hi>with the Lady</hi> Mary Mordant,

of Adultery given againſt me, in the Honourable Houſe of Peers, was,
and is, general, inſufficient, and ſuch as, I humbly conceive, I am not bound
by Law to give anſwer unto. Yet knowing my own Innocency, and that I
am not guilty of the pretended Crime, this Proteſtation being Sacred to me,

anſwer, and ſay, hereby affirming, That having been marryed to his Grace
the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> for near 15 Years, he never did (till this pretended
Charge given againſt me) in the leaſt pretend, or intimate, unto me, that I
had ever injured his Bed; but did always treat me with great Kindneſs and
Reſpect. And about the Year 1685, at his requeſt, and deſire, I did go with
him from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> and there continued with him for ſome time;
where his Grace, being under an Indiſpoſition, and continuing ſo for ſome
time, He ſhewed ſuch Affection to me, and pu<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> ſo great Truſt and Confidence
in me, that all ſuch things that were adminiſtred to him, in order to his
Recovery, He did not, nor would receive any of them but what came from
my Hands; and I did with great care attend him: And being recovered, He
told me his Occaſions required him to go for <hi>England,</hi> but he would return
to me in <hi>France</hi> within ſome ſhort time, and bring Me home to <hi>England;</hi> and
at his parting with Me, he ſhewed great Affection to Me, and in great Paſſion
of Love, with Tears in his Eyes, ſaid, He had Ten Thouſand Pardons to ask
Me, deſiring my Patience, and that I ſhould return into <hi>England</hi> to him in ſome
ſhort time. And after his Grace's return into <hi>England,</hi> he having notice from
me, that my Lodgings was inconvenient, and deſiring his leave to change
the ſame, He wrote me word very affectionately, that God forbid he ſhould
conſtrain me to any Inconveniency, and left me to my Liberty therein.
And before his parting with me, in <hi>France,</hi> as a Teſtimony of his Love and
Affection to me, He ordered 400 <hi>l.</hi> yearly to be paid unto me, out of his own
Eſtate, by Quarterly Payments, over and above the ſeparate Maintenance ſettled
upon me, by my Father, upon my Marriage with him. And that after his
Arrival in <hi>England,</hi> he made ſeveral Viſits to my Mother, the Counteſs of
<hi>Peterborow;</hi> and with great Obſervance, and Reſpect, ask'd her Bleſſing, and
told her, he had left me well, and ſafe, in <hi>France;</hi> and ſaid, that his own
Debts were preſſing upon him; but if her Daughter (meaning my Self)
would conſent that the Mannor of <hi>Drayton,</hi> and other places, ſhould be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
upon him, and his Heirs, he ſhould thereby be made a Happy Man. And
I coming into <hi>England,</hi> his Grace having put off Houſe-keeping, and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in the Counteſs of <hi>Peterborow</hi>'s Lodgings, in St. <hi>James</hi>'s, for about two
Years; and I ſuing him for Alimony (the ſaid 400 <hi>l.</hi> a Year not being paid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me) He did not, during that Suit, object any Crime againſt me, which
had been proper for him to have done, to avoid Alimony, if I had been guilty.
And I, the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> being at <hi>Drayton</hi> in <hi>Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
his Grace did write very affectionately to me. And that Diſturbances
happening in thoſe parts, in <hi>November</hi> 1688, I left <hi>Drayton;</hi> and, with the
conſent of the Duke, went beyond Seas, and there continued till ſent for by
my Father and Mother, and then returned; which was in or about <hi>October</hi>
1691, with the Duke's conſent. And then Applications being made to me
by the Duke my Husband, to join with him in the Sale of <hi>Caſtle-Riſing,</hi> and
other Eſtates: But I being adviſed this muſt be injurious to me, could not joyn
therein, which I humbly apprehend to be the true Cauſe and Occaſion of
this proceeding againſt my Honour, on the Duke my Husband's part.</p>
                           <p>And I the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> adhering to my Proteſtation of
my Innocency, and denying that I am guilty of the pretended Crime charged
againſt me, and being unwilling to Impeach my Husband of any Crime what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever;
yet being adviſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That, by the Laws of the Land, a Husband ſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Divorce for the Adultery of his Wife, he ought not to obtain any Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Divorce, if he be proved Guilty of the ſame.</p>

Wherefore this Reſpondent doth aver, and is ready to prove, that the

the Charge for High-Treaſon, the manner of Tryals, and the ways of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,

                                 <p>Your Lordſhips are now creating new ways of Proceeding againſt me,

                                 <p>I find my Proſecution now to be very violent, and my Proceeding to be
very ſwift upon me, having had but one Night to prepare my Anſwer to this
General Charge. I do in this Place publickly declare, I am Innocent of what
is objected to me, and am not guilty of defiling my Husband's Bed: I am
not guilty of the Crime charg'd againſt me. I hope (being thus accuſed) I
may, without Vanity and Vain-Glory, ſay, what is well known, That I
am not only the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>'s Wife, but alſo Born and Deſcended from
Parents and Anceſtors of the Ancient Nobility; That your Lordſhips Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,

it is with regret that I bring this Anſwer for my Self, and againſt my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,

               <p>WE are in the firſt place to conſider, and compare the Evidence on
both ſides. Secondly, To examine the Credit of the Witneſſes.
Thirldly, The reaſonable Probability of the Matters Sworn, according to the
common Courſe and Practice of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Owen</hi> Swears, That being ſent by <hi>Henry Reyner,</hi> the Duke's Butler, to carry
the things out, and the Lodgings being open, he ſaw Mr. <hi>Germaine</hi> and the
Dutcheſs in Bed; and to countenance the Story, he ſays that two of the Doors
are ſtreight forward, giving to underſtand that the Doors being open, and
one againſt another, a body may ſee the Bed out of the firſt Room into the
third; that <hi>Reyner</hi> gave him the Key of the outward Door, and upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locking
of it he made this Diſcovery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frances Knight</hi> encounters this Evidence with a Depoſition, that ſhe kept
the Key of the outward Door her ſelf, and delivered it to no body, but now
and then to my Lady <hi>Peterborow</hi>'s Houſe-keeper; That <hi>Owen</hi> never went into
any of the Inner Rooms, and that the Doors are ſideways.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry Reyner</hi> ſaith alſo, that he himſelf could not get into the Lodgings, but
by <hi>Frances Knight,</hi> that he never gave <hi>Owen</hi> the Key, nor ever had it in his
Poſſeſſion; that he never ſaw <hi>Owen</hi> beyond the Paſſage-Room, nay that
<hi>Frances Knight</hi> never gave him the Key, but that he ſtill went to her to open
the Door, and that he never had any Key to the Lodgings; that whenever
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150331:11"/>
he ſent <hi>Owen</hi> with Plates, Spoons, and the like, from the Duke's Houſe to
the Lodgings in <hi>Whitehall;</hi> he was either there himſelf to receive them, or
directed <hi>Owen</hi> to deliver them to <hi>Frances Knight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if theſe two Witneſſes ſpeak Truth, <hi>Owen</hi> was never in the inner
Rooms at all; he never had the Key of the outward Door, and the Doors are
not ſtreight forward as <hi>Owen</hi> Swears they are, which is a Matter of Fact
eaſily cleared.</p>
               <p>As to the Credit of <hi>Rowland Owen: Edward Silveſter, John Jones,</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Cook</hi> are produced in his Favour. The firſt ſwears he never knew him
ſteal or cozen, as if the caſe were Pilfery. The ſecond that <hi>Owen</hi> might have
done him wrong, and did not, and thence infers that he would not take a
Falſe Oath. The third, that he knows nothing to the contrary of his being
an honeſt Man. So that here are three Surmiſes for the Reputation of <hi>Owen,</hi>
which are juſt nothing to the purpoſe, on the one hand: and two point blank
Proofs, upon Oath, againſt him on the other; and not one Sillable all this
while to diſparage the Teſtimony of either <hi>Knight</hi> or <hi>Keymer;</hi> though
there are ſeveral pinching Paſſages in the Evidence, that, if they were falſe,
might be detected by Hundreds of Witneſſes. And for an Inſtance of <hi>Keymer</hi>'s
Tenderneſs of an Oath, he has own'd ſome things, upon the cloſe of his
Examination, to the ſeeming Prejudice of the Dutcheſs her ſelf. This is
meant of their going by borrowed Names; but as things ſtood at that time
with many Perſons of Honour, under her Grace's Circumſtances, it was no
Scandal to conceal either their Names or their Abodes. But as to the true
Reaſon of the Dutcheſs's Retirement and living in a manner ſo <hi>Incognito.</hi> The
Earl of <hi>Peterborow</hi> falling deſperately ſick in the <hi>Tower,</hi> her Grace came over
upon it, from beyond the Seas, to be within diſtance in caſe the Sickneſs
ſhould have proved Mortal. The Dutcheſs had at that time nothing to live
upon but an Exhibition from her Father, and one half of that was made over
too for the Payment of her Debts; ſo that not being in condition to appear
anſwerable to her Quality, ſhe thought her ſelf bound in Honour, Prudence
and Juſtice to retrench her Expences, which ſhe could not better do than by
ſuch a Retreat.</p>
               <p>It is in the next place to be obſerved, how <hi>Owen</hi> interferes with himſelf;
the Lodgings, he ſays, being open, he ſaw Mr. <hi>Germaine</hi> in Bed with the
Dutcheſs of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the Dutcheſs leap'd out of the Bed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This muſt
naturally be underſtood to have been upon the opening of the firſt Door;
and to the end it ſhould be taken ſo, he ſays that the two firſt Doors were
ſtreight forward, and that the third turns a little. Now if ſo, how could he
ſee the Bed out of the firſt Room into the third? And then he forgets himſelf
again, in ſaying that the ſecond Door was not cloſe ſhut, and the third open;
ſo that he has now doubled the Difficulty: there was no ſeeing into the Bed-Chamber,
both becauſe the ſecond Door was almoſt cloſe, and becauſe the
third was ſideways. It is to be noted alſo, that the Bed ſtands quite out of
ſight of the Bed-Chamber Door, which is ſufficient of it ſelf alone to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<hi>Owen</hi>'s Teſtimony. But upon ſecond Thoughts, he takes himſelf trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
and inſtead of mending the Matter makes it worſe; it comes into his
Head by this time, that there was no ſeeing them in Bed out of the firſt
Room, and ſo thinks to help it out with a Flam at the wrong end of his Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
that indeed he was in at the third Door when the Dutcheſs leap'd
out of her Bed. Now to take the Tale his own way, can any body imagine
that <hi>Owen</hi> ſhould unlock the outward Door, lay down his Lumber, paſs theſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150331:12"/>
two Rooms into the third, the Dutcheſs and Mr. <hi>Germaine</hi> both awake too,
and all this Noiſe not give them the Allarm.</p>
               <p>To come now to the Probability of the thing. <hi>Keymer</hi> gave him the Key,
he ſays, only for once it ſeems, for he never had it either before or ſince.
Has not this the Face now of a Contrivance calculated for a particular turn?
Is it not highly improbable again, that a pittyful drudging Fellow that earn'd
his Bread, by doing Porters work for the Family, ſhould have the Dutcheſs's
Bed-Chamber laid open to him? And ſo for the Morning-Gown, and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi>'s
hiding himſelf in the Bed, had they no other Cloaths or Garments ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by them? that <hi>Owen</hi> ſhould have the luck to ſee juſt this and nothing elſe.
But his Leſſon was to ſwear <hi>Nudus cum Nudâ,</hi> and <hi>Solus cum Solâ,</hi> to bring
the Proof up to the ſtraitneſs of the Law, and that was the part he had to play.
Or, to take the Caſe yet another way. If <hi>Owen</hi> had ſeen them out of the firſt
Room, can any Body think he would have ventur'd after that into the Bed-Chamber?
or, if he did not ſee them in the firſt Room, what had he to do
in the other Room at all? But over and above all the reſt, for an Amour of this
Quality, to be carryed on thus in the Face of the Sun, the Doors and the
Curtains open; let any Man ask his own Conſcience if he does not look upon it
as an Impoſture, without a Preſident from the Creation to this Day.</p>

John Faucet,</hi> and <hi>Lawrence Parnell,</hi> are produced to ſpeak to her perſonal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.
The firſt ſays, ſhe behaved her ſelf well and prudently in the Duke's
Houſe; the ſecond and third, that they knew no Ill by her.</p>
               <p>There were produced on the behalf of the Dutcheſs, and to invalidate the
Teſtimony of <hi>Margaret Ellwood,</hi> theſe ſix Witneſſes, <hi>Michael Haddon, Joyce
Heath, Mary Trevis, Mary Jones, Ann Roſs</hi> and <hi>Mary Roſs. Mary Trevis,
Mary Jones,</hi> and <hi>Ann Roſs,</hi> do all depoſe, that about <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt, ſpeaking of
the Dutcheſs, and Mr. <hi>Germaine; Margaret Ellwood</hi> told each of theſe Witneſſes
reſpectively, that ſhe never ſaw or knew any thing of Ill by the ſaid Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs;
and yet <hi>Ellwood</hi>'s Accuſation bears date in the firſt Year of King <hi>James.
Mary Trevis</hi> ſwears farther, that upon the next <hi>Sunday</hi> after <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt,
<hi>Ellwood</hi> told her, upon borrowing a Scarf of her, that it might be 5 <hi>l.</hi> in her
way, for the Duke was to be Divorced from the Dutcheſs, and he had ſent his
Chariot for her, and ſhe was to be a Witneſs. <hi>Ann Roſs</hi> ſpeaks alſo to the ſame
effect, how <hi>Ellwood</hi> told her there would be a Divorce, and the Duke had ſent
for her to be a Witneſs; and likewiſe ſaith, that <hi>Ellwood</hi>'s Husband told her,
that his Wife was to have 30 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> ſetled upon her, and live at <hi>Windſor,</hi>
and have the ſhewing of the Caſtle. <hi>Mary Roſs</hi> ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe
alſo, with the Witneſs above, as to what <hi>Ellwood</hi>'s Husband ſaid of <hi>Windſor,</hi> the
Settlement, and the Divorce; adding alſo, that the Duke was to have a great
Fortune (according to the common rumour then about the Town); <hi>Mary
Roſs</hi>'s Father was by, and heard all this: It was about a Week before the date
Information that Diſcourſe had paſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:150331:13"/>
Nay, the Dutcheſs was ſo clear in the matter, that ſhe ſent for <hi>Ellwood</hi>
a little before <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt, and bid her ſpeak the Truth; as <hi>Ellwood</hi> her
ſelf own'd to <hi>Mary Jones</hi> and <hi>Ann Roſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To come now to the Quality and Credit of <hi>Margaret Ellwood. Haddon</hi>
ſays ſhe was his Tenant to an Ale-houſe in <hi>Windſor</hi> in 1689, carry'd off her
Goods by Night, and went away in his Debt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heath</hi> ſaith ſhe liv'd in a Cellar, led an ill courſe of Life; her Husband
was a Cobler in a Stall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ann Roſs</hi> ſays that ſhe had five Children, and that ſhe had but Six Pence a
Day Maintenance for her ſelf and them.</p>
               <p>This was her Condition till near <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt, when all on a ſudden, as
<hi>Ann Roſs</hi> depoſes, ſhe was taken into the Duke's Houſe, the Children new
Cloath'd, and trickt up with good Frocks and Top-Knots (which were till
then all in Rags) Lodgings provided for them at Four Shillings a Week, and
a Maid to look to them, and no viſible means of doing all this. But, in fine,
the Change was not wrought by Miracle, and leans much toward the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
before mention'd, that <hi>Ann</hi> and <hi>Mary Roſs</hi> had with <hi>Ellwood</hi>'s Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion, at laſt, is briefly this; Whether is to be believ'd, a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
under ſo many ſcandalous Circumſtances, and one that Swears for her
ſelf too; or Six Witneſſes againſt her of ſo unqueſtionable Probity, that
not ſo much as one of them could be impeach'd by the other Party?</p>
               <p>To paſs now to the palpable unlikely hood of the Story barely in it ſelf;
<hi>Ellwood</hi> was carrying Company, ſhe ſays, to ſee the Lodgings at <hi>Windſor,</hi> and
opening the Door, ſhe ſaw and heard, as in her Depoſition. How came it
now, that none of this Company ſhould be produc'd, or ſo much as nam'd
to ſecond <hi>Ellwood,</hi> for 'tis to be preſum'd, they muſt needs hear and ſee what
paſs'd upon this Adventure, as much as ſhe her ſelf did; or if ſhe had but
nam'd the Woman, who, ſhe ſays, told her my Lady was not there, it
might have ſerv'd as a Collateral Inducement, for the giving of ſome ſort of
Credit to it. But in a Matter of this Importance, to have ſo many Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
within reach of being found out, and none to appear, looks very ill on
their part, that were ſo much concern'd to produce them: And ſo for <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi>'s
threatning her, and the Dutcheſſes bidding him kick her down; no
People in their right Wits, but would have try'd to ſtop her Mouth, with
fair Words and a good Bribe in ſuch a Caſe as this, rather than provoke her
by Menaces and ill Language, to run open Mouth to the Duke with the
Story, in Revenge, when ſhe had the Dutcheſſes Honour and Eſtate ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
at her Mercy.</p>
               <p>As to the buſineſs of Mr. <hi>Germaine</hi>'s Handkerchief and Ruffles, and his being
let out of the Cloſet, the Contrivance is all of the ſame piece with the reſt; for
why were not the perſons nam'd in her Depoſition, produc'd to prove the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
therein mention'd, as well as <hi>Ellwood</hi>'s? It is moſt certain, that the
Proſecutors could eaſily have done it, and that it was properly their Buſineſs
and Intereſt ſo to do; for what ſignifies <hi>Ellwood</hi>'s ſingle Teſtimony, under
her Circumſtances, without Coroborating Proofs? She tells us a tale of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
to ſee the Lodgings, a Woman that told her ſo and ſo, and another
Woman and a Gentleman that ſaid, and did this and that, and yet not one
Creature at laſt to ſecond her Depoſition, nor any pretence of an Exception
to the Evidence on the other ſide.</p>

he was Butler at <hi>Windſor,</hi> when <hi>Germaine,</hi> and the Dutcheſs, and
<hi>Cornwall</hi> went to play; <hi>Germaine</hi> ſent his Footman for clean Linen, which
he brought the next Morning; Mrs. <hi>Gwin</hi> ſaid to the Dutcheſs, The Dog
would have lain with me, but ſhe would not lay the Dog where the Deer
laid, for ſhe knew my Lady Dutcheſs would accept of him; after that he ſaw a
Shirt and a Waſcoat in the Cloſet, which my Ladies Woman and <hi>Ann Burton</hi>
took away. My Lord being abſent, we murmured amongſt our ſelves, that
my Lord was wrong'd; I told my Lord, whereupon my Maſter <hi>Cragg</hi> had
me to my Lord <hi>Peterborough</hi>'s Lodging, and threaten'd me, that he would
prefer me to his Brother <hi>Richards,</hi> who turn'd me off in <hi>Germany.</hi> This was,
he thinks, in <hi>December</hi> or <hi>September</hi> 1685: Mrs. <hi>Gwin</hi> ſpoke this in the <hi>Green

               <p>
                  <hi>WIlliam Purchaſe</hi> ſaith, That he knows <hi>Thomas Hudſon,</hi> who, he ſays,
was never Butler to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> either at <hi>Windſor,</hi> or any
other place; He, the Witneſs, was Under-Butler himſelf, <hi>Keymer</hi> was Butler
in 1685, and the Witneſs was Under-Butler. He ſaith, <hi>Hudſon</hi> waited on the
Gentleman of the Horſe, and the Steward; he was not the Duke's Servant,
nor waited at the Table that he knows of; he was never ſuffer'd to come
into the Room when the Duke or Dutcheſs was at Play. He ſaith, he, the
Witneſs, was not at <hi>Windſor</hi> at the time when the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> was at
<hi>Portſmouth,</hi> but he was ſent to <hi>Drayton</hi> in <hi>Northampton ſhire,</hi> and was then

he is now Servant to the Lord <hi>Peter borough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Col. <hi>Jacob Richards</hi> ſaith, That he knows <hi>Tho. Hudſon,</hi> he was his Servant,
he was recommended to him by Mr. <hi>Cragg,</hi> he was his Footman; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
he was in his Service four Months, he parted with him becauſe he
found him a tricking Fellow; he told him his Brother <hi>Cragg</hi> was to be kill'd
by one <hi>Curry</hi> and another Iriſhman: He, the Witneſs writ to his Brother
<hi>Cragg,</hi> and he advis'd the Witneſs to part with him, for he did not think him
fit to be truſted in his Travels; whereupon he paid him his Wages, and gave
him Money to bear his Charges to <hi>England,</hi> and ſent a Trunk by him. One
Mr. <hi>Negus</hi> travell'd with the Witneſs and his Father, who then and now lives
with the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> writ to us, that he did not think it fit for us to
keep ſuch a Servant, for he was a dangerous Fellow, or to that effect. <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
never own'd any thing of the Adultery to the Witneſs, but poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
to him he knew nothing of it: This was in <hi>January</hi> 1685. He ſaith,
that <hi>Cragg</hi> writ him word, that <hi>Hudſon</hi> muſt needs be a Tricking Knave.
He negligently told the Witneſs this of the Adultery; Curioſity made him
ask it of him, for he had liv'd with the Duke and Dutcheſs, and it was natural
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:150331:14"/>
for him, the Witneſs, to ask ſuch a Queſtion. He ſaith, he believes <hi>Hudſon</hi>

he ſent, but nothing of any conſiderable value. He ſaith, <hi>Hudſon</hi> never
cheated him of any thing that he knows of; he hath truſted him with a 100 <hi>l.</hi>
at a time: The Trunk was deliver'd in <hi>England,</hi> and he believes, he knew
what was in it: He ſaith, that asking <hi>Hudſon</hi> whether he knew any thing of
the Adultery charg'd on the Dutcheſs of <hi>Norfolk? Hudſon</hi> ſaid, he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it: He, the Witneſs, told him, that it was ſaid, that it was he that

                  <hi>Hudſon</hi> ſays, that they went to Play, and that he overheard Mrs. <hi>Gwin</hi> out

<hi>Hudſon</hi> but a Cloſet Witneſs, which is little better; now <hi>Purchaſe</hi> ſays again,

               <p>
                  <hi>Hudſon</hi> ſays likewiſe, that the Servants murmur'd amongſt themſelves, that

Depoſes that he himſelf telling <hi>Hudſon</hi> of a Talk, that he had betray'd

that it was a falſe Accuſation, and he knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Now as to <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s Credit, he was Colonel <hi>Richards</hi>'s Footman, who
turn'd him off as a Tricking Fellow, and not fit to be truſted. Mr. <hi>Negus</hi>
the Duke's Servant, both then and now, was of the ſame Opinion
too, and adviſed by Letter the putting of him away, as a dangerous Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>This Story of Mr. <hi>Germain's</hi> ſending his man for clean Linnen over Night,
and the bringing it next Morning, has little in it, even ſuppoſing the Fact to be
true; Firſt the Order was given bare fac'd, and Conſequently no Myſtery in it.
Secondly, there was a Set Company at Play, and that was not an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for a Love-Intreague. Thirdly, it is no new thing for People to Sit up all
Night at Play, and change their Linnen next Morning, without any offence to
Honeſty, or good Manners, where they may have a Privacy ſo to do it.
And if my Lady's Woman and <hi>Ann Burton</hi> took away the Shirt and Waſtcoat,
as he ſays they did, there's no great hurt in that neither; tho' it's much to
have three ſuch Confidents to ſuch a Secret, an under Foot-man Privy to

<hi>Germain</hi> was ſtill in the Houſe, whereupon we laid Chairs on the back Stairs,
that we might hear him if he came down, the Chairs were not removed the

ſhe was come, Mrs. <hi>Nelly Gwyn</hi> came in and asked her how ſhe liked her Nights.

the higheſt degree; then he ſhewed me a Letter of the Dutcheſs to me, and
read it to me, before that he told me there was a Shirt and Waſtcoat, and
they are known to be his; he ſaid, I deſire you to ſave the Dutcheſs's Honour,
I deſire that you will be ſo much a Gentleman as to own them to be yours,
and that you left them there; I anſwered, I was much concern'd there ſhould
be ſuch a Trouble, but I deſired to be excuſed, I could not do it without Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice:
He told me the Lord and Lady <hi>Peterborow</hi> had diſcourſed the Duke
of <hi>Norfolk</hi> upon it, and if it were but my Linnen, their Diſcourſe had wrought
ſo much upon him, that if there came any Evidence to aſſiſt him, he would
leave of the Purſuit; I refuſed ſtill, he offered me a Purſe of Gold, and told
me I ſhould make my Fortune by it; but I ſtill refuſing, Mr. <hi>Germaine</hi> went
away very much diſcontented; my Wife being in the next Room, overheard
the Diſcourſe between <hi>Germaine</hi> and me, and told it, and ſpoke of it, or elſe
I had not been here now.</p>

Marry'd his half Siſter; he ſaith, that about a quarter of a Year after the
buſineſs of the Dutcheſs happen'd at <hi>Windſor,</hi> he was at <hi>Varelſt</hi>'s Houſe about
Eleven of the Clock in the Night, and <hi>Varelſt</hi> lock'd the Door, and told him,
he had diſparag'd him by Marrying his Siſter, and ſaid, he would be his
Death, and drew his Sword, and Commanded him to ſtrip, that he might
ſlaſh him at his pleaſure; and the ſaid Witneſs did ſtrip for fear of his Life,
knowing his Frenzy; and he ſtruck the Witneſs above a dozen times with
his Sword, and threatned ſtill to have his Life, if he, the Witneſs did not
fetch his Wife down that Night, which was about Twelve a Clock, and
which was about Six Weeks after ſhe lay in; and he was to bring her to be
Whipt, and to bring Six Rods with him; upon his, the Witneſſes Promiſe
to do this, he let him go, and he hath not ſeen him ſince, but in the Street.
He had half a Year before that been Diſtracted for Six Weeks, and he, the
Witneſs, fetch'd Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> to him once, and the Doctor came ſeveral times
afterwards to him. One Night in that Sickneſs, he got from the Woman
that watch'd him, and run about two hours in his Shirt and Waſcoat, in a
Froſty Night, and cut his Feet, and was brought home by the Watch; he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:150331:16"/>
ſaith, his, the Witneſs's Wife, was to have been here this day, as a Witneſs,
and was here, but having not an hour to reckon, and being ill, is gone home
with her Midwiſe: He ſaith, he never durſt go near <hi>Varelſt</hi> ſince he abus'd
him. He ſaith, that Mrs. <hi>Varelſt,</hi> after ſhe came from <hi>Windſor,</hi> ſaid, that
the Dutcheſs had ill People about her, and that ſhe believ'd her to be much
wrong'd, and ſaid, ſhe could clear her about the Scandal of the Linnen that
was found; for whether it was or was not Mr. <hi>Varelſt</hi>'s Linnen, ſhe could do
it; and ſaid, ſuppoſing I had brought my Husband's Linnen down to be

               <p>THere needs no more to the overthrowing of <hi>Varelſt</hi>'s Evidence, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is, than the Teſtimony of <hi>John Rothmell,</hi> to prove him <hi>Non

at Midnight for ſix Rods to whip his Siſter-in-law; and another fit, for a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of ſix Weeks, when Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> made him ſeveral Viſits to compoſe him,
his Frenzy being ſo violent upon him, that he broke looſe from his Keepers
in a Froſty Night, and ran up and down the Streets in his Shirt, till he was
taken up by the Watch. This is the ſum of <hi>Rothmell</hi>'s Teſtimony, and not
one word oppos'd either to the Credit of the Witneſs, or the truth of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.
But it may not be amiſs, after all this, yet to ſpeak a few words
to the likelyhood of what <hi>Varelſt</hi> has here depos'd.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Germaine</hi> came to him, he ſays, with a Letter from the Dutcheſs, which
he read to him, and in the name of the Lord and Lady <hi>Peterborow,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
him to ſay, the Shirt and Waſcoat were his; but not one word all this

Shirt and Waſcoat were known to be his; now if they were known to be
Mr. <hi>Germaine</hi>'s, what good could <hi>Varelſt</hi> do by taking the matter upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
when he ſaw fair words would not do, there was a Purſe of Gold of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
him, and that would not work neither. The Dutcheſs and Mr. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi>
were wonderfully alter'd, ſure, in this Caſe, from what they were in
the buſineſs of <hi>Owen</hi> and <hi>Ellwood;</hi> there was no Purſe of Gold or Dutcheſſes
Letter to ſmother the matter, but on the contrary, <hi>Ellwood</hi> was threaten'd,
provok'd, and defy'd, inſtead of cajoling her. And what was all this for at

to condemn themſelves by a Confeſſion out of their own Mouths, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the Suſpicion into a Certainty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Can any Body imagine that they

But <hi>Rothmell</hi> ſwears, that Mrs. <hi>Varelſt</hi> ſaid, the Dutcheſs had ill People about
her, and was much wrong'd, and that ſhe her ſelf could clear her about the

ſaw a <hi>Dutch</hi> Woman, who bid her go up Stairs for it; and going up for it, ſhe
met the Dutcheſs of <hi>Norfolk</hi> in a Night-Gown, one ſide lapt over the other
ſide, with <hi>Flanders</hi>-lac'd Night-Cloaths on her Head, without a Hood on:
About two Hours after, <hi>Herman,</hi> Footman to <hi>Germaine,</hi> came into her Houſe,
and ſhe ſaying to him, you have got the Dutcheſs of <hi>Norfolk</hi> at your Houſe,
he ſaid no Dutcheſs of <hi>Norfolk:</hi> I ſaid it was ſhe, for I had ſeen her ſome Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds

having liv'd there ſo long. <hi>Herman</hi> enquiring where I ſaw her, I
ſaid, upon the Stairs; he told me, I ſhould not have gone up the Stairs; I
told him, the <hi>Dutch</hi>-Woman bid me go up: It was about Eleven a Clock in
the Day time that ſhe ſaw her: He bid me ſay no more of it, for if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
knew it, he would kill the <hi>Dutch</hi>-Woman. She ſaw Welſh <hi>Frank,</hi> about
two Months ſince, deliver a Letter to Mr. <hi>Germaine,</hi> and ſhe hath ſeen her
go to the Houſe often; ſhe hath known the Dutcheſs ever ſince, and before
ſhe was married.</p>

Lodge together that ſhe knows; my Lord, told her at parting at the

not attend on ſuch Matters, and therefore he ſent for him, knowing him to
be willing, to do any Services between them. The firſt thing his Grace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
was to acquaint his Wife, and the Lady <hi>Peterborow,</hi> and he thinks he
Named the Lord <hi>Peterborow,</hi> that he expected to be Indemnified from the

and I deſire to be free from being obliged to pay for any of that; he
told his Grace, that he thought he was miſinform'd, for all the Equipage he
ſaw, was a Coach, Coach-man, two Foot-men, a pair of Horſes, and two or three
more Servants; but, ſays his Grace, I formerly paid Money for her, to one

of any ſuch Incumbrance. Therefore, I would have you tell my Wife, that
if ſhe will conſent to the Sale of thoſe Eſtates and make me eaſy in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;
let her conſider, wherein I may make her eaſy, and I ſhall do it: I
know ſhe was a great Lover of <hi>Drayton,</hi> and I ſuppoſe is ſo ſtill; and ſhe did once
offer me a conſiderable Sum of Money for my Life in it; therefore let her
conſider of this Matter, and if ſhe can propoſe any thing for her eaſe and
quiet, on theſe Terms, I ſhall comply with her.</p>
               <p>I do not ſay it to threaten her: But I am told, that for the Reaſon of there
being either One and Twenty, or Two and Twenty <hi>Catholick</hi> Heirs of my
Family before One <hi>Proteſtant</hi> One; if I would bring in a Bill of Divorce, I
ſhould obtain it on that account; he told his Grace he ſhould be ſorry to hear
of any ſuch thing: But in Obedience to his Grace's Commands, he would
acquaint the Dutcheſs with it; accordingly he did, the ſame day, and Lady
<hi>Peterborow</hi> both; her Grace was very Grace was very angry at the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
eſpecially at that part that mentioned a Divorce; and he was ſent the
next Morning to Mr. <hi>Scott,</hi> to deſire him to acquaint the Duke, that as
he was my Lord <hi>Peterborow</hi>'s Servant, it was not fit for him to receive
nor bring ſuch Meſſages. But if his Grace had any thing to ſay, it was moſt
proper, by a Servant of his own, or to ſend for one of hers. I carried the
Meſſage the next Morning to Mr. <hi>Scott,</hi> and at my return Home, the
Dutcheſs ſhewed me a Letter ſhe had Writ to the Duke, to the ſame purpoſe,
and which was ſent to his Grace, but not by him; the Dutcheſs did declare,
when he propoſed the Sale of <hi>Caſtle-Riſing</hi> and <hi>Billing,</hi> as the Duke had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
that ſhe would never Conſent to it. By any of this Diſcourſe it did not
appear to him, that the Duke ſhowed any Inclinations to live with the
Dutches, nor did he underſtand it ſo,</p>

               <p>THE Reader, will find this Diſcourſe about Mr. <hi>Germaine</hi> and the Dutcheſs,
to be a Scandal of a matter of Six Years ſtanding; <hi>Hudſon,</hi> a Caſt Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
has ſworn to the Shirt and Waſtcoat, and that he immediately told my
Lord of it. <hi>Ann Burton</hi> ſwears likewiſe (with another falſe Oath between
her Teeth) that this Shirt and Waſtecoat were ſent by the Duke to the Lord
<hi>Peterborows.</hi> It follows now to be noted, what courſe has been taken from the
Firſt to the Laſt, for a thorough Diſcovering of the Truth of this Matter,
and now it comes to paſs that the Thunder-Bolt ſhould hang in the Air, ſo
many Years, after the Breaking of the Cloud.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mrs. Stourton</hi> is here upon her double Oath, firſt under the Shrift of the
Duke and my Lord <hi>Peterborow,</hi> who took her privately and Adjured her, as
ever ſhe hoped to ſee God in Heaven, to declare what ſhe knew as to the
Dutcheſs being an Adultreſs, ſhe purg'd her ſelf upon her hopes of Salvation,
that the Dutcheſs was as Vertuous as any Woman alive for ought ſhe knew;
ſhe ſwore the ſame thing over again at the Bar of the Houſe of Lords; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Internogate about the Shirt and Waſtcoat before ſpoken of, ſhe ſwore like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
that ſhe ſaw no Shirt or Waſtcoat at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:150331:22"/>
                  <hi>Edith Sawbridge</hi> was now produc'd againſt the Credit of Mrs. <hi>Judith Stour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
and lays the ſtreſs of her Evidence upon what <hi>Mrs. Kniffton</hi> ſaid, which
has been the very Pinch of the Queſtion throughout the whole Cauſe, and
the Proſecution has ſtill been at a Fault when it came to any material Point;
that is to ſay, only the Hear-ſay Witneſſes are produced, and thoſe that can
ſpeak upon Knowledge, and poſitively to the Fact, are withdrawn, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd,
contrary to the Practice and Reaſon of all Judicial Proceedings.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Stourton</hi> is called in again to confront <hi>Edith Sawbridge,</hi> and denies
every Article in her Depoſition, one by one, that is of any moment; but at
the ſame time there appears no Exception, on the other hand, to the Credit
of Mrs. <hi>Stourton:</hi> Neither is it to be imagin'd, that any Woman ſhould dare
to ſwear falſe, in a Caſe where two ſuch Witneſſes ſhould be privy to the
Perjury.</p>
               <p>It follows now to be noted, what Courſe has been taken for a thorough
Diſcovery of this Intrigue, according to the uſual Methods of Honour and
Juſtice. The Examination of Mrs. <hi>Stourton</hi> by the Duke and my Lord <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terborow,</hi>
was as ſolemn, ſtrict and private as the Caſe required; and it was
while the Clamour was freſh too: So that there was no Time loſt when they
enter'd upon the Scrutiny. It will be ſeen in that which follows, by what
degrees the Heat of this Calumny cool'd, and what brought it on again.</p>
               <p>The Duke and Dutcheſs went for <hi>France</hi> together, about a Week after the
Breaking out of this Clamour, and <hi>Elizabeth Camel</hi> waited upon the Dutcheſs;
who ſwears, that they went lovingly together, and parted with Tears on
both ſides; my Lord telling her Grace at Parting, that he would fetch her
away ſuddenly. They eat and drunk together every Day, and were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
together in private; but ſhe cannot ſay they lodg'd together. So
that thus far, in all outward Appearance, the Miſ-underſtanding ſeem'd in
ſome meaſure to be compoſed.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Scot</hi> ſpeaks only to the matter of Monies, and Accounts, which is little
or nothing to the purpoſe in this place, except only as to the One Hundred
Twenty and Five Pounds, mentioned to be pay'd by him, for the Dutcheſs's
uſe; which was a Quarterly Payment out of Five Hundred Pounds <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
adjudged and ordered by the High-Commiſſion Court to be pay'd to
her, in lieu of Alimony.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Robert Wellborne</hi> comes to the very Merits of the Cauſe, and the
preſent State of the Queſtion. He depoſes, that in <hi>November</hi> laſt the Duke
ſent for him, and told him (among other things by the by) that the Dutcheſs
had ſome Pretentions upon <hi>Caſtle-Riſing,</hi> and alſo upon <hi>Billing;</hi> and thereupon
order'd the Witneſs to give her Grace to underſtand, that if ſhe would conſent
to the Sale of thoſe Eſtates, and make the Duke eaſie in that particular, let her
but conſider wherein he himſelf might make the Dutcheſs eaſie too, and upon
thoſe Terms he would do it.</p>
               <p>His Grace told the Witneſs farther, that there being One or Two and
Twenty Catholick Heirs to the Family, before one Proteſtant Heir, if (ſays
his Grace) I would bring a Bill of Divorce, (I do not ſay it to threaten her)
I could obtain it on that Account. The Witneſs acquainted both the Dutcheſs
and the Lady <hi>Peterborow,</hi> the very ſame Day, with the ſubſtance of this
Meſſage, her Grace taking it very heinouſly to be told of a Divorce; and the
next Day the Dutcheſs ſhewed the Witneſs a Letter ſhe wrote to the Duke
upon this Occaſion; declaring, that for <hi>Caſtle-Riſing</hi> and <hi>Billing,</hi> ſhe would
never part with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:150331:22"/>
It appears from hence, that upon the Examination of Mrs. <hi>Stourton,</hi> and
other neceſſary Enquiries into the grounds of this Scandal, the violence of
the firſt Impreſſion was ſo far taken off, that according to the Evidence of
<hi>Elizabeth Camel,</hi> my Lord was pleaſed to treat the Dutcheſs with all Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Tenderneſs and Reſpect, both upon their Paſſage into <hi>France,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Places there, thoſe of the Bed only excepted. In this ſtate Matters
have continued ſome five or ſix Years now, without any Speech or Thought
of a Divorce, that ever the Dutcheſs heard of till Mid-<hi>November</hi> laſt, in a
Meſſage by Mr. <hi>Welborne</hi> from the Duke, and that was but upon a certain
Condition neither, however it was improved afterwards into a Bill, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſeventh of <hi>January</hi> following was formally brought into the Lords
Houſe.</p>
               <p>The Reader will need no other Light to a true underſtanding of the Strait
her Grace was in, upon this Surprize, and the Diſadvantages ſhe was expoſed
to, than what he has here before him, in the Order of the Journal it ſelf:
Where he will find the Dutcheſs ſo ſcanted for time to produce Witneſſes, and
prepare her Defence, that it was a wonderful Providence ſhe ſhould do ſo
much as ſhe did. Though in the mean while, her Grace has loſt the benefit of
ſeveral conſiderable Witneſſes, for want of time to find them out, and bring them
together. Now as for Mr. <hi>Welborne</hi>'s Depoſition, it carries the Countenance
rather of a Treaty than an Accuſation; the Duke's part is only a calm delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Diſcourſe, conſulting the Reciprocal Eaſe both of himſelf and of the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs.
Terms are propoſed and promiſed, and not one Word or Glance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
from one end to the other of it. Mr. <hi>Welborne</hi> (upon the Duke's
asking him, at the Lord's Bar, if by his Diſcourſe he underſtood an Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to live with the Dutcheſs) 'tis true, did not gather from his Words, as
if he had any thought of living with her; the only hard thing ſaid, was that
about his Catholick Heirs, which ſeem'd to turn the Caſe of Adultery into a
Caſe of Religion. Let any Creature judge now, whether the Dutcheſs durſt
to have ſtood it out thus, if ſhe had been guilty of ſo foul a Crime, when
ſhe might have been ſafe and free, as appears by the Propoſal, upon Terms
ſo much more eaſy.</p>
               <p>To make a ſhort Summary now of the Whole, a Word firſt to the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
and Quality of the Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>There is <hi>Owen,</hi> a Street-Porter, brought in as a Witneſs to the Privacies of
the Dutcheſs's Bed-Chamber, beſides ſeveral unanſwerable Exceptions to the
Particulars of his Evidence. There is <hi>Ellwood,</hi> a Coblers Wife, and a Gilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
little Slut, that's as palpably detected of Falſity, as the other. <hi>Hudſon,</hi>
a poor Roguy, Tricking Footman, that was turn'd off for his ill Behaviour.
<hi>Burton,</hi> a beggerly Wench, that cheated her Landlady, and forſwore her ſelf
in this Cauſe at the Lords Bar: <hi>Varelſt,</hi> a Painter, and by Intervals, a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
<hi>Foſter,</hi> a Coachman that was turn'd off by his Maſter, and ſwore to
be reveng'd of him. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> under ſeveral manifeſt miſtakes, but nothing to
the main Cauſe. <hi>Scriber, Anderſon, Hemming, Reynolds,</hi> and <hi>Margaret Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
ſay not one word to the purpoſe: <hi>Wadſworth,</hi> a pilfering Servant, that
robb'd her Miſtreſs, and her Evidence moſt notoriouſly expos'd.</p>
               <p>Now, as theſe Witneſſes are of very little value upon the Stock of their
own Credit, ſo the Witneſſes againſt them cannot be deny'd to have a fair
Reputation, on the other hand. And it is very extraordinary, that after the
naming of ſo many Perſons in their Depoſitions, that ſaid, or did, or heard
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:150331:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or ſaw this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or that; the Proſecutors have not brought in ſo much as one
Creature to ſecond the Swearing Evidence: Tho' it is ſufficiently known, they
could have found them if they would have ventur'd the Cauſe upon that ſtreſs.
It is to be conſider'd once more, what a difference there has been, betwixt
the Demeanour of the one ſide and the other, towards the Evidence. What
Promiſes, Flatteries, and engaging Obligations on the one hand, and not
ſo much as one Word or Deed, directly or indirectly, that look'd like a Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
or a Prepoſſeſſion on the other part of the Dutcheſs.</p>
               <p>Let this be taken in the ſofteſt ſenſe, for it is a great Misfortune, when
officious Inſtruments that are foreward'd to broach Scandals, meet with eaſie
and good natur'd Diſpoſitions, that are too open perhaps to receive them.
This may ſerve in ſome meaſure, perhaps, to remove the Evidence of thoſe
that are not wilfully Deaf and Blind; and for the reſt, it is left to Time and
Providence to bring the Truth to light in its due ſeaſon, and to vindicate the
Cauſe of the Innocent and Oppreſſed.</p>
