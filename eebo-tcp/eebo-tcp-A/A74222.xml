            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have cauſe of adding not altering, what I meant to ſay when I gave out the ſummons for this dayes appearance, I little thought of theſe Meſſengers, or of ſuch a Meſſage as they brought, the which, becauſe it confirmes mee in what I intend to ſpeake, and that I deſire you ſhould be truly informed of all paſſages between me and the Parliament, you ſhall here read, Firſt, my anſwer to the Declaration of both Houſes concerning <hi>Hull,</hi> the anſwer of the Parliament to my two Meſſages concerning <hi>Hull,</hi> together with my Reply to the ſame, and my Meſſage to both Houſes declaring the Reaſons why I refuſed to paſſe the Bill concerning the <hi>Militia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All which being read his Majeſty proceeded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Will make no paraphraſes upon what yee have heard, it more benefiting a Lawyer then a King, onely this obſervation, ſince Treaſon is countenanced ſo neere me, it is time to looke to my ſafety: I avow it was part of my wonder, that men (whom I thought heretofore diſcreet, and moderate) ſhould have undertaken this imployment, and that ſince they came (I having delivered them the Anſwer: you have heard, and commanded them to returne perſonally with it to the Parliament) ſhould have flatly diſobeyed me upon pretence of the Parliaments command. My end in telling you this, is to warne you of them, for ſince theſe men have brought me ſuch a Meſſage, and diſobeyed ſo lawfull a Command. I will not ſay what their intent of ſtaying here is, onely I bid you take heed, not knowing what do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of diſobedience they may preach to you, under colour of obeying the Parliament. Hitherto I have found and kept you quiet, the enjoying of which was a chiefe cauſe of my comming hither (Tumults and diſorders having made mee leave the South) and not to make this a ſeat of Warre, as malice would (but I hope in vaine) make you beleeve; Now if diſturbances doe come, I know whom I have reaſon to ſuſpect.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, you ſee that my Magazine is going to be taken from me (being my owne proper goods) directly againſt my will; The Militia (againſt Law and my conſent) is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be put in Execution: And laſtly, Sir <hi>Iohn Hothams</hi> Treaſon is countenanced; All this conſidered none can blame me to Apprehend dangers. Therefore I have thought fit (upon theſe reall Grounds) to tell you, That I am reſolved to have a Guard (the Parliament having had one all this while upon imaginary Iealouſies, (onely to ſecure my perſon. In which I deſire your concurrence and aſſiſtance, and that I may be able to protect you, the Lawes, and the true Proteſtant profeſſion from any Affront or Injury that may be offered, which I meane to maintaine my ſelfe without charge to the Countrey, intending no longer to keepe them on foote, then I ſhall be ſecured of my juſt Apprehenſions by having ſatisfaction in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars before mentioned.</p>
