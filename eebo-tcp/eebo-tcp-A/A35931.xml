            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This (in ſome ſort) was our condition before this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which was the <hi>ground-work</hi> whereupon theſe men at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> (even by a totall deſtruction of the whole <hi>Nation)</hi> have <hi>compleated the buſineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the firſt meeting of <hi>this Parliament,</hi> the <hi>confuſion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <hi>viſibly</hi> to appear: The <hi>Incendiaries</hi> of that <hi>Faction</hi> not only <hi>cheriſhed</hi> the old, but (by caſting falſe calumnies upon the <hi>King) fomented</hi> new <hi>jealouſies,</hi> whereby the <hi>people</hi> were put into ſuch a <hi>pannick fear,</hi> as that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved a preſent <hi>deſtruction inevitably</hi> muſt befall them, if not <hi>preſerved</hi> by <hi>the Members of the two Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>

            <p>And the <hi>King</hi> on the other ſide, with <hi>wonderfull</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>loyalty</hi> (even by the ſame Serpent) was told <hi>He ſhould be made more Glorious, then any of His Anceſtors or Predeceſſours:</hi> But the <hi>Members</hi> having thus <hi>encreaſed</hi> the flame, between the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Subject,</hi> and having by theſe falſe <hi>ſurmiſes</hi> and cunning <hi>diſſemblings,</hi> gulled the people into a belief, <hi>That whatever the Members declared, be it in things either Spirituall, or Temporall, the one was good Law, and the other true Goſpel;</hi> which the Members perceiving, they inſtantly made uſe thereof, and upon that ſcore Voted it <hi>a high Breach of the Priviledge of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for any</hi> (the <hi>Iudges,</hi> the <hi>Courts of Iuſtice,</hi> nor the <hi>King</hi> himſelf excepted) <hi>either to oppoſe their Commands, or to deny that to be Law, which they declared ſo to be:</hi> By which ſleight, their whole work was finiſhed, for by this

            </p>
            <p>But this <hi>Arbitrary</hi> power, thus by the Members <hi>uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,</hi> reſted not long there: Shortly after that, a <hi>Faction</hi> in the City of <hi>London,</hi> who were the <hi>mony'd men,</hi> and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed in buying the <hi>Church Lands,</hi> and thoſe who were poſſeſſed of beneficiall places in gathering that curſed <hi>tax</hi> of <hi>Exciſe,</hi> and the like, gave the <hi>law</hi> unto theſe <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;</hi> And now we ſee it is a <hi>Councell of War</hi> (although acted in the <hi>name</hi> of the <hi>Weſtminſter men,</hi> called <hi>the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)</hi> and none elſe, who <hi>dare</hi> declare the Law. And ſo for the preſent <hi>ſix</hi> or <hi>eight</hi> empty ſoules, and (untill inriched by <hi>theft</hi> and <hi>plunder) indigent</hi> perſons, are our <hi>Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this <hi>condition</hi> the people muſt be, It cannot be otherwiſe until the <hi>King</hi> be <hi>reſtored</hi> to His juſt Rights; for till then, although we have as many <hi>new Governours</hi> as <hi>new Moons,</hi> it is but ſo often <hi>changing the Theif.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not at all conſiderable to the people, whether this or that <hi>Faction,</hi> or which <hi>opinion</hi> in Religion prevailes in the Houſes, be it the <hi>true Proteſtant Religion</hi> eſtabliſhed, <hi>Popery, Presbytery, Independency,</hi> or what elſe ſoever it is, whilſt the <hi>King</hi> is kept from his juſt Rights of His <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Voice</hi> in Parliament, and his <hi>Soveraigne power</hi> of Government, every <hi>predominant</hi> Party makes <hi>his Will the Law:</hi> and conſequently, the <hi>people</hi> for their <hi>Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> their <hi>Lives, Eſtates,</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi> inſlaved to that <hi>Faction.</hi>

In the ſociety of thy <hi>wife, family, kindred,</hi> or <hi>friends?</hi> if thou doeſt conſider what <hi>hopes</hi> thou haſt to enjoy them, to thinke thereof, will rather adde <hi>grief</hi> unto thy <hi>ſoul,</hi> then <hi>increaſe</hi> thy <hi>conſolation;</hi> for being <hi>defeated</hi> of thy <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> (the knowne Law) which is <hi>baniſhed,</hi> thou canſt not for the leaſt inſtant of time, promiſe to thy ſelf continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any one of theſe <hi>bleſsings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>major part</hi> of the <hi>Members</hi> require from thee, thy <hi>life,</hi> thy <hi>eſtate,</hi> thy <hi>fortune,</hi> thy <hi>friend,</hi> or what ever elſe is moſt <hi>dear</hi> unto thee: It is, ſay they, a breach of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge</hi> of Parliament, not to ſubmit thy ſelf to the <hi>block,</hi> and render all to their <hi>luſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if thou haſt in this <hi>War, acted</hi> againſt thy <hi>King,</hi> thy caſe is ſtill <hi>worſe,</hi> for by that War, the Law is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,</hi> and ſo thou haſt been an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of thine <hi>owne</hi> and the <hi>Kingdomes ruine.</hi> Yet of that <hi>faction</hi> againſt the King, there be <hi>two ſorts of people:</hi> The one <hi>for ſelf-ends,</hi> againſt their <hi>owne knowledge:</hi> the other miſled, and ſo purſuing (although an erroneous one) their <hi>owne</hi> conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>For thoſe of the <hi>firſt ranke,</hi> I feare (like unto <hi>Judas)</hi> their owne <hi>ſouls</hi> render themſelves <hi>hopeleſſe</hi> of pardon, which I preſume (like unto <hi>Catiline)</hi> makes them judge themſelves in no ſecurity, but by <hi>attempting worſe evils,</hi> which doubtleſſe begat that <hi>barbarous Vote</hi> and declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Members, not to make further <hi>Application</hi> to their King. And for thoſe of the latter <hi>ranke,</hi> how far their following the <hi>dictamen</hi> of their owne conſcience, in point of <hi>Divinity</hi> may excuſe them, I will not <hi>diſpute,</hi> but, certaine I am by the <hi>conſtitutions</hi> of this Realme, in <hi>Temporall</hi> things, it neither <hi>extenuates</hi> the crime, nor <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigates</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:54815:5"/>
the puniſhment. In our Law, it is a <hi>Maxime,</hi> and a juſt one too: <hi>Ignorantia Juris non excuſat.</hi> If not knowne the Law, be a <hi>Plea,</hi> or <hi>juſtification</hi> in facts of <hi>Treaſon, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, felony, treſpaſſe</hi> or the like, both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>people</hi> were without <hi>protection,</hi> either of <hi>life, perſon,</hi> or <hi>eſtate:</hi> It were eaſie for every <hi>Malefactor</hi> to pretend ignorance of the Law. Therefore when the <hi>difference</hi> between the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>two Houſes</hi> firſt happened, every Subject at his <hi>perill</hi> ought ſo far to have rectified his judgement, as to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed himſelf which ſide the Law <hi>obliged</hi> him to <hi>adhere</hi> unto: yet not by that obliged to <hi>impoſsibilities;</hi> for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though moſt men (in many particulars) are <hi>unknowing</hi> of the Law; every one (even of the meaneſt capacity) may as eaſily learne from whom he is to be <hi>informed</hi> thereof, (the Judges of the Realme) as a <hi>ſick</hi> man may find out where his <hi>Phyſitian</hi> dwels.</p>
            <p>Now for want of ſo much <hi>conſideration</hi> as to make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, whether (by the Laws of <hi>England)</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> or the <hi>Members,</hi> was therein to be <hi>obeyed,</hi> that ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſurpriſed, quitting their <hi>Allegeance</hi> to their King, adhered to the <hi>Members</hi> their fellow Subjects, and <hi>inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> in this <hi>horred Rebellion:</hi> Therefore in <hi>ſtrictneſſe</hi> of Law, as guilty of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> as thoſe of the former ranke.</p>
            <p>And thus by receding from that one <hi>principle</hi> in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the <hi>true Iudge</hi> of the Law, this <hi>deſolation</hi> is come upon the whole Kingdome. Had the <hi>King</hi> been ſuffered to enjoy his <hi>lawfull</hi> power of <hi>Soveraignty:</hi> The <hi>Iudges</hi> of the Realme their <hi>Offfce</hi> of declaring the Law, by which the King governs, and the Parliament (that is, the King and the two Houſes joyntly its <hi>proper authority, viz.</hi> When neceſſity requires to make <hi>new</hi> Laws, or change the <hi>old:</hi> Had the <hi>Divines,</hi> the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Members</hi> of the two Houſes, kept themſelves
<pb facs="tcp:54815:5"/>
within their owne <hi>ſpheares,</hi> and every one <hi>ſubmitted</hi> unto, and <hi>obeyed</hi> his lawfull <hi>Superior,</hi> the knowne Law of the Land had continued in force, and conſequently we had ſtill been a moſt <hi>flouriſhing</hi> people.</p>
            <p>But it is never too <hi>late</hi> to amend: and if every one would herein begin at home, the worke were inſtantly done: but although it cannot be expected that all men will do their duty, yet for thoſe who were <hi>cheated</hi> into this <hi>Rebellion,</hi> their judgements being once rectified, it were not onely againſt the rules of <hi>charity,</hi> but of <hi>reaſon</hi> likewiſe, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they ſhould not with much more <hi>Zeal</hi> endeavour to <hi>reſtore</hi> the King and the people to their freedome, then (grounding upon an erronious conſcience) they proſecuted theirs, and their owne <hi>confuſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to ſhew, that the honeſt <hi>vulgar</hi> people (which are infinite in compariſon of the <hi>Seducers)</hi> were by the <hi>Incendiaries</hi> of theſe <hi>Weſtminster men intrapped</hi> into this <hi>Rebellion.</hi> That by the Laws of the Land (every mans onely true guide) all the Subjects of the Realme <hi>ought</hi> in that <hi>War</hi> to have adhered unto the King; That by the peoples <hi>diſobedience</hi> therein, the knowne Law is <hi>ſubverted,</hi> and themſelves <hi>inſlaved:</hi> That untill the King be <hi>reſtored</hi> unto His juſt rights, the knowne Law ſet on foot, and a ſubmiſſion to the <hi>true</hi> Judges thereof, the people are not to hope for other, then increaſe of miſery: And that by doing this, (which is both in their power, and the peoples duty to performe) is the ſcope of this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>And herein, let none heretofore active againſt the King (by reflecting upon the Law, which as before appears, doth judge him a <hi>Traytor)</hi> be <hi>deterred</hi> from doing his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; That were (in example of <hi>Judas)</hi> to <hi>revenge</hi> themſelves upon their <hi>owne</hi> perſons: They doe thereby become the <hi>Authors</hi> of their owne ruine; for as we have the <hi>ſeate</hi> of

               <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdome to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> That certain perſons by them therein named, ſhall have power to Call together, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and Arme all the people of the Kingdome, and Conduct them into any part of the Realme to ſuppreſſe rebellious Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections or Invaſions in ſuch ſort as the Members (without the King) ſhal ſignifie: this power to continue ſo Long and no longer then thoſe Members pleaſe, and diſobedience therein to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the Members and none elſe.</p>
            <p>This being preſented to the King, He refuſed to confirm it with His Royall Aſſent: The Members thereupon, ſtiling it, <hi>An Ordinance of Parliament without the King,</hi> declared it a Law: By which in words, not onely the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdome, and the Government of the Realm, was taken from the Crowne, and removed to the Members, but <hi>an Arbitrary power</hi> uſurped by them to ſignifie and declare what Facts were Rebellion, and what not; and accordingly by pretext and colour thereof cauſed the people to be Arrayed, Armed, and Muſtered: And ſo in effect the Kings Sword and Scepter wreſted out of His hands by His owne Subjects.</p>
            <p>And further, the Members pretending the King (not conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54815:8"/>
to that Law) was Evil-counſelled by like Ordinances, raiſed Armies, appointed the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> their Generall, authorized them by War to Kill and ſlay their fellow Subjects, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from the King thoſe pretended bad Counſellours.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> by His Proclamation inhibited all Perſons from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering unto them, and required His Subjects obedience unto Him <note place="margin">27. <hi>Maii</hi> 1642.</note> their King.</p>
            <p>Hereupon I ſeriouſly bethought my ſelf, whether I was obliged herein to <hi>obey</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> or the <hi>Members;</hi> and reſolved the Laws of <hi>England</hi> ought to be my guide, which I found to be thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That this Nation is governed by a known Law, that Law expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Judges of the Realme, Thoſe Judges appointed and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the King our only Supream Governor, unto whom alone all the people of</hi> England <hi>are obliged (in point of Soveraignty and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to ſubmit themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then I conſidered in whom the power of the <hi>Militia</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the making of the aforeſaid Ordinances.</p>

            <p>For the firſt, I found that <hi>the Militia of the Kingdome by the known Law was inherently in the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the latter, that <hi>no New Law can be made, or the Old chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged but by the King, with the aſſent of the two Houſes of Parliament:</hi> And finding the <hi>King</hi> therein to diſ-aſſent, I did without ſcruple reſolve the law was not altered, therefore the <hi>Militia</hi> ſtill in the Crown, and conſequently, that it was my duty herein to obey the <hi>Kings</hi> Command, not the <hi>Members.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then I conſidered what was the offence of a Subject to joyne with thoſe Forces raiſed by the Members, which I found, to be the crime of <hi>High, Treaſon.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>AS it is neceſſary for a Common-wealth to have a Law, ſo every known law muſt be grounded upon certain rules: Therefore be it compoſed with never ſo much care, the people cannot be well governed, unleſſe ſome perſons have power in ſome things to alter the old and make new Laws. Emergent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions are oft ſuch as require <hi>raiſing mony,</hi> and other things to be done which the preſcribed rules of a known Law cannot war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; which perſons ſo authorized to make Laws in this Nation, are called the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that thoſe Perſons at this time conſiſt of the King and both Houſes joyntly, is a thing moſt obvious to all men, but how long it hath been ſo is uncertaine: For although all the Sages of the Law, and judicious Hiſtorians agree, (and therwith reaſon it ſelf concurreth) that ever ſince we have had Lawes, ſome perſons have had power in ſome things to alter and make new Lawes, which might properly be called a Parliament, yet untill long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt. I doe not finde it cleared what was a Parliament, or what Perſons had that power: But upon peruſall of the Statutes themſelves, (which I conceive in this caſe to be the

beſt proof) I confeſſe I am much inclined to believe, that untill the Raigne of King <hi>Edward</hi> 1. there was not any formed body or known perſons whom the King was obliged to ſummon unto a Parliament for the making of Lawes; wherein I ſhall begin with the firſt Law of that nature, which at this day binds the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: And therein we cannot goe beyond the ninth year of the Raigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> 3. that of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> being the firſt, <note place="margin">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54815:10"/>
ſeverall Statutes were made, which to this day binde the people equall to any Act of Parliament made ſince.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, I conceive that <hi>the two Houſes of Parliament</hi> were not originally compoſed with the beginning of the Law, for as by the aforeſaid Acts of Parliament it doth appear in the Raign of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. being the ninth King after the <hi>Conquerour,</hi> and in time <hi>above two hundred years</hi> from the Conqueſt (all which ſpace we were governed by the ſame Law we now have) there was not any formed Body, known Perſons, or Aſſembly, whoſe conſent was neceſſary to joyne with the <hi>King</hi> to make an <hi>Act of Parliament;</hi> but it ſeems that when the King conceived it fit to make a <hi>Law,</hi> He called to Him ſuch of His Subjects either of His Councell, or others, as He thought moſt proper to be conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with concerning that preſent occaſion; if it concerned mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Law (as in theſe of the expoſition of the Statute of <hi>Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and the Statute of <hi>Bigamy,</hi> and other ſuch Acts) the Judges and other of His Councell learned were principally conſulted with; if it concerned the people in generall, as that of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Will.</hi> 1. and other ſuch like, the people of all ſorts were called to adviſe with the King what Laws were to be made. And ſo I conceive it was from that time upward to the Conqueſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore when any Book or Hiſtory makes mention of a Parliament in thoſe daies, that Aſſembly (as I conceive) was no other but as aforeſaid. And rare it was for any King in thoſe times to conſult with any other in making Laws but the <hi>Prelats,</hi> the <hi>Peers,</hi> his <hi>Privy Councell,</hi> the <hi>Judges,</hi> and other perſons lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the <hi>profeſſion;</hi> yet doubtleſſe never concluded any matter of moment without conſent of ſuch his people as were proper to be adviſed with therein.</p>
               <p>Nor do I conceive it was in the power of any King after <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coke. Calvins</hi> caſe. <hi>b.</hi>
                  </note> the Conquerour had conſented to <hi>govern</hi> by a <hi>known law</hi> to alter the <hi>fundamentall grounds</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>But in thoſe daies, although we were governed by the ſame <hi>law</hi> as now, yet it appears to me we had not any <hi>formed bodies</hi> of the <hi>Houſes,</hi> nor could any <hi>Subject</hi> by <hi>the law</hi> challenge a particular priviledge to be <hi>ſummoned to Parliament,</hi> nor claim right to a <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative voice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now the <hi>law</hi> is otherwiſe, there be <hi>two formed bodies,</hi> which

                  <hi>will and aſſent of Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Earles, Barons, Knights, Burgeſſes, and other Free-men of the land:</hi> By this the King exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelf and his Succeſſours (by themſelves alone) to <hi>tax,</hi> or <hi>impoſe</hi> upon the people any payments of mony, and from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth no <hi>ſubſidy,</hi> or other aide could be given him by the Subject without conſent of <hi>Prelats, Peers, and Commons:</hi> This I conceive was the firſt <hi>foundation</hi> of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> and the <hi>ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work</hi> for the <hi>formed bodies</hi> of both Houſes; For it is obvious that (if not the principall) one chief end of calling Parliaments was, and is, to <hi>raiſe mony</hi> for the publike affaires: ſo that after the aforeſaid Statute of 34 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. it had been to little purpoſe to call a Parliament of <hi>Prelats</hi> and <hi>Peers,</hi> and not to ſummon the <hi>Commons.</hi> And upon view of the Statute made after that time, it appears that thoſe perſons were more frequently called.</p>
               <p>And doubtleſſe King <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. and other ſucceeding Kings fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the greater number of the Prelats, Peers, and Commons conſenting thereunto, more cheerfully the Laws were obeyed, it begat in them a deſire to increaſe their number, and to have their aſſent not only to Subſidies, but to every New law. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ſeverall Kings ſummoned more Towns to return Burgeſſes, created new Corporations, and granted to them power to ſend their Deputies: yet was it not reduced to any certainty what number were to be ſummoned to Parliament, the aforeſaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 34 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. only declaring, <hi>That no tax, &amp;c. ſhall be levied without aſſent of Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, Earles, Barons, Knights, Burgeſſes, and other Free-men of the Land,</hi> not mentioning how many, or what particular perſons, ſo that it was ſtill left to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54815:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Kings choice how many to call, And ſo continued for a long time after, For to the making of the <hi>Satute of Staple</hi> 27. <hi>E.</hi> 3. but one <note place="margin">Statute of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple made 27 <hi>E.</hi> 3.</note> ſingle perſon was ſummoned for any one County as by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble thereof in theſe words appears, <hi>viz. Edw. by the grace of God, &amp;c. Whereas good deliberation had with the Prelats, Dukes, Earles, Barons, and great men of the Counties, that is to ſay, for every County one for all the County, And of the Commons of Cities, and Boroughes of our Realme, ſummoned to our great Councell holden at Weſtminſter, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But afterwards all the Biſhops, and Peers, two Knights for a Shire, two Citizens for a City, and two Burgeſſes for a Borough towne were uſually called; And by a Statute made 7. <hi>H.</hi> 4. the <note place="margin">7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. cap. 15.</note> Writ of ſummons now uſed was formed, and by one other Act made 1. <hi>H.</hi> 5. direction is given who ſhall be choſen, that is to ſay, <note place="margin">1 <hi>H.</hi> 5. cap. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>for Knights of the Shire, perſons reſiant in the County, and for Cities and Boroughes, Citizens and Burgeſſes dwelling there, and free-men of the ſame Cities and Boroughes and no other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo by frequent calling Parliaments, conſtant ſummoning the Prelates, Peers, and Commons as aforeſaid, the Kings not preſſing Laws to paſſe, nor any Law being admitted to bind with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch conſent, the Parliament became a body compoſed thus, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Lords Spirituall, the Lords Temporall, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons being three Eſtates, and the King head of all, and as the ſoul adding life, And by continuance of time it likewiſe became in the nature of a fundamentall ground, That no new Law can be <note place="margin">Stat. 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. cap. 21. <hi>Coke.</hi> 8. fo. 20. 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 27. 7 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>Dyer</hi> 59. 60. <hi>Co.</hi> 4.

               <p>And yet the King at this day (which is evident by common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) hath power to increaſe the numbers of either Houſe, and that without ſtint: Thus the power of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> was reſtrained from making Laws without conſent of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as aforeſaid; wherein the difference is but thus; Former Kings in ſome things without conſent of any knowne Body or Aſſembly had power to alter the old, and make new Lawes, our <note place="margin">Stat. 24 <hi>H.</hi> 8. ca. 12. <hi>Coke.</hi> 5. f. 28.</note> King cannot in any one particular alter the old, or make a new Law without the aſſent of the two Houſes.</p>
               <p>Yet Monarchy remaines, the people are governed by the ſame Law, &amp; under the ſame power as before, which is by the Kings ſole
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54815:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Authority. And Laws now made by Act of Parliament, although they bind not without aſſent of the two Houſes, yet they are the Kings Laws, and are properly ſaid to be made by Him, And the Statutes for the moſt part are, and the beſt forme of penning an Act is thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>viz. Be it enacted by the Kings Majesty, with the aſſent of the Lords Spirituall and Temporall, and the Commons, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Beſides, at this day after a Law is made by Act of Parliament, the execution of that Law is by the Kings ſole Authority, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to pardon the tranſgreſſours thereof, and Authority to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Thus it appears, that originally the Parliament conſiſted of the King, calling to Him for their advice ſuch as He thought fit.

               <p>M. <hi>Pryn</hi> hath ſpared no labour to make good his aſſertion, fetching his arguments from a time ſuppoſed by him before Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy here began, ſecondly upon accidents happening ſince this Monarchy, And then imagineth a time to come, that is, when the King and all the bloud Royall of <hi>England</hi> ſhall be extinct for want of an heire at Law to inherit the Crowne. Firſt, for his far fetched argument; Kingdomes (ſaith he) were before Kings;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54815:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Theſe words taken in their literall ſenſe, imply a groſſe and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd contradiction, and he might as well ſay that ſervants were before Maſters, or the Son before the Father: But doubtleſſe Mr. <hi>Pryns</hi> meaning is, that Countries and people were before they had Kings over them, yet his words being ſo expounded, make nothing to his purpoſe: ſuppoſe that before Monarchy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in this Nation, the people had been governed by a known Law, to conclude thereupon, That the Members of the two Houſes at this day have power to make Laws without the King, or that the King hath not a negative Voice in Parliament is to no more pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, then if he ſhould ſay, The Earth was made before it was peopled, <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is neither man woman nor child in the world: or thus, This Nation was peopled before they were governed by a Law, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the people neither had either Law or government. The <hi>Jews</hi> upon the like ground may argue thus, <hi>viz.</hi> our Religion was before Chriſt, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the people at this day ought not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Pryns</hi> argument is more abſurd, he cannot ſhew that the people of this Nation before they were governed under Kings had either Literature, known Law, or Government: However cleere it is, This Nation hath been <hi>Monarchiall above</hi> 1200. <hi>years before the inſtitution of the two Houſes of Parliament,</hi> And ſo Mr. <hi>Pryns</hi> argument that Kingdomes were before Kings, is no weight at all to prove, That the two Houſes have power to make Laws without the King.</p>
               <p>And much like unto it is his argument, That the King may die without heire, for if that ſhould happen (ſaith Mr. <hi>Pryn) the people might make what Laws they ſhould thinke fit:</hi> Now thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he concludes thus, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Members at this day have power without the King, to make Laws. With more reaſon the King might argue thus. <hi>All the lands in</hi> England <hi>mediatly or immediatly are held of the King,</hi> and if the owners die without heire, by the Laws <note place="margin">

               <p>But in Mr. <hi>Pryns</hi> caſe, admit the King ſhould die without heire,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54815:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
although it be granted that the people had thereby power to make Laws, yet groſſe it were to conclude upon it, That the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the two Houſes might ſo do: For if the King and that Stem Royall were extinct without iſſue, the two Houſes would be extinct too.

Yet in that caſe, the ſucceſſour <hi>King</hi> if he pleaſe might call a new Parl. But when the King dies without heire, there is no ſucceding King to ſummon it, And ſo the conſtitution of Parliament, and the whole Law and Government (the fountaine of all which being ſtopped) would be ſuſpended, if not ended, and the people left without Law; Then it might be granted Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> That the ſtrongeſt party concurring in that caſe would governe: yet that is no proof that the Members had thereby power to make Laws: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more abſurd it is to conclude upon Mr. <hi>Pryns</hi> reaſon, That the two Houſes at this day (whilſt the King and the blood Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all are in being) have that power.</p>
               <p>Then for his objections upon Authority, or preſidents happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſince the beginning of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy. <hi>Kings</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have no voice in reverſing judgements, or damning Patents in Parliament, therefore they have not a voice in paſſing Bils for publike Laws.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Pryns</hi> words muſt be underſtood one of theſe wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe judgements are reverſed, and Patents damned by Act of Parliament, or elſe in the ordinary way of proceedings of Law, as in a Court of Juſtice; if he meane by Act of Parliament, he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beggs the queſtion. And falſe it is to ſay the King hath not a negative Voice in every Act propounded for a Law. If he meane by judiciall proceedings, as in a Court of Juſtice (which I conceive he doth) then the caſe truely ſtated is but thus; The Lords Houſe <hi>in Parliament time</hi> is a Court of Judicature, and (amongſt other things) the Members of that Aſſembly have power (the cauſe being regularly brought before them by writ of errour, and by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Judges and not elſe) to reverſe erroneous judgements
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54815:14"/>
given in the Kings Bench, wherein it is true the King hath no Voice; but that nothing diſproves His negative Voice in making Laws: if ſo, that reaſon ſerves as well to exclude <hi>the Commons</hi> as the King, for in reverſing judgements in the Lords Houſe, the Members of the <hi>lower Houſe</hi> have no Voice, &amp; ſo if this argument of Mr. <hi>Pryns</hi> be of force, <hi>the Lords</hi> without King or Commons have power to make Laws by Act of Parliament. Then for dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Patents, neither the Lords, nor the Commons, nor both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes joyntly have power judicially, or finally to determine the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of any Patent or grant of the King: That properly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to the Judges of the Kings Bench, of the Common Pleas, and other Courts of Juſtice, before whom (as afterwards it is more clearly ſhewed) ſuch caſes may be judicially brought to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, wherein neither King, Lords, or Members of the Commons Houſe hath Voice.</p>
               <p>And for the reſt of his arguments, they rather prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, then that which Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> infers upon them: <hi>Kings (ſaith he) have in former times ſhewed their reaſons why they denied to paſſe Bils preſented unto them by both Houſes,</hi> which proves that thoſe Kings had power to deny them, elſe they could not ſhew cauſe of their refuſall, no more then Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> can render reaſons of his being at <hi>Weſtmiuſter,</hi> unleſſe he have been there. But Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> knowes all Kings have moſt frequently rejected Bils paſſed by both Houſes (and Bils declared by the Members to concerne the publike good) without rendring their reaſons for the ſame.</p>
               <p>And for the power of the Protector to confirme Bils paſſed by both Houſes, if that be granted, that in ſome caſes of imminent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity the Protectors conſent might make good, and perfect ſuch Bils, it nothing proves the abſolute power of both Houſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the King, but rather the contrary, and plainly demonſtrates the imperfect power of the two Houſes, who cannot without the conſent of a Protector in ſuch caſes make any compleat and bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Laws, Therefore (if not ſtronger) the ſame it muſt be, when we have a King no infant, and Reigning without a Protector.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſaith</hi> Mr. Pryn <hi>in Countries where Kings are elective, by the death of the Preſent King, untill a new one be choſen: the people having no King over them may make binding Laws.</hi> Here although I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> cannot for other Countries make his poſition
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54815:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
good, yet this admitted to him, rather diſproves his argument againſt the Kings negative Voice; for <hi>of his owne ſhewing</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that in thoſe Countries where <hi>Kings</hi> are <hi>elective,</hi> after ſuch time as the people have choſen a King, they cannot make Laws without Him, And if ſo where Kings are elective, much more they cannot where <hi>Kings</hi> are <hi>hereditary.</hi> Therefore by Mr. <hi>Pryns</hi> owne argument it followeth, that in this Nation, neither the people, nor the two Houſes without the King, have power to make Laws. For we have <hi>no interregnum,</hi> there is not with us any time of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coke.</hi> 7. 30.</note> of a King, <hi>eo inſtante</hi> upon the death of the precedent King, the Crowne is veſted in the ſucceſſour.</p>
               <p>And for the two Houſes refuſall to grant the King Aide by Subſidies and the like, That diſproves the Kings power of His negative Voice in Parliament, as the Kings refuſall to confirme Bils paſſed by both Houſes prove that the King at this day may make Lawes without them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſaith, he if Kings will not paſſe Laws preſented unto them by both Houſes, they may be compelled thereunto, for Kings (ſaith he) have been ſo forced, as King</hi> H. 3. <hi>in that of</hi> Magna Charra <hi>and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Statutes.</hi>

               <p>To admit that a Judge of a Court of Judicature may be forced to declare his opinion, or to give judgement againſt his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſeemes to me to be ſo abſurd, as I cannot but ſuppoſe that Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> himſelf would grant it to be moſt unreaſonable, and even to be deſtructive of the Law it ſelfe. If the King ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble powers, and by force compell the Lords, or Commons to paſſe Laws by Him propounded, it would be judged an act of <hi>high Tyranny,</hi> and I beleeve Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> would conceive Laws ſo obtained bound not, And if ſo in that caſe, (if he be not extreame partiall) he muſt upon the ſame ground agree, that the King in the like caſe ought not to be forced. He doubtleſſe hath the ſame authority, the ſame rules, and motions to be guided by His <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> as a Subject hath.

               <p>Beſides, if the <hi>King</hi> at His Coronation ſhould refuſe to take an Oath, we have no more Law to compell Him thereunto, then we have to force Him to be Crowned. And as it is not material to the right &amp; power of the <hi>King</hi> whether he be Crowned, or not, ſo it is inconſiderable to the people to have Him ſworne, for if we had no municipall Law, the <hi>King</hi> unſworne were bound in Conſcience to govern the people by naturall equity. But we have a knowne <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coke</hi> 7. <hi>Calvins</hi> caſe fo. 17.</note> Law by which both <hi>King,</hi> and Subjects, (the one by a directive power, the others by both directive and coercive) are regulated, and every one protected in his juſt rights, and this, whether the <hi>King</hi> be Crowned, or not Crowned, whether he take an Oath or no Oath.</p>
               <p>Secondly, admit <hi>Kings</hi> obliged to take an Oath at their Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, yet even by the Members owne ſhewing, they are not bound to take it in the words by themſelves mentioned, And of all the <hi>Kings</hi> paſt, they inſtance but <hi>ſeven</hi> who have taken any Oath, and but <hi>three</hi> of thoſe ſeaven (admitting that Oath in <hi>French</hi> and the other in <hi>Latine</hi> to be one, and the ſame) they name to have taken it: And of theſe three, offer proof but for <hi>one,</hi> And themſelves ſhew that the Oathes taken by the other <hi>four,</hi> viz. <hi>King H.</hi> 8. <hi>King E.</hi> 6. <hi>King James, and King Charles</hi> differ in the very words in queſtion, and render a quite other ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> of that of <hi>King H.</hi> 8. they ſet downe the words thus, viz. <hi>(And affirme them which the Nobles and people have made and choſen with my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi> And that of <hi>King</hi> Ed. 6. thus, <hi>viz. Doe you grant to make no new Laws, but ſuch as ſhall be to the honour of God, and the good of the Common-wealth, and the ſame ſhall be made by conſent of your people, as hath been acoustomed.</hi> And for the Oaths of King <hi>James<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> they ſay the word <hi>(chooſe)</hi> was left out.</p>
               <p>So that upon the whole matter that which hath been, or can be ſaid herein is but thus: Some <hi>Kings</hi> at their Coronation have taken an Oath, but that any <hi>King</hi> is obliged ſo to doe, or being obliged that he ought to purſue the foreſaid words, it neither doth, nor can be made good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:54815:15"/>
Thirdly, admit that <hi>Kings</hi> have taken the Oath in the foreſaid words, and obliged thereunto, yet that nothing proves the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers power without him to make Laws. <hi>William the Conquerour</hi>

                     <hi>Coke, Calvins</hi> caſe fo. 17.</note> (all men muſt grant) might have impoſed upon this Nation what Laws he pleaſed. But being reſolved to have a ſetled Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, granted to the people ſuch Laws and cuſtomes as were juſt <note place="margin">

               <p>The people being thus freed from the <hi>ſervitude</hi> incident to a <hi>Conquest,</hi> nothing could be more acceptable to them, then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of that Law: And nothing being more <hi>ſafe for a King,</hi> then to have the <hi>love of His Subjects,</hi> ſucceeding <hi>Kings</hi> might be induced at their publike Coronations, <hi>voluntarily</hi> to take an Oath for the <hi>preſervation</hi> of the Laws: And in that ſenſe theſe words, <hi>(quas vulgus elegerit)</hi> might be aptly uſed, for it is not improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, the people <hi>had choſen</hi> thoſe Laws which the <hi>Conquerour (with their good liking)</hi> had conſented to governe by. So that the Coronation Oath (admitting it in the words as the Members have expreſſed) cannot in any reaſonable ſenſe, be rendred otherwiſe then thus, <hi>viz. Do you grant to keep, and for your ſelf promiſe to defend, and to the honour of God corroborate the juſt Laws and cuſtoms which the people have choſen.</hi> This imports a ſettlement of a known Law, which the <hi>King</hi> ſwears to preſerve, but to render the words in the <hi>future tenſe,</hi> and to make the <hi>King</hi> to ſwear, to confirme ſuch Laws as the people ſhall chooſe (what ever they be) tends to <hi>confuſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, ſay the Members, if <hi>(elegerit)</hi> in this place be Engliſhed <hi>have choſen,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> is not ſworne to keep Laws afterwards made, which is utterly miſtaken, for when a new Law is made, it is then part of the Law of <hi>England;</hi> And being ſworne in generall words, to defend <hi>the Law,</hi> He is ſworne to defend <hi>all the Law. For example;</hi> the Judges in generall words are ſworne to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine controverſies according to the Law, and frequent it is after the Judges have taken that Oath, for the Law to be altered by Act of Parliament, yet the former Oath binds thoſe Judges, and they are obliged, even by that Oath, to give ſentence as the Law is, according to that alteration, not as it was when they tooke the Oath. And ſo it is with the <hi>King,</hi> he having taken the Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54815:16"/>
Oath, is thereby bound <hi>in Conſcience</hi> to defend and obſerve e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Law afterwards made.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, admit the word <hi>(elegerit)</hi> in that place to be Engli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the <hi>future tenſe,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> to ſwear to confirme the juſt Laws which the people ſhall propound unto Him, That can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not admit of any other interpretation then thus: <hi>viz.</hi> If the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple propound Laws to the <hi>King,</hi> which in themſelves are juſt and equall, He is by His Oath obliged in conſcience to confirme them, but He is not thereby bound in conſcience to conſent to all ſuch Laws as the people <hi>ſhall ſay</hi> are juſt: That were to make one part of the Oath to contradict another part thereof, for by the former part of the Oath, the <hi>King</hi> ſwears to defend the Laws of the Realme, And by the ſame Oath <hi>(thus expounded)</hi> He is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bereft of power to performe it, but ſwears at the pleaſure of the vulgar multitude, to deſtroy it. Suppoſe the <hi>King</hi> thus ſworne, be deſired by the people to make a Law thereby to exempt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from puniſhment for <hi>Treaſon, Felony, or other crimes, or to ſettle the power of Srveraignty, and government upon Subjects,</hi> in this caſe the <hi>King,</hi> even by that Oath, were obliged to reject ſuch Laws, for it is neither a juſt Law, nor doth it ſtand with reaſon, to exempt any from puniſhment for ſuch crimes, or to <hi>exact</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> to quit His Authority, nor <hi>(were it in His power)</hi> ought He to put His people under the <hi>yoake of their fellow Subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, but however if the <hi>King</hi> ſhould <hi>in terminis</hi> ſwear to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme all Laws <hi>(whether juſt or unjuſt)</hi> to be propounded to Him by the people, That doth not enable any to make Laws without Him. A <hi>King (although not ſworne)</hi> is obliged in <hi>conſcience</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſuch Laws which are in themſelves <hi>good</hi> for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth <hi>juſt,</hi> &amp; <hi>equall</hi> between Him and His Subjects, but is not <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellable</hi> to <hi>change</hi> either Law or ſetled Government; And if ſo <hi>unſworne,</hi> it followeth that his being <hi>ſworne</hi> to do it, is but a <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tie</hi> upon His <hi>conſcience:</hi> By <hi>ſwearing</hi> to confirme ſuch Laws as His people ſhall propound unto Him, that gives not power to them to make Laws <hi>without Him;</hi> ſuch an expoſition of an Oath <hi>(untill this Parliament)</hi> was never heard of.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, if ſuch an <hi>abſurd</hi> expoſition of an Oath could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the <hi>Members</hi> of the two Houſes <hi>cannot</hi> be the people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the words of this Oath, for <hi>Kings</hi> have taken Oaths at

And for theſe words <hi>(le Roy ſ'aviſera)</hi> the opinion of <hi>Juſtice Hutton,</hi> and the words of <hi>King Richard</hi> the <hi>ſecond,</hi> nothing can be inferred thereupon againſt the <hi>Kings negative Voice,</hi> but rather the contrary. The <hi>Kings</hi> anſwer (ſay they) to Bils preſented to Him by the two Houſes, which He rejects, is thus <hi>(le Roy ſ'aviſera)</hi> that is, He will <hi>adviſe</hi> whether to confirme them or not: It ſeemes to me <hi>ſtrange</hi> to conclude thereupon, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the two Houſes may make Laws without Him, that is plainely a <hi>non ſequitur,</hi> but it doth directly <hi>imply,</hi> that the King hath <hi>election</hi> to make it a Law, or no Law, elſe it were in vaine for Him to adviſe upon it.</p>
               <p>And the words of <hi>King Rich:</hi> 2. (admitting that ſtory to be true) <hi>ſaying He conceived Himſelfe bound by His Oath to conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Law,</hi> ſhewes <hi>firſt,</hi> that it was in His <hi>power</hi> to conſent, or <hi>not</hi> to conſent; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that the Members could <hi>not</hi> do it without Him; <hi>thirdly,</hi> that it was <hi>only</hi> an <hi>obligation upon His Conſcience.</hi> And that He, becauſe He conceived it to be a juſt Law, thought Himſelf tied in <hi>conſcience</hi> to confirme it.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter clear it is, (admitting the King to have taken an Oath in the words mentioned by the Members) it rather proves the <hi>Kings</hi> power of <hi>a negative Voice,</hi> then diſproves it.</p>
               <p>But the Members (I am confident) know that the <hi>King</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did, nor was oblieged to take the aforeſaid Oath; The <hi>King</hi> purſuing former <hi>preſidents</hi> recorded in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> tooke the Oath in <hi>words,</hi> and according to the <hi>Ceremony</hi> as followeth, <hi>viz.

Now having done with this Oath, I ſhall proceed further to examine the <hi>lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of the Members doctrine, to exclude the <hi>King</hi> from His nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Voice.</p>
               <p>It is an undoubted <hi>maxime</hi> in every Law, that no <hi>Perſon, Court,</hi> or <hi>Aſſembly can Act or do any thing concerning the publike affaires of the Kingdome or Common-wealth without Commiſſion,</hi> which ſtands with all the reaſon in the world, elſe it followeth, that every one hath <hi>equall</hi> power to make Laws, Act, and do what he thinks fit. And by the <hi>conſtitutions</hi> of this Realme, every <hi>Perſon, Court,</hi> or <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> muſt derive its authority by one of theſe wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> by the <hi>Kings grant, by Act of Parliament,</hi> or by <hi>cuſtome and uſe:</hi> if by the Kings <hi>grant,</hi> the Patent it ſelfe declares the <hi>perſons</hi> authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; if by <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament, the <hi>Statute</hi> names the men; if by <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> and uſe, that uſe and cuſtome is their Commiſſion. <hi>For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> if the <hi>King</hi> by His <hi>Commiſſion</hi> authorize <hi>twenty perſons,</hi> or any ten of them, whereof A. B. or C. to be one to determine a felony, if <hi>ſeventeen</hi> of the twenty, in the <hi>abſence</hi> of A. B. and C. execute that Commiſſion, all their proceedings are <hi>void,</hi> as done without Commiſſion, ſeventeen <hi>ſtrangers</hi> not named in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, might as well act therein as they.</p>
               <p>And if the Commiſſion be by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> none can <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute</hi> that Commiſſion but thoſe authorized by the Statute. And the like holds when <hi>cuſtome and uſe</hi> is the Commiſſion, <hi>unleſſe</hi> that cuſtome and uſe warrant the perſons to act, it is done without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and ſo void.</p>
               <p>Then for the point in queſtion, <hi>The Members</hi> of the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes have <hi>no grant</hi> from the King, nor is there any <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to enable them to make Laws, nor doth <hi>cuſtome</hi> warrant it: For untill this Parliament, they never <hi>made</hi> Law without, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Kings</hi> conſent, nor <hi>claimed</hi> power ſo to do.</p>
               <p>But ſay the Members in the foreſaid Declaration, <hi>If there be not an agreement between His Majeſty and His Parliament, either</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Nov. 2. 1642.</note> 
                  <hi>His Majeſty must be Judge againſt His Parliament, or the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without His Majeſty, for (ſay they) that queſtion whereupon the ſafety of the Kingdome depends, muſt not be undetermined: And</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:54815:19"/>
                  <hi>(ſay they) if His Majeſty against His Parliament; why not as well of the neceſſity in the queſtion of making a Law, without and againſt their conſent, as of denying a Law againſt their deſire and adviſe? The Judge of the neceſſity (ſay they) in either caſe, by like reaſon is Judge in both. Beſides, (ſay they) if His Majeſty in this difference of opinions ſhould be Judge, He ſhould be Judge in His owne caſe: But the Parliament ſhould be Judge between His Majeſty and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as they are in many, if not in all caſes. And (ſay they) if His Majesty ſhould be Judge, He ſhould be Judge out of His Courts, and againſt His higheſt Court, which He never is. But the Parliament ſhould onely Judge without His Perſonall Aſſent, which as a Court of Judicature it alwayes doth, and all other Courts as well as it. And (ſay they) if the King be for the Kingdome, and not the Kingdome for the King, and if the Kingdome best knoweth what is for its owne good and preſervation, and the Parliament be the repreſentative Body of the Kingdome, it is (ſay they) eaſie to judge who in this caſe ſhould be Judge. But (ſay they) it it not ſo eaſie to underſtand what is the danger of unſetling by this meanes the ſecurity of all mens eſtates. Is this danger (ſay they) kept of us by His Majeſties ſingle Vote? And all mens eſtates without ſecurity, and expoſed to an arbitrary power, becauſe in all Courts of Juſtice, and in the Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament (and that without any appeale from it) mens estates and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts are Judged without His Majeſties Perſonall Aſſent. But (ſay they) we do not ſay this as if the Royall Aſſent were not requiſite in the paſſing of Laws, nor doe, nor ever did we ſay, that becauſe His Majeſty is bound to give His conſent to good Laws, preſented to Him by His people in Parliament, that therefore they ſhall be Laws without His conſent, or at all obligatory, ſaving only for the neceſſary preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kingdome, whilſt that neceſſity laſts, and ſuch conſent can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obtained.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Here with much <hi>art</hi> and <hi>cunning</hi> it is endevoured to <hi>miſleade</hi> the people: And for that purpoſe the true queſtion is <hi>declined,</hi> and other queſtions <hi>raiſed,</hi> which at the firſt ſight may to the <hi>vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> ſeeme plauſible. <hi>When a difference happens (ſay the Members) between the King and the Houſes, and thus in a thing which concerns</hi>

                  <hi>the ſafety of the Kingdome, it muſt not reſt undetermined, therefore (ſay they) either the King must be Judge againſt the Houſes, or the Houſes muſt be Judge againſt the King, and conclude for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the caſe being <hi>rightly ſtated,</hi> and the <hi>conſtitutions</hi> of the Realme, <hi>duly</hi> conſidered, every rationall man will conclude, that this power being granted the Members, all the reſt of the people of <hi>England</hi> are of a <hi>free Subject</hi> become <hi>abſolute ſlaves;</hi> which is thus: This Nation is <hi>governed</hi> by a <hi>knowne</hi> Law, which hath its <hi>preſcribed rules,</hi> therefore (as before I ſaid) it may be <hi>neceſſary</hi> in <hi>ſome things,</hi> to alter the <hi>old,</hi> and make <hi>new</hi> Laws. And that being ſo, ſome <hi>knowne perſons</hi> muſt Judge when <hi>neceſſity</hi> requires ſuch a change, and conſequently untill thoſe perſons have ſo judged it, all the people <hi>ought</hi> to conclude there is no <hi>need</hi> to <hi>alter</hi> the Law. And by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> (as before is ſaid) the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>two Houſes</hi> are that Judge, no <hi>major part,</hi> it is <hi>all joyntly</hi> who have that power.

B.</hi> or <hi>C.</hi> or any two of them, have power to ſell, but moſt <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious</hi> it were, upon that ground to give power to <hi>B.</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> to ſell the Lands of <hi>A.</hi> without his perſonall conſent. So in this caſe, the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England</hi> have <hi>debarred</hi> themſelves from <hi>making,</hi> or <hi>chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging</hi> the Laws, <hi>without aſſent</hi> of the two Houſes, whereby the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Lords</hi> Houſe, or the <hi>Commons</hi> Houſe, hath power <hi>negatively</hi> to hinder the making of any <hi>new</hi> Law, or <hi>changing</hi> the <hi>old,</hi> but it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, therefore the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Lords,</hi> or <hi>Commons,</hi> or any two of thoſe bodies, have power to <hi>make</hi> a Law: The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is no leſſe, then between the <hi>having,</hi> and <hi>not having</hi> a known Law: The one imports the <hi>ſettlement</hi> of a knowne Law, and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves</hi> it, and the other introduceth an <hi>arbitrary government. For example,</hi> if the <hi>King</hi> hath <hi>power</hi> to make what Laws He thinkes fit, He may at pleaſure, <hi>bereave</hi> the Subject of life, and <hi>confiſcate</hi> their eſtates. But now having a <hi>knowne Law,</hi> and thereby prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in our perſons and eſtates, the King having a <hi>negative Voice</hi> to hinder the <hi>changing</hi> of that Law, there enſueth no ſuch <hi>evill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</hi> And the ſame holds with the members, the <hi>Lords</hi> Houſe, and the <hi>Commons</hi> Houſe, having each of them a <hi>negative Voice</hi> to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54815:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hinder the <hi>changing</hi> of the Law, or making a <hi>new</hi> Law, doth not leſſen the peoples <hi>protection</hi> of their perſons, nor alters the <hi>property</hi> of their eſtates; The knowne and ſetled Law ſtill preſerves both.</p>
               <p>But admit <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>both</hi> Houſes without the <hi>King,</hi> to make what Laws they pleaſe, it followeth, they have power to put to <hi>death</hi> whom, and for what <hi>cauſe</hi> they thinke fit, and for their <hi>owne uſe,</hi> to <hi>ſeiſe,</hi> and <hi>diſpoſe</hi> of their eſtates, <hi>their will</hi> is then the Law: So that to give this power to the <hi>King alone,</hi> or to <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>both</hi> Houſes without the <hi>King,</hi> the conſequence is <hi>equally evill.</hi> If the <hi>King</hi> have it, both <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Parliaments</hi> are <hi>deſtroyed;</hi> If the Members, <hi>Monarchy,</hi> the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> it ſelfe are <hi>totally aboliſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if the <hi>King</hi> by having this <hi>power</hi> of a <hi>negative</hi> Voice, be <hi>Judge</hi> in His <hi>owne cauſe,</hi> the Members having that authority, are ſo too. But that is a meere <hi>fiction,</hi> neither King, nor Members, by having a <hi>negatie Voice</hi> in Parliament are <hi>Judges</hi> in their own cauſe, but <hi>all,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>King,</hi> and the Houſes are <hi>jointly</hi> Judges, when it is fit to make a <hi>new</hi> Law, or change the <hi>old.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo long as they extend not <hi>beyond</hi> the power of a negative Voice, the Members of the two Houſes are <hi>perſons indifferent</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and the people; and ſo is the King, <hi>indifferent,</hi> between the Members and the people. <hi>For example,</hi> if the King propound a Law to take away the <hi>life</hi> of His ſubjects, to <hi>tax</hi> them with payments of money not warranted by the knowne Law, or otherwiſe to <hi>inlarge</hi> His <hi>Prerogative,</hi> the Members may <hi>aſſent</hi> thereunto, and ſo make it a Law, or <hi>refuſe</hi> it, and herein they are <hi>indifferent</hi> between King and people, for the <hi>benefit</hi> of thoſe Laws thus propounded, <hi>accrues</hi> not to them.</p>
               <p>And ſo it is, if <hi>either,</hi> or <hi>both Houſes</hi> propound a Law to the <hi>King,</hi> whereby they would aſſume to themſelves the <hi>abſolute</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Government, to put to <hi>death</hi> whom they pleaſe, to <hi>tax,</hi> or <hi>impoſe</hi> upon the people, to <hi>confiſcate</hi> their eſtates to their own uſe, the <hi>King</hi> is a perſon <hi>indifferent</hi> between the Members and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to Judge whether to paſſe it or not. But when the Members <hi>without the King</hi> aſſume power to make Laws, the diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and the people is ended, the buſineſſe is then <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and totally</hi> between the Members and the people: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54815:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by <hi>excluding</hi> the King from His negative Voice, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have made <hi>themſelves Judges</hi> in their owne caſe: By our wofull experience we now find there is none, either <hi>to umpire, or mediate,</hi> between the Members and the people; And ſo the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers by this have <hi>aſſumed an arbitrary power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor doth this power of a <hi>negative Voice</hi> in the King, take away, or leſſen the authority of any <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Juſtice;</hi> Every Court of <hi>Judicature,</hi> purſuing its Commiſſion, hath power to determine the <hi>intereſt,</hi> both of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>people,</hi> and that without <hi>aſſent</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Member:</hi> The <hi>knowne</hi> Law is their ground to judge by, not the <hi>opinion</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> or of <hi>either,</hi> or <hi>both</hi> Houſes.</p>
               <p>Nor can the King in this be ſaid to <hi>Judge out</hi> of his Courts, or <hi>against</hi> the two Houſes of Parliament, for the King and the two Houſes have herein <hi>equall</hi> power, that is, every one of them a <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Voice,</hi> they are all together <hi>joyntly Judge</hi> of that high Court of Parliament, but <hi>no one,</hi> or <hi>two</hi> of theſe bodies is Judge thereof: So that by the Kings, and either Houſes having a <hi>negative Voice,</hi> it cannot be ſaid they Judge each other, out of that, or any other Court of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſome object, that if the refuſall of the King ſhall hinder the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Laws, the Common-wealth is in danger to ſuffer, for (ſay they) the King may be refractory, and deny to paſſe good Laws.</hi>

end of the <hi>diſtraction.</hi> Upon the ſame <hi>ground</hi> that the Lords, and Commons in the caſe of the <hi>Militia</hi> (pretending a <hi>neceſſity,</hi> and that the King was <hi>refractory)</hi> aſſumed power to make Laws with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Him, the <hi>Lords Houſe</hi> may <hi>exclude</hi> both King and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, the Commons Houſe, Lords and King, or the King both Houſes.</p>
               <p>When there <hi>ariſeth</hi> a difference between the King, and the two Houſes, if it be of <hi>neceſſity</hi> that the King, or the two Houſes muſt <hi>ſo far</hi> Judge the buſineſſe, as to make a Law without the other, by the <hi>ſame reaſon,</hi> when a difference happens between the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, one of them muſt be Judge againſt the other, and make a Law without the others conſent, for ſuch a <hi>difference</hi> between the <hi>two</hi> Houſes, may as well happen to concerne the <hi>ſafety</hi> of the Kingdome, as when the difference fals out between the King and both Houſes: And if either Houſe obtaine the <hi>ſole</hi> power to make Laws, ſtill there is no <hi>period,</hi> for if <hi>reaſon,</hi> or <hi>reall neceſſity</hi> require it, and ſhould be Judge when, and what Laws are to be made, the <hi>leſſer number</hi> of one of thoſe Aſſemblies peradventure may be in the right; But whether right, or wrong, the <hi>zelots</hi> may chance to ſide with the <hi>little flock,</hi> riſe up, and in <hi>tumults</hi> call it Juſtice. And ſo conſequently the good Law of the Land deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>club-law</hi> introduced, and the very being of Parliaments taken away; whereas by <hi>obſerving</hi> the <hi>conſtitutions</hi> of the Realme, in ſubmitting this power of making Laws to the <hi>Judge</hi> thereof, that is, the King without the aſſent of the two Houſes, all theſe abſurdities and inconveniences are avoided.</p>
               <p>Which <hi>constitution</hi> being rightly underſtood, is grounded upon great reaſon, and is moſt <hi>equall</hi> between King and people; for the Commons Houſe upon juſt grounds (for any thing to them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears) may paſſe a Bill, which the Lords upon as juſt reaſons may <hi>reject,</hi> the Members of that Aſſembly being perſons, who for the moſt part have a greater &amp; deeper reach &amp; inſight in <hi>State affaires;</hi> And both Houſes may paſſe a Bill, <hi>conceiving</hi> it neceſſary for the <hi>preſervation</hi> of the Kingdome to have it made a Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon deſire the Kings conſent, which the King may as <hi>juſtly reject,</hi> And for ſuch reaſons (they may be matters of that nature) as not <hi>convenient,</hi> and <hi>moſt</hi> unfit to be imparted and revealed to ſuch a <hi>multitude</hi> as the <hi>ſeven hundred Members</hi> or more of both Houſes.

But when <hi>all,</hi> that is, when the King and the two Houſes <hi>concur,</hi> the Common-wealth may as <hi>ſafely</hi> depend upon it, as upon any <hi>humane inſtitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon theſe grounds it is, that when a <hi>diſpute</hi> happeneth concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the making of a Law, the King being of <hi>one opinion,</hi> the Lords of <hi>another,</hi> and the Commons of a <hi>third,</hi> or when any one of the three bodies <hi>diſſent</hi> from the other two, there is no <hi>umpire</hi> but themſelves to end that controverſie, nor can they decide the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion by any other way, but by a <hi>joint</hi> agreement, or <hi>quitting</hi> the diſpute, for untill a <hi>joint concurrence</hi> of all <hi>three,</hi> their proceedings are but <hi>conferences,</hi> and their <hi>reſults,</hi> what they would <hi>have</hi> to be Lawes, but <hi>no</hi> Laws <hi>indeed,</hi> untill by <hi>conſent of all three,</hi> they be <hi>reduced</hi> to Acts of Parliament. <hi>No Order, Ordinance,</hi> or what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it is, or ſhall be called, made by conſent <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>So in this caſe, by the <hi>conſtitutions</hi> of the Realme, no <hi>new</hi> Law can be made, or the <hi>old</hi> altered, without a <hi>joint</hi> concurrence of the King and the two Houſes. It is that <hi>united body,</hi> which at this day (as to the <hi>Legiſlative</hi> power) <hi>repreſent</hi> the whole Kingdome. The Members of the Commons Houſe <hi>alone,</hi> do not in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner repreſent the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Lords</hi> &amp; the <hi>Peers,</hi> and the King for Himſelf, but <hi>all together</hi> do <hi>repreſent</hi> the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, no one, or two of theſe bodies, can herein be ſaid to repreſent <hi>only</hi> any part; every common perſon doth herein, by the Laws of <hi>England, aſmuch</hi> depend upon the judgement of the King and the Lords, as upon the Members of the Commons Houſe. And ſo do the King and the Lords <hi>upon</hi> thoſe Members; for the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> (as now by conſent of former Kings it is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) are herewith <hi>joyntly</hi> truſted. As if three Lords <hi>authorize</hi> three ſeverall perſons to ſell their Lands, if <hi>two</hi> of them ſell, it binds not, therefore in judging that ſale void, no man is <hi>injured,</hi> the Lords are ſeized of their Lands as <hi>before,</hi> and the perſons truſted have the <hi>ſame</hi> power, that is, <hi>joyntly</hi> concurring to ſell, and by that ſale
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54815:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Lords are <hi>concluded,</hi> it is done by the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> of thoſe Lords, and therefore in Judgement of Law their owne Act.</p>
               <p>So for the <hi>Parliament,</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> by the conſtitutions of this Realme, are <hi>jointly truſted</hi> to conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the making <hi>new,</hi> or changing the <hi>old</hi> Law, therefore <hi>no leſſe then all</hi> have Commiſſion for it. And ſo if the King, and <hi>either</hi> Houſe, or <hi>both</hi> Houſes without the King, paſſe a Bill, or make a Law, this ought to be judged <hi>invalid,</hi> none are thereby wronged, ſtill the <hi>knowne Laws</hi> are in force, the people as <hi>before,</hi> by the knowne Law are <hi>protected</hi> in their perſons and eſtates, and thoſe truſted, that is, the King, the Lords, and Commons <hi>joyntly</hi> concurring, have power to make new Laws, which conſent <hi>concludes the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> it is done by its <hi>repreſentative</hi> body, and ſo by their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Thus it appears, that when there is a <hi>queſtion</hi> and <hi>diſpute</hi> in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> between the King and the two Houſes, it is <hi>not neceſſary</hi> to have it <hi>affirmatively</hi> determined, nor <hi>needfull</hi> that <hi>His Majeſty</hi> in ſuch caſes be <hi>Judge</hi> againſt the two Houſes, or the two Houſes to <hi>Judge</hi> it without Him; That is but a <hi>fiction</hi> of the Members, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by them to reduce the Nation unto their <hi>Tyranny;</hi> which as the Members knew they could not effect, but by <hi>excluding</hi> the King from His <hi>negative Voice</hi> in Parliament; ſo that being done, their worke was finiſhed. Then they without the King <hi>arrogate</hi> power to make new Laws, and change the old for their owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage as they pleaſed: And ſo both King and people <hi>inſlaved.</hi> Therefore herein to <hi>beguile</hi> the people, a caſe was <hi>faigned,</hi> and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thus, That ſuch a <hi>difference</hi> between the King and the two Houſes as concerned the <hi>ſafety</hi> of the Kingdome, was happened in Parliament: That unleſſe this queſtion were <hi>inſtantly</hi> determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Kingdome was in <hi>danger</hi> to <hi>periſh.</hi> Then to <hi>draw</hi> the people to ſide with the Members, they were told, that the Lords and Commons were the <hi>repreſentative</hi> body of the Kingdome. That whatever the Members in thoſe Aſſemblies do, it is ſo <hi>much</hi> the Act of every particular perſon in the Kingdome, as if he were within the <hi>wals</hi> of the Houſe <hi>perſonally</hi> conſenting: And perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>vulgar,</hi> that this diſpute between the King and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (in effect) is between Him and <hi>all</hi> the people of <hi>England.</hi> And then offer it to the conſideration of the <hi>multitude,</hi> whether it be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54815:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not more <hi>likely,</hi> that <hi>all</hi> the people of the Realme concurring in <hi>one</hi> opinion, ſhould better know what is for their <hi>owne</hi> good, then the <hi>King</hi> being but <hi>one</hi> ſingle perſon, and diſſenting in judgement from the <hi>whole</hi> Nation. The <hi>poor</hi> people not being of <hi>capacity</hi> ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to diſcerne the <hi>fallacy</hi> hereof: And being raviſhed with a conceipt to be <hi>Judge</hi> in their owne <hi>caſe,</hi> in <hi>ſmarmes</hi> flocked to this <hi>Idoll,</hi> (the Members) thinking they had thereby <hi>adored</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as well as that <hi>beaſt,</hi> and never ceaſed, untill by <hi>violence</hi> they expelled the <hi>King</hi> from His negative Voice in Parliament.</p>
               <p>But now, by wofull experience, they both underſtand by whom, and how, they are <hi>repreſented,</hi> which is thus. The <hi>Knights</hi> of Shires, <hi>Citizens,</hi> and <hi>Burgeſſes,</hi> being <hi>elected</hi> by the Inhabitants of the ſeverall Counties and Townes, do in ſome ſort <hi>repreſent</hi> the people who <hi>choſe</hi> them, but that is no further then their <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion</hi> extends; And they have no other Commiſſion then the <hi>Kings</hi> Writ of Summons; &amp; the returne thereof, <hi>word</hi> by <hi>word,</hi> ſet downe before, which gives them no other authority, then to <hi>conſent</hi> unto Laws agreed on by the <hi>King</hi> &amp; His <hi>great Councell, the Peeres,</hi> &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently they do <hi>repreſent</hi> the people no further then to <hi>conſent</hi> unto ſuch Laws. And for the <hi>Peeres,</hi> they have no Commiſſion at all from the people, nor can be ſaid to <hi>repreſent</hi> them, their authority is <hi>ſolely</hi> from the <hi>Kings</hi> ſaid Writ of Summons, directed to every particular Lord, by which likewiſe his power is <hi>declared</hi> and <hi>ſtinted</hi> That is, to <hi>adviſe</hi> with the <hi>King</hi> concerning the affaires of the Realme. So that the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> put together, they have no Commiſſion to make Laws, we are ſtill to ſeeke that <hi>Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> power, nor is it to be found, but in the <hi>King,</hi> He <hi>alone</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the Law-maker. But the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England</hi> (as before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears) having excluded themſelves to make Laws without conſent of the two Houſes; Therefore that <hi>united</hi> body, the <hi>King</hi> and the Members of thoſe Aſſemblies is called the <hi>Legiſlative power,</hi> and the <hi>repreſentative</hi> body of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But that <hi>either,</hi> or <hi>both</hi> Houſes, or <hi>any</hi> Aſſembly, or people in this or any other Nation governed by <hi>Monarchy,</hi> hath, or ever claimed to have a <hi>Legiſlative</hi> power, or <hi>ſofar</hi> to repreſent the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> as to make new Laws, or change the old, without the <hi>Perſonall</hi> conſent of the <hi>King</hi> is ſuch a <hi>ridiculaus Bull,</hi> as never was heard, or thought of untill this <hi>frantick Parliament:</hi> Therefore,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54815:23"/>
when <hi>either,</hi> or <hi>both</hi> Houſes without the <hi>King,</hi> take upon them to make Laws, they <hi>extend</hi> beyond the bounds of their Commiſſion, they thereby act of their owne head, not as <hi>repreſentatives. For example,</hi> a Lord by Commiſſion gives power to <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> to let, and ſet his Land for tearme of years, ſo long as <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> purſue this authority, they do <hi>repreſent</hi> that Lord: but if by <hi>colour</hi> of that Commſſion, <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> demiſe for life, or ſell the Inheritance, it is done without authority, their Commiſſion reacheth not ſo far, and ſo not repreſentatives. Therefore <hi>ſuch</hi> leaſe or ſale is void, it doth <hi>not</hi> bind the Lord.</p>
               <p>Or thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> (having contracted with <hi>B.</hi> to make <hi>A.</hi> feoffement unto him and his heirs of the Mannour of <hi>D.</hi> upon a condition) by letter of Atturney gives power to <hi>C.</hi> to make livery and ſeiſin upon that Condition: <hi>C.</hi> performes it. In this caſe, the Land is as firmely ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>B.</hi> as if <hi>A.</hi> had executed it in his owne perſon, becauſe it is done by his repreſentative: But if <hi>C.</hi> (omitting to expreſs the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) make livery and ſeiſin, abſolutely nothing paſſeth to <hi>B.</hi> for ſaith our Law, <hi>C.</hi> extending the bounds of his Commiſſion, he doth not repreſent <hi>A.</hi> Therefore his whole act void.</p>
               <p>So here, the <hi>Lords,</hi> as before appears, have Commiſſion to <hi>adviſe</hi> with the <hi>King;</hi> the Commons to <hi>do</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> unto things agreed on by the <hi>King</hi> and them.

reaſon holds <hi>via verſa,</hi> if the <hi>Kings</hi> deniall to make a Law, hinder not the force of it, the abſolute power is in the Members.

               <p>The Members judged it neceſſary for the <hi>preſervatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>And the Members by excluding the <hi>King</hi> from His <hi>negative Voice,</hi> having got poſſeſſion of the <hi>wealth</hi> of the whole Nation, and <hi>dominion</hi> over the people, having thereby <hi>wrested</hi> from the <hi>King</hi> the <hi>Sword,</hi> His <hi>Scepter,</hi> and <hi>Soveraignty</hi> it ſelfe; no doubt but the ſame <hi>neceſſity</hi> pretended by them at firſt to incroach this power, will be ſtill alleadged by them to make their <hi>uſurped</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <hi>laſting;</hi> which accordingly we find, the Members have (as much as in them lie) made their raigne <hi>perpetuall:</hi> They tell us firſt in generall, <hi>that in all matters either concerning Church or State,</hi>

               <p>Then they proceed to particulars, and begin with the <hi>Militia</hi>

of the Realme, which they judge <hi>uſeteſſe,</hi> and as a thing <hi>lying dead,</hi> whilſt it is in the power of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England. For</hi> ſay the <note place="margin">

Therefore the power of the Militia, ſay they, inables Him not to do the Kingdome any effectuall ſervice.</hi> But thoſe Members having <hi>arrogated</hi> a power without the <hi>King,</hi> to impoſe upon the people without ſtint, they do <hi>therefore</hi> judge the <hi>Militia</hi> to be their owne. And I confeſſe they are in ſome ſort <hi>neceſſitated</hi> thereunto, for both we and they ſee, that otherwiſe then by <hi>troopes</hi> of Horſe, and <hi>bands</hi> of <hi>Soldiers,</hi> it is <hi>impoſſible</hi> to leavy upon the Subject, thoſe <hi>illegall</hi> burthens by the Members laid upon them.</p>
               <p>So that it is now come to paſſe, that our greateſt <hi>happineſſe</hi> is made the foundation of our greateſt <hi>miſery,</hi> becauſe the <hi>King</hi> governs us by a knowne Law, theſe Members tell us, we muſt not be governed by a <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Kings justneſſe</hi> to His people, hath furniſhed theſe <hi>Tyrants</hi> with arguments to <hi>diſ-throne</hi> Him. By the government under the <hi>King,</hi> and that authority claimed by Him, the people have ſuch <hi>protection</hi> of their perſons, and <hi>property</hi> in their Lands and goods, as that (otherwiſe then the known Law declared by the ſworne Judges of the Realme doth warrant) the <hi>King</hi> cannot moleſt them in either, therefore ſay the <hi>Members,</hi> He ought not to have the power of the ſword. But on the other ſide, the Members having <hi>uſurped</hi> an <hi>arbitrary</hi> and <hi>tyrannicall</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over the perſons, lives, eſtates and fortunes both of <hi>King</hi> and people, therefore the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom, ſay they, belongs to them, ſo that upon the matter, <hi>better</hi> it had been, both for King and people, if the <hi>King</hi> had <hi>aſſumed</hi> the <hi>Turkiſh tyranny,</hi> for then the <hi>King</hi> (even by the Members owne argument) had kept His Crown, nor had the Subject been in ſo great a <hi>ſlavery</hi> as now, we had then been ſubject only to <hi>one tyrant,</hi> but by this doctrine we are vaſſals to <hi>ſeven hundred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Members have already (beſides the whole Revenue of the Crowne, which they have <hi>barbarouſly</hi> wreſted from the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Queen,</hi> and the <hi>Royall Progeny)</hi> taxed upon the people by way of <hi>Exciſe, Aſſeſments,</hi> and ſuch like, new impoſitions, before this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament never known nor heard of in <hi>England,</hi> above 3000000. l. <hi>per annum</hi> for their owne ſetled Revenue, yet all this ſerves not

               <head>CHAP. IV., <hi>That the King, the Lords Houſe and the Commons Houſe, concurring, have not an unlimited power to make Laws, it being in the breſt of the Judges of the Realme, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine which Acts of Parliament are binding, and, which void, and to expound the meaning of every Act.</hi>

               <p>IT may ſeeme <hi>ſtrange</hi> to ſome, that the <hi>high Court</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould be <hi>limited</hi> in their power, and deny to <hi>expound</hi> their own Laws. But upon conſideration had of the <hi>uſe</hi> of a Parliament, and of the <hi>grounds</hi> of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> it appears to be both <hi>juſt</hi> and conſonant to the <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of this Realme.</p>
               <p>The <hi>People</hi> of this Nation are <hi>not governed by a Parliament, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty</hi>

is the Kings, yet the King Himſelfe hath <hi>not</hi> an <hi>abſolute</hi> or an <hi>unlimited</hi> power over the people; For as the people are governed <hi>by</hi> and under Him, ſo the Law directs <hi>how</hi> He is to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne them: But in this Nation (as in every Common-wealth go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by a ſetled Law) occaſions oft happen, to do ſuch things as the rules of that Law cannot warrant: Therefore <hi>neceſſary</hi> it is, to have a power to <hi>ſupply</hi> thoſe <hi>defects,</hi> and that is the <hi>office,</hi> and true <hi>uſe</hi> of a Parliament; Which authority rightly conſidered, is of ſuch <hi>concernment</hi> to the Common-wealth, as that the <hi>greateſt</hi> care in the world ought to be had, who are truſted therewith. It is no leſſe then a power to <hi>change</hi> that Law, whereby the people have <hi>protection</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>fortune,</hi> and therefore may <hi>require</hi> the conſent of ſuch perſons, as are not rightly <hi>qualified</hi> to judge which Laws are <hi>binding,</hi> and which <hi>void,</hi> or to <hi>expound</hi> the meaning thereof. Upon that ground it is, that by the conſtitution of this Realme, no <hi>new</hi> Law can be made, or the <hi>old</hi> changed, but by the King, with the <hi>aſſent</hi> of the two Houſes of Parliament. Thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (as before appears) are proper to judge when ſuch things have happened, as may require the making of a <hi>new</hi> Law, or to alter the <hi>old:</hi> But without <hi>derogation</hi> from the honour of thoſe perſons, That body is not of a <hi>mould</hi> fit to judge, which Statutes are binding, which void, or to expound the meaning of an Act.</p>
               <p>Firſt, cleere it is, Acts of Parliament may be ſo <hi>penned,</hi> and <hi>containe</hi> ſuch matter, as <hi>ought</hi> not to binde either <hi>King</hi> or people. Suppoſe it enacted, that from henceforth, the <hi>Members</hi> of the two Houſes ſhall be <hi>exempt</hi> from puniſhment for <hi>Treaſon, Murder, Felony,</hi> and other <hi>Crimes:</hi> Or that the <hi>King</hi> and the two Houſes, from <hi>time</hi> to <hi>time</hi> ſhall conſent to make ſuch Laws, as a <hi>cloſe Committee,</hi> or certaine perſons by name ſhall conclude upon, or that every Act of Parliament afterwards made ſhall be void, and the like, no man can conceive ſuch Acts would be <hi>binding,</hi> for thereby the true <hi>uſe</hi> of Parliaments, the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>government</hi> were <hi>destroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, all men grant, that an <hi>arbitrary</hi> power is abſolutely <hi>deſtructive</hi> to the people. And it appears in the next precedent Chapter, that to give this <hi>unlimited</hi> authority of making Laws to the King <hi>alone,</hi> or to <hi>either,</hi> or <hi>both</hi> Houſes without the King, were no other then to bring upon the people that <hi>thraldome:</hi> Now for this boundleſſe power to be in the King and the two
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54815:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Houſes <hi>joyntly,</hi> although that were nothing ſo bad as to have it in the King <hi>alone,</hi> or in <hi>either,</hi> or <hi>both</hi> Houſes without the King, yet the people were not thereby ſo wel ſecured from the <hi>tyranny</hi> of an <hi>arbitrary</hi> power, as when the Judges determine which Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lliament are binding, and which void.</p>
               <p>Upon peruſall of former Statutes, it appears the Members of both Houſes have been <hi>frequently</hi> drawne to conſent, not onely to things <hi>prejudiciall</hi> to the Common-wealth, but (even in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of greateſt waight) to <hi>alter</hi> and <hi>contradict</hi> what formerly themſelves had <hi>agreed</hi> unto, and that even as it happened to pleaſe the <hi>fancy</hi> of the preſent <hi>Prince,</hi> witneſſe that Statute by which it was enacted that the <hi>Proclamations of King</hi> H. 8. <note n="a" place="margin">31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 8.</note>

               <p>And now, <hi>reflecting</hi> upon the <hi>proceedings</hi> of the preſent Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, we finde they have <hi>de facto</hi> arrogated unto themſelves (in the higheſt ſtraine) a power <hi>arbitrary;</hi> It is likewiſe too evident with what <hi>terrors, menaces,</hi> and <hi>inhumane</hi> cruelties, they preſſe their <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne</hi>

               <p>And being thus brought into <hi>miſery,</hi> that which is ſtill <hi>worſe,</hi> our ſelves and poſterity to the <hi>end</hi> of the world, are likely to live under this <hi>vaſſallage</hi> without hope of <hi>redemption,</hi> if not by <hi>Gods mercy</hi> timely remedied.

               </p>
               <p>Now if I appeale to any rationall man <hi>(not prejudicated</hi> as a perſon herein particularly concerned) whether that Law which <hi>declares</hi> ſuch Acts of Parliament to <hi>binde,</hi> or that which <hi>judgeth</hi> them <hi>void</hi> be the more <hi>prudent, wholeſome,</hi> and <hi>reaſonable Law:</hi> I dare be <hi>bold</hi> to conclude, that ſentence herein will be given for the <hi>latter.</hi> And ſince it followeth that ſome Acts of Parliament may, and ought to be adjudged void, that being granted, reaſon dictates to every man of ſenſe, that <hi>not</hi> the Members, but ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>knowne</hi> perſons muſt determine which Statutes bind the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and which are invalid.</p>

It is reſolved by the Judges of the Realme, that divers prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives are ſo <hi>inſeperably</hi> annexed to the Crowne, as that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>ſevered</hi> by Act of Parliament; <hi>for example,</hi> by a Statute made 23 <hi>H.</hi> 6. c. 10. it is enacted that no man ſhall continue <hi>Sheriffe</hi> of a Shire above <hi>one year,</hi> and by that Act declared in <note place="margin">23 <hi>H.</hi> 6. c. 10.</note> theſe words, that <hi>all Patents</hi> from the King of that office of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe for <hi>yeers,</hi> for <hi>life,</hi> in <hi>taile,</hi> or in <hi>fee</hi> ſhall be void, any clauſe or words of <hi>non obſtante</hi> put into ſuch Patents notwithſtanding.

by the foreſaid caſe of the Sheriff, for though by that Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 6. it is inacted that <hi>all Patents</hi> of the King ſhall be void as before, although with a <hi>non obstante,</hi> yet the Judges at <hi>all times</hi> have reſolved it, as a thing without diſpute: That thoſe Patents (although expreſſely againſt the words and intent of that Act) with a <hi>non obſtante</hi> are <hi>good</hi> in Law.

               <p>And the ſame it is when the Law is only <hi>declared</hi> by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. If the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>two Houſes</hi> declare, that it is not by the Common Law of <hi>England, Treaſon</hi> to <hi>kill,</hi> or to <hi>attempt</hi> to kill the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Queen,</hi> or <hi>Prince,</hi> or that it is not felony to <hi>ſteale,</hi> or the like, ſuch declarations are of no effect, they ought not, they do not, they cannot conclude the Judges.</p>
               <p>And as every <hi>Statute</hi> may be judged by them whether it be <hi>binding</hi> or <hi>void,</hi> ſo the meaning of the words thereof muſt be by the Judges <hi>expounded</hi> too.

               <p>Beſides, the Parliament cannot be the <hi>finall</hi> expounders of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes for theſe reaſons. 1. It appears before that it is not the <hi>bare letter,</hi> but the <hi>true ſence</hi> and meaning of the words, which is the Law. And the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>two Houſes</hi> cannot declare the meaning of thoſe words, but by Act of Parliament, they cannot (ſaith our Law) <hi>otherwiſe ſpeake,</hi> what ever they <hi>Act,</hi> or <hi>doe,</hi> in any other way, is <hi>extrajudiciall:</hi> if the King and both Houſes <hi>unanimouſly</hi> deliver an opinion, (without reducing it to an Act of Parliament) concerning the meaning of a former Statute, it is of no more nor greater <hi>force,</hi> or <hi>effect,</hi> then for the Judges of a Court of <hi>judicature,</hi> to give their opinions in a point of Law, in a caſe not <hi>judicially</hi> depending before them, ſuch an opinion binds not, nor is pleadable in a Court of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>And beſides <hi>the abſurd inconvenience,</hi> and the <hi>impoſſibility</hi> to have an Act of Parliament to determine every queſtion ariſing upon Statutes, it may ſo happen, as that the King and the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes can never give an end to one controverſie: <hi>For example,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an Act be made to <hi>explaine</hi> the meaning of former Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <hi>ambiguouſly</hi> penned, the words of this Act muſt have a <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> too, and may admit of <hi>ſeverall interpretations</hi> as well as the former Act did, and ſeverall perſons as they are therein concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, may differ in the expoſition thereof, and ſo <hi>irreconcileable</hi> as not to be ended without the authority of a Judge, and this may
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54815:29"/>
fall out upon every Act of <hi>explanation</hi> upon explanation <hi>in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> and conſequently by that way there cannot to the <hi>end of the world</hi> be a finall determination of the difference.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>validity</hi> of every Statute, and the <hi>expoſition</hi> thereof, at the will of every perſon concerned, may <hi>regularly</hi> be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judges of the Law, but cannot <hi>judicially</hi> depend before the Parliament. <hi>For example,</hi> every Statute is <hi>binding,</hi> or <hi>void;</hi> if binding, it concerns the Subject in his <hi>perſon</hi> or <hi>eſtate,</hi> and when it is put in execution, the miniſters, or actors therein, may (at the will of him interrupted thereby) be ſued in the <hi>Court of Common Pleas,</hi> or in ſome other Court of Juſtice, by an action of treſpaſſe, by which ſuite what ever the Act of Parliament is, both the <hi>vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi> of the Statute, and the <hi>meaning</hi> of the words thereof, is <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi> to the Judges of that Court, and to their judgement; As ſuppoſe this caſe to ariſe upon the foreſaid Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 6. that one who hath continued Sheriff above one year by vertue of a Writ directed to the Sheriff of the ſame County, doth arreſt the body of <hi>A.</hi> who for this brings his action of treſpaſſe in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pleas,</hi> in which the <hi>Sheriff</hi> juſtifies by vertue of the Writ, <hi>A. replies,</hi> pleads the Statute, and ſhewes, that the year was ended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the arreſt, upon which the Sheriff <hi>demurs</hi> in Law; by theſe pleadings the whole <hi>fact</hi> is confeſſed on both ſides, the Sheriff doth <hi>acknowledge</hi> his year was out before the arreſt, and <hi>A. confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth</hi> the arreſt was by vertue of the Kings Writ directed to the Sheriff, and ſo the queſtion being <hi>matter of Law,</hi> it is to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Judges of that Court, wherein the <hi>ſole doubt</hi> is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Statute be <hi>binding,</hi> or <hi>void:</hi> for if binding, judgement <hi>ought</hi> to be given for the plaintife <hi>A.</hi> becauſe the Statute being good, the defendant was not Sheriff after his year ended when he made the arreſt, and ſo had no authority; if void, it ought to be given for the Sheriff, for then the Law is not by it <hi>altered,</hi> and ſo he was Sheriff at the time of the arreſt, although his year was out.</p>
               <p>Now in this caſe no man can deny, but that the Judges muſt give judgement, elſe the Court of Common Pleas (which were abſurd to imagine) hath not power to determine an action of treſpaſſe, and judgement being given (as in this caſe it ought to be) for the Sheriff (becauſe it is already <hi>reſolved</hi> and <hi>received</hi> for

a <hi>knowne truth</hi> that the foreſaid Statute binds not the King, this duty of the Subject to ſerve the King in perſon (ſaith the booke) <note n="a" place="margin">

And contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if by Act of Parliament it were enacted that all <hi>Pardons for fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony</hi> to be granted by the King, ſhould be judged void, after which a ſubject commits <hi>felony,</hi> obtaines the <hi>Kings pardon</hi> for it, is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned at the bar, and pleads <hi>this pardon,</hi> it ought to be allowed being duely pleaded, and the Juſtices in ſuch caſe <hi>ought</hi> not to condemne but to acquit the priſoner: And theſe judgements (as to any appeale to the Parliament) are <hi>finall;</hi> they cannot be brought before the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>two Houſes</hi> by any ſuite, or action at Law: They cannot <hi>judicially</hi> determine any thing but by Act of Parliament; And if they ſhall in this caſe make a <hi>new Statute,</hi> that Law muſt (even by the ſame Judges) be <hi>expounded</hi> too.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Parliament</hi> is a body ſo <hi>compoſed,</hi> as that it is not onely <hi>improper,</hi> but almoſt <hi>impoſſible</hi> for theſe perſons <hi>finally</hi> to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any one point of Law: A Court of <hi>Judicature</hi> ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of <hi>one entire body,</hi> and of ſuch a body, as at <hi>all times</hi> hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, not onely to deliver its owne opinion, but by that <hi>ſentence</hi> to decide the queſtion depending before them, but the <hi>Parliament</hi> is not ſo compoſed: The Members of that Aſſembly are divided into <hi>three ſeverall bodies,</hi> and their proceedings <hi>ſeverall</hi> and <hi>diſtinct:</hi> and obvious it is, that in one and the ſame thing they <hi>frequently</hi> conclude <hi>oppoſite</hi> each to other, yet untill all three <hi>concur,</hi> it binds not. And ſo though every Member of thoſe bodies hath given his ſentence according to his owne <hi>conſcience,</hi> yet the queſtion is not decided, and that which is worſe, peradventure never can be brought to a <hi>period,</hi> for it may fall out theſe three bodies of the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Lords</hi> Houſe, and the <hi>Commons,</hi> may in that <hi>perpetually</hi> differ in opinion.</p>
               <p>Theſe things conſidered, every rationall man muſt conclude, that the Parliament is not of a <hi>Compoſure</hi> fit for this worke, nor
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54815:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>inſtituted</hi> for that purpoſe: Thoſe things (as afterwards in its proper place is more fully ſhewed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) are the <hi>office</hi> of the Judges of the Realme.</p>
               <p>By this it appears, that when the <hi>two</hi> Houſes have paſſed a Bill for an <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament, and to it the Kings <hi>Royall Aſſent</hi> is had, the Parliaments power <hi>ends,</hi> and then <hi>begins</hi> the <hi>authority</hi> of the Judges of the Realme, whoſe office is (the caſe being <hi>regularly</hi> brought before them) firſt to judge, whether the Act it ſelfe be <hi>good,</hi> and if <hi>binding,</hi> then to declare the <hi>meaning</hi> of the words thereof. And ſo the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of having a power upon <hi>emergent</hi> occaſions to make new Laws is ſupplied, and yet the <hi>fundamentall</hi> grounds of the Law, by this limitation of the power of the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,</hi> with reference to the Judges to determine which Acts of Parliament are binding, and which void, is <hi>preſerved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter cleere it is, The <hi>Parliament</hi> it ſelfe, (that is, the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons)</hi> although <hi>unanimouſly</hi> conſenting, are <hi>not boundleſſe,</hi> the Judges of the Realme by the <note place="margin">

               <p>Thus whilſt every <hi>perſon, Court,</hi> and <hi>Aſſembly</hi> keep within its owne bounds, the <hi>knowne Law</hi> protecteth every man in his juſt rights; the <hi>Subject,</hi> whilſt that is obſerved, need not doubt <hi>prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of his perſon, and may <hi>ſecurely</hi> challenge a property in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. But the Members do now <hi>teach,</hi> or (to ſpeake more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly) <hi>force</hi> upon the people another doctrine: They without the King not onely <hi>aſſume</hi> the power of a Court of Judicature, and that without any <hi>appeale</hi> from it, but an authority and power to <note place="margin">Declaration 2 <hi>Nov.</hi> 1642.</note> 
                  <hi>make</hi> and <hi>declare</hi> the Law, and that boundleſſe too, whereby Law it ſelfe is totally deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>It is a <hi>Maxime</hi> in Law, that every <hi>diſſeiſor</hi> of Land is ſeiſed in fee ſimple, and that no man can give a <hi>particular</hi> eſtate by wrong; <hi>for example: A.</hi> Tenant for years, <hi>remainder</hi> to <hi>B.</hi> for life, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder</hi> to <hi>C.</hi> in taile, <hi>remainder</hi> to <hi>D.</hi> in fee, <hi>E.</hi> outs <hi>A.</hi> from his poſſeſſion, <hi>E.</hi> doth not hereby get the eſtate for <hi>years,</hi> but by that entry hath <hi>diſplaced</hi> all the <hi>remainders,</hi> and (untill re-entry by <hi>A.)</hi> is wrongfully ſeiſed to him and his heires: Like unto this was that of the Members: They <hi>injuriouſly</hi> excluded the King from his

               <p>It appears before, that no <hi>Court, Aſſembly,</hi> or <hi>Perſon,</hi> hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to determine any matter of Law, but by <hi>Grant</hi> from the <hi>King,</hi> by <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament, or by <hi>preſcription:</hi> Even ſo it is for the <hi>power, extent,</hi> and <hi>juriſdiction</hi> of any ſuch <hi>Court, perſon,</hi> or <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly;</hi> For, as no man can have any authority but by Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſo none can claime <hi>greater,</hi> or other power then is thereby granted: <hi>For example,</hi> If the Court be erected by the <hi>Kings</hi>

               <p>And this rule <hi>holds</hi> with all other <hi>Courts, Aſſemblies,</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> when they act, or doe ſuch things as they have <note n="b" place="margin">

               <p>The <hi>Judges</hi> of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> are as learned in the Law, and as able for their <hi>knowledge</hi> to determine Pleas of the Crowne as the <hi>Judges</hi> of the <hi>Kings bench,</hi> but they have not the ſame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The Court of Common Pleas hath not uſed it, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it is out of their Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>And that no Court ought to <hi>extend its owne bounds,</hi> is made good by reaſon; For if any <hi>Perſon, Court,</hi> or <hi>Aſſembly</hi> takes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, in any one thing, to execute that which their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion extends not to, by the <hi>ſame</hi> reaſon, they may <hi>aſſume</hi> it in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and ſo <hi>in infinitum,</hi> upon which it followeth, that the power of that <hi>Court, Perſon,</hi> or <hi>Aſſembly</hi> is become <hi>boundleſſe:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In the next place it is conſiderable to know, what Commiſſion the <hi>Parliament,</hi> the <hi>two Houſes,</hi> or either of them, hath therein.</p>
               <p>And firſt for the <hi>Commons houſe:</hi> That Aſſembly hath no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the King, nor by Act of Parliament <hi>to Judge the Law;</hi> and for <hi>Preſcription,</hi> they faile in all the foreſaid three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: for, they cannot challenge any thing time out of mind: The <hi>Aſſembly</hi> it ſelf had its beginning after the Raign of K. <hi>Ric.</hi> 1.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, admit them to have been time out of mind, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to have uſed the power of Judicature, yet it ought to be diſallowed, becauſe not <hi>reaſonable:</hi> it is <hi>repugnant</hi> to the Rules of Law and juſtice, that perſons <hi>not fitly qualified</hi> ſhould have power of Judicature.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>conſtitutions</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> controverſies are decided thus, The Plaintif exhibits his <hi>complaint</hi> in a Court of Juſtice, and that <note n="e" place="margin">Stat. 37 E. 3. cap. 15.</note> in the <hi>Latin tongue.</hi> The Defendant anſwereth in the ſame <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Language,</hi> out of which <hi>pleading</hi> the caſe <hi>ariſeth;</hi> which ſometimes is <hi>queſtio facti,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>queſtio Juris:</hi> If it be <hi>facti,</hi> it is tried by a <hi>Jury ſworn</hi> by authority of that Court where the ſuit depends, and that cannot be the Members of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons houſe, for (beſides the difficulty of the Language) thoſe Members <hi>cannot give an Oath;</hi> and if it be matter of law, the <hi>ſworne Judge</hi> is to determine it; but they are not ſworn to doe juſtice.</p>
               <p>And for the <hi>Lords houſe</hi> it is granted, that in ſome things, which <hi>cuſtome</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> hath made good, the Members of that Aſſembly have power of <hi>Judicature;</hi> for, although that Houſe, (as now it is formed and ſetled) hath not been ſo auntient as to make a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,</hi> yet the <hi>Prelats,</hi> the <hi>Peers,</hi> and the <hi>Judges</hi> time out of mind, have been frequently called together by the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and conſulted with concerning <hi>making of Laws,</hi> and other the affaires of the Common-wealth.

the Lords <hi>(depending therein on the advice of the Judges)</hi> have ſo auntiently, as the beginning thereof cannot be made appear, by <hi>licerſe</hi> of the King, upon <hi>Writs of Error,</hi> reverſed erronious <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> given in the <hi>Kings bench:</hi> But as the <hi>Lords</hi> have this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by <hi>Preſcription,</hi> ſo they are <hi>excluded</hi> from all other power of judicature, but that which <hi>cuſtome</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> doth warrant; for, <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,</hi> is all the Commiſſion they have. Neither Grant from the King, nor Act of Parliament they have for a Court of juſtice.</p>
               <p>Now to give power to the <hi>Lords houſe,</hi> or to the <hi>Commons houſe,</hi> to inlarge their <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> or <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> the ſame incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences would thereupon enſue, as by ſuffering other Courts to doe the like; if the Members of the <hi>Commons houſe,</hi> ſhould at this day, take upon them to <hi>give an Oath,</hi> and this <hi>legally</hi> intitle them to it, by the ſame reaſon they might, (as now the preſent Members of that Aſſembly in effect doth) without King, or Lords, aſſume the whole Government.</p>
               <p>And for the <hi>two Houſes jointly,</hi> they are not a Court of judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; they have therein <hi>no</hi> Commiſſion at all, neither from the <hi>King,</hi> nor by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> nor by <hi>Preſcription.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that is, <hi>the King and the two Houſes,</hi> that body cannot properly be ſaid <hi>a Court of Juſtice.</hi> The <hi>Office</hi> of a Judge is, upon a Queſtion depending before him, to <hi>declare</hi> what the Law is; but the <hi>office</hi> of the Parliament, is <hi>only</hi> to make <hi>new</hi> laws.</p>
               <p>By this it appears, that neither the Members of the Lords houſe, nor of the Commons houſe are <hi>qualified</hi> to be Judges of the Law, nor have they either <hi>jointly,</hi> or <hi>ſeverally</hi> Commiſſion for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, admit <hi>every</hi> Member of either houſe in <hi>Learning ſufficiently qualified</hi> to make a Judge, their <hi>compoſure</hi> conſidered, they are not capable <hi>jointly</hi> to perform that Office; they being two diſtinct bodies, their proceedings <hi>ſeverall</hi> and <hi>diſtinct,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expected, but they ſhall <hi>frequently</hi> differ in Opinion and judgment: therefore were they <hi>never</hi> ſo learned, ſhould the King grant unto them power of <hi>judicature,</hi> or ſhould they have that <hi>authority</hi> given them by an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> would judge both that Grant and Statute abſolutely void <note n="e" place="margin">

               <p>Yet herein, I doe not <hi>abridge</hi> the power and authority of the <hi>Peers of the Realme.</hi> It is true, when the King hath conſtituted a <hi>Lord high Steward,</hi> and conſented to the triall of a Peere for his life, for a fact committed againſt the known Law, ſuch a Peere not only may, but ought (the Lords obſerving the rules of law) to be tried by the Lords his Peers. But there is no <hi>colour</hi> for the <hi>Lords,</hi> or for the <hi>Commons,</hi> or for both <hi>Houſes</hi> jointly, although the King ſhould give way thereunto, <hi>to try,</hi> or <hi>judge any Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</hi> Every common perſon ought to be tried by his <hi>Peers too,</hi> that is, by a <hi>Jury</hi> of the Commons, and that Iury by the Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> ought to be of <hi>that County,</hi> and <hi>neare</hi> that place, where the <hi>fact</hi> is committed. It is a Rule in our Law, that in capitall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi quis delinquit, ibi punietur:</hi> perſons dwelling near the place, are moſt likely to have cognizance of the fact. Beſides, by our law, every <hi>free-born Subject</hi> of this Nation, hath at his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment, power and liberty to challenge Iurors impannelled for his triall: But all ſuch liberties are taken away by this uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Members.</p>
               <p>Thus it appears, that the Judges of every Court of Juſtice, ſo far as their Commiſſion extends, and no other perſons, are Judges of Law. But the Judges of <hi>no one Court,</hi> are thoſe unto whom the people are bound <hi>lastly</hi> to ſubmit themſelves, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Court of Juſtice in ſome reſpect is <hi>inferiour</hi> to another Court or power unto which appeales lie, as in the caſe of a Writ of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and the like, unleſſe it be in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber</hi> when the cauſe regularly depends before the Judges of the <hi>Kings Bench, the</hi>

                  <hi>ſentence</hi> and judgement of the <hi>Judges</hi> of the Realme: yet from that judgement ſome perſons are of opinion, a Writ of errour lieth before the Lords in the <hi>upper Houſe</hi> of Parliament.</p>
               <p>But upon conſideration had of the reaſon of the Law concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the proceedings in Writs of error brought there: I conceive it were to little purpoſe to permit any ſuch appeale unto the Lords upon judgements given in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber</hi> before all the Judges of the Realme.</p>
               <p>The power of the Lords Houſe to reverſe erronious judgements, I conceive began thus; The Court of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> is the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> Court of <hi>Judicature,</hi> wherein any ſuite of Law can <hi>legally</hi> and regularly be brought; and therefore their proceedings not to be examined by any other <hi>ordinary</hi> Court of Juſtice, every one of them being <hi>inferiour</hi> to it: But the <hi>Judges</hi> of the Kings Bench, are as ſubject to <hi>erre</hi> as the <hi>Judges</hi> of other Courts; Therefore as requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to have their proceedings examined.</p>
               <p>Now in regard the <hi>Judges</hi> of the Realme were at all times, <hi>at leaſt</hi> aſſiſtant to the Lords Houſe, it was <hi>proper enough</hi> to have the errors of the Kings Bench <hi>reverſed</hi> in that place: And having had its beginning thus, <hi>conſtant uſe</hi> and cuſtome hath Legally inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled them unto it: Therefore, although peradventure it may have happened, that ſome <hi>few</hi> particular Writs of errour, have been brought in the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> upon judgements given in ſome other Courts, I conceive the <hi>preſcription</hi> (which is all the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they have) lieth <hi>only</hi> for the Kings Bench. And I am the more confirmed therein, becauſe the Law bookes mentioning the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Lords Houſe, in reverſing judgements, do general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtance in the Kings Bench, not naming other Courts. Beſides, as the Lords Houſe hath this <hi>juriſdiction</hi> by <hi>preſcription,</hi> the ſame uſe and cuſtome requires theſe circumſtances. 1. That the <hi>Kings conſent</hi> to proſecute a Writ of error be obtained; becauſe every judgement in the Kings Bench, doth <hi>immediately</hi> concerne the King, the juriſdiction of that Court being properly Pleas of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54815:35"/>
Crowne. 2. That the Lords after the cauſe is brought before them, proceed by the <hi>advice</hi> of the Judges, which is indeed the <hi>eſſentiall</hi> part of the <hi>preſcription:</hi> To have a <hi>profeſſion</hi> of Law, Courts of judicature erected, perſons learned in that profeſſion appointed Judges thereof, it were moſt <hi>prepoſterous</hi> to have the proceedings of theſe Judges <hi>(even in the moſt difficult points of the Law) exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, reverſed,</hi> and <hi>controlled,</hi> by perſons ignorant in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
               <p>By the conſtitutions of <hi>England,</hi> no man is <hi>capable</hi> to be a <hi>Judge,</hi> unleſſe he have <hi>underſtanding</hi> in the Law to performe that office. Therefore ſhall the King grant to one who is moſt learned, a <hi>Judges</hi> place to <hi>him,</hi> and his <hi>heires,</hi> as to his heires it were <hi>void,</hi> and the ſame it were, if ſuch a grant were made by <hi>Act of Parliament:</hi> And ſo conſequently if the <hi>Lords</hi> ſhould <hi>preſcribe</hi> that time out of mind, they, and their <hi>predeceſſours,</hi> Lords of the Parliament, in Parliament time, have (without mentioning it to be with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe and aſſiſtance of the Judges) <hi>reverſed</hi> erronious Iudgements given in the Kings Bench, or in any other Court of Iuſtice, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 words">

But me thinks for a <hi>Nation</hi> which hath been governed ſo many <hi>hundreds</hi> of years by a known Law, and under it, ſo <hi>flouriſhing</hi> a people as the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> have been, and yet not to be agreed, who are the <hi>finall Judges</hi> of the Law, is ſo <hi>groſſe</hi> a thing, as that all <hi>forraigne</hi> Nations hearing of it, cannot but accompt us men to have loſt our wits.

               <p>The Judges of the Law ought to be ſo <hi>conſpicuous,</hi> as that all perſons, even from the moſt <hi>learned</hi> unto the moſt <hi>ignorant,</hi> may equally alike diſcerne the men: Which conſidered, I conceive it neceſſary not only for the information of the <hi>vulgar</hi> people of <hi>England,</hi> which have herein been groſly deceived, but for the <hi>Vindication</hi> and Honour of our own Nation, and the Law eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ſo farre to <hi>digreſſe,</hi> as in a word, to ſhew how this <hi>fond que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion</hi> was <hi>raiſed</hi> and <hi>controverted</hi> in this Kingdome, which was thus.</p>

Now that the Members <hi>aime</hi> was at no leſſe then all, is <hi>too too</hi> apparent: But at the beginning of theſe <hi>diſtractions,</hi> they were not in a condition to force the people, Therefore their Iudgements muſt be deceived. Hereupon the Plot was, that the <hi>Members</hi> (in the opinion of the people) ſhould gaine the <hi>reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of being the finall <hi>Judge</hi> of the Law, which was effected thus: The people by reaſon of ſome good <hi>Lawes</hi> obtained of the <hi>King</hi> by the Members procurement, were inclinable to believe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54815:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they propounded; Then the Members Voted Thus, <hi>viz. That when the Lords and Commons declare what the Law of</hi>

                  <hi>the Land is, it is a high breach of Priviledge of Parliament to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being publiſhed, and the people (by <hi>Incendiaries</hi> ſpread throughout the <hi>Kingdome</hi> for that purpoſe) by <hi>falſe Calumnies</hi> caſt upon the King, being groſly abuſed, the Members work was (in a manner) <hi>finiſhed:</hi> Then they took upon them the power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> declared that the <hi>Soveraigne</hi> power was not in the Kings Perſon, but <hi>virtually</hi> in them: And from thence, what made for their advantage (how groſſe ſoever) did but the <hi>Members</hi> declare it for Law, and good enough: Thus the Iuſtice ſeate, even by a <hi>ſleight</hi> became both <hi>diſputed</hi> and <hi>uſurped:</hi> But now the <hi>Scales</hi> are turned, The peoples <hi>underſtandings</hi> are enlightned, they ſee how groſly they were miſled, They finde that whilſt the <hi>Judges</hi> of the Realme <hi>declared</hi> the Law, both King and Subject were <hi>preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> in their <hi>Perſons, lives,</hi> and <hi>fortunes:</hi> That by this <hi>uſurpation,</hi> the known Law is <hi>ſubverted,</hi> and conſequently, that protection <hi>vaniſhed.</hi> But as the people have <hi>changed</hi> their opinions, ſo have the Members <hi>framed</hi> a new Argument: They have left the <hi>Word,</hi> and betaken themſelves to the <hi>Sword:</hi> They having Armies to back them; <hi>their will</hi> is now the Law, and reſolve whilſt they can, by <hi>force</hi> to hold it.</p>
               <p>Thus we are fallen into a <hi>gulf</hi> of miſery, whereas had the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple been but <hi>half</hi> ſo carefull to have found out the <hi>Truth,</hi> as they were <hi>induſtrious</hi> to effect their owne <hi>deſtruction,</hi> theſe calamities had been prevented: When the difference firſt hapned between the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Members,</hi> had not the people <hi>leaped</hi> into their own ruine, but taken the leaſt conſideration thereof; had they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought themſelves how they were to be rightly informed what the Law was, they muſt have reſolved, that as we had a Law, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently</hi> there muſt ſo long have been a <hi>Judge</hi> of that Law; But the Members neither exerciſed, or pretended any ſuch power, one <hi>minute</hi> beyond the foreſaid Vote.</p>
               <p>And for Authority, to make their pretence good, none can be produced, but that their <hi>own</hi> teſtimony in this their <hi>own</hi> caſe; and in a thing of no leſſe <hi>concernment,</hi> then the gaining of the <hi>wealth</hi> of the <hi>whole</hi> Kingdome to their <hi>own</hi> uſe, and enſlaving the people to

Suppoſe it granted, that the Iudges in that caſe of Ship-mony, gave Sentence by corruption; whereby about 200000. l. <hi>per annum</hi> was drawn from the people: To conclude hereupon, that we muſt from henceforth have no more <hi>learned men choſen Iudges,</hi> is extreame harſh. It might as well be argued thus, The Members of the two Houſes have erred in Iudgement, and have been corrupt, <hi>ergo,</hi> we ought to have no more Parliaments. For as before appeares, the Members of former Parliaments have moſt groſly erred; And for theſe preſent Members they have not only erred, but have been (in the higheſt nature) corrupt too. Firſt, They erred in Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by aſſuming the Iuſtice ſeat, the Soveraign power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and ſo in infinite other particulars.

their lives and fortunes to their owne will. But clear it is, no <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> can avoid every miſchiefe: it is the beſt Law which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the moſt inconveniencies: therefore in this caſe, that which can be done, is to have perſons who are <hi>learned</hi> in the profeſſion, made Iudges of the Law: and all <hi>poſſible care</hi> taken that they doe Iuſtice, and for that, by our Law, no man is <hi>capable</hi> of a Iudges place, unleſſe he have <hi>ability</hi> to execute the ſame: And although he be <hi>ſufficient</hi> for learning, yet being advanced for <hi>bribes</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> he is by Law likewiſe <hi>diſabled</hi> to performe the office.

               <p>
                  <hi>The Parliaments right to elect Privy Councellors, great Officers, and Judges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherein he endeavours to prove the <hi>two Houſes,</hi> by the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> ought to <hi>elect</hi> the Iudges: And proceeds thus. <hi>Kings (ſaith he) were firſt elected by the people, and as he beleeves, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at the first elected the Judges and great Officers, and bound them by publike Laws, which appears (ſaith he) by infinite Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, regulating both the power of the King, and His Officers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in ancient time Lieutenant Generals and Sheriffs, were ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Parliament, and people: That the Coroners, Majors, Aldermen of Corporations, Conſtables, and other ſuch like officers, at this day are elected by the people, Knights of Shires, and Burgeſſes are elected by the Commons of the Realme.</hi>

                  <hi>That although the Kings have uſually had the election of great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and Judges, it hath rather been by the Parliaments permiſſion, then Conceſſion. That the Judges and Officers of State are as well the Kingdomes as the Kings.</hi>

                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:54815:39"/>
The <hi>vulgar</hi> may thereby <hi>conceive</hi> that the Members of the two Houſes <hi>without the King</hi> have made <hi>Acts</hi> of Parliament. That by thoſe Acts it <hi>appears,</hi> That the <hi>people</hi> elected the <hi>firſt King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Judges,</hi> and <hi>bounded</hi> them by publike Laws. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> himſelfe well knowes, that never any Act of Parliament, was, or could be made, without the Kings <hi>expreſſe</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: And that the people of this Nation have been governed under Kings 1200. years before the firſt Act of Parliament at this day extant.</p>
               <p>So that if Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> had <hi>made</hi> his <hi>Argument</hi> according to the <hi>truth</hi> of the fact, it had been but thus.</p>
               <p>After <hi>King</hi> H. 3. begun his reigne (and not before) the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England</hi> have made <hi>ſome</hi> Laws by Act of Parliament, whereby <hi>in ſome things</hi> they have <hi>regulated</hi> their owne <hi>authority,</hi> and the power of their officers and Judges, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the people (although we had Kings 1200. years before that) elected the firſt <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Judges,</hi> and <hi>bounded</hi> them by publike Laws.</p>
               <p>Beſides, admit the people had <hi>elected</hi> the firſt <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Judges;</hi> That <hi>nothing</hi> proves, that the Members of the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at this day by our Law outgh to <hi>nominate</hi> the <hi>Judges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the reſt of his Arguments they are to this effect.</p>
               <p>A queſtion being <hi>asked,</hi> who ought to <hi>elect</hi> the Judges? Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Leiutenant Generals and Sheriffs were anciently elected by the Parliament and people, Colonels, Majors, Aldermen, Constables, Knights of the Shire, and Burgeſſes, are elected by the people. Kings cannot elect a Member, or exclude him from ſitting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Members are honourable, grave, and wiſe. That the Judges are the Kingdomes as well as the Kings. That although the Kings have uſually had the election of them; perchance it was by uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, and</hi> Mr. Bodin <hi>a great Polititian ſaith, that the election of theſe officers may be and often are in the Subject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now hereupon to conclude, <hi>Ergo,</hi> By the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>two Houſes</hi> ought to elect the <hi>Judges.</hi> I cannot more aptly <hi>parallel</hi> the Argument then thus, How many <hi>miles</hi> to London? Anſwer, <hi>a poke full of plums, Ergo,</hi> it is 20. miles to <hi>London,</hi> upon this it might as well have been concluded, 40. 100. or 1000. miles to <hi>London</hi> as 20. and ſo for <hi>electing</hi> the <hi>Judges,</hi> upon any of Mr. <hi>Pryns</hi> reaſons, or upon all together (admitting them all true)
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54815:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
It might with as much ſence and reaſon have been concluded thus, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the <hi>Major of Quinborough, the great Turke,</hi> or the <hi>man in the Moon</hi> ought to elect them.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Members of the two Houſes <hi>cannot</hi> have the <hi>electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Judges</hi> for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the <hi>Chancery,</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Coke</hi> 5. fo. 62. 9 <hi>E.</hi> 4. fo.</note> the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> and the <hi>Court of the Exchequer,</hi> are Courts of Juſtice by <hi>preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> they were inſtituted before the time of memory, none knows the beginning thereof, <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Coke</hi> 8. f. 145.</note> but certaine it is, they were Courts of Iuſtice <hi>before</hi> the Houſe of Commons had <hi>being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, as it is <hi>neceſſary</hi> that the Iudges of the Law be <hi>knowne</hi> perſons: It is as requiſite that ſuch as elect them, ſhould be <hi>conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſible.</hi> But the Members out of Parliament are <hi>inviſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſuppoſe it <hi>enacted;</hi> That none that ſhall be a Iudge unleſſe elected by <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> It were no wonder for them, <hi>irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileably</hi> to differ in their choice: And the two Houſes are as <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly</hi> two, as <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> That <hi>difference</hi> which is, <hi>renders</hi> the Members <hi>more improper</hi> for the worke, and conſequently not of a Compoſier fit to elect the Iudges.</p>
               <p>And that this is the Kings right, is made good thus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It appears before, that thoſe Courts, have had <hi>Judges</hi> time out of mind. And ſo long as any may can <hi>ſhew,</hi> or <hi>prove,</hi> there hath been <hi>Judges</hi> of thoſe Courts, ſo antiently the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and none elſe have <hi>elected</hi> and authorized them, which is the <hi>ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt</hi> proof in the Law: It is <hi>the Law it ſelfe.</hi> It were abſurd for any man to <hi>deny</hi> that it is <hi>felony to ſteale,</hi> or that the eldeſt ſon is heir to his Fathers land, yet there is no other proof to make it good, but uſe and practiſe. And the <hi>Kings</hi> have as <hi>antiently,</hi> and <hi>conſtantly,</hi> elected the Iudges, as theft hath been puniſhed, or that the eldeſt ſon hath by diſcent enjoyed his fathers land.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if this <hi>King</hi> hath not <hi>right</hi> to elect the Iudges, no former <hi>King</hi> had it, and conſequently we <hi>never</hi> had one <hi>Judge rightly</hi> authorized: So that Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> hath <hi>found</hi> out a point in Law, which at once makes a nullity of all former proceedings in thoſe Courts, as things done <hi>coram non Judice.</hi> But this not all: If Mr. <hi>Pryns doctrine</hi> be true, we have had no <hi>Parliament,</hi> for the <hi>Kings</hi> not having power <hi>legally</hi> to authorize the Lord-keeper, all <hi>creations</hi> of Peeres are void, and ſo the Writs for electing the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54815:40"/>
                  <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> were <hi>illegall</hi> and void too; And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Mr. <hi>Pryns</hi> Law admitted, there is <hi>no</hi> Member of either Houſe Lawfully authorized to ſit or Vote.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>authority</hi> of bookes, either <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> I dare be bold to ſay there is not <hi>one</hi> man in the <hi>World,</hi> untill the ſitting of theſe Members, who hath upon any occaſion mentioned theſe things, but hath <hi>delivered</hi> it as a fundamentall ground, and a <hi>poſitive</hi> truth: That the authority to elect the Iudges, is in the King alone. So thatſuch as are unſatisfied of the Kings right herein, may with as much reaſon doubt whether we have had a King, Law, or govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Nothing can herein be alledged againſt the <hi>King,</hi> or on the Members behalfe, unleſſe a <hi>new maxime</hi> of Law be ſtarted up: That no proof (be it never ſo clear) is ſufficient to entitle the <hi>King</hi> to any Intereſt, or authority; But for the Members, although they have neither <hi>authority, uſe, practiſe, preſident,</hi> or <hi>reaſon</hi> to make it good, have title and intereſt, to what they liſt.</p>
               <p>But if the two Houſes have the <hi>finall</hi> power to judge the Law, and that every one who ſhall <hi>diſpute</hi> their Votes, break the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Parliament. It <hi>matters not</hi> who hath the election of them, nor who are choſen: If the man be <hi>flexible enough,</hi> the meaneſt capacity, in <hi>one</hi> dayes ſtudy, and with the expence of <hi>one</hi> ſingle penny, may be ſufficiently <hi>compleat</hi> for <hi>a States Judge,</hi> his Library needs not conſiſt of more bookes then a copy of the Houſes <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> the Votes.</note> Votes, <hi>whereby we are declared breakers of the priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to deny that to be Law which they declare ſo to be:</hi> For by theſe Votes, we have no Law but the Members will. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently thoſe perſons they call Iudges, are no other but their Ecchoes. But the <hi>true Judges</hi> authorized by the <hi>King,</hi> have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the name, but the power of Judges, the <hi>knowne</hi> Law of the Land is their rule to determine every queſtion depending before <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> the Oath.</note> them, which they are <hi>ſworne</hi> to obſerve, notwithſtanding any <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> the Members, or any perſons whatſoever. And conſequently every one is thereby <hi>preſerved</hi> in his juſt Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; but by the Members taking upon them both to <hi>nominate</hi> the Iudges, and to <hi>declare</hi> the Law, the <hi>Law it ſelfe</hi> is <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> and both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>people inſlaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter clear it is, That the <hi>King</hi> and none
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54815:40"/>
elſe hath power to nominate and authorize the aforeſaid Iudges and officers: And therefore if the Members of the two Houſes have, or ſhall, either in the <hi>Kings</hi> name, or in their owne, <hi>de facto,</hi> appoint any perſons for <hi>Judges</hi> in thoſe Courts, or in words, by Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> or <hi>generall Gaole delivery,</hi> give power to any to <hi>execute</hi> the office of <hi>Judicature,</hi> in <hi>Circuits</hi> or otherwiſe, ſuch perſons have not <hi>de Jure,</hi> the power of Iudges. For the <hi>Members</hi> have no more authority to make a <hi>Judge,</hi> or to give any ſuch power, then any other ſubject in the Kingdome hath therein. And conſequently all the judgements, acts, and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of thoſe nominall Iudges, or ſuch Commiſſioners are <hi>void</hi> as things done <hi>coram non Judice.</hi> Every perſon, by ſuch authority, who, either in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> or at the <hi>Aſſiſes,</hi> or elſewhere, hath been, or ſhall be <hi>condemned</hi> and <hi>executed</hi> for any crime (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther guilty or not guilty) is <hi>murdered.</hi> And every other judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſentence by them given, either in <hi>Capitall, Criminall,</hi> or <hi>Civill</hi> affaires, is invalid. In the next place it is proved that the King is the only Supreame Governour.</p>

               <p>Here I deny both his <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor.</hi> Firſt, for his <hi>Major.</hi> Although it is true, that every <hi>Juſt reſolution</hi> of any Court of Juſtice, That is, when the <hi>Judges legally</hi> determine ſuch things as <hi>regularly</hi> depend before them, in point of <hi>Intereſt</hi> bindes the <hi>King</hi> as well as a <hi>Subject,</hi> that proves not a <hi>Soveraigne</hi> power in the Judges.

               <p>☞sAnd for his <hi>Minor,</hi> take his meaning to be the true Parliament.

                  <hi>But (ſaith Maſter</hi> Prin) <hi>the King, although he be cheif, yet he is but one Member of the Parliament, and (ſaith he) the greateſt part of any politicke body is of greater power then any one particular Member.</hi>

               <p>There is <hi>ſcarce</hi> one word in this diſcourſe but it is <hi>falſe</hi> or miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.

It is true, where the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is <hi>Aligarchicall, Ariſtocraticall,</hi> or <hi>Democraticall,</hi> the <hi>major</hi> part determines the Queſtion. But this is <hi>miſ-applyed</hi> to the buſineſſe in diſpute, concerning the Soveraign power; <hi>Our Government is Monarchicall.</hi> The people of <hi>England</hi> are not Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by a Parliament; The <hi>uſe of a Parliament</hi> (as before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares) is <hi>onely</hi> in <hi>ſome</hi> things, when <hi>neceſſity</hi> requires, To alter the <hi>old,</hi> or make <hi>new</hi> Lawes, wherein the foreſaid three bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Lords</hi> Houſe, and the <hi>Commons</hi> Houſe are joyntly truſted.</p>

If Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> be <hi>asked,</hi> what he meanes by the <hi>Major part</hi> of that Corporation, which he in this place calls <hi>the Parliament?</hi> His Anſwer muſt be one of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Any <hi>two</hi> of the aforeſaid three bodies, or elſe, That the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Lords,</hi> and the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons promiſcuouſly</hi> put together, are to Vote as one Aſſembly, and the greater number of ſingle voices (not diſtinguiſhing the ſeverall bodies) to carry it. Grant the firſt, And then the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>either</hi> Houſe or both Houſes without the <hi>King</hi> have power to make Lawes. Therefore againſt that, I ſuppoſe both Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> and the Members themſelves, will conclude. But the <hi>latter</hi> it is he intends, for by that, the <hi>Houſe</hi> of Commons ſhall obtaine the <hi>ſole</hi> power of making Laws: That Aſſembly being in number, <hi>almoſt treble</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Lords,</hi> And ſo both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Peer-age</hi> excluded; And that not all, but in effect the <hi>Gentry too,</hi> for the <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> are in number, farre more then all the reſt. And (as before appears) theſe Burgeſſes not onely <hi>may,</hi> but by the true intent and meaning of the Law <hi>ought</hi> to be <hi>tradeſmen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then for his particular caſes cited for his proof, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Commonalty,</hi> the <hi>Deane</hi> and <hi>Chapter,</hi> the <hi>Biſhop, Deane</hi> and <hi>Chapter,</hi> they are all guided by their <hi>Charters</hi> and <hi>foundations,</hi> which they ought to purſue; And none of them have power <hi>without their head</hi> to make any binding Act. <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Commonalty</hi> without the <hi>Major,</hi> the <hi>Chapter</hi> without the <hi>Deane,</hi> or the <hi>Deane</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> without the <hi>Biſhop.</hi> And ſo it is with the <hi>Parliament,</hi> although both Houſes concurre in one opinion, It binds not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Kings</hi> conſent.

               <p>Then M. <hi>Pryn</hi> ſaith, <hi>That if the King propound a Law, it binds not, unleſſe it be conſented unto by the Parliament.</hi> Ergo, <hi>the chiefe legiſlative power is in the Parliament, not in the King.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Here M. <hi>Pryn</hi> according to his <hi>wonted</hi> ſleight, <hi>divides</hi> the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> making them <hi>two</hi> things, and <hi>aſcribing</hi> unto the two Houſes <hi>without</hi> the <hi>King</hi> the <hi>name</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of a <hi>Parliament:</hi> Whereas he knowes neither <hi>name,</hi> nor <hi>power</hi> is due to them.

For (as before it appears) Lawes made by <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament, although they binde not without the <hi>conſent</hi> of the two Houſes, yet they are the Kings Lawes, <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Coke</hi> 7. fo. 36. 37.</note> and by himſelfe <hi>alone</hi> he may <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence</hi> with them. Therefore it might properly be concluded, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the <hi>Legiſlative</hi> power is more in the <hi>King,</hi> then in the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi> But for Maſter <hi>Pryns concluſion</hi> it is a meere <hi>non ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſaith M. <hi>Pryn, Bils for Acts of Parliament are uſually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on before they come to have the Kings aſſent. And ſuch Bils ſaith he, the King cannot alter. But if the King ſend a Bill which he deſires to have paſſed; It muſt be thrice read, and aſſented unto by both Houſes, who (ſaith he) have power to reject, alter, or enlarge it as they think fit.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a <hi>groſſe juggle,</hi> all his words in <hi>ſome</hi> ſenſe are <hi>true,</hi> yet as he intends the <hi>vulgar</hi> ſhall apprehend his meaning, nothing is more <hi>falſe:</hi> It is true, if the King ſend unto the Houſes a Bill for an Act of Parliament, they may <hi>alter</hi> the Bill. But that done, untill the King <hi>aſſent</hi> unto it <hi>ſo altered,</hi> it is no Law. And ſo when <hi>both</hi> Houſes preſent a <hi>Bill</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> he may alter it, but his <hi>Royall</hi> aſſent makes it not a Law, untill the <hi>Houſes</hi> have conſented to it ſo altered; yet unleſſe M. <hi>Pryn</hi> be underſtood thus, that when the <hi>King</hi> ſends a Bill to the Members, That they may <hi>alter it,</hi> and <hi>make it</hi> what they pleaſe; And that <hi>new</hi> Bill to <hi>bind</hi> the <hi>King</hi> without his further conſent, he hath ſaid nothing, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his meaning, he hath abuſed his Reader with a groſſe fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
               <p>Then M. <hi>Pryn</hi> obſerves the <hi>penning</hi> of the Statutes for <hi>Subſidies</hi> which he ſets down thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Commons Aſſembled, humbly preſent your Majeſty with the free gift of two intire Subſidies, which we humbly beſeech your Majeſty to accept. Therefore (ſaith he) the Commons have the ſole power to grant or deny Subſidies. And (ſaith he) they being the cheif Law-makers in theſe Acts, by like reaſon they are ſo in all other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick penall Acts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:54815:43"/>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here M. <hi>Pryn</hi> affirms, that the Commons Houſe, <hi>without King or Lords,</hi> may charge the people with Subſidies, And infers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, that they have the like power in any <hi>publick penall</hi> Act. But obſerving his proof, And by the ſame <hi>ſleight</hi> he may as well main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine (even by the Scripture it ſelf) That the <hi>Devill,</hi> not <hi>God,</hi> is to be worſhiped. It is thus. Peruſing the Acts themſelves, by which Subſidies are granted, and the words are theſe, <hi>viz. We the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons humbly preſent your Majeſty with two Subſidies.</hi> Thus farre he recites the Act; Then the words follow in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide</hi> the Acts.</note> 
                  <hi>And therefore we humbly beſeech your Majeſty that it may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted. And be it enacted by the Kings Majeſty, the Lords, Spirituall and Temporall, and the Commons in this preſent Parliament Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and by authority of the ſame, that the King ſhall have two Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies.</hi> Theſe being the <hi>words</hi> which makes the Law are left out.</p>
               <p>Then ſaith M. <hi>Pryn, Acts of Parliament made in the time of uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, oblige the right Heires of the Crown, and the people too. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (ſaith he) the Legiſlative power is more in the people, then in the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is moſt falſe, that <hi>all</hi> Acts of Parliament made by conſent of <hi>uſurping Kings</hi> binde the right <hi>Heires</hi> to the Crown. But true it is, that <hi>ſome</hi> Acts of Parliament made by <hi>conſent</hi> of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers,</hi> have been admitted to binde in time of <hi>Kings</hi> raigning by Juſt title, which is upon this ground: The <hi>Competition</hi> for the <hi>Crown,</hi> may happen to be upon a queſtion doubtfull, And the <hi>difference</hi> (as in that between <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter)</hi> may continue <hi>long,</hi> and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſhewes, That the <hi>King</hi> in poſſeſſion (whether by right, or wrong) wants not meanes to declare his <hi>Competiter</hi> an Uſurper. And therefore <hi>dangerous</hi> it were for the Law to <hi>declare</hi> all ſuch Acts of Parliament voide. But admit that <hi>every</hi> Statute made by the conſent of an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper</hi> to be as binding a Law, as any other, How that proves that the <hi>Legiſlative</hi> power is more in the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:54815:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then in the <hi>King,</hi> is not <hi>intelligible:</hi> It rather proves the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it ſhewes there <hi>muſt</hi> be a <hi>Kings</hi> conſent, although an <hi>uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> elſe no Law: And if ſo, ſtronger it is, when the <hi>King reignes</hi> by a <hi>juſt</hi> Title.</p>
               <p>Then ſaith Mr. Pryn, <hi>The King hath little or no hand in making Laws, His is but aſſenting thereunto. As (ſaith he) the forme of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Bils import. For (ſaith he) Bils being paſſed both Houſes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the King, his anſwer is (le Roy le veilt) the Kings wils it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the <hi>conſent</hi> which makes the Law, when the Bill is <hi>ingroſſed,</hi> and read in the Houſe: The queſtion by the <hi>Speaker</hi> is put to the <hi>Members,</hi> whether it ſhall be a <hi>Law</hi> or not, and ſuch as are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion to paſſe it, are directed to ſay <hi>I,</hi> and thoſe againſt it <hi>no,</hi> and being paſſed <hi>both</hi> Houſes, it is <hi>preſented</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> whoſe anſwer if He <hi>confirme</hi> it, is, <hi>le Roy le veilt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that if <hi>any difference</hi> be, the <hi>Kings</hi> words are more <hi>prevalent,</hi> for before that, it is but a <hi>written</hi> piece of <hi>parchment,</hi> not <hi>valid,</hi> but by tht <hi>Kings</hi> words, <hi>inſtantly</hi> it hath <hi>life,</hi> and is become a <hi>Law</hi> binding the <hi>whole</hi> Kingdome and people; And this (as before is ſaid) is the <hi>Kings</hi> Law.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> fals to preſidents, which he cals proofs. <hi>King</hi> Ed. 2. <hi>and King</hi> R. 2. <hi>(ſaith he) were depoſed by the Parliament.</hi>

               <p>The caſe concerning theſe <hi>two Kings,</hi> was thus: Againſt <hi>King Ed.</hi> 2. after many <hi>distractions</hi> in the Kingdome, the <hi>Queen</hi> His Wife, and other of Her <hi>adherents,</hi> increaſed the <hi>faction,</hi> raiſed a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> barbarouſly tooke the <hi>King priſoner,</hi> and during His <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,</hi> without any lawfull authority, or conſent of the <hi>King,</hi> in His name ſummoned a Parliament; and by <hi>force</hi> drew him in words to <hi>reſigne</hi> His <hi>Crowne</hi> unto His Son, afterwards <hi>King Ed.</hi> 3. and that of <hi>King R.</hi> 2. was much to the like purpoſe: He was <hi>drawne</hi> to reſigne His Crowne to <hi>H. of Bullingbrooke.</hi> Afterwards <hi>King Hen.</hi> 4. and theſe two <hi>lawfull Kings,</hi> being thus <hi>injuriouſly</hi> bereft of their <hi>Scepters,</hi> were ſhortly after moſt <hi>barbarouſly murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:54815:44"/>
too. The <hi>whole</hi> proceedings of which Acts, all ſuch <hi>(Pryn</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) as have <hi>mentioned</hi> them, have <hi>condemned</hi> the ſame, not onely to be <hi>illegall,</hi> but as Acts moſt <hi>wicked</hi> and notoriouſly <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſaith Mr. Pryn, <hi>Pierce Gaveſton and the two Hugh Spencers, were by Parliament baniſhed, the Spencers violently put to death, Humphrey Duke of Glouceſter arreſted of high Treaſon at a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Berry, and there murdered. That the Earle of Strafford this Parliament loſt his head againſt the Kings will.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the baniſhment of <hi>Gaveſton,</hi> and the two <hi>Spencers,</hi> his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is but thus: The <hi>King</hi> with the aſſent of the two Houſes, made an Act of Parliament to <hi>baniſh them, Ergo,</hi> the two Houſes <hi>without</hi> the King have the <hi>Soveraigne</hi> power of Government. And admit Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> hath proved (which he endeavours) that the Members of the two Houſes <hi>murdered</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and the <hi>Spencers,</hi> ſtill that proves <hi>not</hi> the Soveraigne power of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be in the Members.</p>
               <p>That example of the late Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> I conceive to be a Preſident, far more proper to be cited for this purpoſe, then the caſe of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> or the <hi>Spencers:</hi> For all men know, that Biſhop was put to death, by no other authority, then by order of the two Houſes; yet this no more proves the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power to be in the Members, then that murder acted by <hi>Felton</hi> upon the perſon of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> proves <hi>Felton</hi> to be the King of <hi>England;</hi> For, the Members of the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, had no more authority to condemne to death the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> then <hi>Felton</hi> had to kill the <hi>Duke.</hi> And conſequently the murder of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> (whatever his offence was, or however guilty) it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done by pretext, and colour of Law, was more horrid.</p>
               <p>And for the <hi>Earle of Strafford,</hi> it was thus. By the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England</hi> no man can, or ought to be convict of a crime, but by <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament, by <hi>utlagare,</hi> or by <hi>triall</hi> of his <hi>Peeres:</hi> That is, if a <hi>Lord</hi> of the Parliament, by a <hi>Jury of Lords,</hi> if under that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, by a Jury of <hi>like quality,</hi> and being <hi>convict,</hi> the <hi>Judge</hi> ought to give no other <hi>ſentence,</hi> but what the <hi>knowne</hi> Law doth <hi>pronounce</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:54815:44"/>
for that fact; Now that <hi>Earle,</hi> by the Members of the <hi>Commons Houſe</hi> was <hi>accuſed</hi> of high <hi>Treaſon.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> thereupon declared His <hi>reſolution,</hi> not to protect him from the <hi>tryall,</hi> or juſt <hi>ſentence</hi> of the Law. After this the Members (waving the ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Law) paſſed a <hi>Bill</hi> to <hi>attaint</hi> him of Treaſon, by <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament; This Bill was <hi>preſented</hi> to the King, He for ſome time <hi>refuſed</hi> to make it a Law, which peradventure He might be induced unto, by the Bill it ſelfe: There being a ſpeciall <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> the Act.</note> 
                  <hi>proviſo</hi> therein, that the <hi>Judges</hi> ſhall <hi>not condemn</hi> any other for the like offences; which might cauſe the <hi>King</hi> to be very <hi>tender</hi> of paſſing the Act, thereby to <hi>condemne</hi> a man as a <hi>Traytor,</hi> for facts <hi>paſſed,</hi> which at the <hi>time</hi> committed was not <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This if <hi>duely</hi> conſidered is ſo far from being <hi>evill</hi> in the <hi>King,</hi> as that the <hi>whole</hi> Kingdome hath thereby great cauſe to acknowledge his goodneſſe: It hereby appears he deſired to <hi>governe</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> not as a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> to proceed againſt offenders according to the <hi>knowne</hi> Law, not by <hi>an arbitrary</hi> power. And if ſome particular perſons too much <hi>thirſting</hi> after <hi>Straffords blood,</hi> occaſioned ſuch things, as might draw the King againſt His <hi>conſcience</hi> to conſent unto that Act, <hi>woe</hi> be unto them. But however, whether the <hi>King</hi> paſſed this Act <hi>willingly,</hi> or <hi>againſt</hi> His will, or whether the <hi>Earle of Strafford</hi> were <hi>guilty</hi> or <hi>not</hi> guilty of <hi>Treaſon.</hi> That nothing proves that the Members have Soveraigne power of government above the King.</p>
               <p>Thus for Mr. <hi>Pryns</hi> objections againſt the <hi>Kings</hi> right to <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty.</hi> And that the Members have no authority therein, is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proved thus.</p>

This government is new, there yet never was the like upon the face of the earth. It is not <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall, Alligarchicall, Ariſtocraticall, Democraticall,</hi> nor (although the neereſt to it) <hi>Anarchicall,</hi> it is worſe then confuſion.

               <p>And for that theſe two things are conſiderable, firſt, what is the <hi>office</hi> of the Supreame Governour, ſecondly, who hath <hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> that duty. For the firſt, all men grant it is to <hi>preſerve</hi> the people in <hi>peace,</hi> by cauſing the Laws to be <hi>juſtly diſtributed,</hi> and the like; which have ever been performed by the King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> for the time being, and by none elſe. He hath <hi>denounced</hi> War, <hi>proclaimed</hi> peace, <hi>inhaunced</hi> and debaced Coyne, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded forraigne Coyne to be current here, ordered all <hi>forraigne</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations; All matters of War, either foraigne or domeſtick.

               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> A. B. <hi>do utterly teſtifie in my conſcience that the Kings Highneſs is the onely Supreame Governour of this Realme, and of all other His Highneſſe Realmes, Dominions, and Countries, as well in all Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things, or cauſes, as Temporall.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:54815:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Now if the <hi>contents</hi> of this Oath be <hi>true,</hi> that is, If the King be the <hi>onely</hi> Supreame Governour, all the reſt of the people, from the higheſt to the loweſt, whether <hi>Members, or not Members,</hi> are ſubject unto Him, and perſons <hi>governed:</hi> And as all perſons are hereby included, ſo it extends to <hi>all things,</hi> both <hi>Spirituall</hi> and <hi>Temporall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And me thinks it <hi>ſtrange,</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> ſhould make doubt of the truth of this Oath. It was <hi>compoſed</hi> by the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Parliament, in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> And at their ſuite, by Act <note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 1. 5. <hi>El.</hi> c. 1.</note> of Parliament made high Treaſon for a Subject to deny to take it; And further enacted, that every <hi>Judge</hi> of the Law, and other <hi>Officer,</hi> either Spirituall or Temporall; <hi>every</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of any <hi>profeſſion</hi> or <hi>calling,</hi> before he be enabled to exerciſe the ſame, every <hi>ward,</hi> before he be permitted to ſue out his Livery, every one <hi>elected Member</hi> of the <hi>Commons Houſe,</hi> before he be permitted to <hi>ſit</hi> or Vote there, ſhall take this Oath.</p>
               <p>Yet the <hi>Members</hi> of this Parliament would make an <hi>evaſion</hi> out of it, Thus. <hi>The Kings Supreamacy (ſay they) is meant</hi> in Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, non in Camera, <hi>in His Courts, not in His private Capacity. And to ſpeak properly, onely His high Court of Parliament, wherein He is abſolutely Supream Head and Governour, from whence there is no appeal. And (ſay they) if the Parliament may take an Accompt what is done by His Majeſty in His inferiour Courts, much more what is done by Him without Authority in any Court. And (ſay they) It is preached to the people by the Kings Declarations, that by the Supreamacy is meant a power inherent in the Kings Perſon, without, above, againſt all His Courts, the Parliament not excepted, whereby (ſay they) the excellent Lawes are turned into an Arbytrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which the <hi>Members</hi> in this diſcourſe ſay, in effect is but thus. The <hi>King</hi> is <hi>Supreame</hi> Governour; Yet under the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers Government, He hath Authority without appeal to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <hi>all things,</hi> yet hath not power to determine <hi>any one thing.</hi> To blear the eyes of the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> they are contented the <hi>King</hi> ſhall be <hi>called</hi> the <hi>onely</hi> Supream Governour. But the Authority, Power,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54815:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Execution thereof (if we may believe the Members) is their owne. The <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People</hi> are herein uſed, as a <hi>Father</hi> ſometimes deals with his <hi>child,</hi> telling his little ſon, the flock of ſheep is his; yet the Father <hi>ſhears</hi> them, &amp; takes the <hi>profits</hi> to his own uſe. Even ſo are King &amp; People dealt with. They are told bythe <hi>Members,</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> by the <hi>Supreamacy</hi> claimes ſuch a power, As that the Subjects thereby have loſt both their Law and Liberty, and would make them believe, that they are by thoſe Members thereunto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored againe.</p>
               <p>Whereas all but <hi>naturalls</hi> may now diſcerne, That whilſt the <hi>King,</hi> together with the <hi>name,</hi> enjoyed both the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> of the <hi>Supreamacy,</hi> The people were a <hi>free</hi> Subject; And that by this <hi>uſurpation</hi> upon the King, They are <hi>inſlaved.</hi> For, the <hi>Supreamacy</hi> is in the Kings <hi>Perſon;</hi> But by it He neither <hi>hath,</hi> nor <hi>claimes</hi> an <hi>unlimited</hi> power. The <hi>People</hi> are Governed <hi>under</hi> Him, but that Government is <hi>directed</hi> by a <hi>known</hi> Law, of which Law <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Cok.</hi> Pref. 4. report.</note> the King is <hi>not Judge,</hi> nor <hi>can</hi> He, by Himſelfe <hi>alone</hi> alter that Law. Now whilſt the <hi>Supreamacy,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> to Judge the Law, and <hi>Authority</hi> to make new Lawes, are kept in <hi>ſeverall hands,</hi> the known Law is <hi>preſerved,</hi> but <hi>united,</hi> it is <hi>vaniſhed,</hi> inſtantly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and <hi>Arbytrary</hi> and <hi>Tyrannicall</hi> power is introduced. <hi>For example,</hi> the Members <hi>condemne</hi> a Subject to die, they <hi>confiſcate</hi> his eſtate to their own uſe, and (without appeal) have power to <hi>Judge</hi> the Law thereupon. This granted, clear it is, the <hi>Will</hi> of the Members is the Law; they are hereby <hi>Judge, Party,</hi> and <hi>Witneſſe.</hi> It were <hi>fruitleſſe</hi> for that condemned perſon (although guiltleſſe) to urge his <hi>innocency</hi> of the Fact, or to <hi>diſpute</hi> the Law upon that Fact, with them who have <hi>condemned</hi> him. And (as the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers tell us) there is none elſe to <hi>appeal</hi> unto; It is therefore to be feared, the <hi>greater Eſtate</hi> the Delinquent hath, or the more <hi>ſpleen</hi> ſome Members bear to his perſon, the more <hi>Capitall</hi> is his offence. So that it is the Members, not the King, who claime a <hi>power</hi> in their owne perſons, <hi>without, above, againſt</hi> all Courts of Juſtice, The Parliament it ſelf not excepted; Our <hi>excellent</hi> Lawes are by them <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> and turned into their own <hi>Arbitrary power.</hi> And thus the people are enſlaved by a <hi>diſtinction,</hi> never <hi>heard</hi> of, or <hi>thought</hi> on before this Parliament, the aforeſaid <hi>two Spencers</hi> onely excepted: It is true, they having committed <hi>acts</hi> of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54815:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to <hi>colour</hi> their proceedings, divulged an opinion ſuitable to this; they pretended that the Oath of <hi>Allegeance</hi> was more in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>Crown,</hi> then the <hi>Kings Perſon;</hi> That the King might be <hi>removed,</hi> and the people ought to governe: But thoſe <hi>opinions</hi> are condemned as <hi>damnable</hi> &amp; <hi>execrable,</hi> by two Acts <note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>But that this of the <hi>Members,</hi> and that of the <hi>Spencers,</hi> are meere <hi>fictions</hi> and <hi>deluſions</hi> to gull the people, is evident both by Authorities of Law, and the common practice of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

And that by Lawfull right and diſcent under one Imperiall Crowne your Majeſty is of</hi> England, Scotland, France <hi>and</hi> Ireland <hi>King; And thereunto we moſt humbly and faithfully ſubmit and oblige our ſelves, our heires and poſterities for ever untill the laſt drop of our bloods be ſpent; And beſeech your Majeſty to accept the ſame as the firſt fruits of our Loyalty to your Majeſty and Royall Progeny and Poſterity for ever; Which if your Majeſty will adorne with your Royall Aſſent, (without which it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be compleat, nor remaine to all Poſterity) we ſhall adde this to the reſt of your Majeſties ineſtimable benefits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this we ſee, that this <hi>Kings</hi> Father <hi>by inherent birth-right,</hi> had the <hi>Soveraigne</hi> power of Government; That the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> in Parliament, did not onely <hi>ſubmit</hi> thereunto, but at their <hi>humble</hi> ſuite, by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament, obliged themſelves,</hi> their <hi>heires,</hi> and <hi>poſterities for ever,</hi> even to the ſpending of their <hi>laſt drop of blood,</hi> to <hi>preſerve Him</hi> and <hi>His</hi> Poſterity therein.

               </p>
               <p>But it is <hi>viſible</hi> to the world: The <hi>Members</hi> uſe the word (King) as they do the name of <hi>God himſelf,</hi> either for their owne <hi>advantage,</hi> or to gull the people, which (amongſt infinite other particulars) by their various proceedings concerning the Kings <hi>Soveraigne</hi> power, it is manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by their foreſaid <hi>Declaration</hi> in words they aſcribe unto the <hi>King</hi> a <hi>greater</hi> power then he either hath, or challengeth: He is (ſay they) <hi>abſolutely</hi> Supreame head and Governour. And this in <hi>all</hi> things, and that <hi>finall</hi> too, for (ſay they) from him there is no <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale.</hi> But even by the ſame Inſtrument they tell us, that this <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty</hi> is not in the Kings perſon, but <hi>totally</hi> in the Members of the two Houſes.</p>
               <p>And after their <hi>preaching</hi> of this doctrine, and <hi>exerciſing</hi> the Kings office for ſome years, then they tooke the <hi>boldneſſe</hi> in plaine tearmes to tell us, they would have <hi>no King,</hi> that they themſelves would (without their Soveraigne) governe the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>But herein they <hi>catched</hi> themſelves, for inſtantly thereupon the people plainely diſcerned their intention even from the firſt, they were by this <hi>Vote</hi> ſatisfied, that the Members <hi>aime</hi> was not for the <hi>publicke,</hi> but for their owne <hi>private,</hi> to <hi>ſubvert</hi> the knowne Law, and to reduce the people to the <hi>ſlavery</hi> of an <hi>everlaſting ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary,</hi> and <hi>tyrannicall</hi> power under their equals.</p>
               <p>The Subjects of <hi>England</hi> upon this <hi>Vote unanimouſly,</hi> even through the whole Kingdome, (as if they were at one inſtant ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally inſpired) make their <hi>Proteſtation</hi> againſt theſe uſurpers.

               <p>Suppoſe <hi>three</hi> ſingle perſons, had jointly the <hi>Soveraigne</hi> power of government, no man can <hi>imagine,</hi> but that they would (even in matters of greateſt weight and perill) <hi>ſterne</hi> ſeverall wayes: But in point of <hi>Government</hi> to adde unto the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Members</hi> of the two Houſes make it <hi>a compoſier</hi> far more <hi>prepoſterous,</hi> and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd: And conſequently to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to that <hi>Vote,</hi> to be governed by <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> (although it be admitted the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers intend it a joynt power) were no other, then to introduce <hi>contradictions,</hi> diſtractions, and confuſion.</p>
               <p>Beſides, by ſetling the government in <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, ipſo facto,</hi> the <hi>knowne</hi> Law is <hi>ſubverted,</hi> and <hi>an arbitrary</hi> power introduced; for, as before appears, they who have the <hi>Government,</hi> and alſo power to make <hi>new,</hi> and change the <hi>old</hi> Law, cannot be guided but by their owne will: Whereas, by obſerving the <hi>conſtitutions</hi> of the Realme, in ſubmitting to the <hi>King alone,</hi> for matter of Government, unto the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>two</hi> Houſes <hi>joyntlie,</hi> for making new Laws, or altering the old, and unto the lawfull <hi>Judges</hi> of the Realme, to <hi>expound</hi> and <hi>declare</hi> the Law, all <hi>arbitrary</hi> power is avoided.</p>

The firſt is properly the <hi>Prelates</hi> and <hi>Peeres</hi> of the Realme, which (beſides infinite other teſtimonies) is proved by the Writ of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to every Parliament. The words are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And the Sheriffs returne is thus, viz.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thus it is manifeſt, that it is the <hi>Prelates</hi> and <hi>Peeres,</hi> (who have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants unto them the Judges, and others of the Kings learned Councell, and the Maſters of the Chancery) whom the King ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth with as His great Councell: It is the office of the <hi>Commons</hi> (as likewiſe by this Writ appears) to do and conſent unto ſuch things, as the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Prelates,</hi> and <hi>Peeres</hi> agree upon.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, are ſuch as the King makes <hi>choice</hi> of to adviſe Him in <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> and are <hi>ſworne</hi> to <hi>ſecrecy;</hi> And the third are the <hi>Judges</hi> of the Realme, and others of the Long Robe, whom the <hi>King elects,</hi> and are <hi>ſworne</hi> to adviſe Him in matters of <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now whilſt theſe <hi>Councellors</hi> keepe within their owne bounds, and <hi>faithfully</hi> performe their ſeverall <hi>duties,</hi> the <hi>known</hi> Law is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and ſo every one <hi>protected:</hi> But when they <hi>extend</hi> beyond their <hi>bounds, confuſion</hi> enſueth.</p>
               <p>Abſurd it were for a ſick man (concerning his Cure) to adviſe with a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> or for any one in <hi>point</hi> of Law, to take adviſe of a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian.</hi> So for the <hi>Privy</hi> Councellors, to judge the Law, for the <hi>Judges</hi> to determine matter of <hi>State.</hi> And the like holds with the <hi>Members</hi> of the two Houſes: They are neither <hi>qualified,</hi> nor have
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54815:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Commiſſion</hi> either to intermeddle with the <hi>Law,</hi> or the <hi>affaires</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> otherwiſe then the King ſhall thinke fit to intruſt them, by asking them their <hi>adviſe,</hi> wherein they are onely to deliver their <hi>opinions,</hi> not to <hi>controle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore when the <hi>two Houſes</hi> have paſſed a Bill for a new Law, and have <hi>preſented</hi> it to the <hi>King,</hi> they have performed their duty, it then reſts in the <hi>King,</hi> whether to make it a Law, or not, wherein it may be neceſſary for Him to take the adviſe of His <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Councell,</hi> His learned Councell, or of both. And I conceive that may be the reaſon, why Kings have uſed to anſwer Bils (which they paſſe not) by theſe words, <hi>le Roy, le veili.</hi> By theſe words of the Writ, <hi>viz. Quia de adviſamento &amp; aſſenſu conſilii nostri, &amp;c. quoddam Parliamentum noſtrum, &amp;c. teneri ordinavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, &amp;c.</hi> It appears that the King depends upon His <hi>Councell,</hi> in calling Parliaments, which oftentimes is occaſioned upon <hi>State-affaires,</hi> ſuch as requires the <hi>aſſembling</hi> of a Parliament, yet not <hi>ſafe</hi> to <hi>reveale</hi> thoſe reaſons to the Parliament men: And ſo the <hi>King,</hi> by <hi>adviſe</hi> of His <hi>Privy</hi> Councell, or His learned Councell, may, and oftentimes doth <hi>reject</hi> Bils preſented unto Him by both Houſes, and yet not <hi>convenient</hi> to render His reaſons to that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
               <p>Therefore clear it is, the <hi>men</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> have extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> and ſo all theſe <hi>Votes</hi> are abſolutely <hi>invalid,</hi> not binding either King or people. The <hi>King</hi> notwithſtanding theſe Votes, is, or whatever the <hi>Members ſhall,</hi> or can Vote, <hi>will</hi> and <hi>muſt</hi> be our <hi>only Supreame Governour.</hi> And conſequently theſe men at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> by <hi>breaking</hi> their bounds, are themſelves <hi>guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of thoſe things, which in and by their declarations to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they <hi>groſſely</hi> and <hi>falſely</hi> aſperſed their <hi>King</hi> with: They have and do arrogate (to uſe their owne words,) an <hi>arbitrary</hi> power <hi>without, above, againſt</hi> all the Courts of Juſtice, the <hi>Parliament</hi> it ſelfe not excepted. And thereby the knowne Law is <hi>ſubverted,</hi> and conſequently, they are moſt <hi>palpably</hi> guilty of that crime, for which they themſelves condemned as a <hi>Traytor</hi> the late <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Strafford,</hi> but for <hi>attempting</hi> to do, and that upon a <hi>ſlender</hi> proof too.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter it may with as <hi>much juſtice</hi> &amp; <hi>ſenſe</hi> be ſaid, that there was yet <hi>never one King of England,</hi> as to queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54815:50"/>
the <hi>King</hi> for time being hath <hi>inherently</hi> in His perſon the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne power of Government. But that man who hath taken <hi>conſideration</hi> hereof, and yet ſo <hi>abſurdly peeviſh</hi> as to remaine unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of the Kings right herein, the whole world muſt judge Him <hi>worſe</hi> then out of his wits to give it unto the Members.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, when a witneſſe (although not a party) <hi>contradicts</hi> himſelfe, his teſtimony becomes <hi>invalid:</hi> But the <hi>Members ſolemnly upon their Oathes</hi> even this Parliament, have declared the King their <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supreame Governour,</hi> wherein they ſwore not for <hi>themſelves,</hi> but on <hi>anothers</hi> behalfe, that is, for the Kings Intereſt: So that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>prudent</hi> man in common ſenſe and reaſon, ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that which theſe men have thus <hi>ſworne</hi> for the <hi>King;</hi> And abſolutely to <hi>reject</hi> this their affirmation contrary to that Oath, and for their owne <hi>advantage.</hi> And ſo I conclude this point <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring</hi> with the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> 1 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> that the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Crowne of this Realme, is, by <hi>inherent birth-right, deſcended</hi> and <hi>come</hi> to this our <hi>King Charls.</hi> And that (according to the Oathes of theſe Members and their predeceſſors in former Parliaments) he is <hi>our</hi> onely <hi>Supreame</hi> Governour.</p>

The <hi>King</hi> cannot <hi>muſter</hi> His Subjects, but in ſuch ſort as is <hi>preſcribed</hi> by <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament: To conclude thereupon, that the Members of the <hi>two Houſes</hi> have the power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> nothing can be more <hi>abſurd.</hi> But, it directly <hi>implies,</hi> that none but the King can <hi>muſter</hi> the people. And conſequently, the <hi>Militia</hi> is in the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for Acts of Parliament <hi>preſcribing</hi> how, or in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the people ſhall be <hi>muſtered</hi> or <hi>arrayed,</hi> we have none of that nature, untill the Raign of King <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. But the <hi>Militia</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was executed, and commanded by the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> 1200. yeares before that time: And by every Act of Parliament which doth in any ſort <hi>order,</hi> or <hi>appoint</hi> the <hi>muſtering</hi> or <hi>arraying</hi> of the Subject; It appeares, that the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> it ſelf, before that Law was in the King; And by none of them is taken out of him: And ſo this Argument of Maſter <hi>Pryns</hi> is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>But ſaith M. <hi>Pryn, The King hath theſe things, and the Revenues of His Crown in His politick Capacity, as (ſaith he) a Major and Commonalty, a Dean and Chapter, and the like, are ſeized of their Lands. And therefore (ſaith he) the King, neither by His Will, nor by His Letters Patents, can deviſe, alien, or ſell the ſame.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>If it be admitted, that the <hi>King</hi> cannot alien ſuch <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Revenues</hi> as He is ſeized of in His <hi>politick</hi> Capacity, (which is in it ſelfe moſt abſurd) how this <hi>diſproves</hi> his title to the <hi>Militia,</hi> the <hi>Forts,</hi> the <hi>Navie, Ammunition,</hi> and <hi>Revenues</hi> of the Crowne, is not <hi>intelligible.</hi> The Argument in effect is but thus: The King hath the <hi>Militia,</hi> &amp;c. in his <hi>politick</hi> capacity, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he hath it not: Or thus, The <hi>King</hi> cannot ſell the <hi>Revenues</hi> of his Crowne, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Members have the <hi>Intereſt</hi> therein, and may <hi>ſeize</hi> them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> (ſaith Maſter <hi>Pryn) the Ships, Armes and Ammunition ſeized of by the Members, were bought with the Kingdomes Money, And therefore the Members may ſeize them.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi>

               <p>Suppoſe it underſtood, what is the <hi>Kingdomes</hi> Money, and that with ſuch Money, <hi>Ships, Armes,</hi> and <hi>Ammunition</hi> are bought. It ſeemes a good Argument for the <hi>King</hi> to <hi>Seize</hi> them. For He, as King, <note n="a" place="margin">

But by the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> we have no <hi>perſon</hi> or <hi>pollitick</hi> body by the name of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> which is capable to have property, either in Lands or Goods.</p>
               <p>And for the <hi>Members</hi> of the two Houſes, as Parliament men, they have not any <hi>politick Capacity,</hi> they are not a <hi>body</hi> to <hi>ſue,</hi> or to be <hi>ſued,</hi> nor are <hi>capable</hi> to buy or ſell, nor have <hi>property</hi> in any eſtate; And conſequently Maſter <hi>Pryn,</hi> by his own Argument, hath as much title to ſeize the foreſaid Ships, Armes and Aummu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, as they.</p>
               <p>Then (ſaith M. <hi>Pryn) the Members ſeized the Ships and Revenues of the Crown, to prevent the arrivall of forraign forces, and a Civill Warre, which they foreſaw.

               </p>
               <p>By this diſcourſe we are told what <hi>moved</hi> the Members to <hi>ſeize</hi> the <hi>Kings Navy,</hi> and the <hi>Revenues</hi> of his Crown, which in effect is thus, <hi>viz.</hi> The Members having <hi>uſurped</hi> an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> power over King and people; and thereby having <hi>deſtroyed</hi> the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> had juſt cauſe, not only to expect <hi>oppoſition</hi> from their own <hi>Soveraign,</hi> but (in his relief) <hi>arrivall</hi> of <hi>forraigne</hi> forces from all the Kings in <hi>Chriſtendome.</hi> For, upon the ſame <hi>grounds,</hi> as the Members made this <hi>ſeizure,</hi> the Subjects of any <hi>King</hi> may doe the like. It is as eaſie for the people of <hi>Spaine, France,</hi> or any other Nation in the world, to ſay they <hi>foreſee</hi> a War, as theſe Members pretend it. And I am certaine, it is as <hi>unlawfull</hi> and <hi>directly</hi> againſt the conſtitutions of <hi>England,</hi> for the Subjects here, to aſſume this power, as for the people of any other <hi>Country</hi> to doe the like to their <hi>King.</hi> Therefore, I grant, it was an act of <hi>Pollicy</hi> for the Members to <hi>ſeize</hi> the <hi>Kings Ships,</hi> and the <hi>Revenues</hi> of His <hi>Crown;</hi> It was a great and principle means to prevent the <hi>ſuppreſſion</hi> of this their <hi>Rebellion.</hi> But all that proves the <hi>legality</hi> of their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, no more then a <hi>high-way man,</hi> having taken a purſe, <hi>murders</hi> the party <hi>robbed,</hi> to prevent his own diſcovery, makes the <hi>robbery</hi> lawfull. And ſo M. <hi>Pryns</hi> Argument, in effect is but thus. The Members <hi>de facto,</hi> have ſeized the Kings <hi>Ships</hi> and <hi>Revenues</hi> of his Crown, <hi>ergo,</hi> they have done it lawfully.</p>
               <p>Thus in Anſwer to Maſter <hi>Pryns</hi> Arguments, whereby he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to prove, that the Members have power over the <hi>Militia,</hi> &amp;c. But that they have no <hi>colour</hi> to claime any Authority therein, further appeares thus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, all men muſt grant, That ſo long as the <hi>people</hi> have been <hi>governed</hi> by a Law, ſo long the power of the <hi>Militia</hi> muſt have been in ſome; But the people of <hi>England</hi> (as before appears) have been governed by a Monarchicall power, above 1200 <hi>yeares</hi> before the <hi>inſtitution</hi> of the two Houſes: And all that while the Kings of <hi>England</hi> for the time being, and none elſe have executed that Authority, Therefore not in the Members.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is abſolutely neceſſary, that the power of the <hi>Milit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> be in ſuch hands, as may at all times provide againſt approaching
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54815:53"/>
dangers to the Common-wealth. But that cannot be the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> they are not <hi>in eſſe</hi> out of Parliament. Suppoſe this <hi>Nation</hi> (in the <hi>vacancy</hi> of a Parliament) be ſuddenly <hi>invaded</hi> by a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne enemy, or <hi>infeſted</hi> by a <hi>domeſtick inſurrection:</hi> If none have power to command the people to <hi>aſſemble,</hi> and make <hi>reſiſtance,</hi> untill the ſummoning of the two Houſes of Parliament, nothing but <hi>diſtraction</hi> to <hi>King</hi> and <hi>people</hi> can be expected.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Compoſier</hi> of theſe Members (being two diſtinct bodies) conſidered, it is as <hi>prepostrous</hi> for them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the <hi>Militia,</hi> as to have the <hi>Soveraigne</hi> power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to judge the Law. It may fall out (even in the time of greateſt danger) that <hi>one Houſe</hi> ſhall Vote <hi>to fight,</hi> the other <hi>not to fight,</hi> the enemy: And this difference may happen to be <hi>unrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled,</hi> untill the Nation be <hi>conquered</hi> or <hi>deſtroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it appears that the <hi>Members</hi> have no power over the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia:</hi> It now reſts to prove, that it is the <hi>Kings</hi> right, which is made good by <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, for <hi>authority,</hi> it is proved by <hi>conſtant practiſe,</hi> which is not onely the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> proof in our Law, but it is <hi>the Law it ſelfe.</hi> We have no formall <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of the Common Law, it is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but <hi>common, Ancient,</hi> and <hi>frequent uſe.</hi> For example, it is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coke</hi> 9. fo. 75. <hi>Dyer.</hi> fo.</note> felony <hi>to ſteale,</hi> it is not felony of <hi>death,</hi> unleſſe the thing ſtolen, <hi>exceede</hi> the value of <hi>twelve pence;</hi> Theſe are things ſo certainly knowne, and ſo generally received for Law, as that any man to <hi>diſpute</hi> them, renders himſelf <hi>ridiculous:</hi> yet being denied, none can ſhew when the Law began, <hi>how,</hi> or by what <hi>authority</hi> it was made, there is no other proof to make it good, but <hi>cuſtome</hi> and <hi>uſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So for the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdome, it was never eſtated upon the <hi>King</hi> by <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament; or by any other <hi>conſtitution.</hi> It is His <hi>right</hi> by the <hi>Common</hi> Law of <hi>England</hi> which is made <hi>good</hi> by <hi>custome</hi> and <hi>uſe,</hi> and <hi>authorities</hi> of bookes.</p>
               <p>And firſt for <hi>cuſtome</hi> and <hi>uſe;</hi> Any man of what <hi>quality</hi> or <hi>ranke</hi> ſoever he be, reflecting upon his owne memory, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, muſt acknowledge, that in all his time, no <hi>Souldiers</hi> were <hi>impreſſed, armed, arrayed,</hi> or <hi>muſtered,</hi> no <hi>Forts, ſtrong-holds,</hi> or <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

either <hi>Forraigne,</hi> or <hi>Domeſtick,</hi> or concerning the <hi>adminiſtration</hi> of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> but by authority <hi>derived</hi> from the <hi>King alone.</hi> And ſuch as ſearch the <hi>Records</hi> in former times, will finde the like <hi>practiſe</hi> in all ages. And with this agrees all <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> and <hi>ſtories,</hi> from this day upward unto the <hi>Roman</hi> Conqueſt.</p>
               <p>Then for <hi>authorities,</hi> and to begin with Acts of Parliament, <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> granted about 440. years ſince, not onely being the <hi>firſt</hi> Statute, but beyond it there is ſcarce an <hi>authentick</hi> record of Law at this day to be found: In which <hi>Act,</hi> it is thus declared by King <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. viz. <hi>And if We do lead, or ſend him (who is by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure to defend a Caſtle) in an Army, he ſhall be free from Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, from the time that he ſhall be with us in fee in our Hoſt, for the which he hath done ſervice in our Wars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>even</hi> in that <hi>Inſtrument</hi> whereby the <hi>King</hi> confirmed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people their Liberties; It appears, that by the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Land, the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> was the <hi>Kings ſole</hi> right.</p>

               <p>Every man may be ſatisfied, theſe men have <hi>ſpoke</hi> what they can to maintaine this their <hi>pretended</hi> Right; yet theſe their <hi>Votes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duely examined, every indifferent perſon will thereby, rather think that the <hi>Devill</hi> himſelf, who hath long <hi>owed</hi> them a <hi>ſhame,</hi> hath now paid that debt, then by theſe <hi>Votes</hi> be drawn to believe the Members <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, for their <hi>ſuppoſed Verdict</hi> to be given by <hi>God himſelf.</hi> Their
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54815:55"/>
Argument therein, is ſutable to that of the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> whoſe examples and preſidents I preſume they follow. The <hi>Jewes</hi> (even to this day) <hi>audaciouſly</hi> ſcoffe and taunt us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> for receiving <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> for our <hi>Meſſias;</hi> becauſe upon the Croſſe, he being required by them to manifeſt his authority by ſaving himſelf; and thereupon, then offering to believe his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which he did not: Therefore the <hi>wicked Jewes</hi> concluded they could not. And the Turkes, for the ſpace of 1000. yeares paſt, to make good their Doctrine of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and their claime to be the only <hi>Monarch</hi> of the World, much inſult upon the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for their Victories obtained againſt them, whereby we cannot deny, but they doe poſſeſſe (amongſt infinite other Kingdomes and Countries wreſted from Chriſtian Kings) the places, both of the <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Paſſion</hi> of our <hi>Saviour.</hi> And upon this, the <hi>Turks</hi> infer, that God hath <hi>Judged</hi> the cauſe for them, againſt the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that difference which is to be found between the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> and theſe of the <hi>Zelots</hi> at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> renders the latter to be the greater <hi>Blaſphemous.</hi> They (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughly wickedly proteſting againſt Chriſt) purſued their <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> Neither <hi>Turk</hi> nor <hi>Jew</hi> (for any thing appeares) did know, or believe <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> Theſe <hi>hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> make uſe of the name of <hi>God himſelf,</hi> and to eſtabliſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their <hi>uſurped</hi> poſſeſſions, with <hi>inſolent boldneſſe</hi> call him to teſtifie, nay affirme, that God (in this point of the <hi>Militia)</hi> hath given his <hi>Verdict</hi> for them, and againſt the King, which themſelves doe not only know, but have acknowledged to be the Kings Right.</p>
               <p>And having with this <hi>ſemblance</hi> of <hi>ſanctity,</hi> prepared the People with this forged <hi>Verdict:</hi> Then they Vote reaſons to perſwade the vulgar; That for the King to have the <hi>Militia,</hi> tends to their <hi>deſtruction;</hi> but that Authority being placed in the Members, the people are (if we may believe them) ſecured from harme. But of their owne ſhewing the expreſſe contrary, Appeares,</p>
               <p>Firſt, they tell us, (as the truth is) <hi>that by the Laws of</hi> England, <hi>the King hath not power by himſelf alone, to tax or impoſe payments of money upon the Subject; therefore ſay they,</hi> (mark this conſequence) <hi>ſo long as the Law is therein obſerved, the Kings having of the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, is not effectuall to the Kingdome: Hence it followeth,</hi> (by the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54815:55"/>
Members own Argument) that if the <hi>King</hi> had an Arbitrary power, then the <hi>Militia</hi> were his own.</p>
               <p>So that, by the <hi>Members Doctrine,</hi> none but <hi>Tyrants</hi> have title to the power of the Sword, which I confeſſe is a foundation <hi>aptly</hi> laid for their own <hi>ſtructure.</hi> All the world will witneſſe for them, that in point of <hi>Tyranny,</hi> the <hi>malice</hi> of man, with the adviſe and aſſiſtance of all the <hi>devils</hi> in hell, cannot out-ſtrip them: Let the <hi>Members</hi> ſearch Hiſtories and Stories, Preſidents and Examples, from the firſt <hi>Creation</hi> untill this Parliament, and not <hi>onely</hi> of this Nation, but throughout the face of the <hi>whole Earth;</hi> and I defie the moſt <hi>vigilant</hi> amongſt them, to finde one <hi>Tyrannicall</hi> act, which theſe Members (ſince their uſurpation upon the King) have not <hi>done,</hi> or audatiouſly <hi>claimed</hi> by the Law of the Land to have power to execute.</p>
               <p>Thus appeares the different condition of the people, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Militia</hi> under the Kings Government, and this under the Members. By that under the <hi>King,</hi> whilſt the people ſubmit unto their <hi>lawfull Superiors,</hi> and obey the juſt <hi>Sentence</hi> of Law; there is no need of the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Sword,</hi> for the <hi>King</hi> neither hath, nor claimes Authority by the <hi>Militia</hi> to <hi>force</hi> his Subjects to make payment of money, or to doe any one thing more, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then the known Law commands. We are not Governed by the <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> but under Him, according as the Law of the Land directs: And the uſe of the <hi>Militia</hi> is no other then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Law. And therefore, in caſe of <hi>diſobedience,</hi> to compell <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> thereunto; wherein the power of the <hi>Sword,</hi> that is, the <hi>Militia</hi> is as neceſſary as the Law it ſelf; for, as the people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be protected in their <hi>perſons, lives</hi> or <hi>eſtates</hi> without the Law, ſo that Law is <hi>fruitleſſe,</hi> where there wants power to put it in <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</hi> Hence it followeth, (even by reaſon it ſelfe) that he, who hath the <hi>Soveraign</hi> power of Government, hath (as an incident inſeperable unto it) the power of the Sword: And by our Law, the King hath the <hi>Soveraignty.</hi> From him (as before appeares) is due to the people, <hi>protection</hi> of their <hi>perſons</hi> and <hi>Eſtates;</hi> That, by <note place="margin">

their <hi>duty,</hi> both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People</hi> are deſtroyed: Therefore to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our King the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Realme, is no leſſe an <hi>abſurdity,</hi> then to appoint a <hi>Generall</hi> of an Army, with commands to fight an approaching Enemy, and to deny that <hi>Generall</hi> uſe of Armes, and power to command his Souldiers.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, to give the <hi>Militia</hi> unto the Members, is the ſame, as to put the Sword into the hands of a <hi>mad-man;</hi> for, as the one hath no <hi>reaſon</hi> to reſtrain himſelf from doing miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, ſo the Members are not guided by any <hi>known Law,</hi> but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>uſurped</hi> an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> power over King and Subject, we finde (by our wofull experience) make uſe of the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Sword</hi> to compell the people to ſubmit unto their inſatiable luſts; Witneſſe, (beſides the infinite murders and ſlaughters of the people) the vaſt ſummes of money theſe Members, ſince this Parliament by the power of the Sword have <hi>unlawfully wreſted</hi> from the Subject, which being <hi>juſtly</hi> caſt up, would amount to more then all the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies</hi> &amp; <hi>grants</hi> of that nature given unto all the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> for the ſpace of 500. <hi>yeares</hi> before that.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter, clear it is, the <hi>Militia</hi> of the <hi>Realme,</hi> by the known Law of the Land, is the <hi>ſole</hi> and onely Right of the King.

thoſe Commands, wherein the Law of all things abhors <hi>force,</hi> and enjoynes <hi>peace,</hi> which Peace, by the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> is called the <hi>Kings Peace.</hi> Therefore in every Indictment for <hi>Murder, Felony,</hi> or <hi>Treſpaſſe</hi> done upon the perſon, or eſtate of a ſubject; Theſe words, <hi>viz. contra pacem domini Regis nunc Coronam &amp; dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatem ſuam;</hi> ought to be expreſſed: for, although the <hi>fact</hi> be done <hi>immediately</hi> againſt a <hi>Subject,</hi> yet it trencheth againſt the <hi>Kings Authority,</hi> His Law is thereby broken; And the <hi>Lawes of England</hi> not onely <hi>protects</hi> the <hi>Kings Perſon</hi> from violence, but preſerves Him in His <hi>Royall</hi> Throne and Government.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if any perſons in this Kingdome, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or aſſent of the <hi>King,</hi> raiſe <hi>Forces, Powers,</hi> or <hi>Armes,</hi> (be it upon what pretence ſoever) it is a <hi>Warre</hi> levied againſt the <hi>Kings</hi> Authority, His <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Dignity.</hi> For in that, the Subject aſſumes the Regall power of the <hi>King.</hi>

               <p>The next Queſtion is, what the Law declares this offence to be. And that appeares by the <hi>Statute</hi> of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. in theſe words. <note place="margin">25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. c. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Whereas divers opinions,</hi> have been before this time, in what caſe <hi>Treaſon</hi> ſhall be ſaid, and in what not: The King, at the <hi>requeſt</hi> of the <hi>Lords,</hi> and of the <hi>Commons,</hi> hath made a <hi>Declaration</hi> in this manner. <hi>When a man doth compaſſe or imagine the death of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne Lord the King, or of my Lady the Queen, or of their Eldeſt Sonne and Heire; or if a man do levy War againſt our Soveraigne Lord the King in this Realme, or be adherent to the Kings Enemies in this Realme, giving aide or comfort in the Realme, or elſewhere; and thereof, be probably attainted of open deed, by people of their condition, &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>By this, clear it is, That it is <hi>Treaſon</hi> to <hi>Levy War</hi> againſt the King, to <hi>compaſſe</hi> or <hi>imagine</hi> the death of the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> or <hi>Prince,</hi> to <hi>adhere</hi> unto, or aide the <hi>Kings</hi> Enemies: Of all which,

               <p>This Title is like his whole diſcourſe, <hi>totally,</hi> either impertinent or falſe.</p>
               <p>This is not the <hi>Parliaments War,</hi> but a <hi>War</hi> of the <hi>Members</hi> of the two Houſes. Nor is it a War on the Members behalf <hi>defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,</hi> but <hi>offenſive;</hi> which (omitting to expreſſe, when, and by whom the Armies and Forces were firſt raiſed, that being obvious to all men) appeares by conſidering the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the Warre, which was thus.</p>
               <p>The Members having <hi>formed</hi> a Law, to take out of the Crown, the power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> and to ſettle it in themſelves, the <hi>King</hi> refuſed to conſent unto it; which <hi>refuſall</hi> was the <hi>ground</hi>

But the <hi>Members</hi> had no way to <hi>gain</hi> their ends, but by <hi>force,</hi> and ſo <hi>began</hi> the War.</p>
               <p>Then Maſter <hi>Prin</hi> proceeds, to prove that this Warre of the Members is not Treaſon: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they intended no violence to the Kings Perſon, His Crown or Dignity, onely to reſcue Him from His Cavaleers, and bring Him backe to His Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>It is true, ſometimes the <hi>intent</hi> of the party committing the fact, alters the caſe. <hi>For example.</hi> A man travelling, the <hi>paſſage</hi> is ſtopt by water: And finding a <hi>horſe</hi> there, makes uſe thereof, to get over the water. This is not <hi>Felony:</hi> But it is a <hi>Treſpaas.</hi> Suppoſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54815:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this party <hi>indicted</hi> for <hi>felony,</hi> at his triall, it is pertinent for him to <hi>confeſſe</hi> the fact, That he uſed the <hi>horſe,</hi> and by <hi>circumſtances</hi> to make it appear, he intended thereby <hi>onely</hi> to get over the water, and ſo to quit himſelf of the <hi>fellony.</hi> But this man being indicted onely for a <hi>Treſpaſſe,</hi> for him to <hi>confeſſe</hi> he uſed the horſe to get over the water, alledging he could not otherwiſe have paſſed, thereby to <hi>quit</hi> himſelf of the <hi>Treſpas</hi> were <hi>fooliſh.</hi> So here, <hi>raiſing</hi> of <hi>Armies</hi> againſt the Kings Command, conducting them into the field, &amp;c. is confeſſed. But (ſaith M. <hi>Pryn)</hi> that is not <hi>Treaſon,</hi> for they <hi>intended no harme</hi> to the Kings Perſon, His <hi>Crown</hi> or <hi>Dignity.</hi> Which is a <hi>fond contradiction,</hi> for admitting they intended no harme to the <hi>Kings Perſon,</hi> the fact confeſſed, is a harme to His <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Dignity.</hi> And that in the <hi>higheſt</hi> nature that may be; It is a <hi>Warre</hi> Levied againſt Him, and His Regall Authority, which by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>High Treaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Raviliake,</hi> who killed the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> upon M. <hi>Pryns</hi> ground, might have <hi>juſtified</hi> the fact. Although he had confeſſed to have <hi>willfully</hi> killed that <hi>King,</hi> yet he might with as much truth and ſenſe, have ſaid, he <hi>intended</hi> not to hurt the Kings Perſon. As M. <hi>Pryn,</hi> firſt confeſſing the foreſaid facts of <hi>Levying</hi> Warre, doth deny an <hi>intent</hi> to harme the <hi>King</hi> in His <hi>Crowne</hi> or <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then for <hi>reſcuing</hi> the King from His <hi>Cavaleers.</hi> If M. <hi>Pryn</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the caſe of <hi>Robert Earl of Eſſex,</hi> in the time of <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> he will finde, That that <hi>Earl (in compariſon of Edg-hill Battaile)</hi> gathered together but a <hi>handfull</hi> of men, nor was that <hi>Queen</hi> fought with, nor her <hi>Perſon</hi> in danger. All which things the foreſaide <hi>Earl,</hi> at his Arraignment alledged for himſelf, And proteſted his intent was <hi>onely</hi> to remove from the <hi>Queen,</hi> ſome evill Councellors about her, yet not available. The fact by him <hi>confeſſed, viz.</hi> without warrant from the Queen, in a <hi>tumultuous</hi> manner, to raiſe force, was <hi>Judged Treaſon,</hi> for which, that <hi>Earl,</hi> and his <hi>Adherents</hi> were executed as Traitors.</p>
               <p>Thus for the point of <hi>Levying Warre</hi> againſt the King. Then for <hi>imagining</hi> the death of the <hi>King, Queen,</hi> and <hi>Prince,</hi> In this caſe the <hi>intent</hi> of the party acting is conſiderable. <hi>For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> ſuppoſe the <hi>King</hi> to be <hi>diſtracted</hi> or <hi>diſtempered,</hi> endeavours to <hi>violate</hi> himſelf, or aſſaults a Subject. To lay hands upon the <hi>King,</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:54815:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to preſerve His, or the <hi>Subjects</hi> life, in thoſe caſes, and ſuch like, the <hi>facts</hi> are <hi>lawfull.</hi> And it may ſo happen, that the <hi>King</hi> may be <hi>ſlaine,</hi> and yet no <hi>Treaſon:</hi> As in caſe of <hi>tilting,</hi> and ſuch like. Now the intent of any man cannot appeare, otherwiſe then by the parties <hi>confeſſion,</hi> or by <hi>Proofes, Circumstances,</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then for the <hi>Authors</hi> and <hi>Actors</hi> in this War; It is true, they deny an intention to <hi>kill</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Queen,</hi> or <hi>Prince.</hi> But the <hi>Circumstances</hi> are as full and <hi>pregnant</hi> to prove they intended it, as is poſſible.</p>
               <p>A man ſeeme to come out of a houſe with a <hi>naked ſword bloody,</hi> none being in the houſe but the <hi>Corps</hi> of a <hi>dead</hi> body newly ſlaine with a Sword. This is ſo <hi>pregnant</hi> a preſumption, as that, before a juſt Judge, and an equall Jury, the mans deniall will not availe him.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe one ſhould aſſault and ſtrike the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Queen,</hi> or <hi>Prince,</hi> and with <hi>violence</hi> purſue the ſame, and for this, be indicted to have <hi>imagined</hi> their <hi>death;</hi> for that man to <hi>alleadge,</hi> he intended not to kill him or them ſo aſſaulted, were in vaine. But certainly the <hi>preſumptions</hi> to prove the <hi>Authors,</hi> and <hi>Actors</hi> of this War, intended to kill the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> and <hi>Prince,</hi> are far more preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Suppoſe the Members and their Souldiers had <hi>declared</hi> their <hi>intent</hi> to be, to kill them; no man can <hi>deviſe</hi> how they could have endeavoured to have <hi>effected</hi> it, <hi>more</hi> then hath been done by this <hi>Warre.</hi> Severall <hi>Battailes</hi> have been joyned, the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> in perſon. And many thouſands on the <hi>Kings</hi> party ſlaine: And for the <hi>Queen,</hi> witneſſe the buſineſſe at <hi>Burlington.</hi> The <hi>Authors</hi> and <hi>Actors</hi> of the <hi>powder-plot,</hi> were <hi>juſtly</hi> condemned for <hi>Treaſon.</hi> Upon that point of <hi>imagining</hi> to kill the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Queen,</hi> and and <hi>Prince.</hi> But upon this ground of M. <hi>Pryns,</hi> they might have eſcaped puniſhment. It had been as eaſie for them to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that they intended not to kill the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Queene,</hi> and Prince, As for the <hi>Actors</hi> in this Warre, to pretend it.</p>

               <p>I confeſſe, if <hi>preſidents</hi> and <hi>examples</hi> of this kinde, be Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to prove the <hi>facts lawfull:</hi> It is eaſie enough to juſtifie this, and every <hi>Rebellion:</hi> And M. <hi>Pryn</hi> having cited that preſident of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> and himſelf acknowledging that fact to be <hi>murder,</hi> he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeen to omit citing that of <hi>Judas,</hi> for it was ſomewhat later in time, it <hi>excels</hi> that fact againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and is very <hi>ſutable</hi> with this of the Members. He <hi>betrayed his Maſter,</hi> and the Saviour of the world with a <hi>Kiſſe;</hi> theſe, their Soveraigne with an <hi>Oath.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</note> And like unto thoſe <hi>Treaſons</hi> and <hi>Murders</hi> againſt <hi>Caeſar:</hi> King <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. and King <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. they might very aptly have cited the examples of ſome of their deare <hi>brethren</hi> the <hi>Scots;</hi> ſeverall King have been <hi>Rebelled</hi> againſt, and <hi>Murdred</hi> too, by the Subjects of that Nation: Yet we ſee they are not (by the people of <hi>Scotland)</hi> made <hi>examples,</hi> or cited for <hi>Authorities,</hi> to prove the lawfulneſſe thereof. But contrarywiſe, That Nation doth <hi>unanimouſly</hi> declare it their duty to <hi>relieve</hi> and <hi>reſcue</hi> their King from out of the hands of His <hi>Rebellious Engliſh</hi> Subjects. And <hi>many</hi> other <hi>exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> I confeſſe there be in <hi>forraigne</hi> Countries, both <hi>Chriſtians, Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidells,</hi> where <hi>Kings,</hi> by their own <hi>Subjects,</hi> have been <hi>betrayed</hi> and <hi>murdered.</hi> And ſo the <hi>diſcontented people</hi> in any Nation, may alledge, that King <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. &amp; <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. of <hi>England,</hi> being lawfull Kings, were by their owne Subjects, <hi>Rebelled</hi> againſt, and <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</hi> And ſo (be the ſcene in <hi>Spaine, France,</hi> or any other Kingdome) conclude it is lawfull for them to doe the like.</p>
               <p>Then M. <hi>Pryn</hi> explaines the meaning of the aforeſaid <hi>Statute</hi> of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. by which it is declared <hi>to be Treaſon to Levy Warre againſt the King, to compaſſe, or imagine the death of the King, the Queen, or Prince.</hi> But the words of the foreſaid Act (ſaith he) <hi>muſt be underſtood with this Limitation,</hi> viz. <hi>ſo long as Kings execute their Juſt Royall powers, according to the Laws of God, and of their Realmes, that (ſaith he) is the meaning of the holy Ghoſt. And even ſo, ſaith he, are theſe words of Saint</hi> Paul, <hi>viz. (let every Soul be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the higher powers) to be underſtood with that limitation, yet</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:54815:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(ſaith he) <hi>No private man of his owne authority, ought to riſe in Armes againſt them, without the generall conſent of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or both Houſes of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was a <hi>doctrine</hi> aptly divulged for the juſtification of this <hi>Rebellion:</hi> And a ready way I confeſſe to draw the <hi>multitude</hi> to their party, who oftentimes are (as in this caſe they were) miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, upon pretence of <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> to their owne ruine.</p>
               <p>Now admit the Members to have <hi>got</hi> the <hi>Soveraigne</hi> power. If Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> be asked this queſtion, How he will have the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> now to ſpeake? If the Members make a <hi>Law,</hi> and declare it <hi>Treaſon</hi> for the people to <hi>leavy War</hi> againſt them, whether that Law ſhall be underſtood with the ſame <hi>limitation.</hi> Mr. <hi>Pryns</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer will be, that the <hi>limitation</hi> is now ended. The Members he will ſay muſt <hi>expound</hi> the meaning of their <hi>owne</hi> Law, and S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words too. For the Members themſelves tell the people, that they are the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> whatever they do they would have us beleeve to be the act of every <hi>perſon</hi> in the <hi>whole</hi> Nation. And ſo not <hi>exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable,</hi> but by God himſelfe in the next world; ſo that the <note place="margin">Declaration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Scots</hi> Papers.</note> 
                  <hi>Members</hi> having got the <hi>power</hi> into their <hi>owne</hi> hands, whether they <hi>governe</hi> by the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>man,</hi> although they be the <hi>greatest</hi> Tyrants in the <hi>world,</hi> &amp; the <hi>highest perſecutors</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> be it either <hi>ſpirituall</hi> or <hi>temporall,</hi> although never ſo pernicious, to foul, or body, it muſt be admitted for <hi>good Law</hi> and <hi>true Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the people (being <hi>drawne</hi> to <hi>recede</hi> from their true <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)</hi> have <hi>occaſioned</hi> their owne <hi>confuſion;</hi> Whereas by their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Laws of the Realme, theſe <hi>diſtractions</hi> have been avoyded. For by the <hi>conſtitutions</hi> of this Kingdome, both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Subject</hi> are <hi>regulated</hi> by a <hi>knowne Law,</hi> which Law, permits neither King, nor people to be <hi>Judge</hi> in their owne caſe.</p>
               <p>If one Subject <hi>wrongfully impriſon</hi> the perſon of another, <hi>ſeize</hi> his Lands, or <hi>take</hi> away his goods, the party <hi>injured,</hi> hath his legall remedy, but is not permitted to be his <hi>owne carver, or revenger:</hi> if he for his owne ſatisfaction, <hi>kill</hi> his adverſary, it is <hi>murder;</hi> If he ſeize his Lands, or take his goods, it is a <hi>treſpaſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in the <hi>Kings</hi> caſe, If by <hi>His Command,</hi> any <hi>Subject</hi> be <hi>impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned,</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:54815:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or his <hi>eſtate</hi> taken from him, againſt the <hi>rules</hi> of the <hi>knowne</hi> Law, that <hi>Subject</hi> hath his <hi>legall</hi> remedy againſt the Kings <hi>miniſters,</hi> wherein, neither the <hi>King</hi> nor his officers, are Judge. Therefore, if that Subject thus <hi>injured,</hi> ſhould, to <hi>revenge</hi> himſelf kill the <hi>King,</hi> or ſeize His Revenues, it were a moſt <hi>barbarous</hi> and <hi>unjuſt</hi> Law, not to condemne this Act <hi>unlawfull.</hi> And that being admitted, it muſt be <hi>unlawfull</hi> to <hi>attempt</hi> His death, or to <hi>leavy War</hi> againſt Him, for any ſuch cauſe; And conſequently all thoſe <hi>facts</hi> (although committed upon the grounds aforeſaid) are <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that <hi>perſon</hi> who conceives himſelfe to be moſt highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, being required to ſet downe the <hi>motives</hi> of his taking up <hi>Armes</hi> againſt the <hi>King,</hi> his <hi>pretence</hi> can be no other then this. That his <hi>perſon</hi> hath been <hi>impriſoned,</hi> his Lands <hi>ſeized,</hi> and his goods <hi>taken</hi> from him. And this (in his judgement) againſt Law, none but <hi>Brutes</hi> can conclude, theſe are legall <hi>juſtifications</hi> to act, and do, ſuch things againſt their <hi>King.</hi> And ſo conſequently the <hi>authors</hi> and <hi>actors</hi> of this War, are guilty of Treaſon.</p>
               <p>But ſaith Mr. Pryn, <hi>The Parliament is not within the meaning of this Statute of</hi> 25 Ed. 3. <hi>Therefore not Treaſon for the Members to ſeize the Kings Forts, Armes, Ammunition and Revenues of the Crowne, for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the King is a Member of the Parliament, and therefore if the Parliament could commit Treaſon, the King ſhould commit Treaſon againſt himſelf: And</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Parliament is a corporation and a Court of Juſtice, and ſo not capable of the guilt of Treaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moſt true it is, That the <hi>King</hi> is <hi>exempt</hi> from the guilt of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for all <hi>Treaſons</hi> are committed <hi>againſt Him.</hi> But every <hi>Subject</hi> (which includes all the reſt of the people) is <hi>capable,</hi> both to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> the fact, and is <hi>ſubject</hi> to <hi>puniſhment</hi> for the ſame. And herein there is no <hi>difference</hi> of <hi>perſons.</hi> It is no more lawfull for a <hi>Peere,</hi> then for a <hi>pezant,</hi> to commit that crime, the <hi>place where</hi> alters not the nature of that <hi>fact,</hi> nor doth it <hi>availe</hi> the actors, in being <hi>Members</hi> of any <hi>Aſſembly, Corporation, body politick,</hi> or <hi>Court of Juſtice.</hi> For every one of theſe Members, or perſons, beſides their <hi>pollitick capacity,</hi> hath a <hi>naturall capacity</hi> too. In which <hi>capacity,</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:54815:61"/>
he is ſubject to the <hi>frailties</hi> of man, he may <hi>actually</hi> breake the Law, and <hi>paſſively</hi> ſuffer for it. But <note n="b" place="margin">

Therefore when the Members of the <hi>two Houſes</hi> in a Parliamentary way, paſſe a Bill, which the <hi>King confirmes</hi> with His <hi>Royall</hi> Aſſent; Abſurd it were to thinke this could be an <hi>Act</hi> of Treaſon.</p>
               <p>And ſo it is for the <hi>Judges</hi> of every <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> keeping themſelves within their <hi>juriſdiction,</hi> they cannot, in the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of their owne <hi>Court,</hi> commit <hi>Treaſon.</hi> And the like holds with all <hi>Corporations</hi> and <hi>bodies politick.</hi> But if a Member in <hi>either Houſe aſſault</hi> or <hi>ſtrike</hi> his fellow Member, that is a <hi>treſpaſſe,</hi> and <hi>wilfully</hi> to <hi>kill</hi> him, is murther: And by the ſame reaſon, to kill the <hi>King,</hi> although within the <hi>wals</hi> of the Houſe, is <hi>Treaſon;</hi> And that being granted, it followeth that to <hi>imagine</hi> His death, or <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> to kill the <hi>King,</hi> or agree to levy War againſt Him, although in that place, is <hi>Treaſon</hi> in ſuch Members.</p>
               <p>And herein no <hi>formall,</hi> or <hi>ſeeming</hi> Parliamentary proceedings, will <hi>alter</hi> the caſe.

               <head>CHAP. X. <hi>That the Subjects of this Nation are not onely commanded from doing violence to the Kings Perſon, or prejudice to His Authority, but are obliged with their lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes to aſsiſt and preſerve His Perſon and Juſt Rights from the fury of His enemies, both forraigne and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ALL the people of this Nation are divided thus, <hi>viz. King</hi> and <hi>Subject;</hi> which of it ſelf is proof ſufficient to make this good. The word <hi>King,</hi> (as before appears) implies a <hi>duty</hi> in the <hi>King,</hi> to protect His people; and the word <hi>Subject,</hi> a duty in them to aſſiſt Him. By the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> for a ſervant to kill his <hi>Maſter,</hi> is an offence of a higher nature, and the puniſhment for it, more ſevere then for the meaneſt Subject (without ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of ſervice) to kill the greateſt <hi>Peere;</hi> for, beſides the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination</hi> between them, a truſt is implyed, the breach whereof, (by an act of that nature) by the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> is petty Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Beſides, the Law expects from the ſervant, a perſonall aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to preſerve his Maſter from <hi>violence</hi> or hurt; and in that regard, the <hi>Maſter</hi> being aſſaulted, the ſervant, by the Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> may juſtifie to reſiſt the aſſailant, in defence of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters perſon. And between the <hi>King</hi> and His <hi>Subjects,</hi> the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination</hi> and <hi>Subjection</hi> is of a far higher nature. The <hi>truſt</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the <hi>Subject,</hi> and his duty to the King, is far more <hi>tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:</hi> the <hi>King</hi> being head of the weal publick. By <hi>violating</hi> his perſon (ſaith our Law) every Member of the Common-wealth ſuffers: Therefore in aſſiſting Him, we doe defend our ſelves.</p>
               <p>He is <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> we are His naturall born <hi>Subjects,</hi> and ſo by the Law of nature, obliged to <hi>preſerve</hi> Him from injury.</p>
               <p>Now the perſon of my <hi>Soveraigne Leige Lord the King,</hi> by an unnaturall Warre, raiſed and proſecuted by His owne Subjects, being aſſaulted, and <hi>Warre</hi> made againſt His <hi>Crowne</hi> and <hi>Dignity;</hi> And the <hi>King,</hi> having by His <hi>Proclamations</hi> ſummoned His <hi>Loyall</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>That the perſons at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>who call themſelves the Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>are not the two Houſes, nor Members of the Parliament.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN my foreſaid Treatiſe, I have (by way of <hi>admittance)</hi> granted theſe men at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to be the <hi>two Houſes of Parliament.</hi> The Houſes, from their firſt Aſſembling, to have been <hi>compleatly</hi> full, To have <hi>unanimouſly</hi> concurred in Votes, and every Member, to have conſented unto all thoſe <hi>horrid</hi> things, acted in the name of the Parliament. And in caſe it had ſo fallen out, ſtill the Law (in every particular before mentioned) had been the ſame; That concurrence of the Members had nothing altered the caſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſure without <hi>diſhonouring</hi> the two Houſes of Parliament; <hi>inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> (in a manner) the whole <hi>Peereage,</hi> and the <hi>far</hi> greater number of the <hi>Members</hi> duly elected of the Commons Houſe: I cannot omit, Firſt, to expreſſe the cauſe of theſe my admittances. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to ſhew that theſe men at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> (who now aſſume the name and power thereof) are ſo far from being the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of England,</hi> as that they are neither the two Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor <hi>Members</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, had I, at the beginning fallen upon theſe queſtions;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54815:64"/>
whether <hi>Members,</hi> or not <hi>Members, Houſes,</hi> or no <hi>Houſes;</hi> I had thereby <hi>barred</hi> all further progreſſe in that my Treatiſe. For, if no Houſes of Parliament, then <hi>no diſpute</hi> can ariſe, what <hi>votes</hi> or <hi>procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi> of the Members are valid, and which voide. Therefore to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce theſe queſtions, <hi>viz.</hi> what is a Parliament, the Authority, and uſe thereof? The proper <hi>office</hi> of either Houſe <hi>ſingly,</hi> and of both Houſes <hi>joyntly</hi> without the King. I granted (but that I ſay only by way of admittance) the foreſaid perſons to be the <hi>two Houſes</hi> of Parliament: and to have all <hi>powers,</hi> and <hi>authorities</hi> due unto thoſe Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>Then for the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe men at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> are <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> the two Houſes, <hi>nor</hi> Members of them, is proved thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt clear it is, that the <hi>eſſency</hi> of a <hi>Houſe</hi> of Parliament, doth not conſiſt <hi>meerely</hi> in the legall <hi>aſſembling</hi> of the Members thereof. Beſides that, it is <hi>neceſſarily</hi> required, that <hi>every</hi> Member have <hi>liberty</hi> to <hi>repaire</hi> unto the place of <hi>ſitting:</hi> And there <hi>freely</hi> (according to his <hi>conſcience)</hi> to <hi>Vote,</hi> and deliver his <hi>opinion</hi> in all things <hi>agitated. For example,</hi> a Commiſſion is granted to <hi>twenty,</hi> with power to <hi>them,</hi> or any <hi>five,</hi> or <hi>more</hi> of them, to execute the ſame. Here, although <hi>five,</hi> (if no more appear) have <hi>full</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Yet if <hi>all</hi> be <hi>preſent,</hi> and <hi>conſenting</hi> to act, <hi>no five,</hi> nor leſſe then the <hi>whole</hi> twenty have authority. So that if <hi>nineteen</hi> of them <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly</hi> exclude <hi>one,</hi> the proceedings of the <hi>nineteen</hi> are void, which ſtands with great reaſon; for, if <hi>nineteen</hi> may exclude one, <hi>eighteen</hi> may exclude another: And in like manner, <hi>one</hi> by <hi>one</hi> they may expell each other, untill reduced to the laſt man.</p>
               <p>Beſides, <hi>frequent</hi> it is, in every <hi>Aſſembly</hi> conſiſting of many, where the <hi>major part</hi> determineth the queſtion. For the <hi>buſineſſe</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, (of what nature or moment ſoever) to be carried on <hi>either</hi> ſide, by <hi>one</hi> voice. Therefore <hi>injuriouſly</hi> to <hi>exclude</hi> one ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from <hi>Voting,</hi> is as <hi>destructive</hi> to Juſtice as to reject <hi>Two, Three,</hi> or <hi>more:</hi> Yet <hi>herein</hi> let not me be <hi>miſtaken.</hi> I grant, that <hi>either</hi> Houſe of Parliament, <hi>frequently</hi> doth, and may <hi>legally</hi> proceede, although not <hi>compleatly</hi> full. And that <hi>each</hi> Aſſembly, hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (in <hi>ſome caſes)</hi> to <hi>ſuſpend</hi> particular Members from ſitting. But I ſay, that whilſt <hi>either</hi> Houſe, (without lawfull cauſe) <hi>wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> hinders any <hi>one</hi> of their <hi>fellow</hi> Members to <hi>ſit,</hi> or <hi>freely</hi> to <hi>Vote</hi> with them according to his <hi>conſcience:</hi> The <hi>reſt</hi> of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54815:64"/>
of that Aſſembly, (what number ſoever) have not <hi>Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> authority to proceed in any thing. Therefore when a <hi>compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> number of either Houſe is Aſſembled, all thoſe ſo met, and no leſſe (I meane without <hi>expelling</hi> them, or any of them, or <hi>forcing</hi> any ones conſcience) have <hi>power</hi> to performe the office of that Houſe. And the ſame it is if any one legally returned, ſhall (by his fellow-Members) be hindered to repaire unto the Houſe. Thoſe diſturbers do thereby diſable themſelves to act in that Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>Now for <hi>application</hi> to theſe men at <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> It <hi>cannot</hi> be forgotten, But that within <hi>few</hi> dayes after the firſt meeting of the two Houſes, the <hi>election</hi> of many <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> (knowne to be honeſt <hi>moderate</hi> men) were <hi>queſtioned:</hi> Their perſons inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſuſpended</hi> from ſitting; but unto this day, whether <hi>rightfully</hi> or <hi>wrongfully</hi> elected (notwithſtanding all <hi>poſſible</hi> endeavours to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it) not <hi>ſuffered</hi> to be determined. Therefore <hi>manifeſt</hi> it is, that to be <hi>rid</hi> of thoſe Members <hi>out</hi> of the Houſe, was the onely cauſe of ſuch <hi>queſtions,</hi> and <hi>ſuſpenſions:</hi> But that more <hi>cleerely</hi> appears by the <hi>progreſſe</hi> of the buſineſſe: For not long after thoſe ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by <hi>Order</hi> of the Commons Houſe, <hi>every</hi> Member of that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, whoſe name had been uſed in any <hi>Patent</hi> of <hi>Monopoly,</hi> or <hi>acted</hi> therein, was in words <hi>diſabled</hi> to <hi>ſit</hi> or <hi>Vote</hi> there. And by colour of this Order, divers Members were <hi>expelled,</hi> and <hi>forced</hi> to quit the Houſe: For no other cauſe, but for that their names were uſed in ſome Patents or grants of the King, which grants theſe Members, before and without any legall triall, judgement, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination thereof Voted to be void. Yet (which is a remarkable ſigne of their injuſtice) their <hi>owne babes</hi> of grace, ſuch of them I meane as the <hi>faction</hi> could confide in (although within the <hi>expreſſe</hi> words of that Order, and (at leaſt) as <hi>guilty</hi> of that fact, as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) have <hi>ever</hi> ſince <hi>been,</hi> and ſtill are, <note n="a" place="margin">Mildemay.</note> 
                  <hi>principall</hi> Voters there. Now if theſe Members <hi>expelled</hi> by the foreſaid Order, were <hi>wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully expulſed,</hi> it followeth, that the whole Aſſemby did therby <hi>ſuſpend</hi> it ſelfe from <hi>acting</hi> as the Houſe of Commons; And that they were <hi>wrongfully</hi> expulſed, and <hi>injuriouſly</hi> debarred <hi>ſitting,</hi> or <hi>voting</hi> there, is thus proved.</p>
               <p>No perſon <hi>duly elected,</hi> and <hi>returned</hi> of the Houſe of Commons, can be lawfully <hi>expulſed</hi> that Houſe but for ſuch <hi>cauſe</hi> as by the <hi>Law</hi> of the Land he is diſabled to <hi>ſit</hi> or <hi>Vote</hi> there. But the <hi>cauſe</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:54815:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mentioned in that Order, by which thoſe <hi>Members</hi> were <hi>expulſed,</hi> doth not (by the Law of the Land) <hi>diſable</hi> any man to <hi>ſit,</hi> or <hi>Vote</hi> in the Houſe of Commons, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To deny the <hi>major</hi> cannot enter into the heart of any <hi>honeſt</hi> Engliſh-man. That is <hi>no leſſe</hi> then to give unto the <hi>greater</hi> part of that <hi>Aſſembly</hi> (at all times) an <hi>arbytrary</hi> power, without lawfull cauſe to <hi>expell</hi> thence (although <hi>equally</hi> truſted and <hi>authorized</hi> by <hi>King</hi> and <hi>people</hi> with themſelves) their fellow Members; which being admitted unto them, it followeth, that the <hi>peoples</hi> power of <hi>electing,</hi> is (in effect) taken away: and conſequently no <hi>repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives</hi> in that Houſe. For although it be admitted, that after ſuch <hi>expulſion</hi> the inhabitants ſhall elect againe; The people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>expect</hi> an end of chooſing, untill <hi>returne</hi> be made of ſuch as the preſent <hi>prevalent faction</hi> likes of. And we ſee (almoſt as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as the tyde turnes) that the <hi>faction</hi> of that Houſe <hi>changeth;</hi> And accordingly <hi>expulſions</hi> follow, and <hi>new</hi> elections are made: So that (admitting this power to <hi>expell)</hi> it would eaſe the people of much trouble, for the Members to <hi>indorſe</hi> upon every Writ, the names of ſuch as ſhall be choſen; Or rather, by their Speaker (after a Vote to that purpoſe naming the man) to ſummon him to the Houſe, and ſo as they <hi>Vote out one Member</hi> to <hi>Vote in onother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which in effect is <hi>exerciſed</hi> at preſent. We ſee it is not at <hi>all</hi> conſidered, whether the party <hi>choſen</hi> be <hi>fitly qualified</hi> for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or not. If he be of an <hi>humor</hi> to <hi>concur</hi> in <hi>opinion</hi> with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent faction, good <hi>enough.</hi> Hence it is that we find the <hi>children,</hi> or <hi>kindred</hi> of thoſe who for the time being ſterve the Houſe (of what <hi>age</hi> or <hi>capacity</hi> ſoever) and none elſe are judged fit for the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And ſo admitting this authority in the <hi>major part</hi> of that Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: The iſſuing out of the <hi>Writs,</hi> the peoples <hi>electing,</hi> and the <hi>returning</hi> of the Members, are become but <hi>frivolous,</hi> and <hi>uſeleſſe ceremonies.</hi> Therefore the Members no <hi>repreſentatives;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently <hi>no</hi> Houſe of Parliament.</p>
               <p>And for the <hi>minor,</hi> It needs not the helpe of a <hi>Lawyer</hi> to make it good; every man of the meaneſt <hi>capacity</hi> may judge it. For, if being <hi>named</hi> in a Patent of <hi>Monopoly,</hi> or <hi>acting</hi> therein, becauſe to <hi>diſable</hi> a Member of either Houſe, to <hi>ſit</hi> or <hi>Vote,</hi> it follows, that <hi>no</hi> man in the Kingdome is <hi>qualified</hi> for that ſervice. Every one (in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54815:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>ſome degree)</hi> is guilty of the <hi>breach,</hi> both of the Laws of <hi>God,</hi> and of the <hi>Realme.</hi> Suppoſe another <hi>faction</hi> in that Houſe (happening to be the <hi>major</hi> part preſent) Order, that <hi>every</hi> Member, who in any fort hath <hi>broken</hi> the Kings peace, committed <hi>fornication, ſworne</hi> an Oath, or <hi>tranſgreſſed</hi> the Law of God, or man, be forthwith <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed</hi> the Houſe. If that Order concerning <hi>Monopolies</hi> be binding, abſurd it were to <hi>deny</hi> this to have the <hi>ſame</hi> effect. For every one <hi>comprized</hi> in each Order, is a <hi>tranſgreſſour</hi> of the Law, and <hi>puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhable</hi> according to the <hi>quality</hi> of the offence: But <hi>no</hi> one of them, more then the other, (by the <hi>knowne</hi> Law) is <hi>diſabled</hi> to <hi>ſit,</hi> or <hi>Vote</hi> in the Parliament: He who hath been an <hi>actor</hi> in a <hi>void</hi> Patent of <hi>Monopoly,</hi> is as <hi>capable</hi> to be a Parliament man, as another who hath committed <hi>fornication, adultery, aſſaulted</hi> or <hi>beaten</hi> his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or the like.</p>
               <p>So that, it appears to be the <hi>Order</hi> of the Houſe, and the <hi>will</hi> of the Members, (not the Law of the Land) which doth now (in that Aſſembly) <hi>regulate,</hi> and <hi>ballance</hi> the buſineſſe. Therefore clear it is, that thoſe Members were <hi>wrongfully, injuriouſly,</hi> and <hi>illegally</hi> expulſed the Houſe. So that, if no more were in the caſe, thoſe perſons at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> are <hi>not</hi> the Commons Houſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, The Members finding the aforeſaid Order of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion</hi> far too ſhort, ſtill <hi>appearing</hi> in the Houſe many <hi>honeſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh-men.</hi> It was reſolved to <hi>caſt</hi> them out by <hi>club-law:</hi> It was hereupon <hi>inſinuated</hi> unto the <hi>giddy</hi> multitude, that <hi>ſeverall</hi> Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of each Houſe, oppoſed <hi>reformation,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice.</hi> The <hi>names</hi> of ſuch Members as <hi>diſcent</hi> in Votes from the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the preſent <hi>major</hi> part, are <hi>poſted</hi> in the ſtreets, and <hi>injuriouſly branded</hi> with a <hi>character</hi> of evill affected perſons to reformation. The <hi>people</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon (in great <hi>multitudes)</hi> ſwarme to the <hi>doores</hi> of <hi>both</hi> Houſes, and there (being <hi>prepared</hi> and <hi>inſtructed</hi> accordingly) with hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>noiſe,</hi> clamor againſt <hi>Biſhops, Popiſh Lords,</hi> and <hi>evill</hi> affected Members; And (although moſt ignorant what it is) call for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>violent medicine,</hi> was ſo <hi>long,</hi> and ſo <hi>often</hi> applyed, that the Houſes (according as <hi>empricks</hi> commonly uſe their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients) abſolutely <hi>confounded</hi> their owne bodies; for of above <hi>two hundred Lords,</hi> 5. 6. or 7. at this day is a <hi>compleat</hi> Houſe of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54815:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Peeres:</hi> And in matters of <hi>greateſt</hi> moment, rare it is to have <hi>ten</hi> of that Aſſembly to carry the queſtion. And for the Commons Houſe of 500 <hi>Members, not</hi> 100 of thoſe now permitted to <hi>ſit</hi> or <hi>vote</hi> there (were at any time by the Law of the Land) Parliament men. And ſo unleſſe the whole <hi>World</hi> hath hitherto been miſtaken, in attributing the powers of thoſe Aſſemblies to the <hi>Major</hi> part of the Members, whereas it ought to have been <hi>given</hi> to the leaſt number. And that by the <hi>conſtitution</hi> of the Realme, it is lawfull for a <hi>part</hi> of them by <hi>force,</hi> and without lawfull cauſe, to <hi>drive</hi> from thence, their fellow Members. We have no Houſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament at this day.</p>
               <p>Nor is the caſe of the lower Houſe any thing better by their <hi>excreaſe</hi> of number: That <hi>forgery</hi> of the <hi>Kings Great Seal,</hi> doth no more <hi>authorize</hi> the Inhabitants to elect a <hi>Knight, Citizen</hi> or <hi>Burgeſſe,</hi> then ſhould the Speaker of the <hi>lower Houſe</hi> (in purſuance of the Votes of both Aſſemblies) <hi>counterfeit</hi> a deed in the name of the <hi>Speaker</hi> of the <hi>higher Houſe,</hi> purporting a <hi>conveyance</hi> to himſelf, of that Lords Eſtate, would <hi>legally</hi> intitle him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Beſides, were that no <hi>counterfeit Seal,</hi> The <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of the County, the <hi>free</hi> men of the <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Boroughs</hi> being <hi>depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> of their <hi>freedome</hi> of election, not daring (as before is ſaid) to <hi>chooſe</hi> other, but ſuch as are intimated to them, to be nominated by the Houſe, or the Souldiers; they are not in Law Members of that Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Members,</hi> although reduced to ſo ſmall a number, were not hereby cured of all their griefs: The <hi>haunting Ghoſts,</hi> and <hi>inſeperable Companions</hi> of every Traytor, <hi>(feares</hi> and <hi>Jealouſies)</hi> ſtill ſtick cloſe unto them; by driving from the Houſes, ſuch as <hi>viſibly</hi> oppoſed this work of deſtruction; gave not ſufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to the reſt of their owne <hi>perſeverance</hi> therein. The <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> therfore of every one this <hi>elect little remnant,</hi> in the next place muſt be fettered; wherein ſpeciall uſe is made of that clauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>priviledges</hi> of Parliament, contained both in the <hi>Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Covenant:</hi> The words thereof being generall, to defend <hi>all priviledges,</hi> the Members declared, that by <hi>whom,</hi> and <hi>when</hi> this priviledge is broken; themſelves and none elſe muſt be <hi>Judge,</hi> And like <hi>Judges</hi> in their owne caſe, they have determined the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>no leſſe</hi> to their <hi>own</hi> advantage then by <hi>enthralling,</hi> not only

               <p>Now although the <hi>nature</hi> of this crime is not yet by them defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; it may (at every inſtant time) when they think fit, even by one <hi>blaſt</hi> of winde be made to <hi>exceed</hi> the higheſt Treaſon: So that, moſt clear it is, after theſe Votes, no man indued with <hi>honeſty</hi> or <hi>courage,</hi> could with ſafety, <hi>ſit</hi> or <hi>vote</hi> in either Houſe; Every one not of the <hi>tribe,</hi> (unleſſe he run into his own <hi>ruine)</hi> muſt ſtand mute untill the deſign of the preſent <hi>prevalent</hi> faction be <hi>viſible:</hi> And then (however it ſuites with his heart) his tongue muſt <hi>chime</hi> with that party: And although this rule be exactly obſerved, yet once having <hi>declared</hi> himſelf, he is every houre in danger of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:</hi> For when a new <hi>faction</hi> gets up, (which is very frequent) <hi>changing his note,</hi> oftentimes preſerves him, not from an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment; he is from thence, but dandled as a <hi>whelp</hi> under a Lyons <hi>Paw;</hi> when that party thinkes fit, cru hed in pieces.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, admitting the Members had not been <hi>injuriouſly</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed; And had they been permitted <hi>freely</hi> to give their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet theſe men at <hi>Weſtminster</hi> have diſabled themſelves to <hi>ſit</hi> or <hi>Vote</hi> there; which is proved thus.</p>

                  <hi>Treaſon:</hi> They have <hi>actually endeavoured</hi> to kill the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> and <hi>Prince,</hi> which is <hi>Treaſon:</hi> They have <hi>counterfeited</hi> the Kings Great <hi>Seal,</hi> which is <hi>Treaſon:</hi> They have <hi>counterfeited</hi> His Mony, which is <hi>Treaſon:</hi> They have not onely <hi>denyed</hi> their <hi>King</hi> to be the <hi>Supreame Governour,</hi> but have <hi>arrogated</hi> the power of <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty</hi> to themſelves, which is <hi>Treaſon:</hi> They have this Parliament <hi>declared</hi> it <hi>Treaſon</hi> to <hi>attempt</hi> to change the Law.

               <p>And for <hi>felony;</hi> That offence is <hi>included</hi> both in the <hi>crime</hi> of <hi>Treaſon</hi> and <hi>Murder;</hi> but there needs not that help to prove them <hi>guilty</hi> thereof. By the Law of <hi>England</hi> it is <hi>felony</hi> of death, to <hi>ſteal goods exceeding the value of twelve pence.</hi> But theſe perſons (in the nature of <hi>robbery)</hi> have by <hi>force</hi> taken from <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People</hi> their whole livelihood.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe 20 <hi>Troopers</hi> to make an <hi>Order,</hi> that all perſons paſſing through <hi>High-gate,</hi> ſhall deliver unto them, all ſuch <hi>Money</hi> as ſhall be found about them.

So here, thoſe men at <hi>Westminſter</hi> have ordered, (which they ſtile an Ordinance of Parliament) that all the people of <hi>England,</hi> ſhall give unto them, the 5 <hi>part,</hi> and the 20 <hi>part</hi> of their Eſtates. That every man, who
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54815:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>eats,</hi> or <hi>drinkes, buyes,</hi> or <hi>ſels,</hi> ſhall pay unto them a <hi>certaine ſumme</hi> by the name of <hi>Exciſe.</hi> That every <hi>County</hi> and <hi>Towne</hi> ſhall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>contribute</hi> unto them, and their Souldiers, <hi>vaſt ſummes</hi> of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.

Now in regard the foreſaid perſons at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> have <hi>not</hi> power (as before is proved) to make ſuch Laws, it <hi>directly</hi> followeth, that the forcing the King and people herein, is unlawfull, and conſequently both King and Subject are robbed of their money, and goods: And their eſtates wrongfully detained from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But peradventure theſe incendiaries at</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>will object, that although they be guilty of thoſe crimes, yet untill they be judicially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict thereof, it cannot be alleadged againſt them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, By their <hi>owne</hi> practice, they have <hi>judged</hi> this point <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> themſelves. For (as before appears) without any <hi>legall</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, they have <hi>expulſed</hi> almoſt all their fellow-Members. And that for <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> facts, which if <hi>guilty</hi> of, <hi>diſabled</hi> not them to <hi>ſit</hi> or <hi>vote</hi> in the houſe. So that, theſe <hi>Weſtminſter-men</hi> (having to the view of the world committed ſuch facts, as by law <hi>diſables</hi> them to <hi>ſit</hi> or <hi>vote)</hi> to be judged no Members, themſelves <hi>muſt</hi> confeſſe, is (at the moſt) but <hi>lex Talionis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it may appear (even in the judgment of Law) that a man is guilty of <hi>treaſon, murder,</hi> or <hi>felony,</hi> although not <hi>attainted,</hi> or <hi>convicted</hi> thereof. <hi>For example,</hi> one calls another (before any <hi>conviction</hi> of ſuch a <hi>crime) Traytor, Murderer,</hi> or <hi>Thief.</hi> The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus charged, brings his <hi>action</hi> of <hi>ſlaunder.</hi> In this caſe, if the Defendant <hi>juſtifie</hi> his words: alleaging, that the Plaintif com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſuch a <hi>fact,</hi> which the law <hi>judgeth Treaſon, Felony,</hi> or <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and at the triall <hi>proved</hi> it. The Jury ought to acquit the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant of the ſlaunder, yet ſtill that <hi>Traytor, Murderer,</hi> or <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> is <hi>not</hi> convict of the fact. Therefore clear it is, a Traytor, is a Traytor. And the people may as well <hi>know</hi> him ſo to be, and as lawfully ſo <hi>call</hi> him, before <hi>attainder,</hi> or <hi>conviction,</hi> as to know a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54815:68"/>
                  <hi>ſpade</hi> to be a <hi>ſpade,</hi> and ſo call it.</p>
               <p>Beſides, when a <hi>treaſon, murder,</hi> or <hi>felony</hi> is committed, it is the <hi>proper</hi> office of every <hi>petty Conſtable,</hi> and of every <hi>Juſtice of peace;</hi> nay, it is the <hi>duty</hi> of every <hi>honeſt Subject,</hi> to apprehend the <hi>male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,</hi> and to bring him to <hi>due</hi> puniſhment; wherein, neither <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">4 Part Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes. fo. 25.</note> of Parliament, <hi>dignity</hi> of the Perſon, or <hi>imployment</hi> of the Offender, is any protection. It is not <hi>only</hi> lawful, but the <hi>duty</hi> of every honeſt Engliſh man, to lay hands upon the <hi>Speakers</hi> of both Houſes, or upon any <hi>Peer,</hi> or <hi>Parliament-man,</hi> or any other, having committed the crime of <hi>treaſon, murder,</hi> or <hi>felony;</hi> or <hi>juſtly</hi> ſuſpected for the ſame: And conſequently they <hi>ought</hi> to <hi>apprehend</hi> the aforeſaid <hi>Weſtminſter-men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, that in the <hi>ordinary</hi> proceedings, no man can be <hi>convict</hi> of <hi>treaſon, murder,</hi> or <hi>felony,</hi> but by <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament, or by <hi>judiciall</hi> proceedings <hi>recorded</hi> in his <hi>life time,</hi> yet there is another <hi>rule</hi> in Law too, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>no man</hi> ſhall take <hi>advantage</hi> of his <hi>owne wrong.</hi> Therefore, if one before he be convict by ſuch proceedings, be <hi>killed</hi> in <hi>rebellion,</hi> and his corps <hi>viewed</hi> by the <hi>chief Juſtice,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now ſuppoſe 500 ordinary perſons (not claiming the power or name of a Parliament) to have committed the crime of <hi>treaſon, murder,</hi> or <hi>felony;</hi> Then <hi>aſſemble</hi> to themſelves <hi>multitudes, out</hi> the <hi>Judges</hi> from their <hi>Juſtice ſeat,</hi> place thoſe of their <hi>faction</hi> therein; ſeize the <hi>Kings Great Seale; break</hi> it in pieces, and <hi>counterfeit</hi> an other; <hi>Impriſon</hi> the King, and thus <hi>ſtop</hi> the <hi>courſe</hi> of <hi>Juſtice</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves: <hi>Groſſe</hi> it were in that caſe <hi>(becauſe unattainted,</hi> or <hi>unconvicted)</hi> not to <hi>declare</hi> them <hi>Traytors:</hi> Should the people in that caſe, omit by all <hi>poſſible</hi> endeavours, to <hi>apprehend,</hi> and bring them to puniſhment, (wherein the Law <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Coke</hi> 9. fo. 68. <hi>Coke</hi> 5. fo. 109.</note> upon <hi>reſiſtance</hi> doth warrant the <hi>killing</hi> of them) they were <hi>not only diſobeyers</hi> of the Law, but the <hi>cauſe</hi> of their owne miſery; Even ſo it is with the people at this day: There is no <hi>difference</hi> to be found betwixt thoſe 500 men, and them at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> but the <hi>Westminſter-mens</hi> pretence of authority, which <hi>renders</hi> them more <hi>odious;</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people ought to be more <hi>zealous</hi> to apprehend them.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, it is an <hi>undoubted</hi> truth, that whilſt the Members are ſo <hi>over-awed,</hi> as to <hi>act</hi> and <hi>doe</hi> what <hi>others</hi> command them; It is no <hi>free Parliament;</hi> and conſequently <hi>all</hi> their proceedings <hi>void</hi> and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54815:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>null.</hi> But thoſe <hi>Weſtminſter-men</hi> are in that manner <hi>awed,</hi> Even as they, by <hi>tumults</hi> expelled their fellow Members, and by their <hi>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi> fettered their <hi>conſciences;</hi> themſelves are now (by the <hi>power</hi> of an <hi>Army)</hi> forced to <hi>captivate</hi> their owne ſence to the <hi>will</hi> of a few <hi>inconſiderable</hi> perſons; ſome <hi>particular</hi> Officers of the Army: The Members do not, they <hi>dare</hi> not act any thing, but in <hi>obedience</hi> of the <hi>reſults</hi> of a Councell of Warre. Nay more, we ſee, not to <hi>alter,</hi> and <hi>change</hi> opinion (how <hi>contradictory</hi> ſoever to former <hi>votes,</hi> how <hi>pernicious</hi> to King, Church, or Common-wealth) as they <hi>receive</hi> commands from thence, is ground ſufficient both of an <hi>expulſion</hi> from the Houſe, and an <hi>impeachment</hi> of <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is, That we find ſuch <hi>contradictory reſults, ſometimes</hi> theſe perſons <hi>voting</hi> themſelves a Parliament, <hi>ſometimes</hi> no Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>ſometimes</hi> much ſhew of ſetling a Forme of Religion, they <hi>unvote</hi> that againe, and declare (upon pretence of ſatisfying ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſciences) to have none at all. They do (in effect) <hi>ſay,</hi> and <hi>unſay, vote one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> thing, lawfull, and not law, even as the <hi>Cudgell</hi> hangs over them.</p>
               <p>And ſo unleſſe perſons, whoſe <hi>Soules,</hi> and <hi>Conſciences,</hi> are ſo far in <hi>vaſſalage,</hi> as to ſay, act, and doe, what ever the preſent prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Party commands, make the Houſes of Parliament, theſe <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter men</hi> are not they, and conſequently if nothing but this were againſt them, it proves them <hi>no Members</hi> of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, admitting theſe men <hi>not diſabled</hi> by any, or all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid means, yet by their late <hi>Votes</hi> declaring their reſolution, not to make any <hi>addreſſe,</hi> or <hi>application</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> nor to permit any from him, they have (by the Law of <hi>England)</hi> diſſolved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; For, ſetting aſide the <hi>Kings Writs of ſummons,</hi> the peoples <hi>electing</hi> the <hi>Knights, Citizens,</hi> and <hi>Burgeſſes,</hi> and the <hi>returns</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of made; And the Perſons aſſembled have <hi>no</hi> more authority to <hi>ſit,</hi> or <hi>vote</hi> in either Houſe, then any other men. And by <hi>thoſe Writs</hi> they have <hi>nothing</hi> elſe to doe, but to <hi>treat</hi> with the <hi>King</hi> concerning the affaires of the Realme. Therefore by <hi>waving</hi> that, they <hi>quit</hi> all their imployment. They doe by it clearly publiſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, an <hi>abſolute deniall</hi> to take upon them <hi>thoſe things</hi> which the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>people intruſted</hi> them with, and for which they had <hi>Commiſſion.</hi> And conſequently, what ever they doe is without Commiſſion, or Authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:54815:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But to doe them right, they are in theſe <hi>votes</hi> more <hi>ingenuous</hi> then formerly. There is now a <hi>harmony</hi> between their <hi>words</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> which heretofore jarred. For, notwithſtanding their often <hi>Declarations,</hi> and high <hi>Proteſtations</hi> (even with deep execrations upon themſelves if not performed) to make the <hi>King glorious,</hi> and the <hi>people to flouriſh:</hi> The world might (even from the firſt beginning of the Parliament) ſee, that all their <hi>actions</hi> tended to the deſtruction, both of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſuppoſe a <hi>new gang</hi> of four Judges ſet up in the Court of <hi>Kings bench</hi> by colour of <hi>Authority</hi> of theſe Perſons at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and three of them (by an Order of their own) to expell the fourth: then two of the three to expel the third: &amp; then <hi>one</hi> of the two to aſſemble <hi>multitudes,</hi> and <hi>expell</hi> the other. And after this the laſt <hi>man</hi> by himſelf <hi>alone,</hi> or calling unto him <hi>two,</hi> or <hi>three</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons <hi>ſutable</hi> to himſelf, to judge the Law, and thereby to declare the <hi>wealth</hi> of the Nation to be their owne, and <hi>both</hi> the <hi>Members,</hi> and the <hi>reſt</hi> of the <hi>people,</hi> to be their <hi>ſlaves:</hi> And having got an <hi>Army</hi> on foot to <hi>ſupport</hi> their actions; Then to declare that they will have no more <hi>relation</hi> unto, or medling with the <hi>Members;</hi> ſuch Perſons would <hi>quickly</hi> be <hi>denounced</hi> no Judges of that Court; Declared to <hi>act</hi> without <hi>commiſſion,</hi> or <hi>authority;</hi> To be <hi>Subverters</hi> of the Law, and would be <hi>impeached</hi> of <hi>high Treaſon</hi> againſt this new State; Even ſo <hi>ought</hi> all the people to declare <hi>theſe Weſtminſter-men.</hi> It is their caſe againſt the King, the people, and the <hi>old known fundamentall</hi> Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter, I cannot more <hi>aptly parallel</hi> theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, then unto thoſe men our <hi>Saviour in the Goſpel warns</hi> us of: They have got within the <hi>walls</hi> of the Houſes of Parliament, but <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 15. 16.

In a word, ſince they caſt off their <hi>loyalty,</hi> and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king themſelves <hi>maſterleſſe;</hi> thoſe <hi>Wolves</hi> are ſo <hi>filled</hi> with <hi>pride,</hi> as that they <hi>diſdaine</hi> all other Creatures; They are ſo gorged with

                  <hi>malice,</hi> as that they <hi>ſnarle</hi> and <hi>pinch</hi> at moſt men they meet, which hath its <hi>effects</hi> like unto the biting of a <hi>mad Dog,</hi> ſcarce curable, but by a <hi>medicine</hi> prepared with the <hi>heart,</hi> or <hi>liver</hi> of that biting Cur. So the world ſees when theſe <hi>Weſtminſter men</hi> have <hi>once fixed</hi> their malice, (whether upon thoſe againſt them, or upon their owne Party, whether he have deſerved well, or ill, whether the fact charged upon him be lawfull, or unlawfull) it is a <hi>million</hi> to <hi>one, in fine,</hi> he <hi>periſheth.</hi> Nor can the <hi>wit</hi> of man find a <hi>cure</hi> for this grief; but to <hi>unkennell</hi> theſe <hi>Wolves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to effect it, the people of <hi>England</hi> by the rule of reaſon, by the law of <hi>nature,</hi> of <hi>Nations,</hi> by the Laws of the <hi>Realme,</hi> and by the Laws of <hi>God,</hi> are obliged to doe their <hi>uttermoſt</hi> endeavour: For to their <hi>dores</hi> it is now brought, wherein they cannot <hi>expect</hi> any <hi>formall Warrants,</hi> according to the ordinary proceedings.

               <p>THe <hi>uſe</hi> of a <hi>Law,</hi> is to <hi>protect</hi> every one under it, in his <hi>juſt</hi> Rights, which (I grant) cannot be done, unleſſe by that Law, the <hi>lives,</hi> and <hi>eſtates</hi> of the people, be <hi>ſubject</hi> to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>ſome known perſons;</hi> without that, neither <hi>Malefactor</hi> can be <hi>puniſhed,</hi> nor <hi>Controverſie</hi> decided: Hence it followeth, that the <hi>happineſſe,</hi> or <hi>miſery</hi> of the people depends upon the <hi>good,</hi> or the <hi>bad</hi> conſtitution of that <hi>law</hi> under which they are <hi>governed.</hi> For, ſuch a law may be, as that the people are thereby little <hi>alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:54815:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from that condition they were in when they had <hi>no Law</hi> at all. <hi>For example,</hi> where there is <hi>no</hi> Law, and ſo the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> party hath the <hi>beſt</hi> intereſt, every one is a <hi>Tyrant</hi> each to other; and where the <hi>ſupream Magistrate</hi> hath an <hi>arbitrary</hi> power, the people are <hi>no</hi> better then <hi>legall ſlaves</hi> to that <hi>ſupreame</hi> Governour.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Arbitrary</hi> power, cannot be avoided but by obſerving theſe <hi>principles, viz.</hi> By placing the <hi>Soveraigne</hi> power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>one</hi> hand, and the <hi>abſolute</hi> determination of that Law, by which (under the Supreame Magiſtrate) the people are governed, in an <hi>other</hi> hand.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>making new</hi> Lawes, or <hi>altering</hi> the <hi>old.</hi> That neither the <hi>ſupreame Governour</hi> by himſelf <hi>alone,</hi> nor any other without him, have that authority; But that ſuch a <hi>compoſed</hi> body be therewith truſted as have not the power of government. All which, is <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved</hi> by the Laws of <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> by our law is the <hi>onely</hi> ſupream Governour; but his power is <hi>not unlimited,</hi> for the people under Him, are governed by a knowne Law: And this Law <hi>not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared</hi> by the <hi>King,</hi> but by the <hi>Judges</hi> of the Realme, being perſons <hi>unconcerned,</hi> and <hi>ſworne</hi> to decide <hi>controverſies</hi> according to the Law; To the King is due <hi>forfeitures</hi> for <hi>Treaſon, fines impoſed</hi> upon <hi>offenders</hi> tranſgreſſing the <hi>Law,</hi> and the like: But the <hi>King</hi> doth neither <hi>Judge</hi> what is <hi>Treaſon,</hi> what <hi>fact</hi> doth breake the Law, nor hath <hi>power</hi> to <hi>impoſe</hi> a fine upon any offender.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>making</hi> Laws, the King <hi>alone</hi> hath not that power, nor is it in <hi>any other</hi> without him. It is <hi>no Law,</hi> without the <hi>joynt</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the King and the <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>two</hi> Houſes; which <hi>united</hi> Body, hath not the <hi>government</hi> of the people: And ſo <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one</hi> is <hi>limited,</hi> and <hi>kept</hi> within his owne bounds.</p>
               <p>But although we have a <hi>knowne Law,</hi> and for the moſt part (in the <hi>execution</hi> thereof) <hi>knowne proceſſe,</hi> which (and <hi>no other)</hi> the people are <hi>obliged</hi> to obey; yet ſometimes (for <hi>neceſſity)</hi> the Law refers <hi>ſeverall</hi> things to be <hi>acted</hi> and <hi>done</hi> according to the <hi>diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of perſons truſted; whoſe Commands, (although they doe not obſerve the ordinary rules and knowne proceſſe of the Law) the <hi>people</hi> are bound to <hi>ſubmit</hi> unto. <hi>For example,</hi> It is the office of <hi>every Sheriff</hi> of his County, to <hi>preſerve</hi> the <hi>Kings peace</hi> within his liberty: Therefore upon any ſuddaine <hi>inſurrection, tumult,</hi> or other <hi>juſt</hi> occaſion, the Law (to enable him to performe that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54815:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
gives him authority to raiſe the <hi>power of that County;</hi> wherein it is beſt to the <hi>diſcretion</hi> of the <hi>Sheriff,</hi> to judge when it is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to command the <hi>peoples</hi> aſſiſtance: But herein he is not the <hi>finall</hi> Judge. In that caſe it is at the equall <hi>perill</hi> of the <hi>Sheriff,</hi> and the <hi>inhabitants</hi> of the County. To the <hi>one,</hi> when to <hi>command,</hi> and to the <hi>other,</hi> when to <hi>obey.</hi> If the Sheriff without <hi>juſt</hi> cauſe, <hi>force</hi> the people to riſe, <hi>himſefe</hi> is puniſhable: And if he requires the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants to aſſiſt him, when it is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> and they refuſe, the <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> are <hi>puniſhable:</hi> In which caſe both <hi>Sheriffs</hi> and <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equally concerned; therefore <hi>neither</hi> the <hi>one, nor</hi> the <hi>other</hi> is Judge, to determine whether there was <hi>cauſe</hi> to require aſſiſtance or not. That queſtion, (the cauſe being regularly brought before them) <hi>properly</hi> belongs to the <hi>Judges</hi> of the Law: And therein he who findes himſelfe agreived, hath liberty to commence his action, and bring it to tryall.</p>
               <p>And as in that caſe of the <hi>Sheriff</hi> for his <hi>particular</hi> County, the like <hi>accidents</hi> may happen, whereby the <hi>whole Kingdome</hi> may be in ſuch <hi>danger,</hi> as not <hi>poſſible</hi> (by the <hi>ordinary</hi> meanes, and knowne practiſe of Law) to prevent the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of it; The <hi>Nation</hi> may be ſo <hi>ſuddenly invaded</hi> by a <hi>forraigne</hi> enemy, or <hi>infeſted</hi> by a <hi>domeſtick inſurrection,</hi> as that, without <hi>preſent</hi> ſupplies, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of <hi>men, money,</hi> and other <hi>proviſions</hi> of War, the whole <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> and Kingdome may <hi>periſh.</hi> It were <hi>groſſe</hi> in ſuch a caſe, to be <hi>tyed</hi> unto the <hi>formalities</hi> of Law, or to want meanes to prevent that danger.</p>
               <p>And this cannot be <hi>ſupplied,</hi> unleſſe ſome have <hi>legall power</hi> to command, and the <hi>people obliged</hi> to <hi>obey:</hi> Therefore by our Law, the King <hi>ex officio,</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> hath that power, He may in ſuch caſes (by His <hi>regall authority)</hi> compell His ſubjects, in His, and <hi>His peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> defence, to <hi>ſerve</hi> in perſon, and <hi>contribute</hi> with their purſes. Yet herein the <hi>King</hi> is not the <hi>finall Judge,</hi> if ſo, the <hi>eſtate,</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> of the ſubject, were at His <hi>will;</hi> He might then (upon <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of neceſſity)</hi> draw from the people their <hi>whole</hi> fortunes, and eſtates, which were (in <hi>effect)</hi> a power <hi>arbitrary.</hi> Therefore as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the caſe of the <hi>Sheriff,</hi> ſo here, as the people are at their <hi>extreame perill,</hi> in caſe of danger, bound to <hi>obey</hi> the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: So it is at the <hi>perill</hi> of the <hi>Kings Miniſters</hi> therein im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, that the <hi>King</hi> hath <hi>juſt cauſe</hi> to make that command. For
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54815:71"/>
every <hi>ſubject,</hi> who (by the Kings <hi>commands,</hi> or <hi>warrants)</hi> is <hi>mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,</hi> either in <hi>perſon,</hi> or <hi>eſtate,</hi> may proſecute ſuit in a Court of Juſtice, againſt the Kings officers, who <hi>interrupted</hi> him, wherein the <hi>Kings Warrants, Writs,</hi> or <hi>Commands,</hi> are no <hi>legall</hi> juſtification, unleſſe it <hi>judicially</hi> appear to the Judges of that Court, where the ſuite <hi>depends,</hi> that the King had <hi>juſt cauſe</hi> to require that aſſiſtance. For, the King is not the <hi>finall</hi> Judge in ſuch a caſe.</p>
               <p>So that our Law, in the <hi>firſt place,</hi> preſerves the <hi>Kingdome</hi> and <hi>people</hi> from danger, by <hi>providing</hi> remedy againſt thoſe <hi>ſudden</hi> acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, yet <hi>protects</hi> the ſubject from <hi>tyranny,</hi> and <hi>arbitrary</hi> power.</p>
               <p>And this <hi>rule</hi> for the <hi>liberty</hi> of the ſubject, holds in <hi>all</hi> caſes; that is to ſay, The <hi>Subject</hi> of <hi>England, under</hi> the <hi>government</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> cannot be forced, either in <hi>perſon,</hi> or <hi>eſtate,</hi> otherwiſe then the <hi>knowne</hi> Law (judged by indifferent perſons unconcerned as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid) doth permit: And conſequently the people of <hi>England,</hi> a moſt <hi>free</hi> ſubject.</p>

               <p>IT is true, the <hi>people</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> for ſome time before this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were grieved with <hi>illegall</hi> taxations, <hi>Monopolizing</hi> of Trades, and other things not <hi>warranted</hi> by Law: And although there wants not meanes (beſides a Parliament) to <hi>redreſſe</hi> any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order ariſing in the Common-wealth, yet the <hi>cauſe</hi> of the <hi>diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> may be ſuch, as that, (without a Parliament) it would be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to reforme them: When the Judges are corrupt, as the Members alledged they were in that caſe of <hi>Ship-money,</hi> when the Officers of State, or other perſons of power neere the King, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the miſchiefe, as it was conceived in the buſineſſe of <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies, few</hi> (in the <hi>ordinary way</hi> of proceedings) <hi>dare</hi> informe, or proſecute. Therefore in <hi>ſuch</hi> caſes a <hi>Parliament</hi> is neceſſary: The Members in <hi>thoſe</hi> things have <hi>freedome</hi> of ſpeech. And the <hi>King</hi> having called His Parliament, at the <hi>firſt meeting</hi> thereof, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Himſelf moſt <hi>ſenſible</hi> of the diſorders of the Kingdome, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared</hi> His <hi>deſire</hi> to have a perfect <hi>reformation;</hi> His <hi>reſolution</hi> to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne according to the knowne Law: ſuch as were <hi>authors,</hi> or <hi>actors</hi> of the former diſtractions, he left them to <hi>legall</hi> tryall. And to compleat the buſineſſe, promiſed to <hi>concur</hi> with the <hi>two Houſes,</hi> in all things tending to <hi>reformation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Parliament</hi> had a <hi>happy</hi> beginning: and for a <hi>good</hi> ſpace of time, a <hi>progreſſe</hi> ſutable. For, ſuch as looke upon the Statutes made this ſitting, ſhall find the <hi>worke</hi> of <hi>reformation</hi> (even by the King Himſelfe) perfectly <hi>compleated;</hi> That Judgement for <hi>Ship-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> the buſines of <hi>Monopolies,</hi> and all other <hi>viſible,</hi> and <hi>Knowne</hi> greivances were taken away: And to prevent the like <hi>danger,</hi> for after-times, the King paſſed an Act, for calling a <hi>Parliament</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>third</hi> year. So that, to the obtaining of the <hi>greateſt</hi> happineſſe, that any <hi>people</hi> in the world can deſire, there wanted nothing, but to <hi>puniſh</hi> the <hi>authors</hi> of the former miſchiefe, and then for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54815:73"/>
a <hi>diſſolution</hi> of the Parliament. Then might <hi>every one</hi> (by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a <hi>knowne</hi> Law) have <hi>promiſed</hi> to himſelf <hi>ſecurity</hi> of his perſon, and challenged <hi>property</hi> in his eſtate.</p>
               <p>But the ſequell ſhewes that it was not the <hi>publick</hi> good, it was their owne private, the <hi>government</hi> and <hi>wealth</hi> of the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Members aimed at.</p>
               <p>And as a <hi>foundation</hi> to it, the plot was to make this Parliament <hi>perpetuall.</hi> But at the firſt (it not being thought fit to diſcover their intention therein) it was pretended that the <hi>affaires</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <hi>required</hi> inſtant <hi>ſupplies</hi> of great ſummes of money, which as they pretended, could not be obtained, but by <hi>Loane:</hi> And that the people <hi>(fearing</hi> a ſuddaine <hi>diſſolution</hi> of the Parliament) would not lend; A Bill therefore is cunningly <hi>formed</hi> (not at all mentioning for what <hi>time</hi> the Parliament ſhould <hi>ſit)</hi> in <hi>generall</hi> words, enacting that it ſhall <hi>not</hi> be <hi>diſſolved,</hi> nor adjourned, but with the <hi>aſſent</hi> of the <hi>two Houſes:</hi> And the King being informed by the hatchers of that plot, that this Act was for no other end but to procure the <hi>Loane</hi> of money for the <hi>publick good,</hi> paſſed the Bill.</p>
               <p>The Members having obtained this Act, and conceiving that thereby the King could not diſſolve the Parliament without their conſent, then they began their intended worke: From thence no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is heard of, in the old Parliamentary way. The proſecution of the Judges in that heavy charge of corruption is, not onely ſet aſide, but ſome of them (formerly accuſed to be ſuch <hi>high ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors</hi> as to have <hi>ſubverted</hi> the knowne Law) are received into the <hi>greateſt</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Trevor</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of Law.</note> 
                  <hi>favour,</hi> as perſons moſt proper to uſher in the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power of the Members.</p>
               <p>Then are the people <hi>amuſed</hi> with <hi>feares</hi> and <hi>jealouſies,</hi> by printed <hi>pamphlets,</hi> they are groſly abuſed by being told that the <hi>King</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to <hi>ſubvert</hi> the Law; and <hi>governe</hi> by His <hi>arbitrary power.</hi> To aboliſh the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, and to introduce <hi>Popery:</hi> The Kingdome therefore (it was reſolved) muſt be put into a <hi>poſture</hi> of <hi>defence:</hi> The <hi>Militia</hi> muſt be taken <hi>out</hi> of the Kings hands, and <hi>ſetled</hi> in the Members. And accordingly by their command, the Kings ſubjects are <hi>muſtered, arrayed,</hi> and put into a readineſſe for <hi>War:</hi> they are <hi>inſtructed</hi> and <hi>prepared,</hi> to take upon them any <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize</hi> the Members ſhall direct. The <hi>Fortes,</hi> the <hi>Navy,</hi> the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54815:74"/>
                  <hi>Armes, Ammunition,</hi> and <hi>Revenues</hi> of the Crowne, are taken to the uſe of the Members.</p>
               <p>Thus having prepared, and ſtrengthened themſelves, the <hi>next</hi> thing was further to <hi>diſinable</hi> the King to make <hi>reſiſtance:</hi> It is therefore falſely and maliciouſly <hi>declared</hi> to the people, that it is <hi>againſt</hi> the <hi>liberty</hi> of the Subject (for any cauſe whatſoever, unleſſe upon an actuall invaſion) to be <hi>forced</hi> (by the Kings command) out of their owne County. So that by this <hi>doctrine,</hi> in caſe of a <hi>forraigne Invaſion,</hi> the <hi>enemy</hi> muſt be landed, he muſt have <hi>footing</hi> in the Kingdome, before the people may be gathered together by the King to make <hi>defence:</hi> But in caſe of <hi>Rebellion</hi> (the buſineſſe in hand) if the <hi>Rebels</hi> once get a <hi>formed body,</hi> too ſtrong for any one County, the buſineſſe is done: They may, if this be true doctrine, <hi>undoubtedly</hi> conquer (County after County) the <hi>whole</hi> Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being done, it was then conceived <hi>opportunely</hi> and ſafe enough, to publiſh and declare their intent. Then without the King, they <hi>arrogate</hi> the <hi>name of the Parliament of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> take upon them to be the <hi>Supreame</hi> Court of Juſtice, to make Laws, and in a word a <hi>power arbitrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the Members have (as an <hi>emprick</hi> by killing his patient, with <hi>improper</hi> medicines cures his diſeaſe) <hi>reformed</hi> this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; under pretence to <hi>reſtore</hi> the knowne Law. The Law it ſelfe is by them <hi>totally ſubverted:</hi> And that which is ſtill more <hi>grievous,</hi> the people were made <hi>voluntary</hi> inſtruments of this <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,</hi> whilſt they conceived they fought in <hi>defence</hi> of the Law, and their owne <hi>Liberties,</hi> they were therein their <hi>owne executioners.</hi> They have <hi>embrued</hi> their hands in the <hi>blood</hi> of their <hi>fellow Subjects,</hi> and by their <hi>victory,</hi> have <hi>plunged</hi> themſelves into the debts of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
               <p>But theſe things being done in the <hi>name</hi> of a <hi>Parliament</hi> (with <hi>ſome</hi> perſons) they ſtill carry the <hi>face</hi> of Juſtice; although nothing ever was, or can be, more <hi>pernitious</hi> to King and people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ket, Cade, Wat Tyler,</hi> and the like, in their <hi>inſurrections,</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>reformation;</hi> To remove <hi>bad Councellors</hi> from the King: To <hi>restore</hi> the people to their Liberties, and to ſet up the Law, they proteſted, were the things they <hi>aimed</hi> at. Now admit, their <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> had been to <hi>reforme,</hi> yet their <hi>proceedings</hi> muſt <hi>neceſſarily</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy

both Law and Government. Suppoſe <hi>Ket</hi> had been asked, who ſhould <hi>judge</hi> what perſons had <hi>broken</hi> the Law, who were <hi>bad Councellours,</hi> who ſhould <hi>nominate</hi> the Officers of State, and the like? <hi>Ket</hi> would have anſwered, that he, who <hi>reformes,</hi> muſt <hi>judge</hi> of the <hi>reformation.</hi> Therefore, none but <hi>Ket</hi> ſhould judge of theſe things, which had been no leſſe, then to have arrogated an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> power, &amp; to <hi>enſlave</hi> the people. And if ſo in <hi>Kets</hi> caſe, It is the ſame, when any perſons (what ever their quality or number be) for it is the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> which the Law lookes upon, to juſtifie the fact, not the <hi>dignity</hi> or <hi>number</hi> of the perſons <hi>acting:</hi> And as thoſe things alter not the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>crime,</hi> ſo the <hi>conſequence</hi> thereof to the people is all one. They are as much, and more damnified by an unlawfull act committed by a <hi>Lord,</hi> as by a <hi>peaſant,</hi> by a thouſand, as by one ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>Then for the Members proceedings; Their <hi>aſſuming</hi> power to <hi>judge</hi> the Law, to <hi>exclude</hi> the <hi>King</hi> from His <hi>Negative</hi> voice in Parliament, taking upon them, <hi>Authority</hi> to make Laws, and the like, are in themſelves as <hi>unlawfull,</hi> as the foreſaid acts of <hi>Ket,</hi> &amp;c. The Members have no more <hi>Commiſſion</hi> for <hi>this,</hi> then <hi>Ket</hi> had for <hi>that:</hi> And the conſequence thereupon to the people, is <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe a <hi>ſingle</hi> perſon to have <hi>conquered</hi> the Kingdome, And thereupon to aſſume an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> power. The <hi>lives, estates,</hi> and <hi>fortunes</hi> of the people were at his command; And ſo they now be at the will of the Members. And thus the Subjects were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved.</p>

               <p>WHen the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> hath diſcovered the <hi>nature</hi> of his ſick patients <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> (and not before) he knowes what <hi>medicine</hi> to apply for the cure: Which holds with a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> fallen into <hi>diſorder.</hi> And for <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>cauſe</hi> of its <hi>grief</hi> is apparent:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54815:75"/>
It is rather out of joynt, then <hi>ſick</hi> of a diſeaſe: Our <hi>miſery</hi> is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned, (as before appears) <hi>onely</hi> by ſetting aſide the King. For, by that, the <hi>Soveraign</hi> power of Government, the <hi>Authority</hi> to make Lawes, and the power to judge the Law, are wreſted out of their <hi>proper</hi> places, and <hi>drawne</hi> into one hand. The Members by <hi>excluding</hi> the King, have uſurped all theſe, ſo that, there is no other <hi>power</hi> or <hi>rule</hi> to guide their actions, but their own will. But whilſt the <hi>King</hi> held His right, the <hi>power</hi> of Government was His, the Authority to make Lawes, was in Him, and the two Houſes joyntly, and to declare the Law in the Judges; whereby every one was <hi>limited</hi> within His own bounds, and ſo avoid all Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power.</p>
               <p>Thus for the <hi>cauſe</hi> of our grief; Then for the cure, when any <hi>limbe</hi> of a man is out of <hi>joynt,</hi> it ſo much <hi>diſtempers</hi> every part, as that (if not timely prevented) the <hi>whole</hi> body is in danger to <hi>periſh:</hi> And as no medecine, without putting it into <hi>joynt</hi> againe, will eaſe the paine; ſo by ſetting <hi>ſtraight</hi> that <hi>joynt</hi> at <hi>once,</hi> it is a perfect cure to the whole body.</p>
               <p>Now by <hi>ſetting aſide</hi> the King, the <hi>diſorder</hi> in our Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, is no leſſe then an <hi>abſolute ſubverſion</hi> both of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:</hi> The people are thereby totally <hi>enſlaved,</hi> &amp; this <hi>incurable,</hi> but by <hi>reſtoring</hi> the King again. For, ſo long as the Members <hi>exclude</hi> the King, ſo long the aforeſaid <hi>authorites</hi> are uſurped by them, and ſo a power <hi>Arbitrary.</hi> For example: If the Members <hi>condemne</hi> an innocent man to death: And for a <hi>fact</hi> (if guilty) not puniſhable by Law. The Members having <hi>power</hi> (without appeal) both to <hi>determine</hi> the <hi>fact,</hi> and to <hi>declare</hi> the Law upon that <hi>fact:</hi> And thoſe Members having <hi>Judged</hi> him to dye, and to <hi>forfeit</hi> his Eſtate unto <hi>themſelves;</hi> This <hi>innocent</hi> man (all the world muſt confeſſe) is without remedy; he is <hi>hopeleſſe</hi> without the mercy of thoſe, who gaine by his deſtruction. But the King being <hi>reſtored,</hi> the foreſaid Authorities are <hi>returned</hi> into their proper places, and againe <hi>divided</hi> into ſeverall hands: <hi>inſtantly</hi> from thence, every <hi>Court, Aſſembly,</hi> and perſon, not only enjoyes its own Authority, but is <hi>limited</hi> within its own bounds; no man then is permitted to be both Judge and Party; he ought not by our Law to give ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death, if by that Sentence the Judge gave the fortune of the man condemned.</p>

                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:54815:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thus for the <hi>Medicine:</hi> In the next place it is <hi>conſiderable</hi> who ſhall apply it. And for that, as the <hi>people</hi> were the <hi>immediate</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of their own <hi>thraldome,</hi> they ought to be the <hi>principall Agents</hi> of their own <hi>freedome;</hi> Their <hi>motives</hi> to returne to their <hi>obedience,</hi> are farre greater, then they had to <hi>recede</hi> from it.</p>
               <p>Was any heretofore hindred to <hi>exerciſe</hi> his <hi>owne</hi> opinions in matters of <hi>Religion?</hi> Was his perſon <hi>impriſoned, taxes</hi> and <hi>impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> laid upon him, not <hi>warranted</hi> by the Law? If ſo, his <hi>condition</hi> is now farre <hi>worſe.</hi> Firſt, for <hi>Religion;</hi> The <hi>ſence</hi> of thoſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers we now finde is made the <hi>rule</hi> of every mans <hi>faith;</hi> he is bound to <hi>change</hi> his <hi>Religion,</hi> as the <hi>Major</hi> part of the Houſes ſhall <hi>Vote.</hi> The <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Judges heretofore, were <hi>limited</hi> in their puniſhments. The Members are boundleſſe. And as they are not <hi>guided,</hi> either for <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> but by their owne <hi>will:</hi> So in their <hi>puniſhments,</hi> they are a <hi>large</hi> too: Shall the Members <hi>Vote,</hi> that no man ſhall uſe the word <hi>Trinity,</hi> or call upon our <hi>Saviour</hi> by the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> or what elſe ſoever it be? The puniſhment upon thoſe breaking that <hi>Law,</hi> may be loſſe of all his Eſtate, or <hi>death,</hi> if the Members pleaſe. Then for <hi>impriſoments;</hi> formerly the <hi>Judges</hi> had power (by whoſe warrant or command ſoever committed) as the cauſe required, to <hi>bail,</hi> or ſet him at <hi>liberty.</hi> But now once committed by the Members, the cauſe is not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable; unleſſe releaſed by them who committed him (without <hi>redemption</hi> or <hi>examination)</hi> in the gaol he muſt <hi>ſtarve</hi> and <hi>periſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for <hi>taxes</hi> and <hi>impoſitions,</hi> it is true, we have heard of <hi>Loans</hi> and <hi>Benevolences,</hi> and we know the buſineſſe of <hi>Ship-money.</hi> But the people are now <hi>taxed</hi> by <hi>Aſſeſſements, Excize,</hi> and otherwiſe at <hi>pleaſure.</hi> Peradventure the <hi>Excize</hi> now laid upon <hi>London,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not 20000. l. a week, but by the ſame Law, that ſuch a ſumme is <hi>impoſed,</hi> it may be <hi>multiplyed</hi> to a <hi>Million</hi> a day. If one County be aſſeſſed at 1000. l. a moneth, it may be raiſed to 10000. l. a weeke. And as theſe are new wayes to <hi>tax</hi> the people: The Members by the <hi>ſame</hi> rule every day, may deviſe other new wayes to <hi>burthen</hi> them. And doubtleſſe he, who hath his Eſtate taken from him by <hi>Aſſeſſements,</hi> or <hi>Excize,</hi> is left as little to feed <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe</hi> and <hi>family,</hi> as if it were taken by way of <hi>Ship-money, Loan,</hi> or <hi>Benevolence:</hi> Nor is any mans <hi>hunger</hi> ſatisfied, his <hi>thirſt</hi> quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, or his children <hi>clothed,</hi> by being told that this is done by the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54815:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>repreſentative body of the whole Kingdome.</hi> But on the other ſide, it is apparent, that the people are hereby <hi>generally impoveriſhed,</hi> and the Members in <hi>pompe, glory,</hi> and <hi>wealth,</hi> advanced far <hi>beyond</hi> their <hi>ranks</hi> and <hi>fortunes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We had a <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and a <hi>High Commiſſion,</hi> the Judges whereof, ſometimes impoſed <hi>exorbitant</hi> puniſhments. But we have now the <hi>Members (ſtiled a Parliament)</hi> who have not onely <hi>accumulated</hi> unto themſelves, the power of thoſe Courts, and of all other <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Juſtice</hi> in the Kingdome, but have therein aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an <hi>unlimited</hi> power, when they think fit to <hi>cenſure,</hi> whether it be for a <hi>crime,</hi> or <hi>vertue, diſobedience,</hi> or <hi>obedience</hi> of the Law. The puniſhment, if they pleaſe, is either <hi>pecuniary, corporall brands of infamy, confiſcations</hi> of their whole eſtate, or <hi>death</hi> it ſelf. And in all this (which by the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> is moſt horrid) the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> are both <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Party,</hi> the profits of thoſe <hi>forfeitures</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound unto themſelves.</p>
               <p>But the new <hi>mercenary Preachers,</hi> and other <hi>incendiaries</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for that purpoſe, <hi>blaze</hi> thoſe <hi>Westminster-men</hi> to be perſons full of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>mercy;</hi> They would make the people beleeve they are ſuch as <hi>drive</hi> onely at the <hi>publicke,</hi> not looking upon their owne <hi>particulars.</hi> And herein make ſpeciall uſe of the putting down of the <hi>Court of Wards.</hi> The truth whereof, is but thus. By the Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> every one, who <hi>holds</hi> Lands by <hi>Knights</hi> ſervice, (whether of the King, or of his fellow Subject) and dyes, his heire <hi>within age</hi> of 21 years, the King, or that <hi>Lord</hi> of whom it is held, hath the <hi>profits</hi> of ſuch Lands, untill his full age, and the government and <hi>marriage</hi> of his perſon. Which being an <hi>intereſt</hi> due unto his Lord, by reaſon of the <hi>tenure</hi> of his Land, is as juſtly his, as the rent of a Tenant for yeares, belongs to his Land-lord. Now this <hi>right,</hi> both of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Subject,</hi> theſe <hi>Weſtminster-men</hi> take upon them to <hi>diſpoſe,</hi> and call it their own act of <hi>grace:</hi> Much like unto their <hi>taking</hi> from their King, and His <hi>Loyall</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects their whole Eſtates, and <hi>bounteouſly</hi> dividing it amongſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>But admit they had had <hi>Authority</hi> (which they have not the leaſt colour to challenge) to <hi>alter</hi> the Law in this caſe of tenures: yet the people are not by this alteration any whit bettered. It is true, formerly the eldeſt ſon, or the heire of ſome particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54815:76"/>
were (during their minorities) ſubject to <hi>wardſhips:</hi> But under the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of theſe men, and by the doctrine they preach, the King and all the people are <hi>hereditary ſlaves.</hi> Themſelves, all their Children, their Childrens Children, and <hi>poſterities</hi> for ever, in perſon, eſtate, and fortune, (whether owner, or not owner of Land, and however it is held, even to the worlds end) are at <hi>all times</hi> at their <hi>abſolute</hi> command. Suppoſe the <hi>King</hi> ſhould <hi>quit</hi> His right of tenures, and then by other <hi>impoſitions,</hi> wreſt from the people 40 times the value thereof: theſe <hi>Members</hi> would judge that to be no act of <hi>bounty:</hi> And if ſo in the Kings caſe, much worſe it is in them. For, they neither have <hi>power</hi> in the <hi>one,</hi> nor in the <hi>other.</hi> They cannot acquit any one of <hi>Wardſhip,</hi> nor lawfully <hi>tax</hi> the people one penny.</p>

So here the people are peſtered with quartering of Souldiers, and are ſo barbarouſly uſed by theſe inhumane wretches; as that the poor men are prepared to part with their whole fortunes, to be eaſed of that preſent <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</hi> Hereupon a new, and an illegall tax of about 20000. l. the <hi>weeke</hi> is laid upon them; which done, although it a mounts to <hi>twice treble</hi> the charge of <hi>quartering,</hi> ſtill the Souldiers muſt be bili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And their <hi>inſolency</hi> hereby, rather increaſed then abated.

An eſtate of <hi>Land,</hi> an <hi>Office,</hi> or other power, or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is by theſe men given for life, or in fee, be it as ſtrong and ful, as words can expreſſe it; neither that, nor any other act of theſe <hi>Tyrants</hi> binds one minute longer then they pleaſe. And all this conſonant to theſe their new principles; for theſe men tell us <hi>their will</hi> is the Law, we have no other Judge upon earth, either in <hi>ſoul</hi> or <hi>body,</hi> ſay they, but themſelves.</p>
               <p>Farre otherwiſe it was with the <hi>people</hi> of this Nation under the <hi>King.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> neither hath, nor claimes power to <hi>tax</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or <hi>impoſe</hi> upon their eſtates, but as the <hi>known</hi> Law permits: When the <hi>King</hi> hath once made His grant, either of <hi>Land, Office, Power,</hi> or <hi>Authority,</hi> He is concluded; He cannot recall it, or <hi>take to himſelf</hi> any thing in <hi>Lieu</hi> thereof. Therefore ſhall the King quit His tenants of the foreſaid <hi>tenures,</hi> and put down the <hi>Court of Wards?</hi> It may <hi>properly</hi> be ſaid an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>bounty:</hi> And ſo it is in all other things granted by Him, He is not <hi>Judge</hi> in His own caſe, nor hath a power <hi>Arbitrary;</hi> His Authority and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, is <hi>regulated</hi> by a known Law.</p>
               <p>Thus appears the <hi>different</hi> condition of the <hi>people,</hi> between that in the <hi>worſt</hi> of times under the <hi>Kings</hi> Government; and what they are now <hi>reduced</hi> unto, under the men at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> So that, if the people had <hi>onely</hi> exchanged that <hi>Government,</hi> for this, it had been <hi>miſerable</hi> enough. Therefore conſidering the <hi>blood</hi> which hath been ſpilt herein, moſt irkſome it muſt be to every honeſt ſoule to think thereof.</p>

But ſtill the peoples caſe is <hi>worſe,</hi> the former <hi>grievances</hi> under the King, was no cauſe of their <hi>defection.</hi> For, before this <hi>War</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, they were <hi>reformed, Ship-money</hi> and all grievances were taken away.</p>
               <p>In a word, the people had no other <hi>motive</hi> to <hi>draw</hi> their <hi>ſword</hi> againſt their <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> but thus: They were by theſe incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries falſely told that the King <hi>meant</hi> not what he <hi>ſaid,</hi> nor <hi>intended</hi> to keep thoſe Laws he had <hi>made.</hi> But now every perſon thus <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,</hi> by his owne <hi>wofull</hi> experience finds, that it was theſe perſons at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> who meant <hi>contrary</hi> to what they <hi>pretended.</hi> If he looke for the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, freedome of <hi>conſcience,</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Realme, <hi>Liberty</hi> of his perſon, or <hi>property</hi> in his eſtate, due unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 words">

               <p>And for that, although conſidering the <hi>calamities</hi> this Nation hath ſuffered, in being brought to <hi>bondage:</hi> To <hi>redeeme</hi> it againe may ſeeme <hi>difficult,</hi> yet upon conſideration had thereupon, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be a thing eaſily <hi>effected.</hi>
