         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was a custome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest the Cretans, (gentle readers) when
they intended to vse their most bitter and vehementest execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, to desire
that those whom they hated, should fixe their whole delights and likings on an
inueterate and euill custome. This Cretan course, I feare me, is fallen vppon
our age, wherein men are so accustomed to vanitie, that nothing is pleaseth
which is not pleasant, nothing is sought after which is not amorous. Which
lamentable error and sicknes of our time, beeing so ordinarie, I almost waxe in
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire of the happie issue of my deuotion: for some I know will condemn me,
&amp; that iustly, for a <hi>Galba</hi> (who begat foul children by night, and
made fayre pictures by daie:) To whom I answere, that I paint fair <pb facs="tcp:23854:6"/>
things in the light of my meditation, who begot the soule forepassed progenie
of my thoughts, in the night of mine error. Some other, (and they
superstitiously ignorant) will accuse me for writing these teares, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
rather with <hi>Brentius,</hi> to impaire the honor of the mother of God, than
with <hi>Bernard</hi> to inhance it. To whom I answer, that it is better
imitating many holy mens deuotion, than cleauing to a few mens foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and
gracelesse contemptes. For other that haue wept (as <hi>Peter</hi> his
apostasie, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> her losse &amp; misse of Christ,) their teares
wrought from them either for repent or loue. But these teares of <hi>Marie</hi>
the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, are not onely ratified by a motherlie compassion, a working
charitie, &amp; vnstay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned loue, but by a manifest prophesie, wherein
<hi>Zacharie</hi> tolde her, <hi>Et tuam ipsius animam pertransibit
gladius,</hi> And the sword of sorrow shall pearce thy heart. And the reason is
anexed, To the end that the harts of many may be opened. This swoord of griefe,
sayth <hi>Beda,</hi> is the swoord of sorrow for our Lordes passion,
Chrisostome and Bernard, the sword of loue. To good men therefore let this
suffice, that in imitation <pb facs="tcp:23854:6"/> of no lesse than fiue &amp; twenty
ancient, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Catholique Fathers of the Church, I haue enterprised this
<hi>Prosopopeia</hi>: to the bad I yeeld no reason at all, who wanting
deuotion, can haue no feeling at all. Some there bee that will not onely gybe
at this complaint, but impaire the person, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Maries</hi>
demerite all that which the fathers in her life helde marueilous, to whome
beside the speciall testimones of Iohn Damascene, and holy Gregory, who haue
written largely of her dignities, I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that of Bernards, <hi>Quod seminae
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperat, humilitas sine exemplo, quod faemina Deo principetur, sublimitas
sine modo.</hi> Some there be that will accuse the stile, as to stirring, some
the passion, as too vehement. To the first I will be thankfull, if they amend
mine errours: to the next I wish more iudgment, to examine circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. Some
(and they too captious) will auowe that Scriptures are misapplied, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
mistaken, sentences dismembred. Whome I admonish (and that earnestlie) to
beware of detraction, for it either shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth meere ignorance, or mightie enuie,
for <pb facs="tcp:23854:7"/> the detracter first of all sheweth himselfe to be void of
charitie, and next of all extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth charitie in others. To leaue them
satisfied therefore, let this sussise, I haue written nothing without example,
I build no wares on mine owne abilitie. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they hold it mistaken
which they haue not read, let them acquaint mee wyth their mislikes, I will
further their readings and establish their iudgements.</p>
            <p>Finally, whosoeuer Turke like, seeketh to kill mee with reproofes,
for cherishing him with meditation, let him beware of ingratitude, least
according to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Platonikes, hee proue <hi>Corpus
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuiosum,</hi> a forgetfull and fantastike bodie.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus preuented the captious, I turne to you curteous and
vertuous rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to whome I commit and commende these labors, wherein if you
exercise your selues you shall gouern your senses, which as Gregorie
witnesseth, are certaine win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, whereat the waters of temptation doo enter.
In meditating with Marie, you shall finde Iesus: in knowing Christs
suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance, you shall be instamed in his loue: in hearing his wordes, you shal
partake his <pb facs="tcp:23854:7"/> wisdome, which who inioteth, leaueth the world as
transitorie, and seeketh after hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for immortalitie. Heereon Augustine
exclaimeth, Vnhappie is he that knoweth all things, &amp; knoweth thee not:
blessed is he that knoweth thee to despise all things. If these stirreanie fire
of deuotion in you, then shal I not greue to see the Baalits, my reprouers,
mangle themselues for shame, whilest the fire of Gods intire loue consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
and drieth the sacrifice, Briefly, our Lord send a plentifull haruest of teares
by this meditation, that the deuout heereby may wax more confident, the
incredulous beleeuing: the indifferent, more zealous, that now at last after I
haue wounded the world with too much surfet of vanitie, I maye bee by the true
Helizeus, cleansed from the leprosie of my lewd lines, &amp; bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing washed in
the Iordan of grace, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my labour to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>

that by interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation beeing the sea, retaineth sixe qualities of the same.
Of the sea it is said, that it is the collection of al wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, either sower or
sweet, the head and hosterie of all flouds, a helpe in necessities, a refuge in
perills, an ease in trauels, a gaine to laborers: of her it is said, Let al the
waters vnder hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen be drawn into one place, which gathering of waters, is the
accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of natures:<note place="margin">Anselmus Gen: 1</note> the sea is
the head and hostery of flouds, the head by the flux of waters, the hosterie by
the refluxe: so the blessed virgine is the mediation and head of grace, &amp;
whatsoeuer good we receiue, it flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth from the fruit of her wombe. Thirdly,
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sea is a help in necessitie, <pb facs="tcp:23854:26"/> Fourthly, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sea is a refuge
in perills when in her maine bodie we escape shipwrack: so the immaculate maid
bringing forth the fulnesse of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, deliuereth vs from the
shipwracke of our soules. So testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Marie. Quia
aperit si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num pietatis uniuersis.</hi> Fiftly, the sea is a helpe to shorten
the waie of the traueller: so in this great sea of this world this holy maiden
directeth vs and shortneth our waie by the staire of her humilitie. Sixtly, it
is a gaine to labourers, making the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rich by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique: so he that trafiqueth
with this blessed maide in meditation, imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth her in deuotion, accompanyeth
her in sorrow, shall receiue the gaine of his labour, and the fruites of
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie. This is she of whom <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> speaketh in his booke of
virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, <hi>Virgo erat.</hi> She was a virgin not onely in bodie but in
minde, for no <pb facs="tcp:23854:26"/> circumuention of decit could adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate hir
sincere affect: in hart hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in words graue, in mind wise, in speech
sparing, in readings studious. This is the rose without prickles, the flower of
the rose in the prime: for as the spring is the cause of gladnes, so was her
fruit the cause or redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This is she whose humility hath raised vs,
whose virginitie hath inri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vs, &amp; whose deuotion hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued vs. O
how wonderfull was the fruitfulnes of this virgine, sayth
<hi>Bonauenture,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anselme</note> which no sooner
recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth salutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but conceiueth salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Before the virgin (saith
<hi>Oditius</hi>) conceiued Christ, it was winter, but after she had conceiued
the word of God, it became Summer. Finally, thorough the vapour of the holye
Ghost the flower sprong: A branch shall springe out of the roote of lesse, and
a flower shall ascende <pb facs="tcp:23854:27"/> from the roote, as faith Esaie. And what
other is this braunch (O thou blessedst amongest women) but thy selfe the
virgine of God: what this flower but thy sonne? O crimson rose Iesus how in all
thy bodie shine the perfect signes of thy loue? Ah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasse there is no little
space lefte without impression of loue or griefe. Hearke what <hi>Ambrose</hi>
faith further of this virgin, She fixed not her happines in vncertaine
sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce, but fastned her hope to her son Christ, intentiue in her workes,
modest in her sayinges, whose pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose was not to satisfie man, but to seeke
after God: to hurt none, but to succour all: to salute euerie one, to reuerence
her elders, not to hate her equalls: to slie boasting, to followe reason, &amp;
to loue vertue. When dyd this virgin hurt her parents with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient lookes?
When dissented <pb facs="tcp:23854:27"/> she from hir friends? When despised she the
humble? When decided she the weake? When shunned she the needie? Accustoming
her selfe to conuerse onely with that companie of men, whose conuersation shee
might not be ashamed of? Whome past shee by without modestie? ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nothing
crabbed in her looks, nothing crooked in her sayiugs, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing immodest in her
actions, not wanton in gesture, not insolent in gate, not foolish in voice, but
such she was, that the verie beautie, por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture, and forme of her body, was
the image of her mind, and figure of her honestie. The beautie of this te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Deity, was expressed in the Canticles, where it is sayd: O howe faire
art thou my loue?<note place="margin">Cant: 4</note> Howe faire art thou? Thine
eies are like doues eies, yet is there farre more hidden within. This is the
paradyce which <pb facs="tcp:23854:28"/> God prepared to put the second A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam in. This is
that virgin of whom Hierome speaketh, which passed the night in contemplation
&amp; watching the thiefe: in loue of God the most learned, in humilitie the
most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in the psalms of Dauid the most elegant, in charitie most
feruent, in puritie the most pure, and in all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue the most perfect: All her
words were alwaies full of grace, because she had God alwaies in her mouth,
shee continually praide, and as the Prophet sayd, meditated in the lawe of God
daie and night.<note place="margin">Psalm 1</note> This is the virgin of virgins,
the humble of hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest, in whome humilitie greatned virginitie, &amp;
virginitie adorned hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie. This is shee whose humilitie adorned her

himselfe after a long pursuit, by the praiers, teares, and sighs of the
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>This is the exalted, according to the Hebrew, or the starre of the

            <p>This is the animated arke of the liuing God, which brought ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

<note place="margin">Albumazar li. 6 in inter.</note> who speaking of
the signe of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, sayde that there shoulde an <pb facs="tcp:23854:29"/> immaculate
virgine be borne, sayre, elegant, and modest, that should no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish an infant in
<hi>Iudea,</hi> who shoulde be called Christ. Of this virgin there was found a
testimony on the tomb of a pagan; where in a plot of ground these wordes were
written, &amp; found in <hi>Constantine</hi> and his mother <hi>Irenes</hi>
time, <hi>An infant named Christ shall bee borne of a virgine, and I beleeue in
him. O sonne thou shalt see mee againe in the time of Constantine and his
mother I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene.</hi> The like Zonoras reporteth of a certaine Iew, who in a
certaine anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent book written in three languages vsed these wordes: This is
shee in whome <hi>Nestorius</hi> denying the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the humanitie with the
diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, our Lorde in iustice caused wormes to deuour and eate out his
tongue. This is she in whom all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues did concurre, all learning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
all deuotions flowe, all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts <pb facs="tcp:23854:29"/> depend. This is she, as
<hi>Gregorie</hi> testifieth, which foretolde the Iewes of their destruction,
and the desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their citie. This is the true ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall
<hi>Pandora,</hi> decked and inriched with the whole gifts of God, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the sonne, and the holie Ghost. This is shee whome the Moores re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to
surpasse in excellence, this is the perfectest of all perfections, as the
Turkes and Arabians testifie. This is shee whome all the fathers in deuotion,
the Mahumetists in theyr Alcoran, set foorth with praises, and inrich with
titles. Oh sweete mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God, who so speaketh of thee as Hierome sayth,
speaketh insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently: humane abilitie cannot attain it, humane industrie is
too weake for it. Whether art thou transported my soule? O my heart bee no more
raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with ioye, intentiue to praise: looke back to the foot of the crosse,
<pb facs="tcp:23854:30"/> there is more cause of meditation, more cause of moane.</p>
            <p>Ahlasse, what seest thou? Nay, what seest thou not to bewaile? If
thou seest the virgines lappe, it is bloudied with the streames that fall from
her Sonnes wounded head. If thou seest her modest eies, they are almost swolne
and sunke into hir head with teares. If thou looke for her pure colour, it is
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caied with extreame sorrowe, her breasts are defaced with often bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of
her handes, her handes are wearyed by often beating of her breasts.</p>
            <p>If shee looke on the one side, shee sees Marie the sinner washing
her sons feet with her tears: if on the other, she beholdeth Ioseph wofully
preparing his funeralls: if on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, she seeth virgins mourning: if on
the other, she beholdeth soldiers <pb facs="tcp:23854:30"/> mocking: if anie waies, she
sees sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes plentifull: knowing therfore in her selfe, that true griefe
cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth the minde, salueth the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and maintaineth innocence, shee
gan renue her teares, and thus tenderly bewailed her.</p>
            <p>If it bee a custome in nature, that fountains return from whence
they first issued, bodies bee resolued to that wherof they were first created,
ahlasse why should not the same law be in my tears, which first springing from
loue, must be buried in loue, &amp; no sooner buried but renued: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
before his fulnesse hath his fairenesse, his ripenesse, his strength, his
perfection, his praise. Why then delaie I my teares, which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer receiue
their excellence, till they bee wepte to their vtteraunce. Ahlasse, ahlas,
teares are sweet wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to wound and to winne harts, <pb facs="tcp:23854:31"/> I will vse
them, I will inuite them, I will maintaine them, I will triumph in them: Come
my son, what now shall I weep in thee? Not thy death, for it is thy triumph:
not thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pts, for they were thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tents: but thy martyrdom, which
wrought my miserie. O sinfull soules, behold two altars raised by one massacre,
one in the bodie of Christ, the other in the heart of the virgin: on the one is
sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed the flesh of the sonne, on the other the soule of the mother: such
a death no creature hath suffered, such a sorrowe no heart hath contained.
Philosophie concents to my sorow,<note place="margin">Cic Famil. 6</note> for

            <p>Oh my charitie, how much do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou helpe mee in this? my faith
onely presenteth mee wyth all these hopes, as it were vnder a vaile, my hope
beholdeth my sonne (&amp; these future prophesies of him (as the <pb facs="tcp:23854:56"/>
chiefest good (which as yet vnpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed she hopeth to inioy) but thou my
charitie makest all these ioyes present, so that I behold effectuallye thinges
before thy bee, and craue no interest in beleefe, whereas my loue assures mee
all is present. Ah that the aduersitie of an houre shoulde make mee thus forget
the pleasures I had in lyfe? when I lulled thee in my lap my son, fostered thee
at these teates, followed thee in trauels, fedde with thee in Aegypt: Then,
ô then what sweetnes inioyed I in thy presence: what comfort in thy
counsels, what courage in extreams? Ah but if it be true, that thinges the
dearer they are loued, breed the more hart griefe by their losse: howe can I
choose but waile, that hauing had pleasure to wrappe thee in thy swathing
bands, must nowe to my discomfort, close thee in thy winding sheete: Can 
<pb facs="tcp:23854:56"/> the want of thy companie, the lacke of thy counsells, the muficke
of thy preachings, the miracles in thy lyfe, the charitie in thy death be
expiated but with another death, or answered with a few sighs? Ah this
aduersitie of an hour (in other mens thoughts) is an age in mine. Compare the
age of thy pleasure, to one minute of the griefe, and it exceedeth it. The
earth for a little trauell rewardeth the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman with a huge crop,<note place="margin">Tul <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Offi. 1;</note> and shal I bee more vnkind than the
earth, to the king of the heauens (who as the beam in the glasse, hath inriched
my wombe, and annointed me with the oyle of gladnesse aboue my felows) shall I
requite his kindnesse &amp; great mercies with a few faint teares? No my
charitie shall not let me, my loue shall suffer my griefe to exceed her, and
reason shall surrender his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to passion, sufficeth it my son, 
<pb facs="tcp:23854:57"/> that in spirit I assure mee of thy life; yet in flesh whilest
thou art absent, &amp; dwellest with death, let mee bewaile thee, (for humane

is made a great fire, of one kernell a large tree, of one grain of mustard
seed, a great and grosse number: why then shuld not one care beget another, one
tear produce multitudes, one sighe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force stormes, wherethorough my griefe
might bee endlesse in lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my teares ceaselesse in weeping, and my sighs

hast giuen mee a South land of desolation, wherin the fruits of hope are barre,
the blossoms of ioyes are blasted: Oh giue mee therefore a well spring of
teares, to water this wast, that my hopes maye ripe by my ruth, and my ioyes
maye bloome after their blasting. Iosiah considering the long absence &amp;
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment of the bookes of the lawe, rent his garments for griefe, &amp;
wept bitterly: Wonder not therefore ô ye men of Israel, though Marie rent

loue of this absent Christ, the griefe in wanting him, &amp; the woundes that
wounde him) can loue nothing better than to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him: can grieue at nothing
else but his want: finally, my eyes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting his woundes to the
conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the same, my thoughts are wounded, by dwelling in my heart,
my heart is wounded by containing my thoughts, and both are wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in
imagining his wounds: yea, they are so filled with compassion, that they yeeld
no place to consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Why then begette not these griefefull thoughtes more
griefefull thoughts: these teares, more teares: these sighes, more sighes:
which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing onelye emperie in my heart, maye giue place to no ioye, but
breake the circumference that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closeth them in in the centre of care, and
getting better freedome to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <pb facs="tcp:23854:58"/> more, they maye in theyr
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie make mee more miserable, and my moane more fruitful', my sorrowe
more plentifull, thorough the foisons of my misfortune. Ah Marie, thou canst
not make thine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie aunswerable to thy will, thy life hath limites, and
must limite thy teares. Hee that bindeth the flouds that they ouerflow not,
boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thy teares. Thou hast wept to the vtterance, thou hast no more to
vtter: the darknes must once come to an end, the cloudes must at last bee
dissolued, and euerie thing must end at his appointed time, and as there is a
time to bemoane, so lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse there is a time to bee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
            <p>If thou weepe tyll thou weepe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie lyfe, and crie till thy dayes
bee consumed and quite wasted, a daie shal come to determine both? What 
<pb facs="tcp:23854:59"/> shall I become a comforter? or giue a lawe to my remorse, who
cannot comprehend my losse? No mine eies weepe on, whilest I haue a time to
liue, giue no tearme to your teares: as fast as you weep them, my braines shall
distill them, the fire of my loue shall helpe to distill them, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
cease till I die, and beeing dead, what need I seeke to bewaile, his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
being assured of his presence? Th<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e til I die I wil not cease to weep, that
being dead, I may behold him, &amp; whilest I liue, I will count all food
vaine, till I feede on his presence. If mine eies growe wearie, my sighes shall
assist them, and when both of them are infeebled, my cries shall be inforced:
in the hollow of his sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre I wil execute these drirements, and I will
exclaime so long on death till I make him deafe with hearing me. Make him deafe
poore Marie? <pb facs="tcp:23854:59"/> Ahlas, he is alwaies deafe and insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, it were
a second death to assault him: hee is not tamed by intreaties, tempted by
perswasions, bribed by benefits, or allured by lamentations, tearmes please him
not, tears pearce him not, it were an endlesse labour, a fruitlesse worke. Oh
my sonne, how am I discruciate for thee, I woulde worke, I know not what, to
win thee I know not how, I wold end my sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and desire to begin it, I
woulde beare thee to thy graue, could I cease to imbrace thee, I would
complaine of my desires, so I might appease them, and conquer my affections, so
I might command them: but flames that are 'quickly kindled, are hardly
quenched, and where oyle seeds the lampe of sorrowe, it will hardly bee
extinguished. My sighs preuent my teares, and inforce them to issue, my teares
preuent my thoughts, &amp; make <pb facs="tcp:23854:60"/> them impatient, my thoughtes
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent my reason, and admit no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, my reason would preuent all this,
but loue preuenteth it: my loue beeing of it selfe firie, will not cease
burning till it imbrace thee, flaming, till it find thee out: my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is
soueraigne of all my delights, she wils mee die to liue with thee: And as in
Salomons temple there, there was nothing that was not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with golde, so
is there not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie parte, sense, motion, or action in me, or the liuing temple
of my soul, which is not inuested with loue, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with charity, which
hauing the nature of fire, (which is the most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of all elementes) is
neuer idle, but reuiueth teares when they are extinct, quickneth sighs when
they cease: armeth thoughtes, when they are dismaide: and forceth reason when
shee fainteth. As the roote is <pb facs="tcp:23854:60"/> to the tree, the soule to the
bodie, the sunne to the worlde: such are thou to mee, O my sonne: the boughs
are not clothed with green, except they bee vnited to the root: the members
inioye no lyfe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be imformed by the soule: the worlde partaketh no
light, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte the Sunne illuminateth and lightneth the same: so my bodie
inioyeth no lyfe except thou liue in mee, mine eyes no delight, excepte thou
loooke vppon them, my thoughtes no cleere and perfect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, vnlesse
thou beautifie and beholde them. Briefely, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee mine owne without
thee, I cannot liue, thou beeing dead, I cannot leaue weeping teares, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
thou come and wipe awaie my teares. Hee that truely loueth (saith the
Philosopher) is dead in his owne <pb facs="tcp:23854:61"/> bodie, and liueth in anothers:
then how commeth it to passe my sonne,<note place="margin">Arist: Polit: 1</note>
(if this reason doo holde) that I liue not in thee, who loue thee so dearly? If
it be true, that ther are two tearms in all motions, the one from whence the
thing parteth, the other whether it is resorted: why is it not this lyfe that
hath lefte thee, incorporated in my bodie? and my life which should forsake my
bodie, possessed of thine? Our loues are in the highest degree perfect, why
haue not then these causes their effects? Why liuest thou not my sonne? Why
moue not these handes with mine? Why stirres not this hart with mine? Why open
not these eyes with mine? Why speakes not this mouth with mine? Oh my God,
except it bee imperfection of my bodie, I know nothing can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe thy lyfe
from me. By it I liue, <pb facs="tcp:23854:61"/> by thy spirit my spirit breatheth, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
my life is not in thy body, because it is vnworthie to expresse it, vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
to animate thy heart, open thine eyes, quicken thy handes and tongue: and thy
life is not in mine, because my bodie is vnable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it: yet a sparke of
thy spirit is my loue, and a beame of this loue is my desire, which by kisses I
breath into thy lippes, which though it actually worke not in thee, yet by
effectuall wil, I wish it in thee. What I can giue of my life, I lauishly haue
spent on thee, my life liueth in my bodie, though my body liue not, til thy
bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die inioy life, the life of my bodie is liuelesse, onely my charitie which
is in me, taken from thee (who art the tree' of life, and fountaine of charity)
maketh my bodie liuing in spight of my will, and inforceth all my senses 
<pb facs="tcp:23854:62"/> (through vehemencie of my spirit,) to worke theyr offices in a
liuelesse body, and a hartlesse creature, which liueth onelie by thee, and
cannot liue but in thee: so if I liue, I liue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly, till thou liue. And to
verefie this philosophie (in that I loue thee truly) I leaue my selfe to liue
in thee, &amp; onely by the liuing charity which is in me, my handes imbrace
thee, as they doo, mine eies bewaile thee with teares, and euerie other parte
worketh as thou wouldest. Ah Lord now see I the reason of my deadlie lyfe, and
thy wounding death: thou the hope of the disconsolate, art cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. thou the
fountaine of life, art troubled: how can my life then bee fruitfull, who was
ingraffed by thee, Or thy death bee but wounding, when thou the fountayne (by
whom I liue) art dried vp by death? <pb facs="tcp:23854:62"/> If of contraries, there growe
a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie reason, why shoulde I feare? The wicked (sayth Iob) shall neuer
departe out of darknesse, the flame shall drie vp their branches, with the
blasts of Gods mouth shall they bee taken awaie. What then shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the
godly? If the wicked dwell in darknesse, they shall inioye light? If the flame
dry vp their bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the children of the righteous shall bee like Oliue
branches: if the godlesse be blasted by Gods mouth, the innocent shall bee
blessed with his benefites: Then what shoulde I feare? And what not hope? Thou
knowest me (ô Lord my father) how I have conceiued in' innocencie, and
hated the workes of darknesse: thou knowest my sonne hath suffered in
innocencie, let therefore the fruit of my wombe florish, let thy promises be
accomplished in Iacob, &amp; thy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant in Israel.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:23854:63"/>
            <p>Though death hath blasted the branch, by a winter of others sinne,
let the spring of thy mercie comfort the roote, and animate the bowes, so shall
thy terrors and promises be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mplished in both sortes. The waight of their
shames shall weigh downe the euill: the workes of the iust shall preuaile
before thy mercie seate. There are two teares, O Lorde, wherewith thou art
pleased, the one of ioy and praise, the other of sorow and lamentation: I wepte
the teares of ioye when thou blessedst my wombe, I weepe the tears of sorow,
because the hope of my daies is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caid. Quicken him O Lord, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
mee, and as I receiued him with delight, nourished him with care, wept for him
with ioy, and lost him with griefe: so let mee recouer him with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, who
wept for him through discontent &amp; losse, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <pb facs="tcp:23854:63"/> him in
his resurrection, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in his ascention, that pleasing In either sort
of teares, I maye praise thee for both sortes of mercie. O my bodie, thou hast
passed the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of woe, no rocke hath beene so kinde to yeeld thee an
eccho, my on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breast by often beating on, hath ecchoed my stripes, so that in
my self I haue had the cause of complaint, &amp; report. Oh my soule, thou hast
been sifted by incessant sorrow, all thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual powers &amp; discurfiue
parts, haue beene plagued by themselues, and supposing their weale lost, they
intertaine no hope to come.</p>
            <p>Thus plagued in bodie and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed in soule, sate poore
<hi>Marie</hi> (a holy and happie virgin) enacting hir griefe with her armes,
when she had ouerforced both her tongue and eies with compassion: briefely, her
paine &amp; impatience beeing so great <pb facs="tcp:23854:64"/> as her wordes could not
expresse it, hir desires so importunat, as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded all her delightes.
The image of her griefe before her, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of her losse within her,
shee sownded on the senselesse earth, and being conueied to her oratorie by the
