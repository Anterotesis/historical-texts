            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Right Honourable, THE LADY ELIZABETH DELAVAL.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince your Ladyship has such great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Fortune in those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Blessings, Wit and Beauty, the best Companions of Quality; this Trouble is no more than what in Reason ought to be expected: For Dedications are but little better than Prologues and Epilogues; the general Subject of 'em is, to Persecute the Witty and the Fair. Your Ladyships Perfections give me an ample Theme, and your Kindness to this Poem gives me boldness to make use of it. But Virtues in Persons so Nobly descended, are but things Necessitated; your Ladyships<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Merits
<pb facs="tcp:98160:3"/>
could not be less, since they are derived from such Illustrious Parents. The Loyal Earl of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogh,</hi> by his Personal Actions in the Wars, and his constant following the Kings Fate beyond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Sea, made himself so considerable an Enemy to the Rebellious Party, that they used all their Arts, and laid all the Baits of Interest to have made him their Friend; but their Impious Cause, and their slighted proffers appeard so detestable, that he proved his Valour and Fidelity equally Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable. And to summe up his Character, he was a Person that made the Field his Temple, Majesty his Divinity, and his Life and Fortunes, the Sacrifices he offered: Nor were his Heroick Vertues unmatcht in the Famous <hi>Lady Aubeny,</hi> whose Industrious Loyalty, and more than Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Courage, renderd her so Conspicuous, that, though Success and Victory were the Rebels constant Slaves, and the spight of Fate had made 'em continually Prosperous, both in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and their Arms; yet such were her Indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Services to the Royal Cause, as made her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by the World, and Feared even by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible: witness her Imprisonment in the Tower, from whence by a miraculous Escape from her
<pb facs="tcp:98160:3"/>
Confinement, and her threaten'd Martyrdome, as she lived a Champion for Loyalty, she dyed an Exile for it. Nor is your Ladyship less Indebted to Providence for your Education than your Birth, in the Affinity and Patronage of the Lady <hi>Stanhope,</hi> a Person of so much Worth and Honour, so truly Generous, and so excellently Good. But my design is not that of a Herauld, but a Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner. The <hi>Faithful Shepherd</hi> begs Acceptance, and the better to obtain that Favour, I may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Crime boast of some Merit in the Present I make, since it borrows its Value from the Esteem'd <hi>Guarini;</hi> and I have one encouragment more to devote it here, knowing it has formerly been your Ladyships Diversion. If I am Censured by the Admirers of <hi>Pastor Fido</hi> for being so bold with so received a Poem, I only make this Apology, that <hi>Plays</hi> are so strictly tyed up to Fashion, that like costly Habits, they are not Beautiful without it. I confess I have taken a great deal of Liberty in the Characters of <hi>Sylvano</hi> and <hi>Corisca,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were not kept up in the Author: The first of which, in the Translated <hi>Pastor Fido</hi> (for I am a Stranger to the <hi>Italian</hi>) flag'd in the second Act, and was wholly lost in the two last.
<pb facs="tcp:98160:4"/>
And the part of <hi>Dorinda</hi> was made up new to fit it for the person design'd to Act it: And the two last Acts which have so little of the Authors, have still his design, only that I have represented what was but Narrative in the Original. But what-ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages I may have received from so famed a Story, &amp; so good a Foundation, my greatest is, the occasion it gives me of expressing my self,</p>
