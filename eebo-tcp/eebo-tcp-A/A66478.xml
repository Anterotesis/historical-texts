         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Hiſtorical Review
Of the Late HORRID
Phanatical Conſpiracy, &amp;c,</head>
            <p>AS Previous to the Relation of the late <hi>Phanatical Plot,</hi> to
ſhew the unreaſonableneſs, as well as Impiety of the ſame;
It will not be unneceſſary to take a ſhort Scheme of the
Times wherein the ſame happened. To which end, we
need look no further back in our Annals, then the days
we have lived in, nor certainly can we meet with in all the paſt Records
of ours or any other Nations, any inſtances of Ills ſo Infamouſly Notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as thoſe which theſe may afford us, pretermitting ſuch which an Act
of Oblivion did but too mercifully bury in Silence, tho our Memories
cannot obliterate the ſame, ſeeing the like Actors, and Actions deſigned
on our preſent Theatre, as fatally made up the Tragedy of our late Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters,
which brought as well the beſt of Kings to the Ax, as the beſt of
Governments to Anarchy and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>The Night of ſuffering under which we then lay, was ſo long and
tedious, that our hopes were almoſt inveloped in its ſhades, and deſpair
had got ſo ſtrong a poſſeſſion of our Spirits, that we lay groaning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our burthens, with Tempers as unactive and frozen, as Slavery, and
Fear could make them; to complain was a Crime, to redreſs, a Treaſon;
the firſt a certain Forſeit of our Eſtates, the latter of our Lives. When
Providence, Almighty Providence, for no leſs could Finiſh our Redempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
raiſed up our beteared Eyes, to behold the Day-ſtar, which uſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Morning of that Felicity, we have ſince enjoyed in the happy
Reſtauration of his Majeſty. A day which in all future ages will be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
Recorded amongſt the moſt fortunate, this Iſle was ever bleſt
with. A day wherein Religion and Monarchy, like two Winter'd Roots
that had been long buried in the Grave of Earth, began to Sprout,
and put on the Springing Livery of Summer, and Increaſe. A day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Right, like an Intercepted Current, flowed again in its own Channel,
and viſited thoſe Banks from which it had been ſo long eſtrang'd. Our
Churches reduced from Stables, and Garriſons to the Temples of the
Omnipotent: Our Benches from Seats of Injuſtice, to thoſe of Law,
Equity and Conſcience: Our Preachers diſarrayed of their Buſſ, Diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of their Swords and diſcarded from theſe pretences, to give Place
to the Judicious and Pious. Our Doctrines purged of Schiſm, and
Hereſy, and in ſhort, whatever was in it ſelf Relig<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ous, Peaceable,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51743:4"/>
Juſt, and Righteous, took the upper hand of Atheiſm, Hypocriſy, Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and Deceit.</p>
            <p>Nor was the ſhine of this Glorious hour like the Promiſing Beams of
a Beauteous Morning, which was ſoon overſhadowed by the riſing Clouds
of a weeping Noon, but ſo ſettled, and Eſtabliſhed, were its reſplendent
Rays, that under the Univerſal Influences thereof, our Vineyards
increaſed, and our Barns were fill'd with the repleniſhed Harveſt of all
ſorts of Happineſs, in ſo great a meaſure, that certainly no Nation in
the whole Univerſe, not our own in the moſt Celebrated times of Peace,
and Plenty, could ever boaſt the like. 'Twas then we began to ſee the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
between a Tyrant that had Uſurped his Maſters Throne by
feigned Artifices and Injurious Arms, and preſerved the ſame by cloſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
and holy Cheats, and a Lawful Prince, whoſe undoubted Right
gave him as Indiſputable a Title thereunto, as his Merits have ſince
ſhown him worthy thereof. The noiſe of War, and Bloodſhed, was
drown'd in the ſtill Waves of ſlowing Peace, No ſeige Alarm'd the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
Palace or diſpers'd their Votaries, the Citizen was fearleſs of, and ſafe
from Plunder, the Plough-man unaffrighted could Sing at his Labours,
knowing his propriety to their Increaſe, and each Man under his own
Vine, bleſs the Patron of their ſafety. Happy, happy, had we been,
could we have been thus contented; but ſo luxuriant is the temper of too
many amongſt us, that Heaven it ſelf ſhould it have ſhowred down Gold
into their Cheſt, and Treated them with Celeſtial Viands, yet they
alas! Would never have been contented, but like the Murmuring
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in proſpect of their <hi>Canaan,</hi> have lookt querulouſly back to their
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage, and longed for the Onyons, and Garlick, they there
fed on; a greater Inſtance of which I would boldly challenge all Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to give me an account of, then this which now Employs my Pen,
Which, I'me affraid, will ſcarce in future Ages receive its due Credit, it
being ſo unreaſonable in it ſelf, and ſo Impious in its deſign; a deſign not
only to have deſtroyed the Ancient Government of three Realms, the
Eſtabliſhed form of the beſt Religion, and the continued Calm and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity,
we had ſo long enjoyed even then, when Chriſtendom was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyled
in Blood and Arms, and ſcarce one corner of the <hi>European</hi>
World, beſides our own, was diſengaged; but alſo that great and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
Monarch, kind as a giving God, and bounteous as Heaven, who
preſerved the firſt, Encouraged the ſecond, and held the Ballance of the laſt
Impardonable Ingratitude! by what Name ſhall I ſtile thee? By
what Title ſhall I diſtinguiſh thee from thoſe leſſer Crimes that fill the
Legends of the Infernal Deeps? To call thee Rebellion, or Treaſon,
how inſignificant is the Name? Theſe imply ſome Cauſe, ſome Oppreſſion
to Inſtigate them; thine had none, unleſs thy too great Tranquillity,
and Increaſe pampered thee, and like the Aſs in the Fable, thou ſpurneſt
thy Feeder, tell me ye unſatisfied, Can any of you complain that you
were hardly uſed? Did you ever in vain Implead for your own, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from the Courts of Juſtice without Redreſs? Did you ever La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the loſs of any thing that was Tortouſly wreſted from your Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?
Were you ever Plundered, or Sequeſtred, Impriſoned, or Enſlaved,
Baniſhed or Ruined? You cannot be ſo Impudently, ſo Notoriouſly baſe,
to Anſwer in the Affirmative; no, 'twas the luſt of Power Inticed you,
and the embraces of a Throne, that your Arms ſought after, whilſt the
gay Deluſion, like the wandring Fires that misguide the nighted Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller,
lead you on through Boggs, and Quagmires, where, that you
might the more ſafely paſs, you disburthen'd your ſelves of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51743:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Loads of Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Conſcience that might retard you,
and changed the ſubſtantial part thereof, for Shadows and Paints that
deceive the Spectators, and are leſs troubleſom to the bearer; wherefore
to undeceive thoſe whom your falſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Appearances have miſſed, I ſhall
hereby endeavour to expoſe the nakedneſs of your ends in the Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of what in matter of Fact, hath been obviouſly enough proved,
and collect in a few ſheets the work of Volumes; to begin therefore with
the miraculous Diſcovery of the late <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> as the ſame was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eſteemed, a work of Omniſcient Power, ſo did His Majeſty, and the
great Council of the Nation, as became Wiſe, and Juſt Governours,
take the ſame into Examination, and prob'd the Wound to its full depth,
applying fit Remedies thereunto for its cure, not only by cutting off the
Proud Fleſh that grew about it, but alſo healing up the Breach it had
made, and purging the ſtate of that Body Politick, it had reach'd from
the remaining Infections, the ſame by a new relapſe might have fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
by ſuch wholeſom and Proper Methods, as the quality of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
required; when inſtead of Reſting ſatisfied therewith, the
Diſſenting part of the Nation (under which Title I may Juſtly Rank
the whole <hi>Phanatical</hi> Sect) like Ignorant Quacks fell out with the
Preſcriptions, and if they could not be admitted to deſtroy the patient
by their unskil'd preparations, nothing leſs would ſerve their ends.
Hence it was they began to aſſume to themſelves that Liberty, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſing
their Superiours, in Common Prints, Libels, and Paſquils at
their very Gates, whilſt their Coffee-Houſes, and Tables afforded no
other Diſcourſe then the wiſe Methods of altering the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and Integral parts of that Government they lived under, nor could
any Man ſpeak his own Judgment, if the ſame was not tun'd to their lyre,
and danc'd to their Extravagant Meaſures, at no leſs rates than the hazard of
his Liberty, &amp; Pennance to boot; Incomparable Juſtice! The Peoples <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
Charta,</hi> and the Multitudes by Law; yet ſuch were the only Patriots who
owned it, ſuch the Defenders of our Property, who Intruded moſt arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily
upon it, and thoſe the honeſt Preſervers of our Freedom, who
Thieved it from us, till the Inſolency of the Populace was grown to
that height, our great Maſter was threatned by it through the ſide of his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Brother, &amp; forced at laſt to ſay, as the Almighty to the Diſſenting Waves,
Warring againſt the Eſtabliſht ſhore, Hitherto ſhall ye go, and no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Nor was it leſs then neceſſary, to prevent the inundation of that
Throne, on which he ſat; but as the Waves, when ſo ſtopt, murmur againſt
the ſhore that bounds them, and daſh their ſawcy Billows at it's Imperial
Feet, ſo did the Clamorous and Ill manner'd vulgarity, by bold, and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
forfeiting Petitions, ſtuft with little leſs then Treaſon, and ſufficiently
with ſcandal, approach the Sacred Seat of Majeſty; which, I'me afraid,
too many of them thought too ſtrongly fixt; and though the general
Cry was Religion, Property, and a Parliament, 'twas a Common Wealth
at the bottom, and nothing leſs would ſatisfie this all asking Party. Why
otherwiſe ſhould they ſtand in open Defiance, againſt ſuch very Acts
their own Repreſentatives had upon Mature and ſerious Deliberations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
as particularly thoſe which were made againſt the Nonconformiſts,
and Schiſmaticks, to which either no reſpect is to be had to thoſe Aſſemblies
that Conſtituted the ſame, or thoſe Laws are fit, and juſt; and why they
ſhould be ſo ſevere againſt them, in the Days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> before
ſuch time as they had broke out into an open Rebellion, and ſhould now
remit of their ſeverity, when by frequent Rebellions and Extravagant

Inconſiſtent with all Governments, into the body of their Divinity, I ſee
not the leaſt umbrage of reaſon for—but alas, they care no more for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
then Kings, and think them only infallible, when like themſelves
they connive at pulling down all Right, Religion, and Order, as ſome did
but too nearly Accompliſh. As a Syſtem of which Principles, I think not
Improper to inſert an Expreſſion in the Prayer of one of their Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Divines, ſince fled for a <hi>Scotch</hi> Traytor, juſt about ſuch time as the
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Parliament was diſſolved, after ſome Incouragement of the
People to be unannimous againſt the ſo much feared Popiſh Doctrines,
and Counſels—<hi>Oh Lord,</hi> purſues he! <hi>if thou haſt deſign'd this ſpot, this
little ſpot</hi> England, <hi>as the ſcene on which the Battles of Chriſt, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt
is to be fought, let us have the honour of it, and begin quickly,
let this be called the Valley of the Valley of Deciſion:</hi> Judg then
you, who will not be blinded, with what was moſt aimed at, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

ſuch Troops of <hi>Colledges,</hi> and Swords-men, attended the ſame, they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
there like Vultures over the Field of gathered Warriours, expecting
the News of Battle and Slaughter, to ſatisfie their Voracious Maws; But
Thanks, Ten Thouſand Thanks to the great Governour of Heaven, and
his Immediate Subſtitute, our Gracious Soveraign, who baulk't their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations,
and ſent them angrily home, repining at the Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But here let <hi>Billinsgate</hi> Avaunt, and give place to the Mechanicks
and Joyners of State, whilſt in more ſpurious Ribaldry they rail at their
Prince and Government, let <hi>Bedlam</hi> be clear'd for theſe wiſer Madmen.
Reformation's on Foot, the Church is to be cleanſed by the Common-Sewer,
and the Laws to be rectified by Libels, Double the Watches, the
Papiſts are in Arms, Black-bills appear, the Knife is at their Theoats, and
before the next Morning the Dead ſhall ariſe, and wonder to behold
themſelves Living, this was the Common Cry, Incomperable Advice!
But why this Diſſimulation? Why not in plain Engliſh? might it not be
ſaid Riſe and Defend your ſelves, bring in your Plate, your Spoons, your
Thimbles, and your Whiſtles? is the Publick Credit of leſs value than
formerly? Where are the Drums and Trumpets, your Levies and Muſters?
Why are the unneceſſary Guards ſpared, ſay the Word, ſpeak your Intentions
in Intelligible Sillables. Your Noble Peer is ready to Aſſiſt you, Daſtardly
Leaders and deluded Cockscombs. But Fate had not Ripened their Aimes,
their Party wanted the Courage they wiſhed them and like cunning
Men, and more to be feared, Traytors e're they leapt, they view'd the
Precipice, and for want of Reſolution, miſt their Opportunities, which the
Prudence and Care of His Majeſty, by the ſeaſonable Publiſhing his
Gracious Declaration, for the future Abrigded them of, 'twas this that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
the Eyes of the Cheated Nation, and drew the Loyal upon their
Knees, in grateful Acknowledgments of his Fatherly care of their Lives, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
and Eſtates; 'twas this diſpelled thoſe Miſts, and Fogs, of Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
which aroſe from the Stenchy Vapours of their Nauſeous Principles,
&amp; Deſigns, and clearly diſcovered their Malevolent Intentions. But yet ſo
far had they ſpread their Poyſon amidſt their Diſſenting Brethren, that the
botches and blains thereof but too plainly appeared, and were not ſo ſoon
cured, the chief Magiſtrates were ſuch as they themſelves had ſet up, and
Cajoled into their Service, ſo that here Treaſon was Indemnified, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the ſame was carefully Committed within the Circuite of thoſe Walls,
and tho taken notice of, and brought to light, they had a free ſhelter
from the Judgment the Law pronounced thereon, being Skreened on
the Dark ſide of an Ignoramus Conſcience.</p>

Happy days indeed! when to diſcharge a Thief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Jury ſhall be Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
from amidſt his Brother Criminals, though he ſees the Halter, he
need not tremble at it, let the Law threaten him, he is aſſur'd that the
ſame is but like the Cords of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> which he can break at his pleaſure.
But Juſtice will not be ſo ſatisfied, the voice of Treaſon, like that of
Blood, is never quiet, till the Traitor meets his due Reward, nor did we
long want an Inſtance thereof in the Fate of that unhappy Wretch who
ſlipt the Nooſe here, when he was removed to another County, and
came before Perſons of Religion, and Integrity; they ſoon ſaw, and
as ſoon abhorred his Crimes, regarding the quiet of their threatned
Country, beyond the Clamorous Inſtigation of a Rebellious Throng, who
neither weighed the Crime, nor danger of admitting ſuch extravagant
Scandals which he had too freequently diſperſed in order to the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that fair Intelligence that ought to be managed between the King
and his People. The unavoidable obloquy on the reputation of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
beſt and ſureſt Friends, and in ſhort, the intended Ruin of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he lived under; to the preſervation of which, who is it can blame
that Neceſſary, Juſt and Single Execution, when he lays it in the Ballance
with thoſe deſigns that threatned the whole? Where's the ſeverity
which the Phyſitian uſes in cutting off an Infected Limb to preſerve the
Body? where the Imprudence, in drawing a little Blood to prevent the
Frenzy of the Patient? and then eſpecially when he is inclined thereunto,
and the uſual Symptoms that forerun the Fit are too viſible and more then
remarkably growing every hour upon him. If this be an Error, farewel
Policy, our Anceſtors were then in the wrong, when to reſtrain the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
Liberty that Men had taken to themſelves in the late times of Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs,
when the uncloſed Wounds of the Nation were Freſh and Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to Enact a prevention of thoſe Cauſes which too far contributed to
the ſame, in making Traiterous Words &amp; Poſitions that aimed at the Life
or Perſon of his Sacred Majeſty, or the Roots of his Eſtabliſht Government,
tho no overt Act beſides demonſtrated the ſame to be adjudged High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
yet had this been wanting, ſufficient was the proof againſt our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſufferer, and ſo palpable were his Treaſons, that all good Men cry
out with as much Juſtice againſt thoſe who firſt acquitted him, as the
very Crimes themſelves of which he ſtood Indicted—High time therefore
was it for our Gracious Monarch to look about himſelf, and Aſſume the
Rein of Empire into his own hands, when ſuch mad <hi>Jehu</hi>'s ſtrove to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
the Chariot, and Cariere us to Ruin.—Nor indeed was leſs to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
as quickly afterwards was diſcovered in that dangerous Aſſociation,
which was found in the Cuſtody of one of the greateſt Patriots of this
Diſaffected Party, a Villany ſo cloſe laid that no Record perhaps to future
Ages ſhall be more Authoritative to convince Infidelity it ſelf of their then
Deſigns; which that the Reader may be further ſatisfied in, I think it not
Impertinent to Abbreviate the ſame, and preſent a ſhort view thereof to
his Proſpect. In the firſt part of which, tho the ſame ſeems ſomewhat
plauſibly Penned in ſetting forth the dangers we are in from the Popiſh
Prieſts and Jeſuits, with the Papiſts and their Adherents and Abettors,
who for ſeveral Years laſt paſt, had purſued a moſt Pernicious and Helliſh
Plot, to Root out the True Proteſtant Religion as a Peſtilent Hereſie, and

whereby he had created to himſelf Dependants in Church and State,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51743:6"/>
under expectation of his Succeſſion to the Crown, as alſo that by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
Mercenary Forces had been Levied and kept on Foot for his ſecret
Deſigns, and Parliaments unreaſonably Prorogued and Diſſolved, when
in the hot purſuits of Popiſh Conſpiracies and ill Miniſters of State, with
many other Conſiderations, that hereby the Treaſure, Strength, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation

ends they had in a Parliamentary way endeavoured to Exclude the ſaid
Duke from the Succeſſion to the Crown, and Baniſh him for ever out of
theſe Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but the ſaid Means being Rejected,
they thereupon thought fit to Unite themſelves by a Solemn and Sacred

            <p>I <hi>A. B.</hi> do in the preſence of God Solemnly Promiſe, Vow

            <p>Upon the whole, let any ſerious Man debate, what this amounts to leſs
than rankeſt Treaſon, where they come, in the laſt Clauſe of it, to the
perfect point of Levying of War, poſitively agreeing, that they will Obey
ſuch Officers, as either the Parliament, or the Major part of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
either Sitting or Diſſolved, or the Major part of the Subſcribers of

Eight other Witneſſes at the ſame time, who ſeverally Teſtified againſt

Innocent Lord was Diſcharged, and a new Holiday added to the Kalendar
of the Presbyterian Saints, for his Deliverance, which that the ſame might
be conveyed to the Memories of their Poſterity, a Medal was framed,
where on one ſide thereof the Face and Title of our Hero, was delineated,
and the Reverſe preſented us with a Palace becoming his honour, the Tower

Songs and <hi>Io Paeans</hi> before him, whilſt Fires of Joy lighted his way into
the Boſom of that Town he at the ſame time intended to lay waſte (as

parallel'd by former Preſidents, or practis'd in any Civil Government, and
yet the pretence is Zeal for the Publick Good, the <hi>Catiline</hi> was his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
Patriot, the Bulwark of their Liberties, the Defender of their Rights,
and Oppoſer of thoſe Invaſions that were pretended againſt them: Oh
well vail'd Hypocriſie! Methinks I ſee the Devil in <hi>Samuels</hi> Mantle, with
his demure Prieſts about him, Plotting to have no King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that

Canting, That Heaven is Auſpicious to their intended Deſigns, in that it
ſo far favours them! But alaſs, the Day will not long laſt, the Eye of

Fame, like that of <hi>Solomons,</hi> has already reached to the outmoſt Limits
of the World, and is juſtly the Admiration of the preſent, as he ſhall be
of future Ages, who much about this time returned from an Honorable
Exile in the Neighbour Realm, whereunto the Malevolence of the

Loyal <hi>Engliſh-Men,</hi> tho' the Advantage of that Country where he then
Reſided, the Influence of whoſe Gracious Preſence, like that of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
Rays of Light, having there produced ſo general a Reformation,
and Increaſe of all ſorts of Benefits to the Inhabitants, that mentioning
the ſame, I cannot but give you a ſhort Account thereof, as the Pens of
their own Writers have Confeſt, that Men may learn to know, he is not
ſo Invaluable a Governour, That an Inrode ſhould be made upon the Laws
of God and Nature, to Exclude him, but on the contrary, fall down on
their Faces with Confuſion, to beg his Gracious Pardon for Thoughts ſo
Incongruous to his Glorys, and their own Peace.</p>
            <p>For that it can't be deny'd, but that before his <hi>R. H.</hi> came to <hi>Scotland,</hi>
the Fields were every Sabbath covered with Arm'd Men, upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of hearing Seditious Sermons, His Majeſties moſt undeniable Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives
were upon all occaſions controverted, Maſters contemn'd by their
Servants, Heritors by their Tenants, Miniſters of the Goſpel
Invaded, Wounded and Aſſaſſinated, Churches left waſte, or inſolently
perturbed, when frequented, Principles of Aſſaſſination Preached and
Practised, all ſuch as owned, or ſerved the Government, Affronted and
Menaced, and nothing but Paſquils and Defamatory Libels, publickly
Vented and Prais'd.</p>
            <p>Whereas now People are gathered in from Fields to Churches, God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
is ſerved with Reverence, the King as his Vicegerent, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
the Royal Prerogative is neither ſtretched nor baffled, the Privy-Council
have been taught, by his <hi>R. H.</hi> ſitting ſo long amongſt them,
to ſhew as much Clemency as may conſiſt with firmneſs, and to ſuſtain
their Juſtice by their Courage. All Animoſities and Differences amongſt
the Nobles are compoſed and forgot, the Thefts and Robberies in the
Highlands, which were formerly ſo great a Reproach to the Government,
and a Ruin to the People, are now not only ſecured againſt by preſent
Puniſhment, but prevented by ſuitable and proportionable Remedies, ſuch
as Commiſſions of Juſticiary, Security taken from Heritors and Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51743:7"/>
of Claus, ſettling of Garriſons in convenient places, and giving
Moneys for Intelligence to Spies; Miniſters are ſo much protected and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
that one can hardly think, if he had not known their former
Condition, that ever the People had any Unkindneſs for them; Men do
not now luſt after News and Conventickles, but imploy thoſe thoughts
and that time upon their private Affairs, which they formerly miſpent in
following their Expenſive Field Preachers, ſecuring themſelves and their
Eſtates by a pleaſant peaceableneſs from the fears as well as the dammage
of Fines and Puniſhments. They meet with no Paſquils nor hear of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and in ſhort, Men honour the Laws by which they are protected,
and thoſe Magiſtrates by whoſe Miniſtry they enjoy this Peace and Quiet.
But as theſe were the effects of his R. H's Conduct in the North, ſo

were ſo Bold, to put the ſame in Execution on their Chief Magiſtrate,
even while he was acting in that Sphere, whereinto he had been regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Choſen, and legally Conſtituted, till His Majeſty was forced to Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
His Authority, and call them to an Account for their Riotous and
Extravagant Proceedings, and upon a fair Tryal, and undeniable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
ſetting forth the Cuſtoms and Uſage of Elections, He obtained
Judgment againſt ſeveral of the moſt Notorious of them, who had been
the greateſt ſticklers therein, and withal, thought it abſolutely neceſſary,
to Enquire into the Abuſe of Franchiſes, to make a Regulation ſufficient
to reſtore the City to its former good Government, wherein His Aim
was not ſo much for their Puniſhment, tho he had ſufficient Incitations
thereunto, as their Good, to which End, he brought and obtained Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in a <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> againſt their Charter, but to ſhew His Mercy,
as well as His Power, when He had them at His Feet, tho before they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
a Submiſſion to His Gracious Pleaſure, upon their Humble Petition,
He offered the Confirmation thereof again to them, reſerving to Himſelf
only the Power of Approbation in the Choice of ſome few of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
which had been as much for their Benefit, as the general Peace and
Good of the City, to have Granted but this, the remaining Sparks of the
Faction thought too much to be allowed, even when the whole was at His
diſpoſal, and happily fell into His Hands; but during the time that theſe
Affairs were managing in the Courts above, a more cloſe Cabal of Helliſh
and Impardonable Rebels, were every Day Aſſembled, for carrying on and
perfecting the main Plot upon His Majeſties Sacred Perſon, as alſo that of
his Royal-Highneſs, and the Loyal Party, who were to be Maſſacred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Riſing; In the handling of which, I ſhall firſt give a draught
of the Deſign in the general, and then deſcend to ſpeak of the particular
parts thereof, as the ſame were in Proof againſt thoſe who Suffered a
Condign Puniſhment for their ſaid Treaſons.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> 1682. when the Chief of that Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Seditious Tribe found that the Magiſtrates of the City was ſettled,
as is before mentioned, their Impaciency was ſuch, that they immediatly
Conſulted of Riſing in an open Rebellion, for which, ſome of them
thought themſelves ſo well prepared, that they could not fail of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Ends, when ever they ſhould break into Arms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:51743:8"/>
Upon which, there was a Meeting of ſome of the Principal of the
Conſpirators, to agree of the beſt and readieſt Methods, to Maſter His
Majeſties Guards, and Seize His Royal Perſon; but upon Conſideration,
they found it neceſſary to add more Arrows to their Quiver, and Strings,
then one, to their Bow, that if they miſt their Aim at firſt flight, the
Second might hit their Mark, they therefore thought fit to prepare their
Friends in the ſeveral Counties, Cities and Towns, of <hi>England,</hi> as alſo the
diſaffected Party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to join with them, without which any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
in the City of <hi>London,</hi> or upon the Guards aforeſaid, appeared too
Raſh to be undertaken, ſo that the thoughts of a preſent Riſing was then
laid aſide, and they diſpoſed themſelves to find, by a Correſpondence with
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and the ſeveral parts of this Kingdom, how far they might be
Aſſiſted by a general Inſurrection, ſo that in Humane probability they
might not fail of Succeſs, whence the Reader may Obſerve, that this was
not an Airy Notion, or Embryo of hot Brains, but laid as deep, and as
deſignedly and proportionably formed, as the Wiſdom of Man, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
of Contriving Rebels, could Studiouſly Effect.</p>
            <p>Moreover, whilſt this firſt Deſign was framing, ſome Villains were
likewiſe carrying on that Horrid and Execrable Plot of Aſſaſſination afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
of His Majeſty, and Royal Highneſs, His Deareſt Brother,
in their coming from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> and Money was depoſited for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
but by the ſhortneſs of the time, His Majeſty being then immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
upon His Return, and for want of neceſſary preparations, they were
forced to defer the Execution of it till further opportunity.</p>
            <p>It was then propoſed amongſt them, whether they ſhould Attempt the
ſame at His Majeſties next going to <hi>Newmarket,</hi> in <hi>March</hi> following? To
which, an Objection was ſtarted, That thoſe Guards which uſually remain
here ſome time after His Majeſties Departure, would be capable of making
a great Oppoſition upon the Arrival of the News; for which reaſon, and
becauſe they were not then in a readineſs, it was Agreed to be done at His
Return thence. The Scene where this Fatal and Execrable Wickedneſs was
to have been perpetrated, was the Houſe of one <hi>Richard Rumbald</hi> a <hi>Malſter,</hi>
called the <hi>Rye,</hi> near <hi>Hokesdon,</hi> in the County of <hi>Hertford;</hi> and it was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
That Forty Perſons in Number, who were to be the Actors in
the Tragedy, under the Command of the ſaid <hi>Richard Rumbald,</hi> ſhould
hide themſelves in or near the ſaid Houſe, and when His Majeſties Coach
ſhould come over againſt them, then Three or Four to Shoot with Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbuſſes
at the Poſtilion and Horſes, and if they ſhould miſs their Aim,
ſome were to be ready in the way, who in the Habit of Labourers, ſhould
Turn a Cart acroſs the Paſſage, and ſo ſtop the Coach; others were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to Shoot into the Coach where His Majeſty and Royal Highneſs
were to be, and others to Fire upon the Guards that Attended them, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
withal, That upon the ſame Day, many Lords and other Perſons
of Quality, whom they ſuppoſed favourable to their Deſigns, ſhould be
Invited to Dine. in <hi>London,</hi> that they might be the more ready to appear
amongſt the Citizens, upon Arrival of the ſaid News; the Actors in the
ſaid Aſſaſſination having contrived their manner of Eſcape, by a nearer
paſſage then the uſual Road, by which means they hoped to get to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
as ſoon as the News could be brought thither, thinking it would not
be difficult, upon their perpetration of this Abominable Fact, to poſſeſs
themſelves of the Government, preſuming on the Numbers of the Diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
But leaſt the Blackneſs of ſuch an Action might deter any from
joining with them, they prepared to Palliate the ſame, as far as they
could, by ſome True Protoſtant Fanatical Remonſtrance or Declaration,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51743:9"/>
which was ready to be Printed and Diſperſed in that Confuſion, to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe
the People; and leaſt the Officers of State, and the Magiſtrates of
the City, with the Militia thereof, and other of His Majeſties Loyal
Subje<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s, ſhould be able to put ſome ſtop to thoſe Floods of Ruin and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,
which would hereby have inevitably overwhelmed the better
part of the Nation, they Reſolved to follow this Blow with a Maſſacre,
wherein they particularly deſigned the immediate Slaughter of the ſaid
State Officers, the then Lord Mayor, the Sheriffs, and the Magiſtracy of
the City, and all others, who had been any ways Eminent for their ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and unbiaſt Loyalty. But here again the Finger of Almighty appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his Wonderful Providence, to Defeat theſe Councels, by a ſudden
Fire at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> which neceſſitated His Majeſties Return thence, before
the time he had appointed; Happy, Miraculouſly Happy, Flames!
May the Aſhes you made, be Conſecrated, and the Ground, you laid
waſt, the Foundation of a Temple to the Omnipotent, where Songs of
Joy and Praiſe may be Sung, to Times laſt Period, for the occaſional De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
you afforded us. Yet theſe Villains, hardned in Impiety, were
not hereby diſcouraged from purſueing the ſame Bloody Deſign, but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to Travel forward therein, till they reach'd the outmoſt ſtep to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the ſame; and propoſed with themſelves, that it might be done, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in His Majeſties paſſing from <hi>Windſor</hi> to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> or in His
then intended Journey to <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> or when He ſhould go by Water in
His Barge, or under <hi>Bedford-Garden-Wall</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> when He
ſhould paſs that way, or at the <hi>Bull-Feaſt,</hi> which was then ſhortly after
intended, in <hi>Red-Lyon-Fields,</hi> they being informed, His Majeſty and Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Highneſs would be there. And that they might be the better prepared,
when the occaſion ſhould offer it ſelf, by having a certain Number of
Arms lying always ready, for that purpoſe Arms were beſpoke for Forty
Men in all haſt, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Thirty Carbines, with Belts and Swivels, Thirty
Caſes of Piſtols, and Ten Blunderbuſſes, which were accordingly made
and paid for.</p>
            <p>And for their more eaſie drawing their Party together, againſt the time
of Execution, they contrived to divide the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
and the Suburbs, into Twenty parts, from each of which, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Five Hundred Men to be ready on the firſt Onſet, and ſome Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators
were to give an Account of Men to be furniſhed in each Diviſion,
and give out Orders to them, as there ſhould be occaſion.</p>
            <p>And to the end, the Forces they ſhould Raiſe, might be the ſooner
Modeled into the Form of an Army, there were a Hundred old Officers,
who had been Engaged in the late Rebellion, (thereby the better fitted for
this,) ready in Town to take the Command of them; in the purſuit of
which Deſperate, Cruel and Ineterate, Projects, they continued, till they
knew that Diſcovery had been made thereof to His Majeſty.</p>
            <p>During all which time, the other more principal Conſpirators were not
unemployed, but carried or managed their other Deſign, for a general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
in both Kingdoms, and the late Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> who had at
firſt preſſed them to a ſudden Inſurrection, which he would have had to
have been before, or at leaſt, on the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> being the Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when People generally gave themſelves the
Liberty of Solemnizing the ſame in Extraordinary Crouds, and on that
Account, would be leſs ſuſpected, and the ſooner Raiſed, ſent to the reſt of
the Conſpirators, at a Meeting appointed by them, to know their Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and finding them either timorous or unprepared to Venture upon
the ſame, Conveyed himſelf, with ſome others of his Crew, ſecretly into
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51743:9"/>
               <hi>Holland,</hi> to avoid the Danger he might be in, by a Diſcovery, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
piece of Policy, perhaps, that ever that ſaid Earl, tho a Famed <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel,</hi>
ever in his Life was to be Eſteemed for; but his thus withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf from their Councels, did not diſcourage them from purſueing
their Pernicious Infernal Deſigns, tho it made them a little more Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
whereupon a New Councel was appointed, of Six Perſons, that
were to have the Chief Management of Affairs, in order to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Inſurrection, by a Correſpondency with their Party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
the ſeveral parts of this Kingdom, and becauſe an Intercourſe of Letters
was thought dangerous, it was held neceſſary, that ſome Perſon ſhould be
Intruſted with a Meſſage into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to Invite the Heads of the Diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
Party there, to come hither under pretence of Purchaſing Lands
in <hi>Carolina,</hi> but in truth, to Concert with them, the beſt Means for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on the Deſign Jointly in both Kingdoms; and a Treaty was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
had with <hi>Archbold Cambell,</hi> late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> who then ſtood
Attainted of High Treaſon, and had made his Eſcape from Juſtice, who
Demanded <hi>30000l.</hi> at firſt, but afterwards Agreed to Accept of <hi>10000l.</hi>
for Buying of Arms in <hi>Holland,</hi> and making other Proviſions previous to
the ſaid Rebellion, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in which ſaid Councel of Six, ſeveral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
were managed, As whether the Riſing in this Kingdom, ſhould be
firſt in the City of <hi>London,</hi> where, by reaſon of the vaſt Number
of the Diſaffected, that might readily Unite, they might eaſily Maſter the
Guards, or rather in ſome Remote Parts, whereby His Majeſty would be
under a neceſſity of ſending His ſaid Guards to Suppreſs them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Riſing in the ſaid City would become more Secure and Effectual;
but at laſt it came to this Reſolution, as moſt convenient, That it ſhould
be in all parts at the ſame time, leaſt the City might be Defended by
the Militia thereof, without help of the Guards, which might be ſent for
Suppreſſing any Inſurrection in the Countrey; to which they all Conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and diſpoſed themſelves for Compaſſing the ſaid Deſign, which was
very near taking Effect, juſt as the ſame, by the Mercy of the Almighty,
on the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1683. came to a Diſcovery, by the Confeſſion of
Mr. <hi>Keeling,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 10. Walcot<hi>'s Tryal.</hi>
               </note> who greatly troubled at his Concernt herein, (being one of
thoſe who ſhould have been Employed in the Aſſaſſination mentioned,)
thought, he did very ill in not diſcovering the ſame, in ſo much, that he
had no Peace, Satisfaction or Content, nor could he mind his Buſineſs,
or take that Reſt that at other times he was wont, Ruminating with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that if it were a Sin in <hi>David,</hi> to Cut off the Hem of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
much more would the ſame have been in him, to have Murdered
ſo Good and Gracious a King: Which the ſaid Conſpirators coming to hear
of, they began each of them to ſhift for their Safety, and met about the
ſame at the Lodgings of Captain <hi>Walcot,</hi> ſince Executed, very early on
the <hi>Monday</hi> Morning following, where ſome of them having Hired a
Boat, to whom they had given Five Pounds in Earneſt, intended for <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
whilſt others lingred about the Town, and particularly, <hi>Rumbald,</hi>
who having got this <hi>Keeling</hi> to a Tavorn, began to Charge him as a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer,

which in due time, is more then probable, will be too ſwift for ſuch
Wretched Criminals; beſides theſe, <hi>Ford</hi> Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> being Apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

Committed to the ſaid place, for the Treaſons aforeſaid, whether under a
Senſe of his own Guilt, or the Utter Deſpair of his Royal Maſter and
Benefactor's Mercy, whom he had ſo highly wronged, prevented the
Sentence of the Law, and laid Murdrous Hands on his Life, by Cutting
his own Throat; ſeveral others were taken and Committed, amongſt
whom, the Lord <hi>William Ruſſell, Algernoone Sidney</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Thomas Walcot,

to Treat of, which is the Second part of that Method I propoſed,
and wherein I ſhall Glean only what was materially Witneſſed againſt
them, and is proper for the further parts of this Hiſtory, whereby the
way, and from what has been before ſaid, I would entreat the Reader to
take Notice, that there were Two ſeveral Deſigns on foot, the one, The
Murther of the King, and the Utter Deſtruction of the Government, in
which the Three latter were concerned; the other, Singly againſt the
Government, in which was the Two firſt. But theſe Two, like Siſter-Springs,
roſe both from one of the ſame Corrupt Fountain, and tho the
Channels, in which they wandred, were for ſometime different, yet at
laſt they were both deſigned to Meet and Embrace each other in the
wide Ocean of Anarchy and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>At the Tryal of Captain <hi>Walcot,</hi> the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> 1683. for the ſaid
Treaſons, Evidence was given by Collonel <hi>Rumſey,</hi> to the following Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
That about the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
he was with the late Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> who acquainted him, the
D. of <hi>M.</hi> the Lord <hi>Ruſſell,</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong,</hi> were
at Mr. <hi>Shepheards,</hi> the Merchants Houſe, to whom he deſired him to go,
and know what they had done about the Raiſing Arms at <hi>Taunton,</hi> who
Anſwered him, (when he came there to them,) That Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi>
had failed them about Men, and they could proceed no further at that
time; which Anſwer being conveyed to my Lord, he ſaid, There was
no dependance on thoſe Gentlemen, and that he would leave <hi>England;</hi>
after which, a Meeting was had by ſeveral of the Conſpirators, <hi>Goode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
Wade,</hi> and others, Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> being then in <hi>Holland,</hi> where
it was propoſed, No good was to be done by a general Riſing, but the
ſureſt way, was taking off the King and the Duke, to which End, they
ſent a Letter to Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> (without whoſe Aid they could not carry
the ſame on,) to <hi>Holland,</hi> who thereupon coming over, Captain <hi>Walcot</hi>
came with him on <hi>Aſhwedneſday</hi> in <hi>February,</hi> after which, ſeveral Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
were had about the ſame matter, wherein it was Concluded, at His
Majeſties coming from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> a Party ſhould Kill the Poſtilion, others
the Coach-Horſes, whilſt <hi>Rumbald</hi> Charged the Coach wherein His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
and Royal Highneſs were to be, and <hi>Walcot</hi> the Guards, to which
End, they were to meet at <hi>Hokesdon</hi> aforeſaid, and in Caſe their Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbuſſes
miſt, they were by their Swords to finiſh the ſame. But this
was put off, on the Kings unexpected return thence, on occaſion of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51743:10"/>
Fire, their Men being unprepared, tho the ſame was laboured in by Mr.
<hi>Ferguſon,</hi> and Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> undertook to go down and ask. But this
Deſign being then for that time prevented, they Agreed to Raiſe Money to
provide Arms, Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> being preſent, Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> undertook the
Arms, Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> the Money, <hi>Goodenough</hi> and <hi>Rumbald</hi> to provide Men,
for the like intent, againſt His Majeſties Perſon, as He came from <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor</hi>
to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> or at the Play-Houſe, as opportunity ſhould ſerve,
and a general Riſing was intended, to which end the City was to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into ſeveral parts, and accounts were taken of the numbers of Men
in the ſeveral Deviſions by <hi>Goodenough</hi> and others; This was the ſum
of Colonel <hi>Rumſeys</hi> Evidence.</p>
            <p>The next that appeared was Mr. <hi>Keeling,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 8. Walcot<hi>'s Tryal.</hi>
               </note> whoſe Evidence was, That
ſome time before the King went to <hi>Newmarket,</hi> he was at the <hi>Sun Tavern</hi>
with <hi>Richard Rumbald</hi> and <hi>Richard Goodenough,</hi> &amp;c. That <hi>Goodenough</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him aſide and asked him what Men he would procure to go down to
<hi>Newmarket</hi> to Kill the King and the Duke, he anſwered him he thought
none. But the Queſtion being renewed ſeveral other times, he had in the
mean while ſome Diſcourſe with one <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>Thompſon, Burton</hi> told him
one <hi>Barber</hi> would be concerned and <hi>Tompſon</hi> alſo, the <hi>Fryday</hi> after, being
the Day which the Fire happen'd in at <hi>Newmarket, Rumbald</hi> came to his
Houſe to ſee thoſe Men he could Procure, and the next day he met him,
and asked whether they were willing to go down to the <hi>Rye</hi> (meaning
his Houſe) there being, as he ſaid, no better convenience for the Deſign
then that in <hi>England,</hi> it being a Houſe intire to it ſelf, and very remote
from Neighbours, beſides the Advantage of a Court or Wall, uſing this as
an Argument to prevail with thoſe Perſons, <hi>That it would be keeping one of
the Commandements in Killing the King and the Duke, for if it be not done,
there will be otherwiſe a great deal of Blood ſhed.</hi> In the Afternoon they
met, at the <hi>Dolphin Tavern</hi> in <hi>Bartholomew Lane, Rumbald, Weſt, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough</hi>
and <hi>Hone,</hi> where <hi>Weſt</hi> asked <hi>Rumbald</hi> whether he heard the King
would come home that Night, which he Anſwered that he did, but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
it would not be till <hi>Saturday,</hi> that being the day appointed to go to
<hi>Rye</hi> to meet the King and Duke. But if they ſhould, ſays <hi>Weſt,</hi> hovv

it ſignified in <hi>Dutch, Culing,</hi> and that he vvas their <hi>Engliſh Culing,</hi>
adding, that he hoped to ſee him at the Head of as good an Army in
<hi>Wapping,</hi> as <hi>Culing</hi> vvas then at <hi>Colen.</hi> This vvas the chief part of Mr.
<hi>Keelings</hi> Evidence, only ſomething was added, touching <hi>Goodenoughs</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
to try the Temper of ſome of his Neighbours, in thoſe Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
about him, by Queſtions at a diſtance, ſuch as thoſe, <hi>In Caſe of an
Inſurrection, or</hi> French <hi>Invaſion, how are you prepared? Or, whether you would
be willing to Join therein?</hi> Telling him withal, <hi>In Caſe the Aſſaſſination
went forward, they would lay the ſame on the Papiſts, as a Branch of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Plot, and that a Declaration was prepared to eaſe the Cautious People of
their Burthens, and eſpecially,</hi> Chimney-Money.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51743:11"/>
others, where the Reſult of the Buſineſs was, <hi>A ſpeedy Deſign to Raiſe
Men, and dividing the City in Twenty Diviſions, Seizing the King and Duke
of</hi> York, <hi>and ſetting up</hi> Monmouth; That Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> then brought
an Account of 3 or 4000 Men out of thoſe Diviſions, he had an Account
of; That at another time, Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> being preſent, 'twas Diſcourſed,
To have Seized my Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, and ſome of the Aldermen,
and Chief Miniſters of State, about Town; That the <hi>Saturday</hi> before
the Diſcovery, he met at Captain <hi>Tracies,</hi> and <hi>Monday</hi> afterwards, at Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Walcots,</hi> where <hi>Ferguſon, Goodenough, Weſt</hi> and <hi>Norton,</hi> were preſent,
but nothing was concluded, he leaving them on the Debate, of Killing
<hi>Keeling.</hi> Thus much Mr. <hi>Bourne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi>'s Evidence was, That he came Acquainted with the Captain
the laſt Summer Vacation; that the Captain told him, That there was a
Deſign of an Inſurrection to be made in Three Weeks or a Month, and
that he did not know, whether he ſhould be concerned, but that my Lord
<hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was Engaged therein, and that he had an Expectation of being
a Collonel of Horſe, and Asked him, If he would have any Command
under him? That the ſaid Lord had another Deſign on the King and the
Duke, as they came from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> in <hi>October</hi> then laſt, but withal,
that he Abhorred any ſuch thing, that it was ungenerous, and he would
be concerned no further then the general Riſing, and Asked him to lend
him a Suite of Silk-Armor, and deſired him, to beſpeak him a good
ſtrong Tuck; but the ſaid Deſigns being put off, as he underſtood, by
means of Mr. <hi>Trenchard,</hi> who had diſcourſed, of what Forces he could
Raiſe in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> But when the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſent for him, his
Heart failed him, and he declaring it, my Lord <hi>Grey</hi> called him Coxcomb,
this was about the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>November;</hi> That Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> told him,
Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> had the Conduct of the Aſſaſſination, in <hi>October,</hi> and that
he was acquainted with the Inſurrection, and was a great Man in it; That
he met Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> who entertained him with a long Diſcourſe of the
Miſeries of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that the People were in Slavery and Bondage,
and would be ſo here, if they did not free themſelves, to which, there
were Two ways, One, a general Inſurrection, but that was gone off, the
other, the Killing the King and the Duke, which was the more Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
and added, that he ſuppoſed the ſame was beſt, and propoſed to
meet at his Chamber, as a place of privacy, to Treat of the ſame; they
met accordingly at his Chamber, and <hi>Ferguſon</hi> propoſed ſeveral ways of
doing it, One, as the King and Duke had their private Meetings at St.
<hi>James</hi>'s, where it was an eaſie thing for a Swords-Man to do it; That
Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> and the Captain, both told him, There was a Deſign to
have done it at my Lord Mayors Feaſt, in the Hall, or on their Return in
St. <hi>Pauls</hi>-Church-Yard, or at <hi>Ludgate,</hi> but the King not Dining there, it
was diſappointed; another way was propoſed, that they might do it as
the King and Duke went down the River, lying behind ſome ſmall Ship in
a Hoy, or ſome ſuch thing, and ſo over-run their Barge, or if that failed,
to break a Plank with their Blunderbuſſes, and ſo Sink it; another way, at
the Play-Houſe, where Forty or Fifty Men ſhould be placed in the Pit, with
Pocket or Hand Blunderbuſſes, Piſtols and Swords, and when the Muſick
ſtruck up between the Acts, to Fire on the Box, but this was held hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous,
and therefore they thought it better to do it as he came back, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Bedford-Garden-Wall,</hi> becauſe there was a Convenience for a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Men to walk in the <hi>Piazzas,</hi> and another parcel of Men might be
placed in <hi>Covent-Garden-Church-Porch,</hi> and within the Bails, where Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
could not come; That this was before Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> went for <hi>Holland,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:51743:11"/>
with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and Captain <hi>Walcot;</hi> That in the mean time,
he met Collonel <hi>Rumſey</hi> very often, but nothing was agreed, till they ſent
for Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> back, upon whoſe Arrival there was a Meeting at the
<hi>Five Bells Tavern,</hi> and ſeveral times afterwards at his Chamber; where
<hi>Ferguſon, Goodenough</hi> and <hi>Rumbald,</hi> undertook to provide the Men for the
Aſſaſſination, whereupon Debates were had, whether it ſhould be done as
His Majeſty went or came? To the firſt it was Objected, that the
Guards were left here and there, and they went together, but very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
return'd apart, and nothing being prepared, it was Reſolved, as he came
back; That it was then Conſidered, what Arms ſhould be provided, and
the matter leſt to Mr. <hi>Rumbald,</hi> and he was to provide Blunderbuſſes,
Carbines and Piſtols; That ſeveral Meetings were had, where they
brought and conferred Notes about the Men, whoſe Names, as he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
were, amongſt others, <hi>Keeling, Burton</hi> and <hi>Hone,</hi> and as he thought,
one <hi>Manning;</hi> That afterwards he Asked Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> what proviſion of
Money he had made? To which he Anſwered, That when the Men were
ready, he ſhould have Money, and not before, for that Money being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Raiſed, it was put into the Hands of One who never returned it,
and that my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> did often Complain of that Abuſe; That it
was Debated, how theſe Arms ſhould be Conveyed to <hi>Rumbald</hi>'s Houſe,
and propoſed, the ſame might be ſent down in Cheſts, in <hi>Smithfield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Carts,</hi>
or by Truſty Water-men, who were to Cover them with Oyſters;
others, that Men ſhould carry them, but no way Reſolved; And
then it came to be Debated, how they ſhould get off, and how manage
the ſame, ſome were to fall on the Poſtilion and Horſes, others on the
Coach, a Third Party under Captain <hi>Walcot,</hi> which he ndertook, who
ſhould fall on the Guards; That <hi>Rumbald</hi> undertook to Bring them off,
and that there was a Gate he would ſhut on the Horſe Guards, and they
might, when the thing was done, avoid the Road-ways, but come over
the Meadows by <hi>Hackney-Marſh,</hi> but Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> thought it better to
Retire within his Wall, and there keep till Night, it being a place they
could, againſt any Force, Defend for a Days time; That Captain <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot</hi>
told him, In Caſe of an Aſſaſſination or Inſurrection, my Lord <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
had prepared a Declaration, and would have had him done the like;
ſaying, <hi>That he would have ſeveral People do the ſame, to pick one good out
of all of them;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>That he had ſome Collections himſelf towards it;</hi>
and ſhewed him a Paper, in which was Obſervations of all the Paſſages in
the Three Kings Reigns, King <hi>James,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and this
King, which he called Attempts to bring in Arbitrary Government, and
Popery, and concluded, Taxing them with ſome Perſonal Vices, and that
the Government was Diſſolved, and they free to Settle another in its ſtead;
That when the News of the Fire came, they Adjournd to his Chamber,
and Conſiderd what they ſhould do, they were not ready, nor had no
Horſes, ſo that the ſame was laid aſide; That it was afterwards Agreed
at another Meeting, where the Captain was preſent, Mr. <hi>Ferguſon, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough,
Norton,</hi> and one <hi>Ayliſſe,</hi> that Arms ſhould be Bought, the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
were, Ten Blunderbuſſes, Twenty Two Inches in the Barrel, Thirty
Carbines, Eighteen Inches, and Thirty Caſes of Piſtols, Fourteen Inches;
That he was put upon it to Buy the ſame, the rather, for that he had a
Plantation in <hi>America,</hi> and might have on that Account a Pretence; but
Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> was to pay the Money, which in ſome great time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he did, ſaying, he had but juſt then received the ſame, and paid
him Ninety Three Guineas, which he ſuppoſed, the Moneys of Mr. <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi>
That in Caſe this Aſſaſſination had gone on, it was Deſigned, the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51743:12"/>
Lord Mayor and Sheriffs ſhould be Killed, and as many of the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
as they could get, and the Principal Miniſters of State, my Lord
<hi>Hallifax,</hi> my Lord <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> my Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> and that they would
Hang him on the ſaid Tree that <hi>Colledge</hi> had Hung; Sir <hi>John Moore</hi> was
to be Killed, and to be Hung up in <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> as a Betrayer of the
Rights and Liberties of the City; and the then Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berton,</hi>
Fleyd, and Hung up in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> with a great many of
the Pentional Parliament, as Betrayers of the Peoples Rights; That the
Priſoner was ſometimes by, at theſe Diſcourſes; That Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
he had told ſome Nonconformiſts, and they deſired him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear;
but adds he, <hi>They are Silly People, and do not know how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh,
between Killing a Prince for difference in Religion, and Deſtroying
a Tyrant for Preſervation of the Right and Liberties of the People; That
it was an Action would make all the Kings in the World Tremble, and Teach
them to uſe their Subjects Kindly;</hi> That it was the Deſign at the ſame time,
the Mayor and Sheriffs were to be Killed, that Mr. <hi>Papillion</hi> and Mr. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bois</hi>
ſhould be forced to take the Sherievalty on them, and if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
it, they ſhould be uſed as others; and that Sir <hi>Thomas Gold,</hi> Sir
<hi>John Shorter,</hi> Alderman <hi>Corniſh,</hi> ſhould be ſet up for Mayor, but rather,
the laſt, as the fitteſt Perſon; That the Kings Natural Sons were good
Luſty Lads, and it would do well to keep them for Porters and Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and my Lady <hi>Ann</hi> ſhould be Married to ſome Countrey Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
for a Breed, to keep out Foreign Pretences.</p>
            <p>I have been ſomething larger in the Repetition of this Evidence, then
was at firſt intended, but the ſame being ſo material, to Prove the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridneſs
of the moſt Barbarous part of the Deſign it ſelf, as well as that
Concern, which the Priſoner had therein, and on which his Fate depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that I hope the Reader will Excuſe me, and from the whole, Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with himſelf, That nothing leſs then the Watchful Eye of Heaven,
could poſſibly have Guarded His Sacred Majeſty from the ſeveral At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
ſo often renewed againſt him, by this Malevolent Party, Set on,
and Encouraged, by the Cant and Hypocritical Zeal of a <hi>Scotch Whig;
Whoſe only Deſign it was, to Murder His Royal Perſon, and overthrow the
Government, becauſe not Squared to his Preciſe and Rebellious Meaſures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to my Subject, The Evidence aboveſaid, ſo plainly and
palpably made out, did admit of no Plea nor Excuſe in the Wretched
Priſoner; nor indeed, could he have any Face to deny the ſame, there
being, beſides this, a Letter that was intercepted, under his own Hand,
to the Secretary of State, wherein he doth, as much, as plainly Confeſs
the ſame, <hi>Acknowledging it as his firſt Crime, and that his Life was at the
Kings Mercy, and that if his Death would do Him more Service, he was willing
to Surrender it; That if His Majeſty would admit him to Come in, &amp; uſe Mercy,
he would tell all he knew, concerning</hi> England, Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>which he
thought, would be more material, then any other Diſcoverer could Tell;</hi>
Which plainly ſhews, that he had a deeper Hand in this Miſchief, then
any of thoſe that had given Evidence againſt him. Upon the whole,
when my Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> came to Sum up the Evidence, having taken
Notice of the Material Paſſages aforeſaid, and given his Directions to the
Jury, they Brought him in, deſervedly, <hi>Guilty of the Indictment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next in order, who came to Tryal for the aforeſaid Treaſons, was,
<hi>William Hone</hi> a Joyner, with whom, in ſhort, I ſhall no further trouble
the Reader, then his own Confeſſion, <hi>That he was drawn in by Mr.</hi> Goode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
<hi>and was one of thoſe that was to Murder His Majeſty and his Royal
Highneſs, whoſe Names they Diſguiſed, under that of the</hi> Blackbird <hi>and</hi> Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finch.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:51743:12"/>
Nor ſhall I much Enlarge the Bulk of theſe Sheets, with that of <hi>John
Rouſe,</hi> who could not deny his Concern in the Treaſons aforeſaid, tho his
Poſt was ſomething of another Nature, then the Two former, which I
ſhall forthwith give you ſome Account of, begging leave only to take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
of the Juſtice of Heaven, which now overtook this Miſerable
Wretch, he having been too long known in the Government, for a moſt
Malitious Diſturber of it, and had once before been brought to the Bar
for High Treaſon, at a Time, as Sir <hi>George Jeffries,</hi> our preſent worthy
Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 63.</note> then took Notice of, <hi>When the Common Juſtice of the
Nation could not be Obtained in that place,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rouſe</hi>'s Tryal.</note> 
               <hi>inſomuch, that the Judges who
came to Execute Juſtice, had more reaſon to fear being Executed upon the
Bench, then the Priſoner at the Bar.</hi> To proceed, This Gentleman was to
take Care, to Manage a Party of Men, who were to take the Tower of
<hi>London,</hi> and the Evidence againſt him, were firſt, Mr. <hi>Lee,</hi> who Teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> having Acquainted him, that there was an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,
that the Rights and Priviledges of the Nation were Invaded,
and that it was time to look to themſelves, for Popery was Deſigned, and
Arbitrary Power, and Asked him, whether he would Engage in that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
to prevent it, and withal, that the City was to be divided, as is before
mentioned, and deſired to know, whether he would Engage in one part
of it? He Anſwered, His Acquaintance was not where he Lived, but he
would get a part where he was known, and afterward told Mr. <hi>Rouſe</hi> of
this, as alſo, that Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> had further informed him, the Deſign
was to Set up the D. of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and Kill the King and Duke of <hi>York,</hi>
but that all Parties muſt not know of it; and the People ſhould be only
Acquainted, there was like to be a Foreign Invaſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if they
ſeemed ready &amp; complyant therein to Aſſiſt, then to diſcourſe them nearer.
That Mr. <hi>Rouſe</hi> told him, he had before known it, and that he would provide
Arms for 100 Men, and that nothing was to be done, unleſs the King was
ſeized, adding, That he remembred ſince 41 the King went and ſet up
his Standard, but that he was then for ſeizing him, not taking his Blood,
and that 'twas a convenient thing for a Ball to be playd upon <hi>Black-heath,</hi>
and to that end, that ſeveral Sea-Captains ſhould be ſpoken to, that he
himſelf had ingaged Ten, and that the Affair ſhould be managed, that
he that won ſhould take it, that when they had ſo done, every Captain
ſhould take his Party, and tell them they had other Work, and then go
with Long Boats and Arms and ſeize the <hi>Tower,</hi> That Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> was
acquainted therewith, and approved thereof. That <hi>Rouſe</hi> went ſeveral
times to view the <hi>Tower,</hi> and took one <hi>Mate Lee</hi> with them, which <hi>Mate</hi>
directed them to <hi>Traytors Bridg,</hi> and ſaid, it was an eaſie place, and that
he would undertake to do it with a 100 Men, provided they had but
Hand Granadoes; That Mr. <hi>Rouſe</hi> met in this Buſineſs with 2 Sea-Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
whom he ſaid was to be Two of the Undertakers, and that they
were willing thereunto. That Mr. <hi>Rouſe</hi> was afterwards of Opinion,
for taking off the King and Duke both, for then, ſaid he, there's no Man
can have a Commiſſion to fight for them, and that he had been a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller,
and preſumed to ſay, <hi>That the King was Sworn in</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Spain
<hi>to bring in Popery and Arbitrary Government in ſo many Years, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was no Sin to take him off,</hi> adding, <hi>that he had it under his own
Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mate Lee</hi> Teſtified, That Mr. <hi>Rouſe</hi> Asked him, if he could not get
ſome Seamen fit to make Commanders of Ships, for, ſays he, with the
Guard Ships at <hi>Deptford</hi> we muſt Secure the <hi>Tower,</hi> and <hi>Whitehall</hi> both,
or we do nothing, And beſides this, One <hi>Thomas Corbin</hi> Teſtified, Tho
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51743:13"/>
the ſame did not more Affect the Priſoner, then to ſhow the Temper of
the Villain, That before the <hi>Oxford</hi> Parliament, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Rouſe</hi> ſaid,
he did foreſee, the ſame would be but a ſhort Seſſions, but theſe frequent
Diſſolutions and Prorogations of Parliaments, adds he, will not avail the
King, for whatever he hath, the Parliament had given him, and might
take it away when they pleaſed, at which, a Stander by, bid him have a
care what he ſaid, he replyed, the King had forfeited His Crown, and had
no more Right to it then he had. To all which Evidence againſt him,
the Priſoner he had no more to offer for himſelf, but that, as to the firſt
Witneſs, the Words that he Teſtified againſt him, were not really ſaid by
him, but firſt mentioned by the ſaid <hi>Lee</hi> to him, of all which; he had
not leaſt matter of proof, beſides his own Aſſertion, and indeed, theſe
matters did ſo Quadrate and Correſpond with the Temper of the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that they were the more readily receptive of Credit, which was
made plain, in the Corroborating Evidence of <hi>Corbin,</hi> before mentioned,
ſo that the Jury preſently gave in their Verdict of his Guilt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thus I have gone thro, as intended, the firſt and moſt Tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
part of this Conſpiracy, which I ſhall Sum up in the Words of the
late Lord,</hi> Chief Juſtice, <hi>now, Sir</hi> Francis Pemberton, <hi>at the end of</hi> Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot<hi>'s
Tryal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 24.</note> This Deſign, <hi>ſays he,</hi> hath gone into other of the Kings Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and is to be feared,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Walcot</hi>'s Tryal.</note> is larger then the King knows; 'Tis time to Nip
theſe Treaſons, when they are gone ſo far, ſurely a more Barbarous was never
thought of by Mankind. We have had certainly as many Engagements to the
King, as any Subjects ever had to any Prince whatſoever; He hath done as
many Acts of Grace, We have Lived as Peaceably, as any People under a
Prince can ever expect to do; He hath ſhewed Himſelf with as much Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
with as much Lenity, even to His very Enemies, as any Prince that we
ever Read of; The Preſervation of our Religion, and the Laws of the
Kingdom, our Laws and Libertees, and all our Happineſs, depend as much
upon His Life, as they ever did upon the Life of any Prince, or ever can do;
ſo that we ought all to be Concerned, even to the laſt drop of our Blood, to
Preſerve Him. But how this Miſchievous Deſign ſhould enter into the Hearts
of Men, to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertake to Kill Him in ſuch a Villanous and Barbarous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
may juſtly make us Aſtoniſhed. <hi>Thus far my Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which brings me to the Second Part of this Deſign, wherein the next
Unfortunate and ill Adviſed Gentleman, my Lord <hi>William Ruſſell</hi> was too
nearly Concerned, who on the <hi>13th</hi> of the ſaid Month, at the <hi>Old Baily</hi>
aforeſaid, was Arraigned and Indicted of the ſame, whereupon, after his
Lordſhip made a Challenge of the Jury, for that they had not Free-hold,
in which Point his Lordſhip had his Councel allowed him, upon the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of whom, the Court was of Opinion, <hi>That the ſame was no good Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,
in Caſe of Treaſon, for that they had not Free-hold within the City.</hi>
But ſatisfied his Lordſhip, that there was no Hardſhip in the Caſe, the
Reaſon of the Law for Free-holds, being only to the Intent, that no ſlight
Perſons ſhould be upon the Jury, where the Life of a Man, or his Eſtate,
comes in Queſtion; But in the City, the Perſons that are Impanelled,
are Men of Quality and Eſtate, and have much to loſe, therefore, in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
his Lordſhip had as much, as if the Challenge had been allowed;
ſo that the Jury being called over, after Exceptions made againſt Thirty
One of them, they proceeded to Read the Indictment, and Call the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
The firſt of whom, that I may not Interfere with what hath been
before taken Notice of, were Collonel <hi>Rumſey,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Shepheard,</hi> the
ſubſtance of whoſe Teſtimony, was, That my Lord <hi>Ruſſell</hi> was at the
Houſe of Mr. <hi>Shepheard,</hi> when Collonel <hi>Rumſey</hi> brought the Meſſage
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51743:13"/>
aforeſaid, from the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> about the Riſing at <hi>Taunton,</hi> that he
heard the ſame, and Approved of the Anſwer, and that there was a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of ſeeing what Poſture the Guards were in, which was to be done
by the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong;</hi>
thus far Collonel <hi>Rumſey.</hi> That at the ſame time, a Declaration, or
ſome Papers purporting as much, and ſetting forth the Grievances of the
Nation, were there Read by Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> but could not tell, whether
my Lord heard the ſame, or was by when it was Read, but that he was by
when they Diſcourſed of Seizing the Guards; ſo far Mr. <hi>Shepheard.</hi>
The next was my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> whoſe Teſtimony, as it chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
the Second Branch of the Plot, on which we now inſiſt, I ſhall
purſue the ſame in its ſeveral Steps, as it was by him Declared, (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
            <p>That he was Acquainted with Captain <hi>Walcot,</hi> and Introduced him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that of my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> where he ſoon gain'd a Confidence with
the ſaid Earl; That Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> came to him, and told him, that the
People were ſo ſenſible their Intereſt was going, by the Violence offered
to the City, in their Elections, that they would put a ſtop to it if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
That there were ſeveral Conſults and Meetings about it, and that
they began to put themſelves into a Poſture to Act, ſome had furniſhed
themſelves with good Horſes, which they kept in ſecret and blind Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
that divers intended it, and he would Imbark in it, and having an
Eſtate in <hi>Ireland,</hi> Ordered his Son to turn his Stock into Money, to
which End, he ſent his Son thither about <hi>Auguſt;</hi> That the Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
growing higher, and every Day ſeemd nearer to Action; That after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
going into the Country, he received Letters from him, wherein in
a diſguiſed Cant, he gave him Notice, that the Negotiation he had with
his Correſpondents was going on, and in good Condition, and earneſtly
deſired him to come to Town; This was about the middle of <hi>September;</hi>
That he came to Town on <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Day; That Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> Dined
with him the next, where he told him, that my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was
withdrawn from his Houſe, and tho he had abſconded from divers others,
would willingly ſpeak with him, and for that purpoſe, had ſent him to
him, with whom he went, and finding my Lord alone, my Lord told
him, That however Innocent he was, yet he, and all Honeſt Men, were
unſafe, ſo long as the Adminiſtration of Juſtice was in ſuch Hands, as
would Accommodate all things to the Humour of the Court, That in the
ſence hereof, he Retired, and that he did not doubt, Affairs were ſo ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and things ſo prepared, but that he would be able, by thoſe Men
that were in readineſs in <hi>London,</hi> to ſtop the Torrent; but complain'd, The
Deſign was much retarded, by the Deportment of the D. of <hi>Monmouth,</hi>
and the Lord <hi>Ruſſell,</hi> who had withdrawn from his Aſſiſtance, and their
own Engagements, for that when he had got ſuch a formed Force, as he
had, in <hi>London,</hi> they told him, the Country was not prepared to Concur
with him, which he lookt on as an Excuſe, and an Inſtance of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
to deſert him; That if they would loſe the Honour of it, he
would do it himſelf; To which the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> Asked him, what
Forces he had; his Anſwer was, he was Aſſured of Ten Thouſand Brisk
Boys, who would follow him on holding up his Finger, and that they
would poſſeſs themſelves of the Gates, and theſe Ten Thouſand, in Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Four Hours, would be Multiplied into Fifty Thouſand, and be able to
Sally out, and Poſſeſs themſelves of <hi>Whitehall,</hi> by Beating the Guards;
That he was certain of the Undertakement, but Confeſſed it a great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment,
that the Lords had ſailed him; That he did Conſent with
ſome Perſwaſions, that the Witneſs ſhould ſpeak to thoſe Lords, but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51743:14"/>
added, He would find they would wave it, or give deferring Anſwers.
That accordingly, my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> went to the D. of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and
told him the Earls Complaint; That the D. told him, he thought the
Earl Mad, and that he was ſo far from Encouraging him, that he told him
from the beginning, and ſo did my Lord <hi>Ruſſell,</hi> that there was no good
to be done then in the Country; That he Asked the D. whether he was
willing to Meet, who told him, with all his Heart; That he did go back
to my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and told him what the D. had ſaid, to which my
Lord replyed, 'twas Falſe, and that they were afraid to own it, adding
he had reaſon to believe, there was ſome Bargain between the Father and
Son, to ſave one another, for when he had brought him to Action, he
could never get him to put on; That they had different Proſpects, that
he was for his Perſonal Intereſt, but his People (as he termed them) was
for a Common-Wealth; That an Interview between them, would but
widen the Breach, and that he dared not truſt him; That his Friends
were gone ſo far, they could not retreat, for that it was Communicated to
ſo many, it would take Air; But that their Party was Brisk, and that
they had a Thouſand or Fifteen Hundred Horſe, who would be able to
Scour the Streets, and hinder them from Forming a Force againſt them;
But no Interview wou'd be admitted, only he added, that he might let
them know what forwardneſs he was in, and that if they would Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond
with him, they might, or he would go on without them; Which
Meſſage the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> carried back to the Duke, and at length ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
their Conſents to a Meeting, which, with much adoe, the Earl con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to, but the time appointed was put off, apprehending himſelf in
ſome Danger; That after this he did not ſee the Earl, but heard that my
Lord <hi>Ruſſell</hi> had, and that they had put off the Riſing for a Fortnight,
on Condition, that thoſe Lords, and ſeveral others, ſhould be prepared
to Raiſe the Country at that time; This was told him by the D. of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
who added, That they muſt be now in Action, for that there was
no holding it off longer, and that he had been at <hi>Wapping</hi> all Night, and
never ſaw a Company of Bolder Brisker Fellows in his Life, and that he
had been round the <hi>Tower</hi> and ſeen the Avenues thereof, and that it would
not be difficult to make themſelves Maſters thereof in a ſhort time, that
he thought it would have come to Action, but that the Duke afterwards
told him, the Gentlemen in the Country would not ſtir, hereupon they
were in a great hurry, and Captain <hi>Walcot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> came ſeveral times to him and
Diſcourſed thereof, ſaying, <hi>It was a Diſhonour of the Lords they were back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to perform their Parts, but they reſolved notwithſtanding to go on;</hi>
and, <hi>That they were reſolved to Riſe, and believed, that a ſmart Party
might perhaps meet with ſome great Men, That he acquainted the Duke here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
and that there was ſome darke intimation, as if there might ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
be made on the Kings Perſon,</hi> at which, the Duke in a Paſſion ſtruck
his Breaſt, and cryed out, <hi>God ſoe, Kill the King, Ile ne're ſuffer that,</hi> and
hereupon went to the <hi>Playhouſe</hi> to find out Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> to ſend
him about the City to put it off, That the day the King came from <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market,</hi>
ſeveral of the Conſpirators Dined in the City, where a Notion was
conveyed about, that ſome bold Action would be done that Day, and
comparing it with the Kings coming home thought it might be upon him,
That my Lord <hi>Grey</hi> hereupon ſwore, that if the ſame was attempted it
could not fail, but His Majeſties ſafe Arrivel put by the Expectation, and
what was next Determined was the Riſing on the 17th of <hi>November.</hi> But
the Proclamation againſt Bonfires then coming out, fearing the ſame was
diſcovered, it was put off, all which, my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> taking notice
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51743:14"/>
of, took Shipping and went away. That afterwards, fearing a Diſcovery;
the ſame having ſo far ſpread it ſelf, it was thought that it would not be
ſafe to retreat, and withal conſidered, that an Affair of this Weight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of of ſuch infinite particulars, it would be very neceſſary, That
there ſhould be one general Councel that ſhould take upon them the care
of the whole, upon theſe Thoughts a Cabal was Erected amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which conſiſted of Six Perſons, who were the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi>
the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hampden</hi> Junior, <hi>Algernoon Sidny,</hi>
Eſq; and the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> That about the middle of <hi>January,</hi> all theſe
Parties met at Mr. <hi>Hambdens</hi> Houſe, where it was agreed their Province
was to take care of the whole, the things to be thereby conſidered of, were
agreed to be, whether the Inſurrection was moſt proper to begin in <hi>London</hi>
or in the Country, or both at one Inſtant. To which it was ſaid, in the
Country, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> giving it as a Reaſon, that it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by a rude Rabble haſtily got together, to oppoſe a Formed Methodiz'd
and well Governed Force, and therefore whatſoever Numbers could be
gathered in the City would be quickly ſuppreſſed before they could Form
themſelves, that in the Country they might without the ſame fear they
would be here Subject to, and that being likewiſe remote from Town it
would put the King on the Dilemma that he muſt ſend his Forces to Reduce
them, or not: if he did, the City was left nake &amp; would give them opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to Riſe and come back upon the Kings Forces, if not they might
have time to form their Numbers and be better ordered, it was further
conſidered what Arms was neceſſary to be got, and how diſpoſed, what
Towns were moſt diſpoſed to Action, that it would be neceſſary to have
a Common Bank of 25 or <hi>30000l.</hi> to anſwer the occaſions of ſuch an
undertaking, but the laſt and greateſt was to draw in <hi>Scotland</hi> to conſent
with them, which at the next meeting, the ſame Perſons being all Six
there, where at my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s own Houſe, it was reſolved ſome Perſons
ſhould be ſent to my Lord <hi>Argyle,</hi> to ſettle an underſtanding with him and
others, to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to invite ſome Perſons hither who beſt underſtood the
State and could give Account thereof, the Perſons agrreed were Sir <hi>John
Cockram,</hi> Lord <hi>Melvill,</hi> and one <hi>Campbell,</hi> and accordingly <hi>Aaron Smith</hi>
was agreed to be ſent, and Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> to take Care of the Affairs.
This was the Tenour of my Lord <hi>Howards</hi> Evidence, which, together with
what was before repeated, was the ſum of what was proved againſt the
Priſoner, to which his Exceptions were firſt in general againſt the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
for that they were concerned in this matter, by their own ſhewing,
and then particularly againſt my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> that before he came as a
Witneſs againſt him, he had declared to the Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> in the hearing
of my Lord <hi>Angleſey</hi> (who Teſtified the ſame in the behalf of the Priſoner)
that the ſaid Earl had a wiſe Son and a worthy Perſon, one that could not
be in ſuch a Plot, as the ſame was, or ſuſpected for it, and that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
might expect a good Iſſue in that Affair (his Son being then Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted)
and that concerning him, he knew nothing againſt him or any
Body elſe. The ſame words at another time ſpoken, or the like Effect
were Teſtified againſt him by Mr. <hi>Howard,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> to the ſame
Purpoſe, only adding ſome Imprecations his Lordſhip had made to confirm
what he ſa<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d: to which objection my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> replyed, That the
Circumſtances he was under obliged him to outface the matter. Several
other Witneſſes were brought to prove the Priſoners Reputation and Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of Life, but the Evidence was ſo plain and undeniable againſt him,
and the Conſequence ſo great, that all good Men abhorred his Crime at
the ſame time they had Compaſſion on his Circumſtances; and even then
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51743:15"/>
when by their Oaths and Conſciences the Jury were bound to find him
Guilty, they pittied his Misfortunes. I now proceed to the Tryal of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Algernoon Sidney,</hi> (which tho the ſame doth not fall in order of time,
yet its neceſſary to give the Account thereof, it being the cloſe of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
touching the main Plot) who came to be Arraigned the 17th of
<hi>November</hi> laſt, and Tryed the 21th. wherein I ſhall pretermit all ſuch Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
as was given in general, and which is before touched, previous to
what moſt concerned him, by <hi>Weſt, Rumſey,</hi> and <hi>Keeling,</hi> as alſo the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and introductory part of what my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> Teſtified, which I
have taken notice of in the preceeding Pages.</p>
            <p>That which cheifly concerned the Priſoner, was the two Meetings and
Conſultations afore mentioned, at Mr. <hi>Hambdens,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s,
as alſo the buſineſs of <hi>Scotland</hi> debated, in the latter, to which Colonel
<hi>Sidney</hi> propounded, that he would take Care of the Perſon, and that
he had one in his thoughts, and named <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> who was look't on as
a Proper Perſon, and was accordingly ſent by him, as he himſelf told the
Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> and that he gave him about 60 Guineys to ſupply his
Charges, and had received a Letter from him on his way to <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi>
A Second part of the Evidence againſt the priſoner, were ſeveral Papers
found in his Houſe, which were by three Witneſſes proved to be of his
own hand writing by Perſons that were converſant with the ſame, in which
Papers there was a continued Thread of Argument laid down, not in one
ſingle Propoſition but a whole Series of Reaſoning, in which were
theſe Poſitions, <hi>That the King derives all his Power from the People That
'tis Originally in the People, and that the meaſure of Subjection muſt be Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ly the Parliament, and if the King does fall from doing his Duty, the
People will exact it.</hi> And this he lays down as no ways prejudecial to him,
for, ſays he, The King may refuſe the Crown if he do not like it on theſe
Terms, But if he does accept it he muſt expect the performance will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted,
or revenge taken by thoſe he hath betrayed, then he ſets up an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
and argues againſt it, Ay! but ſhall the People Judg in their own
Cauſe, which he thus Anſwers, it muſt be ſo, for is not the King a Judg
in his own Cauſe? How can any Man elſe be tryed and Convicted
of any Offence, if the King may not be Judg in his own Cauſe, for
to Judg by a Mans ſelf or his Deputy, is the ſame thing, and ſo a Crime
againſt the King cannot be Puniſhed, and then he takes notice of it as a
very abſur'd Poſition the King ſhould Judg in his own Cauſe, and not
the People. That would be to ſay, the Servant entertained by the Maſter
ſhould Judg the Maſter, but the Maſter ſhall not Judg the Servant, and
after this ſort of Argument he comes to this ſetled Poſition. We may
therefore, ſays he, change or take away Kings (without breaking any
Yoke, or tho 'tis made a Yoke) the injury therefore is in impoſing the
Yoke, and there can be none at all in breaking it. But he goes on in the
ſaid Papers by way of Anſwer to an Objection, that if there be no Injury
yet there may be an Inconvenience if the beadleſs multitude ſhould ſhake
off the Yoke, But ſays he, I would fain know how the Multitude comes to
be headleſs, and there gives you inſtances in ſtory, and from Foreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
comes home to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and tells you how all Rebellions in latter
Ages have been headed, and tells you the Parliament is the Head, or the
Nobility, and Gentry, that Compoſe it, and when the King fails of his
Duty, the People may call it, the Multitude therefore is never<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> headleſs,
but they either find or create a Head, ſo that upon the whole, here is a
plain and awowed Principle of Rebellion Eſtabliſhed upon the ſtrongeſt
reaſon he hath to back it, which with the other Evidence againſt him was
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51743:15"/>
ſufficient to prove his Compaſſing the Death of the King. The Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he makes is, when Kings break their Truſts they may be called to
an Account by the People, this is the Doctrine he Brooks and Argues for,
and in another part of the Book, he ſays, <hi>That the Calling and Diſſolving
of Parliaments is not in the Kings Power.</hi> So that the King having Called
and Diſſolved Parliaments, in ſo doing he hath broke his Truſt, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
by his Arguments may be called to an Account by the People
and Depoſed, which is certainly a Treaſon of the Deepeſt Tincture, and
which the Jury upon Conſideration thereof, and the other ſufficient Prooffs
againſt him, ſo found, and brought him in Guilty, upon the whole, we
have here met with an Account of one of the moſt Atrocious and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Deſigns as any Recor'd in the whole World can furniſh us with, and
particularly in this laſt Gentlemans Caſe, wherein it was the more Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
in that he proceeded upon the Foundation of his Reaſon, it was
his beloved Principle, the avowed Guide of his Actions, that by which he
led the ſtedy courſe of his Life, and he that is convinced of theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
what will he not do, what will he leave undone to accompliſh and
bring about his Deſigns, how wary will he be in his Actions, which way
to bring them ſecurely about, and ſo much the more dangerous is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy
in him, by how much more it is rooted, and how deep it is, you
have heard, he Writes it as his Principle, that it is lawful to Depoſe Kings
who breaks their Truſt, and that the Revolt of the whole Nation in that
caſe deſerves not the Name of Rebellion, ſad muſt our ſtate then ſurely
be when People are Impious for Conſcience ſake, and Ruin and Deſtroy
the Government for the good of it.</p>
            <p>Having thus far Travelled through the preceeding particulars, I doubt
not but every impartial Eye will clearly behold the Malevolent Intentions
of this Phanatical Frenzy, and accordingly Eſchew all ſuch Doctrines,
and Principles, as ſhall ſecretly connive at, or openly abet the ſame,
which had they now taken Effect, let us ſtay alittle to conſider the condition
this Miſerable Nation, and People would have thereby been Immerſed
in, But here Imagination muſt ſupply the defect of my Diſcription, for
'tis not enough to ſay we ſhould have loſt the beſt of Kings, the beſt of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
the beſt of Religions, and the beſt Friends and Maintainers of
each, but alas, who of us had been ſafe? unleſs we could have yeilded to
have Joyn'd with this Impious and abominable Faction, which had to any
conſidering or good Man been leſs Eligible, then Martyrdom it ſelf.</p>
            <p>It had been enough to have Condemn'd us that we had any thing to
looſe, the Extravagant Heir would never have complained his Fathers
hours too ſlowly waſted, but have turn'd Parricide and correpted them, the
Servant would ſcarce have yeilded to have borne the Remainder of his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Years Yoke, but have eaſed himſelf thereof in the Slaughter of his
Maſter, the Slave had dominioned o're his Lord, the Baſe and Scoundrel
World have ſeated themſelves on the Benches of State and Juſtice, whilſt, our
Streets had been channelled with Bloud, our Fields been fill'd with Slaughter,
our Houſes with Rapine, and our ſelves Mourning over their Fates, who had
got the ſtart of us, only ſome few tireſom and melancholly minutes
which had been ſpent in the Expectation of our threatned and advancing
danger.</p>
            <p>This I ſay, had been the Caſe of the moſt Innocent amongſt us, and
may not we therefore, as on the one hand Praiſe our God, for our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
ſo on the other with a Juſt and Pregnant Indignation, ſet our
mark, of regret and abhorrerenc on thoſe Principles and Parties, that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
(nay give me leave to ſay, as far as we can Pry into the Cloſets of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51743:16"/>
their Breaſt, or Judg of what is there ſtored by their words and Actions,)
do but yet too much endeavour to accompliſh the ſame upon us.</p>
            <p>Why otherwiſe ſhould there be any one amongſt mankind ſo much an
Infidel to Senſe and Reaſon, as to proclaim his Doubts or Heſitations (which
by the way are only to amuſe the Vulgar) of the Credit of this <hi>Phanatical
Conſpiracy,</hi> which hath been ſo demonſtratively made Evident that the
Light in the Heavens is not more obvious to our natural, then this to out
Intellectual Capacities.</p>
            <p>But leaſt the Poyſon of ſuch Amuſements ſhould too far ſpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
(Amuſements which the Promoters underſtands to be ſo) I ſhall
take a ſhort view of the Parties Condemn'd, as they were too fatally by
their Treaſons, drove to the outmoſt brink of Life, and ſtood ready to
Launch into the Ocean of Eternity, at which time it might be well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
however their carriages had repreſented them to the World, as
Traytors and Injurious Perſons to the Government they liv'd under,
the Dread of that Tribunal to which the Rope and Ax had ſummoned them,
would in ſome meaſure work them to a True and Penitent Confeſſion of
thoſe Crimes for which they came thither.</p>
            <p>As to the Three firſt, <hi>Walcot, Hone,</hi> and <hi>Rouſe,</hi> who ſuffered together at
<hi>Tyburn</hi> on Friday 20th of <hi>June</hi> 1683. theſe three ſeverally confeſſed the
Crimes that brought that unhappy Fate upon them, whoſe Evidence in
the ſight of that grim Meſſenger that then ſtood before them, was more
to be conſidered againſt themſelves, then 10000. Witneſſes, and which,
were it only ſingle, is more then ſufficient to take off all Cavilling Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delities
the worſt of Men can raiſe againſt it, yet leaſt their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
which are upon the ſame ſtructure raiſed as to the Speech of my
Lord <hi>Ruſſell,</hi> may prevail upon the Ignorant and miſinformed, let us
look alittle into the ſame, and hear the Objectors Arguments, (ſay they)</p>
            <p>If then the Facts whereof my Lord <hi>Ruſſell</hi> was found Guilty by the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
upon ſuch Pregnant proof be ſo Evident, how is it poſſible for a Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Man before God and Men to aſſert his Innocency with ſuch aſſurance,
and ſo frequently repeated in his Speech to the Sheriff, Firſt, <hi>God knows how
far I was always from Deſigns againſt the Kings Perſon, or of altering the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
Secondly, <hi>I profeſs I know of no Plot, either againſt the Kings
Life, or the Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Paper delivered, it is thus Expreſſed,</hi> What ever Apprehenſions I
had of Popery, and my own ſevere and heavy ſhare I was like to have under it,
when it ſhould prevail, I never had a thought of doing any thing againſt it baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or inhumanely, but what would conſiſt with the Chriſtian Religion, the Laws,
and Liberties of this Kingdom, <hi>Again,</hi> I have always Loved my Country
much more then my Life, and never had any Deſign of changing the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and would have ſuffered any extremity rather then have conſented to take
away the Kings Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Specious &amp; well Guilded pretences drawn by a cunning Pencil to pleaſe
and quiet the Conſcience of a Dying Criminal, and caſt a miſt before the
purblind Eyes of the unthinking Croud to poſſeſs them with his Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and lay the Load of Envy and Aſperſion on the Government for a
Malicious and Cruel Proſecution againſt him, for otherwiſe what need all
theſe careful Reſtrictions and Limitations to uſher in his Innocency, might
lie not as well have ſaid in a few plain words, as became a Dying Man, I
know of no Deſign to make an Inſurrection or Rebellion in this Kingdom,
which had been more a-kind to the Crime he came to Suffer for, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
he, God knows how far, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God knows all things, that's true, and without doubt was privy to the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51743:16"/>
guilt he then lay under, this amounts to no denial, nor further when he
ſays, In the words of a Dying Man, I profeſs I know of no Plot either
againſt the Kings Life, or the Government, pray take notice, I know of
no Plot, how could he then? the ſame was put by and defeated,
but this is reſtrained againſt the Kings Life or Government, very well, but
might not the unneceſſary Guards be ſeized, and no perſonal harm, in their
Senſe, done the King, ſuppoſe they ſhould have depoſed or impriſon'd him,
or put away other Indignity on him, ſhort of Life: This might have
been done too, without any change of Government, the Crown might
have been Tranſlated from one Head to another, yet Monarchical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
unaltered, So that the Snare is ſufficiently Evident to our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
that the ſame was cautiouſly penn'd to glare the Eyes of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and deceive their Apprehenſions, but I intend not to inſiſt in the
taking to peices the ſaid Speech, only thence prove that by my Lords own
Confeſſion therein contained, he hath ſaid ſufficient to Evince the Truth of
this Hiſtory, as to the Plot in general, and likewiſe as to his own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and fatal concern therein, For</p>
            <p>That he agreed he was at Mr. <hi>Shepherds</hi> when ſuch Perſons were met,
as Colonel <hi>Rumſey</hi> and Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> both Swear, That there was a Diſcourſe
of Seizing the Guards, of the Feaſableneſs thereof, and the ſaid Two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
both add, his Undertakement, and in a clauſe or two, further add,
that he remembers the like Diſcourſe at my Lord <hi>Shaftsburies,</hi> at which
time he ſaith, <hi>he flew out and exclaimed againſt it, and lookt upon it as a
horrid thing,</hi> and a little afterwards ſays, <hi>that ſeveral things were ſpoken
in his hearing with more Heat than Judgment,</hi> and that nothing was Sworn
againſt him, <hi>but ſome Diſcourſes about making ſome ſtirs, and this is not Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
of War,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which is Treaſon by the Statute of</hi> Edward <hi>the</hi> 3d. <hi>and
not Conſulting and Diſcourſing about it, which by a fetch was Conſtrued a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of Killing the King, and ſo he was caſt.</hi> In Anſwer to which I would
ſtate clearly what the Law of the Land is on theſe Points to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of all Men.</p>
            <p>The Meeting and Conſulting to make an Inſurrection againſt the King,
or Raiſe a Rebellion within the Kingdome, be the end thereof never ſo
ſpecious for the publick good, tho the Rebellion be not raiſed, it is High
Treaſon by the Law of the Land. It was ſo at Common Law by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of all Books that Treat of that matter, and no one Authority againſt
it. It is ſo ſince the Statute of the 25 of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d, Chapter</hi> the
<hi>2d,</hi> within the firſt Branch of that Law, <hi>Againſt Compaſſing and Imagining
the Death of the King.</hi> The Death of the King in that Law, is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained,
to the Killing of His Natural Perſon, but extends as well to Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Death, as Natural, to Conſpire to Depoſe the King, is equally High
Treaſon, with that of Killing Him; ſo for Impriſoning, Seizing or Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
Him into the Power of His Subjects, or for laying any Force or
Reſtraint upon Him, until He do what His Subjects would have Him;
Theſe are all High Treaſons, for Compaſſing His Death, either Natural
or Civil; and all Overt-Acts which declare the Intent of Effecting any
of theſe Crimes, as all Meetings, Conſultations and Agreements, to Riſe
in Rebellion, and Seize upon the Kings Guards, which are His Defence
againſt Force, and Invite the Aid and Aſſiſtance of the Kings Subjects of
any other Kingdoms, are plainly Overt-Acts, and have been at all times
ſo Adjudged.</p>

in what manner and place, the Invaſion might be; No Invaſion follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

Reſolved it High Treaſon, becauſe an Invaſion with Power could not be,

Vane</hi>'s Caſe, Meeting and Conſulting about Treaſon, was held ſufficient
Overt-Acts; Nor could my Lord <hi>Ruſſell</hi>'s Caſe be only Miſpriſion of High
Treaſon, for this is only the Concealment thereof by a Perſon, without
any mixture of his Conſent. But if the Perſon be preſent at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
and Conſultations, tho he ſay nothing, if he doth not immediately
Reveal it, but continues to Meet, and be preſent at their Debates, he is a
Principal Traytor. Where a Perſon was not preſent at the Debates and
Reſolves, but is afterwards acquainted with them, and gives Conſent
thereto, it is High Treaſon. This was the Caſe of <hi>George Brook,</hi> to whom
the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> related the whole Conſpiracy, of ſetting up the Lady
<hi>Arabella,</hi> who Conſented to the ſame, and was Attainted as a Principal
Traytor for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now my Lord <hi>Ruſſell,</hi> as he puts his own Caſe, of being preſent at
ſeveral Meetings, where <hi>ſeizing the Guards</hi> was treated of, and <hi>horrid
things</hi> ſpoken, Argues himſelf Guilty of Treaſon, though he make a
falſe concluſion from thoſe premiſſes, that it was Mispriſion only.</p>
            <p>But the Witneſſes proving his frequent Meetings and Conſults, and the
laſt of them, at his own Houſe, and his expreſs conſent to the matters
debated, put it beyond a Queſtian to any Man, that deſires not to be
wilfully Blind, that his Crime was high Treaſon in the higheſt degrees.</p>
            <p>For which Crime, the ſaid Lord <hi>Ruſſell,</hi> on <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>21th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi>
1683, had his Head ſevered from his Body, upon a Scaffold, erected for
that purpoſe, in great <hi>Lincolnes-Inn-Fields.</hi>

            <p>Having thus Anſwered this Objection, I proceed to the Death of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Algernoone Sidney,</hi> who made his laſt Exit from the Theatre of Life,
on a Scaffold on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> the Seventh of <hi>December</hi> then next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
from whom, Conſidering the Principles he had Imbibed, it was no
Wonder, to hear him Exalt therein, and look upon the ſame, rather, as
the Honourable Trophies of Martyrdom, then the Ignominious Brands of
Diſgrace and Puniſhment, which the Almighty in his own time Viſited
him with. <hi>I Die</hi> (ſays he) <hi>Glorifying Thee O Lord, for all thy Mercies, and
that at the laſt, Thou haſt permitted me to be ſingled out as a Witneſs of thy Truth,
and even by the Confeſſion of my Oppoſers, for that</hi> Old Cauſe, <hi>in which I have
been from my Youth Engaged, and for which, Thou haſt often and Wonderfully
Declared Thy Self.</hi> Ingenious Confeſſion! This Gentleman tells you what's
the Cauſe he Suffers in, he ſpeaks it plainly, and Bluſhes not to own its
Truth; 'twas the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> the <hi>Old Cauſe,</hi> in which from his Youth he had
been Trained up, 'twas not a New thing, a Start Up Opinion, an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtick
Frenzy; That it was lawful to Plot againſt, to Dethrone, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon,
Mock, Diſgrace, and at laſt, to Murder the Beſt of Monarchs,
this he had been before Honourably Concerned in, and this was the <hi>Cauſe</hi>
he Gloryed of; The ſame that Coſt the Nation ſo dear a Price, that was
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51743:17"/>
Foſtered at no leſs Rate, then the Blood of Thouſands, and Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands,
of our Country-Men, that divided our Families, made the Brothers
Boſom a Sheath for the Brothers Sword, and the Fathers Breaſt a Battery
againſt the Sons Shot; That left our Wives Widows, and Children Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans,
and yet this was the <hi>Cauſe</hi> he Triumphed in, and this was made
by him, no leſs, then the <hi>Shibboleth</hi> of God, and the Blood and Deſolation
aforeſaid, the Miraculous Work of the Almighty Hand, and the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
Declaration of Heaven it ſelf. In this <hi>Cauſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Bleſs thy
People, and Save them that ſhall own it, Defend them that Defend it;</hi> Let
thy Shield of Protection be held over the Heads of Traytors and Rebels
to their Prince and Government. <hi>Stir up ſuch as are Faint,</hi> that they
may take Courage in Evil. <hi>Direct thoſe that are Willing,</hi> to go through
with the Plots and Conſpiracies of Treaſon and Deſolation. <hi>Confirm thoſe
that Waver,</hi> that they fling aſide the Burthens of a Conſcious Breaſt, and
go on ſteadily in the Roads of Rebellion, that <hi>thy Name may be Glorified,</hi>
that <hi>our Kings may be Bound in Chains,</hi> and <hi>our Nobles in Fetters of Iron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then this, what can ſuch Cant otherwiſe ſignifie, and is it thus to Die
a Chriſtian, where's the Forgiveneſs we owe our Enemies, can that Man
regard the Peace, Quiet, or Government of his Country? Who in a Senſe, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
for its Confuſion, <hi>Articulo mortis,</hi> when his laſt breath is, taking its
final farewel of his Condemned, and Suffering Carcaſe, at that time to pray
to God, to defend and ſtrengthen thoſe that own and defend the Cauſe of
Treaſon, ſuch was that Cauſe he Dyed in, and ſuch, who well wiſht and
abetted the ſame, the only Perſons he thought worthy of his laſt Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Monſtrous and Inſufferable Impudence, to Outface Heaven, and Vie, as it
were, with the Almighty, on no better Grounds, then if he ſhould have
ſaid, The Magiſtrates thou haſt placed over me, and Injoyned me to Obey,
I have Rebelled againſt, and Glory that I have ſo done. Thy Laws I have
broken, and Rejoyce in an Honourable Martyrdom for the ſame. If this
be the Character of a <hi>true Proteſtant Diſſenter?</hi> Heaven Defend us, and all
good Chriſtians, from ſuch Antichriſtian, Antimonarchichal, and equally
as bad, if not worſe, than the worſt of Jeſuitical Principles.</p>
            <p>It is but Reaſon therefore, that we lay by our Animoſities, in ſome
meaſure, againſt them, and Debate with our nearer and more dangerous
Enemies, who, like the <hi>Frogs</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> Infeſt our Dwellings in ſuch
numerous and increaſing Multitudes, that no part of the Land is free
from them.</p>
            <p>I wiſh I had not Cauſe to ſay thus much, but in this Caſe, who can be
Silent? The Dumb Child ſpake when he ſaw the lifted Sword at his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Breaſt, and high time is it for all Loyal and Ingenious Men, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thoſe Principles that Juſtifie ſuch Parricidial and Criminal Tenets;
And yet, as if we were a People ſo Stupified, that nothing could work
upon us; Has it not been the Endeavour of too many, who would Aſſume
the Names and Titles of His Majeſties and the Nations beſt Friends, to
drive us on to further Ruin and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>That I do not ſpeak this, without a Sad and Lamentable, tho truly Juſt
Ground, let us proceed to Examine, ſince the ſaid Horrid Conſpiracy was
Miraculouſly Detected, what it is the ſaid Party hath been doing, and
how they have Employed themſelves.</p>
            <p>And here it might have been Expected, that in one Body, with one
Aſſent, they ſhould have Proſtrated themſelves at the Feet of His Offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Majeſty, to Beg His Gracious Pardon for their Crimes, or at leaſt, if
they had been Innocent, to have Publickly Teſtified their Abhorrence and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51743:18"/>
Diſlike againſt ſuch, who had been under Worſe and more Criminal Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
            <p>But inſtead hereof, Obſerve how Reſtleſs and Unquiet, how Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Sollicitous, they have been, to Evade the Guilt thereof, and lay
the ill-gotten Brat at the Door of the Government, as a Baſtard of State,
a Policy of our Superiours, to induce their own Ends; and in their own
words, a <hi>Sham Plot,</hi> and no more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As a Proof whereof, look over the Tryal of Sir</hi> Samuel Barnadiſton,
<hi>where in one of his Letters,</hi> The Papiſts (<hi>ſays he</hi>) are down in the
Mouth, their Pride is Abated, themſelves and their Plot Confounded, but
their Malice is not Aſſwaged. 'Tis generally ſaid, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was
Murdered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Brave Lord <hi>Ruſſell</hi> is afreſh Lamented; The Plot is leſt
here, except you in the Country can find it out amongſt the Addreſſors and
Abhorrers, <hi>with many the like Expreſſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And can there be any thing more plainly Malitious, more openly and
execrably Envious, then what is contained in theſe Libellous and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
Lies. Lies that reflect ſo immediately on the Government, both of
Church and State, as nothing could poſſibly have been Invented worſe of
either; Here's Popery and Murder in the higheſt degree charged on
both; His Majeſty is traduced, as if he were ſo eaſie to be prevailed upon,
to do things to deſtroy his own Subjects, and like their <hi>own Party,</hi> in the
late Times, by <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Methods</hi> of <hi>Mock Juſtice.</hi> The <hi>Judges</hi> are <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniated</hi>
as Regardleſs of their <hi>Oaths</hi> in <hi>Condemning the Innocent.</hi> The
<hi>Traytor Acquitted</hi> and the <hi>Law Arraigned,</hi> the <hi>Criminal Sainted</hi> and the
<hi>Courts of Juſtice Exploded, Vilified and ſet at nought,</hi> and all this under the
Umbrage of Zeal for the Publick Good, Excellent Tenets, and becoming
an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> Impudence.</p>
            <p>Heaven defend us, where is't we live! amongſt <hi>Heathens</hi> or <hi>Mahumetans</hi>
we ſhould find more Loyalty and Honour.</p>
            <p>Nay, give me leave to ſay, That theſe Seditious Lies were not only
directly and Immediately aimed at the Government, but even all thoſe
Perſons, who thought themſelves obliged in Juſtice and Conſcience, to ſhew
their Duty to His Majeſty, and their diſlike of that Damnable Deſign and
Conſpiracy againſt him. For now, ſays our Author, <hi>The Plot is loſt here
unleſs you find it amongſt the Abhorrors and Addreſſors in the Country.</hi> So
that all Mankind, who ever thought themſelves under any ſort of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
to Congratulate that Bleſſed and Happy Deliverance of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
and Royal Brother, from the Pit that theſe Men had dug for them,
(and whereinto they themſelves had Juſtly fell) Theſe, I ſay, muſt be
Branded with the Ignominious and Opprobious Names of <hi>Papiſts, Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
Traytors, Addreſſors</hi> and <hi>Sham-Plotters,</hi> which evidently Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
it was not only aimed at the Civil Magiſtracy, but all that dare be
honeſt, and oppoſe Faction and Rebellion, how near this amounts to High
Treaſon, let any Man give his Judgment, as for my own part, I can't
but perceive the ſame Temper of Mind and Inveteracy of Spirit goes to
the making up the one, as there would be required to the Perpetration of
the other, and nothing ſhall ever prevail with me to induce an Alteration
of this Opinion, That they who could ſay, the firſt, were Well-wiſhers &amp;
Abettors of the latter.</p>
            <p>But our Libeller reſts not here neither, but to ſhew him of the ſame
Temper with the reſt of the Faction, he lays the Bloud of the Earl of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi>
tho ſhed by his hand at the ſame Door? <hi>It is</hi> (ſays he) <hi>generally ſaid,
the E. of</hi> Eſſex <hi>was Murdered;</hi> &amp; in another place, Mr. <hi>Braddon, Who Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Murther of the E. of</hi> Eſſex, <hi>the Information put in againſt him, in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51743:18"/>
Kings Bench, by Mr.</hi> Attorny, <hi>for a pretended Subornation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>was not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted,
and his Bail Diſcharged.</hi> But our Author was herein deceived,
&amp; ſince thence Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> hath found the Law his Maſter, &amp; the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
too careful to connive at ſuch Practices, undertaken ſingly, without
the leaſt ground of Probability, to bring an Odium upon the Kings Majeſty,
&amp; his Royal Highneſs in that the ſame ſtrongly inſinuated, as if they, who by
chance, had been walking in the Tower that Morning, when this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
thing hapned, had deſigned the ſame. How Baſe, How Deviliſh, and
How Helliſh a Deſign this was, and how far from all Imaginations or Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage
of Truth, is ſo plain, (that I ſhall ſpare Paper in relating the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
and refer the Reader to <hi>Braddons</hi> Tryal in Print, where he may be
fully convinced thereof,) and yet this ſo carefully diſperſed and diſtilled
into the minds of the Kings Subjects, that no Age or Record can give a
Parrallel thereof, as to every Malitious part the ſaid Deſign was built
upon.</p>
            <p>Nor can we Imagine, had the ſame taken Effect, what Influence it might
have had on the leſs diſcerning: How ſtrongly it would have incouraged
the Expiring hopes of the almoſt diſappointed Party, and have ſet them
within the Proſpect of a returning Incouragement, once more to have
prevail'd in their Trayterous, Impardonable and Wicked Conſpiracies, How
haſtily would they have run down the Plot then, when now they have
the Impudence to attempt the ſame.</p>
            <p>But God be thanked, the Vail is drawn from before our Eys, and we
now behold their Execrable Deſigns Stript and Naked before us, the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
is vaniſhed, and our Fears and Apprehenſions are quieted in the firm
and ſteady view of the over-ruling Hand of Providence, which we have
Experienced in their Confuſion.</p>
            <p>Yet can I not paſs over this ſo ill intended a Deſign, without a little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulation
of the Methods uſed in carrying on the ſame, which if ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
conſidered, was certainly in it ſelf as much to be Condemned, in it's
Contrivance, as End, for tho Subornation and Perjury (<hi>foro Conſcienciae</hi>)
be a Crime of as high a nature (tho not ſo ſeverely Puniſhable as Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
can well Commit,) yet in this Caſe it was extraordinarily ſuch: For
were it to have been managed between Men, who had known the nature
and value of the Guilt, it had been more Excuſeable in that ſuch dealings
had been (in ſome ſort) on fair Terms, Souls on each ſide had been ſtaked, the
Suborner and Suborned, but to draw in Children as they did, Children
who were not of Age capable to underſtand what they did, that knew no
more hazard therein, then the Venial Peccadillo of a Childiſh falſity Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable
by a School Laſh, or Parental Reprehenſion, to Practice on theſe, is
to Anſwer for a double Crime, to Pledg their own Souls, not ſingly for
themſelves, but for them they had drawn in, and if every Man ſhall have a
Sentence ſevere enough for his proper Sins; what is he to Anſwer before
the great Judg of all Men, that is not only to ſtand the Severity of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
for himſelf,<note place="margin">V. Speaks Tryal in his Letter to Sir <hi>R. A.</hi>
               </note> but the Innocent whom he Enſnared.</p>
            <p>Execrable, Abominable, and Impardonable Impiety! and is it thus to
gain the Name of good Men, do ſuch need their Guards, * their defence,
let them have them, but may they then attend them, to the Gibbet, that
the Nation may be rid of ſuch Perverſe and ill Principled Monſters.</p>
            <p>But to draw to a concluſion, let us now change the Scene, and having
thus as in Miniature preſented you with the Figure of this Gorgon, I ſhall
only take a ſhortScheme of the preſent alteration of Affairs, ſince the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and Detection of the Abominable Crimes herein Treated of, as I
began with the then Seaſon, wherein they firſt took Birth, and herein
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51743:19"/>
Obſerve, that as the great Creator of Heaven and Earth, by the word of
his Power did frame the Univerſal Fabrick of the World, which conſiſts of
ſuch Varieties of Beauteous Parts, from a Wild and Undigeſted Chaos,
wherein the Warring Elements were all in Uproar and Confuſion, the
Moiſt, the Dry, the Hot, the Cold, Combating each other, ſo hath the
Prudence and Care of his Sacred Majeſty from the Contending Principles
of the Faction, which were ſcarce at a leſs Variance, reduced the ſame to
an Harmonious Order.</p>
            <p>Inſomuch that now we may again hope to live in that Peace and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
we ſo lately diſpaired of, and Wonderful it is to behold how ſtrangely
and miraculouſly the ſame hath been Effected.</p>
            <p>Yet ſo it is, that now, as if a new Light had its Birth amongſt us, we
ſee with other Eys, we are no longer cheated by the vain and painted De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions
of Phanatical Zeal, but can ſpie the deceiver beneath the black
Cloak, diſtinguiſh the Rebel from the Patriot, and behold the Cunning
Presbyter in a Gown and Circingle.</p>
            <p>We regard no more the Voice of Property and Liberty in the Mouth
of the Betrayer, the Cry is no longer, A Parliamant, A Parliament,
(Tho we want not a Juſt Reverence for that Grand Aſſembly, when his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Pleaſure ſhall call them together, and they are Legally and Loyally
diſpoſed) yet our Peace is confirmed without them, Our Churches are
