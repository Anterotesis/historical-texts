            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

but that wee might liue to glorifie God, and to the good of his Church and Children. This point is plaine by the Apoſtles precept, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.7.8. and by his practise, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.23.24. For, as here preſcribes to others that none ſhould liue or dye vnto himſelfe, but vnto the Lord; that whether Chriſtians liue or dye they ſhould be the Lords: yea, that whether they liue in the body, or remoue out of the body they might be the Lords, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8.9.

and Idols then they) then in their houſes, which are rather dens of Diuels, and cages of vncleane Birds, then Churches. What are the deſires of ſuch who ſees not? What their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts who knowes not? who feares not?</p>
                     <p>In the ſame ranke are the reſt: where is the Tradeſman, (as <hi>Iob</hi> of the good Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) one of a thouſand, let him ſtand forth, whoſe heart tels him, that truely and ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Trade and Calling hee aymes aright? and ſo all others, let their ſoules ſpeake. Who in their traffique and commerce with men ayme at GOD, at the profit and emollument of others, and not wholy, or for the moſt part, at themſelues? Who in ſeruing of man ſeekes directly and immediately to ſerue God and not rather himſelfe? Who ſeekes grace and godlineſſe, and not gaine? ſuch an one <hi>erit mihi magnus Apollo</hi>: I would trauell farre on my feete to finde ſuch a Phoenix.</p>
                     <p>For the other ſort, that liue eyther in no calling, or in a ſenſuall ſinfull calling, ſuch as riotous Prodigoes, profane <hi>Eſau's,</hi> vaine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, gull Gallants, retchleſſe Ruffians, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Lechers, graceleſſe Gameſters, filthy Brothellers, Queanes, Curtizans, and beaſtly Bawdes, with all the reſt of that reſtleſſe and retchleſſe crew: alas, what good doe they in the world? what ayme they at, but like Swine to feede? like the rich Churle, to goe brauely

and faire deliciouſly with the Sabarites and <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> to inuent and wallow in pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting pleaſures, to feede their fancy, pleaſe their owne humours, content themſelues, delight the fleſh, and damne the ſoule? liuing to eate, eating to liue the life of ſinne; doing as much good to others, as the Moath to the garment, the Caterpiller to the fruit, the Cantharides to the Oyntment, ſpoyling and infecting (like plaguy people) vvhom thy liue amongſt. Therefore theſe and all theſe,<note place="margin">Terrae in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vtile pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</note> as they are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable burthens to the earth, they ſhall be ſwept away from the earth like <hi>Iabin</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſera,</hi> and the Sodomites, euen into hell, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.17. As they glorifie not God, which was the end of their Creation and Redemption (which thy forget) ſo God will neuer glorifie them.

                     <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, here wee are to take notice of that which wee haue obſerued in <hi>Moſes</hi> before; namely, that <hi>Simeon</hi> is willing to dye: for the whole Text imports and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it, that there was in him no vnwillingnes to dye; not ſo much as in ſhow: but a great

willingneſſe, propenſitie, and diſpoſition to his diſſolution, whether wee take his vvords here as Optatiue, <hi>Oh that thou wouldeſt let thy Seruant depart,</hi> as ſome doe: or Indicatiue, <hi>Now thou doſt let, &amp;c.</hi> or Precatory, <hi>Lord, now let, &amp;c.</hi> or plainely, as they are here; all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port perſpicuouſly that hee dyed voluntarily.</p>
                     <p>From whence note, that a good Chriſtian is willing to dye: wee may ſee this, as in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon,</hi> ſo in <hi>Paul.

What doth this argue, but a guiltie conſcience, a ſecure ſoule, a hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned heart, a carnall minde, and a maine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of infidelitie, incredulitie, and want of faith, in the remiſſion of ſinnes, the reſurrection of the body, the immortalitie of the ſoule, and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:19288:92"/>
hope of a better life: which conſiderations, as they haue moued the ancient and moderne Martyres, <hi>Ignatius, Policarpus, Laurence, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> and others in our precedent age, <hi>French, Germaine,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to ſubiect themſelues to the mouthes of Lions, flames of fire, and all other tortures and torments, which Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Malice could inuent, &amp;c. So the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of theſe, the want of the perſwaſion of Gods loue, and expectation of wrath and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance after this mortalitie, makes wicked men entertaine Death as <hi>Ahab</hi> did <hi>Elias,</hi> euen as their greateſt enemie, as their Iaylor, their Serieant, their Butcherer, their Executioner, as the curber of their delights, and procurer of their curſe. Yet that I be not miſtaken, I doe not here condemne all feare of death, and make it ſuch an eſſentiall note of Gods childe, as though euery one that feared God did not at any time, or in any reſpects, feare to dye: or that wicked men might not ſometimes, and vpon ſome ſeruile reſpects, with ſome ſhew of alacritie vndergoe death: for, Firſt, I know that there is in all men a naturall deſire to liue, which cauſed <hi>Ezekias</hi> to mourne when hee was to dye, <hi>Eſay</hi> 38.10. And <hi>Dauid</hi> to pray that his ſoule might liue, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.4. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. As alſo our Sauiour Chriſt to deſire the Paſſage of the cuppe from him, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.

Fourthly, a godly man may pray ſometimes againſt ſome kinde of death; as our Sauiour Chriſt did, praying not ſimply againſt death, but againſt that curſed death of the Croſſe; fearing not death, but the curſe of the Law that went with death. Fiftly, I know that euen naturall men haue made light account of death, ſuch as the <hi>Decians</hi> and the <hi>Fabritians, Curtius</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus,</hi> with others amongſt the Romanes, and

Thus muſt wee firſt learne to practiſe this hardeſt point of Chriſtianitie, in dying to the world, ere euer wee can be willing out of faith and feeling to dye out of the world: for alas, what cauſeth men that they haue as little heart to goe into their Mother-earth, as the Moale hath to come out of the earth; but onely that they loue the earth too well? being deſirous euer to liue vpon the earth, but neuer to lye in the earth. Why liſt not worldlings returne to their duſt, but onely that (as true children of the old Serpent) the curſe of the Serpent is vpon them to licke the duſt, minding earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things here, their end being damnation hereafter. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.17.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, when this is performed, in brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off thy deſires from the world, which is <hi>Terminus à quo,</hi> the place which thou leaueſt, then fixe thy eye vpon another world, <hi>Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ad quam,</hi> the place whither thou goeſt.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:19288:95"/>
Looke not too much at the griſly face of Death, which will agaſt thee; but at the end of it, where thou ſhalt ſee as many comforts as <hi>Eliſhaes</hi> Seruant ſaw, to encourage thee. Euen as hee that is to paſſe ouer ſome great and deepe Riuer, muſt not looke downe-ward to the water, but muſt caſt his eye to the bancke on the further ſide: ſo looke ouer the waues of death, and fixe the eye of thy faith vpon eternall life. Looke not at Death in the glaſſe of the Law, in which it is ſet out, as a curſe and the downe-fall to the gulph of deſtruction, but in the Chriſtall Glaſſe of the Goſpell, as it is changed and altered ſo by the death of CHRIST that it is a ſweet ſleepe, and reſting coole harbour.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, therefore conſider, how there is a bleſſing accompanies and attends thy death, pronounced by the Spirit it ſelfe, <hi>Reu.</hi> 14 13. which is alone ſufficient to ſtay the rage of thy affections in the ordinary feare of death: for, who feares bleſſings, ſince euen profane <hi>Eſau</hi> ſues for a bleſſing, and euen the very Heathens ſo much deſired that bleſſedneſſe which their Philoſophers, of all ſorts, ſo much diſputed, but neuer ſo ſoundly determined as God doth here?</p>

                     <p>The Reaſons why the godly dye are theſe:<note place="margin">Why the godly dye.</note> firſt, becauſe they are inuolued and vvrapped in the common ſincke of originall ſinne, with the reſt of <hi>Adams</hi> poſteritie, and therefore they muſt participate of death, the common puniſhment; from which no perſons, orders, or degrees are excepted or exempted, no not infants themſelues, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27.

                     <p>I confeſſe (as wee haue already inlarged another poynt) that death is fearefull to all fleſh, both man and beaſt,<note place="margin">Exhortat.</note> much more to a wicked man: ſtout ſtomacks haue beene agaſt and turned crauens at his griefly face, euen as all the Troopes of Iſraell were affrighted when they ſaw <hi>Pharaoh</hi> behinde them, and the red Sea before them, the two Iawes of death, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſwallow them.

                     <p>Conſider with thy ſelfe what reaſon there is to the contrary: is it reaſon that God ſhould accept the Winter of thy life, thy barren and frozen ſoule, when thou haſt offered vp the Spring, Summer, and Autumne of thy yeeres to Sathan? that he ſhould receiue the euening Sacrifice, when Mammon, or Luſt, hath had

the morning? that he ſhould be pleaſed with thy lees and dregs, when thou haſt giuen the beſt wine of thy bloud to the Diuell? will hee pledge Sathan in ſuch a cup? will he take the refuſe, and offals, and leauings of Sinne? It is poſſible hee may, I doe not limit the vnboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Ocean of his mercy, but it is not probable hee will.</p>
                     <p>Make it thine owne caſe: wouldeſt thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine an old decrepit Seruant, that is able to doe thee little or no ſeruice, and giue him great wages, that hath ſpent his youth and ſtrength in the ſeruice of thine enemie? I trow not. Will any Generall admit of a lame Souldier paſt ſeruice, that hath ſerued all his life againſt him, in his enemies Campe? will God admit thee into his ſeruice, entertaine thee into his Campe, receiue thee into his Houſe, reward thee in his Kingdome, when thou haſt ſpent the prime of thy yeeres in the ſeruice, nay, in the ſeruitude and ſlauery of Sathan? I ſay as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid to ſuch a deferrer as thou, <hi>Non dico ſaluabitur, non dico damnabitur,</hi> I will not ſay thou ſhalt be ſaued, I dare not determine thou ſhalt be damned: I leaue thee in the hands of God, that hath thee as the Potter hath the Clay, as the Smith his Iron, as the Carpenter his Wood, as the Creator his Creature, to harden or ſoften thee; to make thee a veſſell of honour or diſhonour; to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie

                     <p>Yet for all this which hath beene ſaid, the Theefe on the Croſſe ſtickes much on the ſtomackes of many?

to condemne the practiſe of thoſe, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to theſe preſcriptions, from the Word, in their ſickneſſe, ſeeke for help from Sathan, (as <hi>Ahazia</hi> that ſent to <hi>Baalzebub</hi> the God of Ekron) and that eyther directly, or ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily, when they runne to Coniurers, South-ſayers, Charmers, Inchanters, Witches, Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, Wiſe-men, and Wiſe-women, (as the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe deluded Country-people call them) who are in farre more reſpect with the common people (and ſome great ones too) and more ſought after, then eyther God is ſought to by prayer, or the Phyſitians for Phyſicke: for, if any of theſe ſimple ſoules be in any extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, by ſickneſſe or diſeaſes, or their Wiues, Children, &amp;c. euen as they doe alſo (like beaſts) for their beaſts and Cattell: ſuch a Wiſe-man, ſuch a Wiſe-woman, ſuch an old Hag, ſuch a white Witch, ſuch a ſhee-Diuell muſt be ſent to.<note place="margin">Earneſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uectiues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities ſeek to Witches and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, with diſſwaſiues from ſuch Idolatry.</note> Alas, what is this, but to runne from the God of Iſrael to the God of Ekron, from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> in Ramoth, to the Witch at Endor, from the Riuers of Samaria to the Waters of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus, from the liuing to the dead, from God to the Diuell?

courſe, and Satanicall practiſe in thy ſickneſſe: for alas, to runne a whoring afrer ſuch, is not the way to cure thee, but to kill thee; for this haynous ſinne vſually prouokes the Lord to plague the practiſers of it, euen with death it ſelfe, as the Lord himſelfe threatens, that hee vvill purpoſely <hi>ſet his face againſt thoſe that worke with Spirits, &amp;c.</hi> yea, and that he will <hi>cut them off</hi> to <hi>from amongst his people, Leuit.</hi> 20.6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So the Lord verified this threat in <hi>Ahazia:</hi> for, becauſe hee did ſeeke to <hi>Baalzebub,</hi> and not to the God of Iſraell, in his ſickneſſe, God ſends <hi>Elias</hi> directly to tell him, that for that cauſe, hee ſhould not come downe from his bed, but ſhould dye the death, as indeede hee did, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.6.

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, ſuppoſe thou ſhouldeſt get help, it is by the Diuels meanes, and who vvould goe to ſuch a filthy Phyſitian?</p>

                     <p>Others there be that vſe other meanes, which haue no warrant: of which kinde are thoſe that vſe any manner of Charmes or Spels, or that hang about their neckes Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters and Figures, eyther in Paper, Wood, or Waxe, &amp;c. which are all vaine and ſuperſtitious, becauſe neyther by creation, nor by any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in Gods word they haue any power to cure diſeaſes: for, words doe onely ſignifie, Figures can but onely repreſent.</p>
                     <p>Indeede I confeſſe, there are ſome things that haue ſome vertue in them, being hung about the necke, as white <note n="k" place="margin">Galen. lib. 6. &amp; 10 de ſimpl.

not by ſome virtuall contract, muſt needes haue their power from the Diuell.</p>
                     <p>The laſt dutie which muſt be done in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is relatiue, concerning others: of which briefely, euen as wee haue ſpoke of thoſe that concerne God and our ſelues.

                     <p>Firſt, to thy enemie thou muſt be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; forgiue him, and deſire to be forgiuen of him: thou art now about not to offer a Lambe or a Bullocke, as in the Leuiticall law, but thy ſelfe, thy body, thy ſoule a ſacrifice to GOD, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. Oh then firſt be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to thy God ere thou offer thy gift, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.23. Now, if the party whom thou haſt iniured, eyther be abſent, or preſent and vvill not relent; yet thou in ſeeking peace haſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged thy conſcience, and God will accept thy will for the deede.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if thou haſt wronged any man by any manner of Iniuſtice whatſoeuer, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly or openly, thou muſt make reſtitution, euill gotten goods muſt be reſtored, be they gotten by Vſury, Oppreſſion, Extortion, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the pawne, the pledge, or by any ſiniſter meanes whatſoeuer: the LORD ſtrictly inioynes it, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1.2.3.4. <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> practiſed it, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.

very Law that is writ within vs doth preſſe and vrge it.</p>
                     <p>The practiſe of the world is againſt both theſe rules: for alas, are there not many whoſe malice is (like coales of Iuniper) vnquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? The throwing of duſt amongſt buzzing Bees, makes them quiet; but the ſummons to their duſt, cauſeth not ſome to leaue their waſpiſhneſſe: they carry wrath boyling with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their breaſts, as in a Furnace, euen to To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, the fire and Furnace of Hell; neuer pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to forget nor forgiue; nay, wiſhing that their very ſpirits could torture and torment their enemies after their diſſolution.

In which thoſe men doe not onely preiudice their owne ſoules, but their Children alſo and poſteritie, euen in earthly things, in leauing to them riches wrongfully got, which bring deſeruedly the curſe of God vpon all the reſt of that eſtate which they bequeath vnto them; according to the phraſe:
