         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is not a thing altogether unknowne to thoſe
that are any whit read in Controverſies, that
many ſtriving againſt the errours of others, have
ſometimes denied ſome truthes, and given their

ſaw the manifeſt truth denied by thoſe that conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

without all doubt with the <hi>Arminians</hi> of late, who
notwithſtanding they have been found, to hold
forth many notorious errours, raſing the very
Foundation of Chriſtian Faith: to wit, denying
<hi>Originall Sin,</hi> holding <hi>Free will</hi> and <hi>Falling aw<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Yet in as much as in confuting them the manifest
Truth hath been denyed for the moſt part: <hi>viz.</hi>
Chriſts ſuffering for the ſins of all: Theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
have rather been emboldned then infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
or convicted, becauſe they conceived, that
their Adverſaries were driven to deny the manifeſt
truth, therefore they themſelves were in the Truth.
And on the other ſide, theſe erronious perſons
have gloſſed their errours under the pretence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
direct conſequences of Chriſts ſuffering for the
ſins of all (whereas indeed and in truth it is no

hath cauſed many to thinke evill of this doctrine,
and of us profeſſing the ſame conceiving that wee
can not be the Church of Jeſus Chriſt, whilſt wee
(in their conceivings) maintaine ſuch errours:
Whereas we having more narrowly ſearched the
ſame, and by ſearching have found not only that it
is a truth, but ſuch a truth as is the very foundation
of <hi>ſaving faith.</hi> Doe therefore conceive, that wee,
ought to be ſo farre from ſhunning the Doctrine

partly to cleare this Doctrine from thoſe evil
conſequences that are ſuppoſed undenyably to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

worth of this Truth to our ſelves and others, it being
ſo farre from makeing us not to be the Church of

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What meanes hath God provided for mans
ſalvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> God ſo loved the world, that he
gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
in him, ſhould not periſh, but have eternalll
life, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is it the duty of all mankind to beleeue in him for
Salvation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe eternall life is promiſed to whoſoever
doe beleeive in him, and eternall death is threatned
to them that doe not beleive</p>
            <p>Q. Are not all under the penalty of everlaſting
damnation though there were never a Chriſt to
to be beleived on?</p>
            <p>A. Yes ſurely, for ſo it doth appeare, Rom. 3. 9. 23. ch
5. 12. 16 17. 18. 19.</p>

for not beleiving in him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> For two cauſes: Firſt, for that Chriſt having
ſuffered the puniſhment of our ſins, we ſhould not
ſuffer if we beleive in him; the want of which
therefore cauſeth our ſins to reſt upon us ſtill:
and Secondly, becauſe the not beleiving in him is
the neglect or contempt of mercy offered, and ſo
a grevious ſin, and doth deſerve condemnation
more then any other ſin of any other kind, <hi>John</hi> 3.
18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Hath Chriſt then ſuffered the puniſhment due for
the ſins of all mankind?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes ſurely, for ſo it is written, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 15. Heb.</hi>
1. 9. 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 6. Iſa. 53. 6. John</hi> 1. 29. and 3. 16. 17.

Chriſt, and us alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Not ſo: for Chirſt did not ſuffer for any ſuch
end, as to free us from puniſhment without faith
in him: but that thoſe that beleeve might be ſaved
Joh. 3. 16. and the reſt left without excuſe Joh. 12
47. 48. which could not be if he had not ſuffered
the puniſhment due for the ſins of all.</p>

            <p>

are ſaved, and thoſe that beleeve not have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
to make for themſelves why they beleeve not
in him, therefore he died not in vain.</p>

beleeved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He could if he would, but his ſuffering for all
doth not neceſſarily enforce that he muſt worke
faith in all, he was free in the giving of himſelfe
to ſuffer. Joh. 10. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he is free alſo in quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the ſoules of whom he will. Joh. 5. 21.</p>
            <p>Ob. Why doth Chriſt ſay, Mat. 23. 37. How oft
would I gathered thy children together, and yee would
not.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea ſurely, in as much as Chriſt hath required
remiſſion of ſins to be preached to all in his name,
and nothing is required of any to be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of that remiſſion but only faith to beleive it,
<hi>Rom. 3. 28. Gal.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> not ſo, but the matter and meanes of remiſſion
of ſins is true in Chriſt for all, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 2. but then
only formally remitted when the former truth is
preached in the name of Chriſt and beleived, <hi>John</hi>
1. 12. 13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Ought men to beleive, that their fins are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
yea or no?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea but it is true by conſequent of our belee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ving
<pb facs="tcp:169434:5"/>
that Chriſt dyed for our ſinnes: therefore we
we ſhall not dye for them, <hi>John</hi> 11. 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But then it ſeemes, that we ought not to beleeve
that our ſinns are pardoned by a direct Act of Faith

the ground of our beleefe in that particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That is not ſo, becauſe by the ſame Faith by
which Chriſt is underſtood to be the meanes of the
remiſſion of ſins, by the ſame he is underſtood to
be ſuch an effectuall meanes as nothing is needfull
to be added thereto; ſeeing his death is our life,
for by his ſtripes we are healed <hi>Iſa.</hi> 39. 5. and he that
doth truly beleive, that Chriſt God man hath
ſuffered for his ſins, cannot but beleive, that his ſins
are pardoned, and that he ſhall not ſuffer for them:
as on the other ſide it is impoſſible, that any ſhould
groundedly beleive the latter, that doth not upon
true grounds beleive the former.</p>
            <p>

our ſins?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe forgivenes of ſins is by faith in Chriſt,
aud though all ought, yet all doe not beleive in
Chriſt: and thoſe that doe not fully deleive as
they ought, and therefore ought to pray, that God
would give and increaſe in us the beleiving in Chriſt

judge the em for it, with temporall judgements, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
them thereby as his children to mortifie the
ſin that remaineth in them, keeping them by this

they received not the love of the truth by beleeving the

he gave himſelfe for it, is not to exelude any, for that
were to make the Scripture to contradict it ſelfe, but
only to ſhew that the church did partake of ſuch love
from Chriſt as a patterne to husbands towards their
wives. And it may as well be concluded, becauſe Paul
ſaid, Chriſt loved me, and gave himſelfe for me, that he
gave himſelfe for no other, as becauſe he he loved the
Church, and gave himſelfe for it: Therefore not for all.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> True it is, that the blood of Ghriſt is of a

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is there any power in man by nature to beleive
this Doctrine?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No ſurely, he cannot know it, for it is a fooliſh
Doctrine, and emnity to the wiſedome of every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
man, 1 Cor: 1: 23: &amp; 2: 14: <hi>Rom:</hi> 8: 7: 8: and
the light and underſtanding thereof is only had by
the power of the ſpirit of God, 1. <hi>John</hi> 4: 13: 14.
and all men naturally are more averſe unto this
then unto any other thing, <hi>John</hi> 5: 4: 44: <hi>Mat:</hi> 23.
37.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Why doth God promiſe eternall life only to thoſe
that beleive, and eternall death, to thoſe that doe not,
ſeeing it is not in their own power?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Firſt that he might by meanes of thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
and threates worke us to that which by nature
we are averſe unto, 2 Cor: 5: 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: 20.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that we might appear more inexcuſable
when neither promiſes nor threates will move us to
embrace free mercy, <hi>Acts</hi> 13: 16. 51: &amp; 18: 6: 7:</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the grace of God might as well
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:169434:10"/>
appeare in giving power to beleive, as in giving
Chriſt, and in him forgivenes of ſins to be beleeved
<hi>Rom:</hi> 9: 16: &amp; 11: 5: 6: 7: <hi>Pſal:</hi> 2: 13.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that we might apply our ſelves unto
God in the uſe of thoſe meanes, that he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted,
for the working of Faith in us, <hi>John</hi> 6: 27:
<hi>Iſa:</hi> 55: 3.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, that we might wholy deny our ſelves, and
ſearch, and by ſearching find in the Covenant of
Grace matter of free conveyance of power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
whatſoever is required to be beleeved, <hi>Rom:</hi> 10:
17: <hi>Iohn</hi> 5: 39: <hi>Pſal:</hi> 119: 9: 98. 99: 104: 105: <hi>Rom:</hi>
3. 24: &amp; 4: 16: <hi>Gal:</hi> 3: 2:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Can it ſtand with the juſtice of God to require
perſons to beleive with penalties annexed thereunto,
ſeeing it is not in their power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea, ſeeing the matter of free conveyance of
power is offered in the Covenant of Grace, which
would be conveyed thereby were it not oppoſed,
<hi>Acts</hi> 13: 46: or deſpiſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 7: 51: <hi>Rom:</hi> 2: 4:
<hi>Heb:</hi> 10: 29: or neglected, as, <hi>Heb:</hi> 2: 3: and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other places of Scripture it appeares.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But whether doth it not follow from hence that
Gods Grace is ſubjected unto man, whether he will op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
deſpiſe, or neclect the ſame yea or no.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> True, ſo far as to leave man inexcuſable for ſo
doing, ſeeing the oppoſing, deſpiſing, or neglecting
is wholy mans evill worke, but not ſo, but that the
receiving, eſteeming, or improoving the ſame power
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:169434:10"/>
muſt be conſidered to proceed from the covenant it
ſelfe, and not from man, it muſt needs therefore be
attributed to God only, who proporioneth the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
effectually according to his owne Decree
of Election.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Ought every one to beleeve then that Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d
for all the ſins of all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea ſurely, or elſe how ſhall each perſon beleive
he ſuffered for their ſins?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But it ſeemes incongreous, that one ſhould be
required to beleive what Chriſt did for others</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Not ſo, for if the benefit of Chriſts ſufferings
be to be preached unto others, it is then neceſſary
to beleive what we preach for truth, to be truth,
and that to them to whom we preach the ſame.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, if there be nothing to diſtinguiſh
me from others, as the truth is, before faith there is
not, then the queſtion is, if he have not ſuffered for
all, how I ſhall find that he ſuffered for me? But if
he hath ſuffered for all, as the truth is he hath, <hi>Heb.</hi>
2. 9, then I beleeving tha doe neceſſarily beleive that
he ſuffered for me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But if this be ſaving faith to beleive that
Chriſt ſuffe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed for all, then who is it but will be ſaved?
for all men will ſay, that Chriſt ſuffered for all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Not ſo, for all that object to the contrary
do<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> not ſay it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, all that doe ſay it, doe not truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
it; and whoſoever do beleeve it, do <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

thus beleeving will neceſſarily be conſtrained to
love God, and all things according to God, 2: Cor:
5: 14: 15: 1 John 4: 10: 14: 19.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſts yoake is eaſie in the nature of it,
<hi>Mat:</hi> 11: 30: and that is it that makes it moſt hard
and difficult to our nature, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 14. fooliſhnes
to the learned <hi>Gretians</hi> &amp; a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtomling bock to the <hi>Jewes</hi>
who cannot endure, that the unlearned vitious <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans</hi>
and <hi>harlots</hi> ſhould be free by the grace offered
in the Goſpell, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 39. &amp; 15. 2. by their beleiving
that Chriſt ſuffered for all, ſhould thereby only be
ſaved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But it ſufficeth to ſaving faith, that Chriſt be
beleeved to be the Son of God, and was ſent and came
into the world to ſave ſinners indifinitely though not all.</p>
            <p>A. Not ſo, if any be excluded: becauſe that takes
away certainty of faith from any in reſpect of Chriſt,
for if any be excluded, I may be the perſon as ſoone
as any other, and I have no ground to the contrary</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But I may be certaine if I beleive.</p>
            <p>A. This is to make the foundation of faith to
ſtand in my beleeving, and not in Chriſt, and alſo to
make my firſt beleeving without any certaine truth
to ground it ſelfe upon, and is a ſuppoſition of an
impoſſibility, (to wit) of a firme beleeving that
which cannot be knowne whether it be true or not:
whereas on the contrary it being a revealed truth,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:169434:11"/>
Chriſt did <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſt death for everyman, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. each
perſon hath a ground in that word of truth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
that he dyed for him, and none hath any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
that doth not beleeve it.</p>
            <p>Q. Is this then the ſubject matter of the Goſpel,
that Chriſt hath required to be preached to the
world: to wit, that Chriſt ſuffered for all the ſins of
all.</p>
            <p>A. Yes ſurely, for without this no man hath any
thing to preach to the world, no Goſpell of glad tydings,
no remiſſion of ſins, no doctrine of reconciliation, no grace
or peace at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But it may be preached that Chriſt dyed for
beleivers.</p>
            <p>A. That is no glad tydings to the world, which
doe not yet beleeve: neither will ſuch a doctrine
worke faith, whereas Chriſt hath appoynted a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
of remiſſion of ſins by his death to be preached
to the world, to the begetting of perſons to the faith
of that truth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. 17. &amp; 1. 16. &amp; 16. 26.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſuch a doctrine doth ſuppoſe perſons
to be beleevers before Chriſt dyed for them, or at
leaſt before it may be preached unto them, that
Chriſt dyed for them, and ſo by conſequence before
there be any thing to be beleeved: and ſo by the ſame
conſequence impoſſible there ſhould be any beleever,
<hi>for how ſhall they beleeve on him of whome they have
not heard, Rom.</hi> 10. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But men muſt firſt feare God, or have ſome
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:169434:12"/>
worke of God wrought in them, Acts 13. 26. before it
may be lawfull to preach the Goſpell to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Not fo, for then it cannot be ſaid, that any are
<hi>begotten</hi> by preaching: if <hi>perfons</hi> muſt have a life and
being in <hi>godlyneſſe before:</hi> which is <hi>contrary to theſe
Scriptures, Jam. 1. 18. 1 Cor. 4. 16. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 23.</p>
            <p>Secondly, then it is unlawfull to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all Nations, even to them that doe not feare God,
which is contrary to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Mat:</hi> 28: 18:
<hi>Mar:</hi> 16: 15: <hi>Acts</hi> 8: 5: &amp; 9: 29: &amp; 13. 45: 46: 50:
and 17: 32: and many other.</p>
            <p>Thirdly the meaning of <hi>Acts</hi> 13: 26: is but to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
the <hi>Proſelites</hi> from the naturall <hi>Jewes</hi> by the
application of fearing God: and when he ſaith, <hi>to
you,</hi> that is you Jewes, both by nature and religion;
<hi>to you</hi> in the firſt place according to the Commiſſion
of Chriſt, Luke 24: 47: as therein offering mercy to
them, and they refuſiug the ſame, were left inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable:
as, ver. 40: 41: 45: 46.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But how is it proved that the ſubject matter, of
the Goſpell required to be preached to the world, is that
Chriſt ſuffered for the ſins of all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, becauſe Chriſt and the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
did ſo teach, <hi>Iſa:</hi> 53: 6: <hi>John</hi> 1: 29: &amp; 3: 16
17: &amp; 6: 51: &amp; 12: 47: 48: 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 15: 3: 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5
14: 15: &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt required them ſo to preach, <hi>Mat.</hi>
28: 18: 19: <hi>Mar:</hi> 16: 15: <hi>Luke</hi> 10: 5: &amp; 24: 47:
<hi>Rom:</hi> 16: 26:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:169434:12"/>
Thirdly, the Saints are commended for beleeving
ſo, John 4: 44: 1 John 4: 14.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, becauſe it is a condemning ſin in any
hearing the Goſpell not to beleeve ſo (to wit, that
Chriſt dyed for their ſins, Joh: 3: 18: 19: &amp; 12: 47:
48: &amp; 16: 9: 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5: 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q:</hi> But why is ſuch a doctrine required to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the world; to wit, that Chriſt ſuffered for all the
ſins of all?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> For the working of the beleefe thereof in all,
in whom the doctrine prevaleth, and for the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſablenes
of the reſt, 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2: 14: 15: 16: &amp; 4: 3: 4: &amp; 6:
1: 2: &amp; 10: 4: 5: 6: 2 <hi>Theſ:</hi> 1: 8: &amp; 2: 10: <hi>Heb:</hi> 2: 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q:</hi> But will it not from hence follow, that man hath
free-will?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No ſurely, for if the Goſpell muſt worke faith, then
it flowes not from the inclination of the will, but from
the Goſpels inlightning the underſtanding, Epheſ. 4. 20.
23. Gal. 3. 2. Rom. 1. 16. 17. &amp; 10. 17. and as for
the inexcuſablenes of the reſt which do not beleive, it
doth not betoaken a freedome of will to beleive, but doth
bewray a blind mind, and an bard heart, and a rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
diſpoſition, that will not beleive the truth, though
it be declared unto them, Acts 13. 4<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the beleiving of the Goſpell?</p>
            <p>Anſ. Yes ſurely, untill the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
prevaile, and then, and by that meanes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
<pb facs="tcp:169434:13"/>
diſpoſition is caſt down and ſubjected, and

               </gap>ons brought unto the obedience of Chriſt,
2 Cor 10. 5: and when it prevailes not, it heapes up
vengance againſt the diſobedient, ver. 6,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But hath God elected ſome perſons before the
world began, which only ſhalbe ſaved?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea certainly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. or elſe the events
of things in time ſhould come to paſſe without or

               </gap> God, which were impiety once to imagine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But doth not the doctrine of Chriſts dying for all
con<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>radict this doctrine?</p>
            <p>A. No ſurely, becauſe it is the meanes to worke
faith effectually in the Elect according to the eternal
decree, 1 <hi>Thef.</hi> 1. 4: 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. and to leave the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
abſolutely inexcuſable in the effecting their

ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>erings of Chriſt preached and that acording to
the ſame eternall decree, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 8. Jude</hi> 4. Rom. 8. 33.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Why then it ſeemes, that Chriſts ſuffering for all
the ſins of all ought freely to be preached to all, and not
to be limited by any conſideration of the doctriue of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection?</p>
            <p>A. Surely that muſt needs be ſo, Firſt becauſe it
is the Commiſſion of Chriſt, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 15.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe we doe not know who is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
no otherwiſe then by the event.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe it is as true doctrine to them
that are not Elect; as to the Elect, whether they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:169434:13"/>
it or not.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, becauſe God hath his end in Chriſts
ſuffering for the ſins of all, and in the doctrine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to all as well when it is not beleeved, as when it
is beleeved, <hi>Luke 2. 34. 1. Cor. 23. 24. 2 Cor.</hi> 14. 15. 16.
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 6. 7. 8. 9.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Becauſe elſe it is not a direct meanes to

            <p>Sixtly, Becauſe elſe unbeleevers are not by that

               </gap>anes left inexcuſable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But if this be the doctrin and faith to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
and beleeved, may it be concluded frim hence, that
that none have ſaving faith but thoſe that beleeve this
doctrine?</p>
            <p>A. It is certaine, there is no ſaving faith without
beleiving in the ſufferings of Chriſt; neithnr have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
true ground to beleeve that he ſuffered for them
any otherwiſe then is declared in Scripture to have
ſuffered for all; yet here we muſt diſtinguiſh, ſome
do not ſo diſtinctly underſtand it to build their faith
upon it as others doe, who therefore have a weaker
faith then others have: yet this is out of all doubt,
that no ſaving faith ſtands in oppoſition to it,
though ſome perſons weake in the faith poſſibly may.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But ſome perſons who doe appeare very godly
doe oppoſe it.</p>
            <p>A. True, but many perſons who doe appeare ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
godly are not ſo indeed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, many godly perſons are enemies to the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:169434:14"/>
truth, and to themſelves too, <hi>Mat. 16. 22. 33. Mar.</hi>
8. 33.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſuch oppoſition proceeds not from their
faith, but from their ignorance &amp; ſinfull corruption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſtion.</hi> But may wee ſafely beleeve that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> ſnffered for the ſinn of all, and ſo for us all,
and therein our owne Salvation, before we know
whether we be elected or not?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea ſurely: for ſo we are directed <hi>Rom:</hi> 10: 6: 7:
8. 9. and yet nevertheleſſe by this Call of God to
this knowledge &amp; beleife, we may be ſure that he hath
choſen us unto Salvation. <hi>Rom:</hi> 8: 30.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q:</hi> But why is this beleefe required?</p>
            <p>A. That we may thereby partake of union with.
Chriſt, and thereby <hi>Reconciliation, Adoption, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>Glorification. Joh:</hi> 1: 19
<hi>Gal:</hi> 2: 16: 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5: 20: <hi>Gal:</hi> 3: 26: <hi>Rom:</hi> 8: 28: 29:
30: <hi>Ast:</hi> 26: 18: <hi>&amp;</hi> 10: 43: <hi>&amp;</hi> 15: 9: <hi>Eph:</hi> 3. 17: 18</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Are not the Elect Juſtified before they doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve?</p>
            <p>A. <hi>Noe ſurely for they are without</hi> Chriſt, ſtrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
from the Covenant, without Hope or God in the
world: dead in ſinnes: children of wrath as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
in a ſtate of condemnation. Joh: 3: 18: Eph: 2:
1: 3: 12.</p>
            <p>Ob: But the Scripture in many places doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
Juſtification to be by the blood of Chriſt,
and doth not mention faith: as <hi>Rom:</hi> 3: 24: <hi>&amp;</hi> 5: 9:
18 19: <hi>Rev:</hi> 1. 3: <hi>Heb:</hi> 9: 14: 26: 1 <hi>Job:</hi> 1: 7: <hi>Eph</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: 7. and beſides, faith is a beleeving of Remiſſion
of ſinnes and conſequently Juſtification, which
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>herefore mu<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> be before the beleeving of the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> True it is that the matter of our Inſtification
is the blood of Chriſt ſhed for all, to be beleeved by <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll:
and faith hath no other Object: but yet be that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
not his owne Juſtice and Life in the death of Chriſt
ſhall never ſee Light but the wrath of God abideth on
him. <hi>Joh:</hi> 3: 36. and we are juſtified by faith: not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out:
Rom: 3: 28: &amp; 5: 1: Gal: 2: 16: Nor yet before
we beleive; for it is counted for Righteoufneſſe, not an
other thing: Rom: 4: 3: 5: 9: 11: 12: 16. 13: 22: 24: Gal.
3: 6: 7: 8: 9: 11: 14: 33: 34: 26: and the reaſon is becauſe
by it only we partake of Chriſts death and ſufferings:
Joh: 1: 12: &amp; 3: 14: 15: 16: 17: 18: 19. 33: 36:
&amp; 8: 34: &amp; 11: 25: 26. &amp; 12. 46. 47. 48 Jo. 16. 9.</p>
            <p>Q. But are not the elect juſtified in the purpoſe of
God from all eteinity?</p>
            <p>A. No more then they are called and glorified
from all eternity, and that is only predeſtinated and
arpoynted from all eternity to be called and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ſuch a time and by ſuch a meanes as faith in
Chriſt. <hi>Rom:</hi> 8: 38: 39: 30. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1: 4. 5: &amp; 2: 8. 2
<hi>Theſ.</hi> 2: 13: 14. and therby preſerved to glory in
the end. Heere we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of God and the execution of the ſame decree<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
the appoyntment to doe a thing, and the doing of
the ſame according to appoyntment: God did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt
for to juſtifie his Elect in time, and when the
<pb facs="tcp:169434:15"/>
time is come, God doth accordingly effect the ſam<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
by giving them Faith therby making them partaken
of union with Chriſt, and therby of Reconciliation
Adoption and Juſtification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But when perſons doe (according to the Goſpell)
beleive that Chriſt ſuffered for all the ſinnes of all, an<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
ſo for them: by which Faith they partake of, or are <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
with Chriſt, and thereby of Reconciliation, Adoption,
and Juſtification: doth God require any further meanes
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o be by them uſed tending to Salvation yea or no?</p>
            <p>A. Yes ſurely, becauſe it is neceſſary that this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife
be preſerved and encreaſed, and the fruits ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
and the power of ſinne mortified, which is done
by degrees. 2 Pet. 3: 18: 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4: 1: <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0. and God
hath appoynted meanes to be uſed for that purpoſe
by the Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What meanes is that?</p>
            <p>A. Surely the preaching and hearing of Gods
word, which is as neceſſary for Edification as for
Converſion: and the adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and prayer, and the Diſcipline of the true
Church: <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll which ought conſcionably to be uſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Gods word by all true beleivers as the
meanes of perſeverance and encreaſe of Faith, untill
we come to the end of our Faith the Salvation of
our Souls. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 9: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4: 12: 13. <hi>Math:</hi> 26:
