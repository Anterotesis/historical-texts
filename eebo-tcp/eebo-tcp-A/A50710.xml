            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Ruff.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cuff.</speaker>
               <p>Well, remember your ſelves and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteris
<hi>Stichwel,</hi> one to whom you have been
both beholding in your days.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Band.</speaker>
               <p>Who? Miſtris <hi>Stichwel,</hi> by this light
I know her not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cuff</speaker>
               <p>No, nor you neither.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ruff.</speaker>
               <p>Nor I, I ſwear by all the Gum and
Blew ſtarch in Chriſtendom.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cuff.</speaker>
               <p>I thought ſo, why its the <hi>Semſter,</hi> one
that both you had been undone had it not
been for her, but what talk you of undoing?
I ſay Miſteris <hi>Stichwel</hi> the <hi>Semſter</hi> was the very
maker of you both, yet thus little do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
her, but it is the common cuſtome of you
all, when you come to be ſo great as you are;
you forget from what houſe you come.</p>

               <p>Well <hi>Band</hi> and <hi>Ruff,</hi> you were beſt
both of you to take heed of her, you know
ſhe ſet you both in the Stocks once before,
and if ſhe catch you again, is is a hundred to
<pb facs="tcp:93633:5"/>
one, if ſhe hang you not both up, for ſhe hath
got ſtrings already,</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ruff.</speaker>
               <p>Meet me, if thou dareſt?</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cuff.</speaker>
               <p>Since you will go, go; but hear me,
if you go, look at me well; as little a fellow as I
am, I will come and <hi>Cuff</hi> you both out of
the fields; if I do not, ſay, <hi>Cuff</hi> is no man of his
hands.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ruff.</speaker>
               <p>Alas poor ſhrimp, thou art nothing
in my hands.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cuff.</speaker>
               <p>If you go, yon ſhall never ſay that
<hi>Cuff</hi> came of a ſleeveleſs errand, Ile bind your
hand (I warrant you) for ſtriking.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Band.</speaker>
               <p>Say and hold.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cuff.</speaker>
               <p>And you be ſo chollerick, Ile even
pin you both in, as ſoon as I come home: can
you not decide the quarrel between your
ſelves without a field? I had thought you had
been a little more mild, <hi>Ruff.</hi> You were a
horrible <hi>Puritane</hi> the other day, a very preciſe
<hi>Ruff.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ruff.</speaker>
               <p>Hang him, baſe Raſcal: would he not
make any man mad, to ſee ſuch a—I durſt not
ſcarce peep out before Coller came to Town,
now to ſwagger thus.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cuff.</speaker>
               <p>Come, you ſhall be friends, <hi>Band.</hi>

               <speaker>Band.</speaker>
               <p>Friends with him? ſuch a baſe Raſcal?
he is a very thread-bare fellow, I ſcorn, but my
man <hi>Coller</hi> ſhould go as well as he every day
in the week, and be friends with him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ruff.</speaker>
               <p>Thy man <hi>Coller?</hi> Thy Maſter, thou
wouldſt have ſaid, I am ſure he is thy up-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cuff.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, ſurely he is his Maſter, at leaſt his
Maſter: for <hi>Bands,</hi> make rags; rags make Paper;
paper makes Paſt-board; and Paſt-board makes
<hi>Collar;</hi> and I think that this is a ſtiff argument
that he is his Maſter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ruff.</speaker>
               <p>Wel, be he what he will, if I catch his
<hi>Collar,</hi> Ile cut him in jags, let me but claſp him,
and Ile make him for ſtirring.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cuff.</speaker>
               <p>But you ſhall not fight: have you not
Friends &amp; Neighbors enough to end this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,
but you muſt go into the fields, and
there cut the thread of your lives? wee'l have
none of that, come chuſe you an Umpire, <hi>Band,</hi>
for it ſhall be ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Band.</speaker>
               <p>Since you will force me to it, if <hi>Ruff</hi> be

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cuff.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, ſtay there, he is a moſt filthy Sni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veling
<pb facs="tcp:93633:6"/>
fellow, and he will wipe your Noſe of al,
if you put the caſe to him, but what ſay you to
<hi>Shir?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ruff.</speaker>
               <p>He is a ſhifting knave, and one, to whom
<hi>Band,</hi> a little before hath been much beholding,
they were joyned along time togither in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Why, then go to Maſter <hi>Cap,</hi> the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Band.</speaker>
               <p>No, I deny that, he is a very bad Juſtice
you may have him wrought on any ſide for
mony.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ruff.</speaker>
               <p>Ile tell you what, then we will go to

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Band.</speaker>
               <p>He is not in Town.</p>

               <p>Here's a-do with you, and may Lord
<hi>Corpus,</hi> indeed I would you were both hanged
about his neck for me, but I ſee, this ſtrife will
never be ended, till I be Arbitrator my ſelf, you
know, I am equally allied to you both: ſhall I
be Moderator between you?</p>

               <p>Well then, <hi>Ruff</hi> ſhall be moſt accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of amongſt the Clergy, for he is the grave
Fellow (although I know, the <hi>Puritans</hi> will not
greatly care for him, he hath ſuch a deal of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and they love ſtanding very well.) As for
<pb facs="tcp:93633:6"/>
you, <hi>Band,</hi> you ſhall be moſt made of amongſt
the young Gallants, although ſometimes they
ſhall uſe <hi>Ruff,</hi> for a faſhion, but not otherwiſe;
however, you need not regard the giddy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
multitude, let them do as they liſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
reſpecting one, ſometimes the other: but
when you come to the Counſailor, and men of
Law, which know right from wrong, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
Maſter Worths to be equal, they ſhall
preferre neither, but uſe the kindneſs of you
both, wearing both a <hi>Band</hi> and a <hi>Ruff;</hi> how ſay
you, are you both content?</p>
