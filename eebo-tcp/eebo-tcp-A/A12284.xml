            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>CHristian Reader, howbeit the continued infirmitie of this authors body, wherwith it pleased God to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise him, might iustly haue excused him from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king pen in hand to write, especially in businesses of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his desire being as himselfe testified in his life time, to finish this last period of his life with more comfortable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations then to follow controversies: yet did he labour to his power, yea and (as I may say) beyond his power, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force himselfe even in his decayed health, together with his other necessarie labours, to discover the fraud and falshood of the adversaries: amongst others he iudged these Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists not the least, which occasioned this ensuing Censure; Another nearer inhabitant then the former author, was one Mr. <hi>Paget</hi> that lived in the same citie by him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being a chiefe leader to another congregation there, who being of a quarrelsome disposition, and envious hearted towards Mr. <hi>Ainsworth,</hi> and the truth professed by him, having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly picked quarrels against him: afterward without his privitie while matters were in debating (not imitating D. <hi>Reynolds</hi> to <hi>Hart</hi> although he highly commends him pag. <hi>367.</hi>) published a book against him, laying to his charge things which he knew not, even grosse vntruths, and palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reproches, making divers false charges upon him, as if he neither shamed nor feared to be Sathans instrument to blow abroad whatsoever envie and malice had scraped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in likelihood expecting no other reward then grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the world, by the Gospells disgrace in our subversion; yea labouring through his sides to smite the text it selfe,
<pb facs="tcp:187:3"/>
which I trust M. <hi>Ainsworth</hi> hath well cleared in that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle advertisement published in his life time with those books of Moses, besides a particular answer to his book he had well begun, and had finished long before his death had not his infirmitie of body hindered. But now time permits not to instance particulars, but leaving so unneighbourly, yea so unchristian an opposite to the Lord for iudgement, I will add a word or two touching the occasion of this treatise en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing, which was at the request of some, (whose minds the Anabaptists would cumber with their errours) to shew his iudgment on the foresayd book. Now as some were assaulted that yet would giue no way or entertainment to those errors, yet othersome that had stood in the truth a long time, were perverted. The knowledge of these things comming to this reverend and iudicious man, Mr. <hi>Henry Ainsworth,</hi> hee soone drew out this answer, and sent it by a friend into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to reclaime (if God saw it good) such as had erred herein, and gone astrray by rash and inconsiderate zeale beyond knowledge, and through the grace of God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue such from falling as yet stood: this he sent for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, purposing if the Lord continued some competent health and strength, to revise and so to make more perfect this which then shortnesse of time in respect of the Messengers great haste, could not be affoorded, and so to make it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in this spring; but the Lord having prevented this his purpose, by taking him to himselfe, hee now resteth from his labours. Yet finding the matter may, through the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God, be profitable to his people, it is thought fit not to keepe these his last labours in matters of this nature in silence, but that it come to the publick view for the good of them that are ordained to life. And so I wish thee to fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well in the Lord.</p>

            <head>A CENSVRE UPON A DIALOGVE of the Anabaptists, intituled, <hi>A Description</hi> of what God hath Predestinated concerning MAN, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>BEING requested by some, whose mindes the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists would cumber with their errours, to shew my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on their foresaid Book; I haue set down these few observations.</p>
            <p>In the first part which they intitle of <hi>Predestination,</hi> they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a double fault, 1 They confirme not by holy Writ their owne doctrine: for in the third page of their Dialogue, they describe Gods Predestination out of their own head; not one Scripture brought to proue that they say: neither can they justifie by Gods word that their description, wherein some things are erroneous, some ambiguous and sophisticall till they be cleared. 2 They abuse and calumniate the doctrine of those whom they call Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists, and would father upon them absurdities, errours, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: taking advantage upon some harsh phrases, concluding against them worse things then either they spake or meant; pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing over the explanations to be seene in sundry of their workes, which will cleare them of the errours that these men would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force upon them.</p>
            <p>The differences vvhich they make (in page 4) between the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists doctrine and theirs, are fraudulent and iniurious. As betweene <hi>All things,</hi> and <hi>all good things:</hi> where first these Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists doe differ from the plaine Scriptures, which testifie that <hi>All things</hi> were created by Christ, Col. 1 16, and without him was <hi>not any thing</hi> made that was made, 1 Ioh. 1 2. Secondly, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ignorant but that we hold all things that were made to bee very good, Gen. 1 31, so this difference they forged out of their idle heads.</p>
            <p>The 2 &amp; 3 differences, as that the Calvinists should say, <hi>whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is done (murther or the like) commeth from God; and that God is the principall cause and author of all things, appointing all things to the one part and to the other, damnation as salvation, vice as vertue.</hi> But the Anabaptists say, <hi>whatsoever good is done commeth from God, but no evill things that are done; and that God is the principall cause and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:187:4"/>
of all good, and of salvation to all men; but the devill is the author of all evill.</hi> In these differences they set down some errour, with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnie and sophistrie.</p>
            <p>Errour it is to say, God appoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ke <hi>vices</hi> come from God, and are appointed by him, is injurious sophistication.

As they are morall, Gods providence concerning them is twofold: for as they are vicious &amp; sinfully done, God doth them not, but suffreth them so to be done: as they haue in them respect of justice and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, so God doth, appointeth, commandeth them to be done: As, the defiling of Davids Concubines, being considered in the sinfulnesse of it, proceeded from Absaloms wicked lust, and A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But considering it as a punishment or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement for Davids sin, the Scripture telleth us, that God <hi>took</hi> Davids wiues and <hi>gaue</hi> them to Absalom, and God <hi>did</hi> this <hi>thing,</hi> 2 Sam 12 11 12.

That sin is no substantiall thing is plaine, seeing all things were made by God, Ioh. 1 2, but sinne he never made: it is a vicious quality infecting the good things which God made, and corrupting their actions.

Thess. 2. a work of justice: therefore a good worke. And if God did not doe these things, but onely suffered them: then the good workes of justice are done by wicked men and divils; and the Divils shall be good doers; and God a sufferer onely of good to be done. The proofe they make shew of from comparing the Evangelists, sheweth what strangers they are in the book of God. When sundry Prophets or Apostles repeat the same things, it is usually with some change and difference of words: not that the different words are equivalent, one meaning neither more nor l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sse then another, but of different meaning, and larger extent oftentimes, to teach further matter. That which one Evangelist calleth <hi>fasting, Mark</hi> 2.19. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other calleth <hi>mourning, Math.</hi> 9.15. yet are not these two one, though often joyned together. To drink <hi>with the drunken, Math.</hi> 24.49. is explained, To drink <hi>and to be drunken,</hi> Luk. 12.45. which two speeches are not alwayes the same; for a man may drink with the drunken, and yet not be drunken himselfe. In 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.4. the <hi>Levites</hi> took up the Ark: in 1. <hi>King.</hi> 8.3. it is sayd, the <hi>Priests</hi> took up the Ark: this expoundeth the former; for though all Priests were Levites, yet all Levites were not Priests. In 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.19. the Syrians <hi>would</hi> not help the Ammonites: in 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.19. it is sayd, they <hi>feared</hi> to help them. Yet are not these words of equal force and extent: for some may bee unwilling to helpe though they be not afraid. The Prophet sayth, <hi>Rejoyce</hi> greatly O daughter of Sion, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.9. the Apostle alledgeth it, <hi>Feare not</hi> O daughter of Sion, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.15. The Prophet sayth, the Gentiles shall <hi>seeke, Esa.</hi> 11.10. the Apostle expoundeth it, the Gentiles shall <hi>trust. Rom.</hi> 15.12. And many the like; where to make one of the words no more in force then the other, were to do open violence to the scripture.

And that all may see that <hi>sending</hi> is more then <hi>suffering,</hi> the very same historie which they alledge doth convince them, for the same Divils at the same time desired Christ that hee would not <hi>send them</hi> away out of the countrie, <hi>Mark.</hi> 5 10. but in <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.31. it is said, they desired that he would not <hi>comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But why doth the one Evangelist say <hi>send us,</hi> and an other, <hi>suffer us</hi>? Not to confound these two as one, but to teach us two things; 1. that as it was the divils sinfull and malicious desire to hurt the creatures, &amp; to procure envy against Christ in this respect he <hi>suffered</hi> them: 2. but as it was Christs just punishment on the covetous Gadarens, and trial of them whether they loved their swine more then him and his gospel; in these respects Christ not onely <hi>suffered,</hi> but <hi>sent</hi> the divils into the swine; and the divils were his servants to doe what he would haue done. The like is to be minded for Gods sending the Assyrians, and Babylonians, with sword to kill; and the divils with delusions to deceiue the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates; and other the like, 1 King. 22, 19, 20—22.23.</p>
            <p>This is further manifested by the example of Christs death: touching which (whatsoever the Scripture saith) these men doe <hi>deny that God determined, appointed or decreed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 28.</note> 
               <hi>that the wicked should betray or murther him, otherwise then by suffering them.</hi> Which if they spake in respect of the sinne onely, we would grant: but being meant of the actions done, it is against the expresse Scriptures, which say the Iewes tooke and crucified him, <hi>being delivered by the determinate counsell and foreknowledge of God, Act.</hi> 2 23, and that both Gentiles and Israelites were gathered together for to doe whatsoever Gods <hi>hand</hi> and his <hi>counsell, predestinated</hi> (or <hi>fore-deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined) to be done: Act.</hi> 4 27.28. Now Gods Counsell and Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination that a thing should be done, is more then bare permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and his <hi>hand</hi> being in it, sheweth him to be an agent in this work. God out of his loue, sent and gaue his Sonne for us, Ioh. 3.16.17, it pleased the Lord to bruise him, and put him to griefe, Esay 53.10, and Christ laid down his life of himselfe, no man took it from him, Ioh. 10.18, he powred out his soule unto death, Esa. 53.12, he offered up himselfe a sacrifice for our sinnes, through the externall Spirit, Heb. 7.27, &amp; 9 14. These and the like sayings in Scripture, teach us more of God in Christs death, then a bare suffering. Gods good hand was in it for our redemption, and not onely the wicked hands of them that sinfully crucified him.</p>

Will they teach him an other or a better way to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his owne purposes, then himselfe hath chosen? But what would they infer upon it? If God had decreed that Christ should haue beene slaine by holy Angels; they would not then deny (I suppose) but God should be an agent in his Sons death.

are the effects (not the cause) of our election, and are conditions
following election, not going before it; as it is written, <hi>As many as

ordaining to life (that is his election) went before their beleeving,
but these men invert the order of God, and would teach, that so

that our conformity to the image of Christ, our faith, obedience,
bearing of his crosse &amp;c. is that whereunto (not that wherefore)
God predestined or chose us. This is most apparant by the words

following: <hi>Whom he did predestinate, them he also called, and whom he

unrighteous, that they may be made godly, righteous, and holy,
through his grace. But these men say, <hi>God chooseth a righteous man,</hi>
whereas the Scripture saith, <hi>There is none righteous, no not one, there
is none that understandeth, none that seeketh after God, Rom.</hi> 3.10.11,
so that if God should chuse the righteous onely, none at all should

But all beleeved not: therefore all were not ordained (or elected) to life. Against reason it is to say, All are elected: for election implieth a leaving or refusing of some. Where all ar taken, no choyse is made. Their second saying is, <hi>all were elected, not actually,</hi> because they had no being; but in Gods eternall purpose. The action is in God, not in man: and his purposes or decrees are his actions: and if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world, God elected us in Christ, as the Apostle teacheth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. then were we actually chosen before we had naturall being: though Gods choyse had not effect in us till we had being: But whereas they add, <hi>vpon the condition afore spoken</hi>; it is an error before refuted.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But of the elect Paul sayth, Ye were without Christ, without God in the world,</hi> Eph. 2.12. <hi>so they were not then really and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly elected.</hi>

They neglect Pauls doctrine, that God chose us before the world was, that we should be holy: and teach new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Antichrists devising, that God chose vs because we were holy. But to follow them in their doctrine: God chooseth none (they say) but where he findeth faith. Where doth God find this, seeing he hath shut up all in unbeliefe? <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32.

               <p>By this which hath been sayd, all that loue the truth may see, that all men to whom the Gospell is preached, are not elected to salvation in Christ, as these corrupters of the Gospell teach: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can all men beleeue, or obey; because God giues them not such grace. Some refuse indeed willingly, and they perish justly: some (who naturally are as bad as other, &amp; haue harts of stone not

of flesh) are changed, new hearts are given them, faith and holines are wrought in them, and so they are brought unto salvation whereunto they were elected. Why God changeth the heart of some and not of other some, when he could if he pleased, change alle is not a question to be disputed of, Rom. 9.19.20. Let it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice us, that God oweth us nothing, except death for our sinnes.

For God foreseeing their wickednesse, appoynted them to wrath before they acted it, though hee infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth not punishment till they be sinners.

               <p>The faith which we professe is this: that the elect, however through Satans tentations, and their owne infirmities, they are subject to fall from God and perish; yet they are kept by the power of God, through faith unto salvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, though they through their weakenesse sin and fall, yet the Lord putteth under his hand, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.24, and the seed of God remaineth in them, and they cannot sin (unto death) because they are borne of God, 1 <hi>Iob.</hi> 3.9.

               <p>
                  <hi>Those that Christ hath bought may be damned,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Answ.</hi> Those are such as before I spake of, which were bought of Christ by his offer of grace, and their feyned acceptance of it: but had they been in deed bought from the earth, they would haue follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lamb, and should haue beene without fault before the throne of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.3.4 5.

<hi>yet having forsaken their first loue, if they repented not, God would remoue
the candlestick</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. <hi>Answ.</hi> This is answered in the answers
to the Scriptures which they brought in their first reason. It is
true, the elect without repentance, faith, and perseverance cannot
be saved. But all Gods elect haue from him the grace to repent,
beleeue, and continue in well-doing, as before is proved: so they
cannot perish. But hypocrites which were among the Saints one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:187:13"/>
but never of them, they cannot continue with the Saints, and
so cannot be saved, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.19.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>If a man in Gods favour and chosen cannot fall out of it: then
need he not, though he commit incest, adultery, murder, &amp;c. feare falling

as if men should continue in sin that grace may abound. Far
be it. All men ought to feare falling into any sinne, and the elect
feare continually knowing their owne frailtie. Our spirituall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
is not carnall security: our faith is in God, not in our selues;
by his power we are kept, not by our owne. Hee saith to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>The mountaines shall depart, and the hills be removed, but my kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be
removed; Esai.</hi> 54.10. But if by feare, they meane feare without faith,
that is despair: we beleeue that the elect though they fall into such
sinnes, ought not to despaire or distrust Gods mercy: as the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of David, Peter &amp;c: which they alledge, doe evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 51. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.31.32.</p>

of these sinnes, then to what end is repentance taught? It is in vaine, if
they neither be, nor can be in condemnation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Answ.</hi> They that teach
such doctrine, their religion is vaine. We beleeue as the elect can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
perish, so neither can they continue in sin: he that is borne
of God (saith the Apostle) <hi>committeth not sinne,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.9. All
that truely beleeue that they are elect, doe also beleeue and know,
that by repentance, faith, and abiding in Christ, they must come to
the end of their election, the salvation of their soules: this is the
way and meanes unto life, and without this they cannot see God.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>To what end are men admonished or exhorted not to receiue the grace

3.17 <hi>&amp;c. If they cannot fall into them, doth the Lord use words in vain?
Answ.</hi> No, but these mens words are vaine. For God as he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
men to life, hath also ordained his lawes, exhortations,
threatnings &amp;c. as meanes to bring them into life. He dealeth not
with men as with stones, to cary them into heaven by violence; but
giueth them repentance, faith, loue, zeale, care and other graces; hee
perswadeth, moveth, draweth them to come willingly, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
carefully, and so at last saveth them.</p>

And as he dealeth with the elect Iewes, so doth he vvith all the elect Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: therefore all Gods elect shall in time be converted, and haue their sins forgiven them, and so undoubtedly saved by him whose gifts and calling are vvithout repentance.</p>

The Apostle sayth of the many Antichrists, <hi>they went out from us, but they were not of us,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2, 18, 19. This these men will not haue to be meant of their persons, but of their spirits in their persons.

               <p>First it is an errour to say God hateth not the persons of wicked men, but the evill qualities in them onely: for though hee hateth no creature in respect of their creation which was good; yet the

creature being degenerate and fallen from God, he hateth their wickednesse and them also for it, as the Scripture plainely wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5.4.5.6 &amp; 11 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It is erroneous to say, that <hi>by Spirits, the Apostle meaneth not
persons, but qualities,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.1. for himselfe sheweth his meaning,
when he saith, <hi>because many false Prophets are gone out into the

subjects or persons, by the name of adjuncts or qualities in them:

Fourthly, the Prophet speaketh generally of the many sinnes which the fathers did, and the sonnes did not, Ezek. 18.6.7.8.18. the Apostle speaketh of that one sinne or offence, by vvhich we all (being in Adams loynes) are guiltie.

               <p>Further, they answer, (and desire it may well be observed) that mankind was onely in Adam in their bodily substance: he is the

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We obserue it well, and obserue their error also. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true that thus (to wit in respect of our bodies onely) we were in Adam, and not in respect of our soules: no scripture teacheth them this, but their own fansie. For though our soules were not in all respects in Adam, as our bodies were, to wit, materially: yet in some resp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ct (to wit formally) we were in Adam both body and soule; which I thus manifest. Adam begat Seth in his own image, Gen. 5 Abraham begat Isaak, &amp;c.

                  </gap>ynes of Abraham is sayd to pay tythes, Heb 7.9 10. Now the body without the spirit is dead, and therefore cannot pay tythes, nor do any action. And in the place and case in hand, in Adam all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, all died, judgement came on all men to condemnation, Rom. 5.12.18. but the body without the soule sinneth not, neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Fourthly, let all they say be given them, yet it helpes them not: for I haue before proved, that we were all in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam as living men, not as dead corpses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so had soules of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Further they say, God never purposed to execute on Adam for that transgression condemnation to hell; in that hee purposed to send Christ betwixt, in whom Adam beleeving should be saved. If Adam for his own sin was not condemned to hell without remedy, shall any of his posteritie be sent to hell without remedy, and that for his sin? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The question in the first place is changed, which is, whether Adam and all his posteritie in him falling from God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served not hell for their sinne. This they deny not, neither can disproue. 2. As God purposed not to damne Adam for his sinne; so neither purposed he to damne Noah for his drunkennesse, Lot for his incest, David for his adultery and murder, &amp;c. but to giue th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Will they hereupon plead that other actuall drunkards, murderers, whoremongers, deserue not damnation: or shall not many such be damned for these sinnes? 3.

For Christ (the second Adam) giveth righteousnesse and life to all infants and old transgressors that are borne of him; as the first Adam conveyed unrighteousnesse and death to all his ordinary naturall posteritie. Yea grace here excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: for the judgement (or guilt) of originall sin was by one (of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence) to condemnation; but the free gift (by Christ) is of many offences, unto justification, Rom. 5.16.</p>

Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vvhen the Apostle sayth in Rom. 7.9. <hi>that he was aliue without the law</hi>: this contradicteth (according to their sense) the other scripture, in Rom. 5 12. that <hi>all haue sinned, and are dead.</hi> The Apostle in Rom. 5. speaketh of things as they are; in Rom. 7.9, he speaketh of things as they seemed to be, but vvere not indeed. Paul vvas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue in his owne conceit, thinking himselfe able to keep the Law, as naturall men doe suppose they can. But vvhen the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came (to wit unto his knowledge and conscience,) then sin revived and he died. How could this be: seeing the <hi>commandement is holy, just and good,</hi> v. 12 He telleth us in 13 v. that <hi>sinne wrought death in him by that which was good.</hi> So then he vvas sinfull (though he knew it not) before the commandement came; sinfull by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but not discerning this his wofull state, the Law vvas given to shew it him; for <hi>by the law commeth the knowledge of sinne, Rom.</hi> 3.20.

Fourthly,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:187:20"/>
it is here to be observed how the Anabaptists <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>grant, <hi>all men haue weake natures, and cannot obey and liue, but sin and dye.</hi> How commeth this to passe? <hi>By Adams sinne,</hi> say they. Behold here how they thwart their own grounds. They impose a necessitie upon all men which (they think) are born innocents, to sin. They cannot but sin, they must needs dye: and this not through their owne default at all, but by Adams. If we should thus teach, what outcries would they make after us! How is it they here forget the scriptures by themselues forealleaged, <hi>The son shall not beare the iniquitie of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Ezek.</hi> 18.20. Is not this a heavy burden which the sonns beare, that their father sinning, and they being innocent, are so weakned of God, that they cannot but sin, they cannot but dye? Doth God create an innocent man, and giue him charge to doe that vvhich is unpossible for the man to doe, and threaten death unto him for not doing it? We abhorre such doctrine as quite overthrowing Gods justice. When he made Adam innocent, he gaue him no law, but that vvhich was possible &amp; easie for him to do, and to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in doing it, if he had would. His justice requireth him to doe the like to all his innocent creatures. Wherfore if these men come not to acknowledge with the Apostle (and with us) originall sinne and death for sin to be in Adams seed, that his fall and disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was the fall of us all, by imputation and by infection, (as a serpent brings forth but a serpent) &amp; that so being sinners in him, we haue lost our abilitie to do good, by Gods just judgment, &amp; are sold under sinne: If they come not (I say) unto this, they will bee open enemies to the iustice of God, and make the judge of all the world not to doe equitie. 5. Finally, vvheras they say, that neither this nor any part of Gods word is spoken to or of infants: they impudently avouch untruth. The Apostle in Rom. 5.14. speaketh of them which sinned after the similitude of Adams transgression, and yet death reigned over them also. What sin can this be but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall sin vvherin infants are born, and for vvhich many infants dye. For vvhen they passe from infancie and come to understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, they sin actually as Adam did. To sin the same sin they cannot, for all being shut out of paradice, they cannot eat of the forbidden tree, though they vvould. Neither doth the Apostle speak of that same sin, but of sinning <hi>after the similitude</hi> of Adams transgression: so it meaneth actuall sin, like Adams. Now all sin, is either originall or actuall. If then death reigneth ouer them which sinne not actually, as Adam did, it must needs reigne over them which sin originally onely in Adam: and these be infants. For the Anabaptists grant, that when they come to discretion, they sinne (and cannot but sinne) actually. And thus their next vvords also are refuted,<note place="margin">

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:187:20"/>
cannot be imputed unto them, Rom.</hi> 4.15. The contrary is thus proved: Infants haue transgression imputed unto them, and death for transgression, as the Apostle sheweth in Rom. 5. Therfore they are under some law: though not under Moses law vvhich punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth actuall transgressors, yet under Adams law (in vvhose loynes they vvere and sinned) for vvhich they are punished even vvith death it selfe.</p>

For Adams fall, as the Apostle describeth it, vvas <hi>sin, offence, transgression, disobedience, judgement</hi> (or guiltinesse) <hi>to death, and condemnation: Rom.</hi> 5.12.—19. Now all mankind fell in him, as Paul teacheth, and these enemies grant: therfore all mankind is in sin, offence, transgression, &amp;c. unto death and condemnation.<note place="margin">

               <p>Of the remedy for the sin of all (vvherof they next speake) we grant that is both for infants and old sinners, <hi>by grace in Christ.</hi> But these are two severall questions: and here we treat of sinne onely and the merit of it. Of Gods grace we haue spoken otherwhere.</p>
               <p>They proceed and say, that <hi>Infants whom Christ so often accounteth innocents, Mat.</hi> 18.3, 4, <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.14. <hi>are freed from the law, and so sin is dead in them: but when the commandement comes, then they die in sinnes and transgressions, &amp;c.

When though they be sinners, yet they are not guiltie of such sins as men lay to their charge, Exod. 23.7. 2. Sam. 3.28. Ier. 2.34. 3.

               <p>Secondly, it is another abuse of scripture that they say, weake flesh is called sinfull fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, by <hi>Flesh</hi> there Paul meaneth not the substance of flesh, for that vveakneth not the Law, nor hindereth mans salvation: it is the good creature of God, as is the soule or spirit: but hee meaneth by flesh, our corrupt sinfull state in soule and body: for he sayth in verse 8. <hi>they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</hi> If <hi>flesh</hi> meane our bodily substance, then no man living in the body can please God: not the Prophets, not the Apostles, no nor Christ himselfe, for he lived in our flesh, in our humame nature, and the Apostle should speake untruly in the ninth verse, <hi>yee are not in the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

meaneth not sin, but affliction, such Christ had: such, the Apostle tooke pleasure, 2 Cor. 12, 10, but infirmity as it meaneth sin, Christ had not: he is opposed herein to the Priests of the Law, vvhich had infirmity or vveakenesse, Heb. 7, 27, 28, and 4, 15, But David in Psal. 51, confesseth such infirmity (if they vvill haue it so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) as vvas <hi>sinne</hi> and <hi>iniquity</hi>; vvhich proveth he was a transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor from the womb, and not vvithout sin as vvas Christ. 6 Christ is said <hi>to be made sin for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5, 21, these words <hi>for us</hi> the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries baulk and omit.

               <p>Their former answer being so apparantly against the truth, that David acknowledging sinne, they vvill haue it no sinne, but weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, they devise to darken the light with an other cloud; as if David spake not of his own estate, but his mothers: <hi>and then</hi> (say they) <hi>it is the curse or punishment for sinne laid upon her, Gen.</hi> 3, 16, <hi>where the very words agree with these of Davids &amp;c. and it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Scripture to call punishment for sinne by the name of sinne,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and it is neither Davids sinne nor his mothers that hee heere confesseth, to speake properly, but his mothers punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

And that in supplicating to God for grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after, he should here insert a complaint of his mothers punishment, is without any colour of truth. But this is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and suteable to his other words, that lamenting his actuall transgressions, he bewaileth the evill fountaine whence they flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to weet, his natiue corruption, which brought forth these ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trespasses.

Secondly, Christian infants haue the graces they speak of, repentance, faith, regeneration &amp;c, though not actually, or by way of declaration to others; yet they haue through the worke of the Spirit, the seed and beginning of faith, virtually and by vvay of inclination; so that they are not wholly d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If infants naturally are some vvayes capable of Adams sinne, and so of unbeleefe, disobedience, transgression &amp;c. then Christian infants supernaturally and by grace, are some wayes capable of Christs righteousnes, and so of faith, obedience, sanctification &amp;c. But infants are capable of the former evils by Adam: therefore they are capable of the latter good things by Christ. That they are capable of the former, is before proved (vvhere vve treated of originall sin) by <hi>Rom</hi> 5, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5 1, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3, and many Scriptures. The consequence, that therefore they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the latter also, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o wit of Christian graces, is thus manifested. 1 Because the first Adam was a figure of the second Adam Christ, so that as the sinne of the first Adam, his fault, disobedience, and death for it came on all his children, both by imputation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or corruption of nature: so the righteousnesse and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Christ commeth on all his children, both by imputation and renewing of nature, unto life and salvation, as the Apostle compareth them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.15.16.17.18.19.21. 2 Because infants being by Adam sinners, children of vvrath &amp;c. must be borne againe of the spirits, or else they cannot see the Kingdom of God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3, 3.5.6. But the Christian infants dying in infancie shall see the Kingdom of God, and not be damned (as the adversaries grant) therefore by Christs doctrine they are borne again of the spirit: and so must needs in some measure haue repentance, faith, holines, vvithout which there is no regeneration. Again, that infants haue the faith and loue of God in them, and regeneration in their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is thus proved. They to vvhom God giveth the signe and seale of righteousnesse by faith, and of regeneration, they haue faith and regeneration: for God giveth no lying signe, he sealeth no vaine or false covenants.

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> They reason ignorantly and perversly, not onely against the light of Gods word, but of nature. As if some brutish person should plead thus. A man is a living creature that hath a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble soule; and the proper affections of a man as he is a man, are the facultie of understanding, of thinking, capablenesse of learning, of remembring, facultie of reasoning, of judging and discerning true and false, good and evill, of approving and improving, of willing &amp; nilling, of speaking, of numbring, &amp;c. Now let them which affirme that infants are borne men (as Christ doth in Ioh. 16.21.) proue that infants doe understand, do think, remember, judge, discerne good and evill, approue, will, speak, &amp;c. or else they say nothing. Were not such a disputer worthy to be laughed and hissed at? who requireth the actuall use and manifestation of humane affections and faculties in infants; vvhich are in them but potentially &amp; in the seed and beginning: and because th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y cannot declare these things by their workes, therefore he denieth them to be of the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mankind, or borne men into the vvorld: or that they haue the faculties of men at all in them any manner of vvay? Even such is the argumentation of these erroneous spirits against the truth of religion. For as before they reasoned against the sin, transgression, and condemnation of Infants, (contrary to Pauls doctrine in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5) because infants actually understand not the law, nor transgresse against it; and will not consider how they are sinners originally in Adam: so now also they reason against the grace of Christ in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and his work of regeneration in them; because they cannot outwardly manifest the effects of regeneration or fruits of faith, (such as the scriptures that they allege do require in older persons) &amp; wil not understand that these graces are in them through Christ and his spirit, but in the beginnings onely (as I haue formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) and are not in them as in those of full age, who by reason of use haue their sences exercised to discerne both good and evill. And here I desire to know of the Anabaptists in their next vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings about these matters; first when they thinke that children
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:187:26"/>
(vvho in their opinion are borne without a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Yea let any of them tell me (if he can) vvhen he himselfe first fell from his innocencie and became a sinner, being none before; by what act or transgression of what commandement. It is strange that an innocent man should fall from his innocencie, and not know when and how. Secondly let them say, vvhether every child so soon as it beginneth to be a sinner, hath not remedy for the sinne by Christ; and so whether it it be not capable of repentance, faith, regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. and consequently of baptisme, so soone as it is a sinner. Thirdly, seeing they insist so much on the perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ction of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the new Testament, as of the old, (which thing I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant) I desire to know whether (as God appointed the eight day for the circumcising of a child after it was borne,) Christ hath appoynted any day, moneth or yeare for a child to be baptised af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is borne. If they say none, but vvhen the child can manifest repentance and faith: then vvhat manifestation hath Christ pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, vvhether if the child say it repenteth him, &amp; he beleeveth, it is ynough, or what rules and ordinances Christ hath given, by vvhich vve may certainly know that now (and not before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) a child is to receiue baptisme, as a repentant and beleeving sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: and let them tell us at what age of their children they or any of them hath first baptised his child unto remission of si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s. These things are needfull to be known, that we may vvalke by rule; and being not yet signified (to my knowledge) in any of their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, I desire for my information, and for the better clearing of these controversies, that they vvould set down their doctrine tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching these poynts. For it is required of all parents to bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, Eph. 6.4. this they cannot doe aright, unlesse they know vvhen first they begin to sin, and consequently vvhen first they begin to beleeue. If they blame a child for sinne vvhiles it is an innocent, they commit iniquitie: if they keep a child from Christ and Christian baptisme vvhen it is a repentant &amp; beleeving sinner (which may be so soon as it is a sinner) they vvrong their child most sinfully, to condemne that vvhich Christ justifieth. These things are vvorthy of serious consideration both in respect of our childrens estate, and of our owne.</p>
               <p>And now ere I proceed further to answer their cavils, I will shew two commandements for the baptising of infants: the one given of old to our fathers, the other given by Christ.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:187:26"/>1. That vvhich vvas once commanded of God, and never by
him called back, is now still to be done; as it is vvritten, <hi>What thing
soever I command you, obserue to doe it, Deut.</hi> 12.32. But God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the outward seale of his covenant of grace to be given to
the infants of his people, as in Gen. 17.12.13. <hi>He that is eight dayes
old shall be circumcised among you, &amp;c. and my covenant shall be in your
flesh for an everlasting covenant.</hi> And this commandement touching
the substance of it, and outward sealing of the covenant, hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
by him been abrogated. Therefore it is still to bee continued,
and our infants (by vertue of that commandement) are to haue
the seale of Gods covenant.</p>
               <p>The common objection that this proofe is not from Christs te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, but from Moses writings, is of no weight.

That the covenant then made with Abraham vvas the covenant of the Gospell, which we now haue. 2 That circumcision the seale of the covenant then, and baptisme the seale of the couenant now, are one and the same in substance. The first is proved thus, Paul sayth, <hi>The Scripture fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing that God would justifie the heathen through faith, preached before the Gospell unto Abraham, In thee shall all nations be blessed, Gal.</hi> 3.8.

Gen.</hi> 17.4.5. this promise (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the faith of Christ) is applied to our state under the Gospell, Rom. 4.13.16.17. and is by Paul there opposed to the Law. Moreover the covenant vvith Abraham vvas, that the Lord vvould be a God to him and to his seed after him, Gen. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>7. this promise implieth blessednesse to him and them; for <hi>Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, Psal.</hi> 33.12. and this blessednesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth on none by the Law, Rom. 4.15. Gal. 3.10.11.12. and that he should be a God unto us, and we his people, is the summe of the Gospell, Heb. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>10 2. Cor. 6.16. Reu. 21.3. The difference between the fathers and us, is, that they had the Gospell in promise; wee haue the same Gospell in performance, Luk. 1.69.70, 72.73. &amp;c. Act. 13.32.33. &amp; 26 6. They beleeved in Christ that vvas to come; We beleeue in Christ vvho is come: Their faith and ours is one in substance, Heb. 11. Gal. 3.9. That circumcision and baptisme are also one in substance (though differing in outward signe) is thus
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:187:27"/>
manifested. Circumcision was the signe of faith and holines, Rom. 4.11. &amp; 2.29. Col. 2.11 Deut. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>16. Baptisme is the signe of faith and holinesse, Act. 8.37.38<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rom. 6.3.4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. Circumcision was the first signe and seale of entring into the covenant: Baptisme is so now. We now being buried with Christ in baptisme, are sayd to be circumcised in him, Coloss. 2.11.12. vvhich plainly manifesteth them to bee one and the same: even as their other sacramentall signes, are sayd to be the same that we now haue, in respect of the things signified, 1. Cor. 10.1.2.3.4. 1 Cor. 5.7.8. Forasmuch then as the covenant vvith Abraha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and with us, and the seale of the covenant then and now, are one in substance: it followeth, that the commandement then to giue infants the seale of the covenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never repealed, bindeth us to giue them the seale of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant at this day. The exceptions vvhich the adversaries make of the difference between circumcision and baptisme, shall be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after in their place.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The second commandement for baptising of infants, is in
Mark. 16.15. <hi>Goe preach the Gospell to every creature; he that beleeveth
and is baptised, shall be saved. Math.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go teach all nations, baptising
them, &amp;c.</hi> In this commission of Christ are two things, the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Gospell to every creature, to all nations; and the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the same by baptisme. The Gospell belonged to infants, &amp;
they are necessarily implied in the first: therefore baptisme belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to infants, and they are as necessarily implied in the later.
Christ biddeth them proclaime or preach the <hi>Gospell</hi>: but vvhat
the <hi>Gospell</hi> is, is not here declared, we must gather it from other
scriptures. The <hi>Gospel</hi> (or <hi>Evangelie</hi>) is the glad tidings or joyfull
declaration that the promise vvhich vvas made unto the Fathers,
God hath fulfillled the same unto us their children: the promise,
(I say) concerning Christ, and the redemption of the vvorld by
him, as these scriptures teach, Act. 13.32.33. Luk. 1.54.55.69.70.71.72.73.
&amp;c. Act. 2.38.39. &amp; 26.22.23. Luk. 4.18 — 21. So the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
(which is the good tidings of the fulfilling of the promise) is as
large as the promise vvas: vvhereupon, not in the forementioned
scriptures onely, but in many other places, the Apostles referre the
Gospell to the promise (or promises) made of old, as, <hi>It is of faith,
that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the
seed: Rom.</hi> 4.16. and <hi>Now we, brethren, as Isaak was, are the children of
promise, Gal.</hi> 4.28. and, <hi>Christ was a minister of the circumcision, for the
truth of God, to confirme the promises (made) unto the fathers: and that
the Gentiles might glorifie God for mercie, Rom.</hi> 15.8.9. and, <hi>That the
promise by faith of Iesus Christ, might bee given to them that beleeve,
Gal.</hi> 3.22. and, <hi>Paul an Apostle, &amp;c. according to the promise of life,
which is in Christ Iesus,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.1. and many the like. Not in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:187:27"/>
onely, but the particular promises at severall times, are she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
to be accomplished in the Gospell; as the promise to Adam,
Rom. 16 20. from Gen. 3.15. to Abraham, Luk. 1.55.73. Rom. 4.16.17.18.
to David, Luk. 1.69.70. Act. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>30 31. to Israel by Moses,
Samuel, and other Prophets, Act. 3.22.24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>25 Luk. 1.70. so that all
the promises of God are yea and Amen in Christ, 2. Cor. 1.20.
And for the poynt in controversie, the promise of grace and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Abraham and to his seed, Gen. 17.7. is by the Gpspell she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
to be confirmed, Luk. 1.55. Act. 2.38<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>39. Gal. 3.14.16.29. But
the promise to Abrahams seed implied his infants, Gen. 17, 7, 10, 12,
therefore the Gospell (vvhich is the complement of that promise)
implieth our infants: and so the Apostle sayth, <hi>the promise is to you
and to your children,</hi> Act. 2.39. And the signe and seale of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
vvas giuen to Abrahams children in infancie, Gen. 17, 10, 12.
therfore it belongeth to our children in their infancie: and we are
sayd to be the children of promise as Isaak was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gal. 4.28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But Isaak
was the child of promise in his infancie, and had then the seale of
the promise in his infancie, when he was but eight dayes old, Act,
7, 8, wherefore we also in our infancie are children of the promise,
and haue right to the seale of the covenant even then, or else wee
are not as Isaak was. And thus Christ commanding the Gospell to
be preached, commanded the fulfilling of the promises to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
even all and every one of the promises, without excepting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
and so commanded the promise of grace, and accomplishment
of it to the seed of the faithfull even in their infancie to bee prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.
Likewise commanding the seale of the covenant to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
unto all vvithin the promise, as freely and generally now as
ever it was of old, not excepting infants: he commanded infants to
be sealed by baptisme, as they were sealed before by circumcision.
And seeing all beleevers are by his commission to be baptised: the
infants of the Church being beleevers (in respect of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of faith, though not actually) as I haue formerly proved, they
are also to be baptised by vertue of Christs commission, Mark. 16.
Math. 28. that so the promises unto the fathers may be confirmed,
and the Gentiles (as well as the circumcision, that is, the Iewes)
may glorifie God for his mercie, Rom. 15.8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>9.</p>
               <p>Now I will proceed to answer their exceptions; beginning first vvith this about circumcision, and the covenant with Abraham.</p>

                  </gap>rue that it is an invisible seale in the heart; vvhereas Paul speaketh of an outward visible seale, which is also a signe, and on the body. Again, the covenant may haue more seales then one: so that if the Spirit were an outward seale, yet might circumcision be a seale also of the same thing. Moses cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:187:29"/>
circumcision a <hi>signe</hi> or <hi>token,</hi> Gen. 17.11, but he no where cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it a <hi>seale</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet Paul calleth it a seale, because in truth it was so, and more then a bare signe. For a signe is to make some other thing knowne unto us, as the doole-stone or land mark is for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of grounds: or it is further to put us in minde of things formerly done, as the stones at Gilgall vvere for a memoriall to Israell how their Fathers passed through Iordan, Ioshu. 4.20.21.22. But a seale goeth yet further, and certifieth or assureth of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny promise or gift. Now because circumcision was such a signe as assured unto Abraham his righteousnesse by faith in Christ the promised seed: therefore the Apostle rightly calleth it a seale. Vpon which ground vve also rightly call the Passover, Baptisme, and our Lords Supper <hi>Seales,</hi> because they are such signes as certifie and assure us of forgivenesse of sins, and of righteousnesse and salvation by Christ. And from this we haue a most certaine ground for the baptisme of infants: because baptisme is no more now, then circumcision vvas of old, namely a signe and seale of righteousnesse by faith. And if infants had such a seale under the promise of the Gospell: how should it with any colour be denied now under the performance of that promise? unlesse we will say, Christ hath not confirmed the promises made unto the fathers, contrary to Rom. 15.8. 2 Cor. 1.20.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> In this their plea, there is a little truth, but much errour and delusion. It is true, there were but two Covenants, the Law and the Gospell. There is sophistry and delusion in their saying the covenant of the law was with the children of Abraham <hi>after the flesh</hi>: for as <hi>after the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sh, Iohn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. vers. 5.6. in this sense it is true, that the children of the flesh are not the children of God, Rom. 9.8. and they are under the Law, not under the Gospell. But this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:187:29"/>
against the truth we maintaine. For Isaak who was Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams seed after the flesh in the first sense, but after the Spirit, and by promise in the second sense, hee was circumcised in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie, Now all the Christian Church are as Isaak, children of the promise, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.28, and our infants though by nature (as it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted) they be children of wrath, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2, yet by promise and grace in Christ, they are children of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, and therefore are to haue the seale of the covenant of grace in infancie, as Isaak had; even as by Abrahams justification, the Apostle proveth the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of us all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3.22.23.24.</p>
               <p>Errour it is that they say, <hi>Abrahams children had circumcision in the flesh for a signe of the old covenant or Law</hi> For first, the Law was given by Moses, <hi>Iob</hi> 1.7. many yeares after Abraham, and could not disanull the covenant with Abraham, or make the promise of none effect, as the Apostle plainly teacheth us <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. Christ also sayth, <hi>Circumcision was not of Moses, but of the fathers, Iob.</hi> 7.22. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the covenant which circumcision sealed, was that the Lord would be a God to Abraham and his seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7.10, this was the covenant of the Gospell, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8 10, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2 1.3. Thirdly, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision was the seale of righteousnesse of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4 11, but the Law is not of faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11.12, therefore circumcision was a seale of the Gospell promised, a seale of the covenant of grace.</p>

In <hi>Exod.</hi> 24, 7, 8, the covenant is made up and dedicated. And that this was that first and old covenant which should be abolished, as Ieremy foretold, the Apostle doth plainly manifest.

This being briefly and obscurely told by Moses, God after inlargeth by Asaph another Prophet, vvho sheweth the manner of it; how not onely the vvaters of the sea saw the Lord, vvhen they fled and parted; but the clouds also (from aboue) poured out vvater vvhen they rained; the skies sent out a sound by thunder, &amp;c. thus the ground being softned vvith the raine, occasioned the charret vvheeles of the Aegyptians (sticking in the mire) to fall off, and hindred their pursuit:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Psa.</hi> 77.16.17, &amp;c. After this the Apostle (taught by Gods spirit) mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festeth the mystery which before was kept secret; namely how this passage under the cloud (which rained) and through the sea was a baptism to the Israelits:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1.2. <hi>&amp;<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mark.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.33.</note> even as Christian mens washings in rivers or vessels, was a baptisme to them. And as the manna which Israel ate, and vvater from the rock which they drank, vvas the same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall meat and drink which we haue signified by bread and wine in our Lords supper; so their vvashing in the cloud &amp; sea, and our vvashing in vessels or rivers, is spiritually the same baptisme. From hence we gather the baptising of our infants by two arguments: 1 <hi>All our fathers</hi> (saith Paul) <hi>were baptised in the cloud and sea</hi>: therfore (say we) infants: for seeing there vvas no other baptisme but that in the cloud and sea, such of our fathers as then vvere infants vvere at that time baptised, or else many of our fathers (even al the infants of many thousand families) vvere never baptised: vvhich is contrary to the Apostles doctrine. And if infants had baptisme un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Moses, it cannot (vvith any colour of reason) bee denied them under Christ. 2. In that the Apostle teacheth us, that the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and temporary sacraments (or seales of salvation) vvhich Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael had, vvere the substance and truth vvhich wee now haue, though Moses doth not so express: it followeth upon like ground, that their ordinary seales, namely Circumcision and the Passouer, vvere the same in truth and substance vvith baptism and the Lords Supper vvhich vve now haue. And being the same, as infants had circumcision then, so they are to haue baptisme now.</p>
               <p>Secondly, vvheras they say that of Moses was called baptisme by comparison, as if it were not properly baptisme; they swerue from the right way: it was as truely and properly baptisme to them, as ours is to us, though the manner of administration differ: even as their Manna and vvater vvere as truly and properly the sacrament of Christs body and blood to them, as bread and wine in the Lords supper are to us. Otherwise the Apostle should not say truly, that hey vvere <hi>the same.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3.4.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:187:34"/>Thirdly, Noes ark is not called <hi>the figure of baptisme,</hi> as these corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of scripture tell us: but baptisme (sayth the Apostle) is a like-figure (or antitype) 1 Pet. 3.21. So that the saving by water of eight men in the Ark, was a type or figure: and the saving of a few now by vvater in baptisme, is an antitype, or like figure: both of them figuring salvation by the death of Christ. Fourthly, neither do these men set down the reason fully and rightly, why they are sayd to be baptised, namely, <hi>because the cloud and sea was their safetie as Noes ark was</hi>; for though it may in some sense bee granted that these were th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y were sayd to be baptised in the cloud and sea, because they were in them sacramentally wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their sins, &amp; planted together in the likenesse of his death, buriall, and resurrection, as we are now by baptisme, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3.4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>5. The cloud served them for three users, 1. to protect and keep them safe, <hi>Esai.</hi> 4.5.6. 2 to guide them in the way that they should go, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.17. <hi>&amp;c. Exod.</hi> 13.21. and these two were ordinary, 3. to baptise them by powring down water, and this was extraordinary, and but one time in the red sea, for ought we finde. And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect Paul sayth they were baptised in it. Fiftly, their last speech of <hi>inioyning infants to suffer persecution,</hi> as well as to baptise them, is spoken vvith a wry mouth: for as vve enjoyne not infants to bee baptised, though we baptise them; so can we not enioyne them to suffer persecution. But this we say and know, as infants are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised into Christ, so oftentimes they suffer persecution for Christ: being with their parents afflicted, imprisoned, banished, &amp;c. yea and bereaved of life it selfe, so that they haue even the baptisme of blood or martyrdome also.</p>
               <p>Wheras we find mention of whole housholds to haue been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised by the Apostles; from which example it is probably gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that infants also were baptized. Against this they dispute thus,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 143.</note> 1. <hi>There are many housholds in which there are no infants.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is true: and it is also true that in many there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. Therefore this argument is propounded but as probable, not as certaine.</p>
               <p n="2">2 They say, <hi>It is most sure as the Apostles practised in one houshold,
so they practised in all. But in the Iaylors house they baptised such as they

most plaine that infants cannot heare nor beleeue, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is not most sure, but altogether unlikely, as themselves, I think,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.13 14.</note> will acknowledge. For there is no likelihood that all hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds to whom the Apostles preached, did beleeue every one in them,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.13.16.</note> though some did. And they grant that none but beleevers were baptised. So then if the goodman of the house, and the men
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:187:34"/>
onely beleeved, there none but men were baptised: if women one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeved, they onely were baptised. Therfore the Apostles pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise was not alwayes alike in respect of the persons that they bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised. So for infants, such houses as had none, wee easily grant that no infants vvere there baptised. But such as had infants, their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents beleeving, we hold that their infants vvere baptized; for there is no exception of infants at all in any place of the Apostles Acts. The barre vvhich they put, that infants <hi>cannot heare nor beleeue,</hi> is soone removed. We know infants can heare, though not vvith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding: we know also (and haue proved before) that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, though not actually or professantly. And this faith begun in them in their regeneration, is a sufficient ground vvhy infants should be baptised, as I haue formerly manifested.</p>

                  <hi>Ans</hi> They speak like children in understanding. 1. The people brought yong children properly unto Christ, not men converted &amp; become like children: Mark. 10.13.

               <p>Now vvhereas Christ <hi>blessed</hi> the children; they tell us, <hi>he baptised them not,</hi> vvhich we grant: but if they vvhich were by nature chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath and curse, were now by grace made children of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in Christ; then were they in deed of the kingdom of God, and such as might receiue baptisme the signe and seale of blessednes.</p>
