            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>A Parson of a Countrey Village (for the encrease of Towne Calves) kept a lusty <hi>Bull,</hi> which serv'd for the use of the whole Parish; which <hi>Bull,</hi> was fallen so poor and leane, that his bones might have been almost told as they were ready to start out of his skin, and the cold Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being come, the miserable Parson put the <hi>Bull</hi> to graze on the bare ground in in the Churchyard, (for there was little or no Grasse) and there was also a Horse of the Parsons as leane as the <hi>Bull,</hi> which fed (or fasted) in the said Churchyard. These poore Beasts being almost starved with hunger and cold, and the hardnesse of their Masters heart, it fortuned that in a very darkenight, there arose a very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Tempest of wind and raine, so that the <hi>Bull</hi> for succour and shelter from the weather, went into the Church porch, and there lay downe and dyed with cold and
<pb facs="tcp:20966:12"/>
famine. The Horse likewise (having the like purpose to get out of the storme) went to the Church-porch, and by reason it was so darke, he stumbled over the dead <hi>Bull,</hi> and ran his head against the Church doore, which was so old and broken that with the force of the Horses fall, it flew o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and let the Horse into the Church, who recovering his legs, and walking up and downe, musing where he was, at the last he came to the Bell Ropes, which the Countrey people that used to Ring, had (for the ease of their hands) made wispes, or wads of Hay fast round about the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fasts or handles of the Ropes; the which Hay, the Horse smelling out, he being hungry, laid lippes to, and pull'd so hard at the Hay, that the Rope gave warning to the Bell, and the Bell to the Clapper, that it Rang now and then a stroake or twain, which the Parson hearing, he marvelled much what the matter should be, or who should jangle the Bels so confusedly at that time of the night, in the meane space
<pb facs="tcp:20966:13"/>
the Horse goes from Rope to Rope, (as he could find them in the darke) which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed every Bell to toll in an untuned Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pason: At last the Parson arose, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up the Clerke, and some neighbours, and lighted their Lanthornes (which were the lighter and the heavier for their Candles) so they came amazedly and fearefully to the Churchyard, and there they found the <hi>Bull</hi> dead in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porch, and the Horse in the Bell-frey ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Knell.

                     <l>Whilst showts, and Mastives mouthes do fill the sky</l>
                     <l>That sure <hi>Acteon</hi> ne're had such a cry.</l>
                     <l>Thus <hi>Beares</hi> do please the hearing and the sight,</l>
                     <l>And sure their sent will any man invite:</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>For whosoer'e spends most, shall finde this fauour,</hi>

                     </l>
                     <l>And as a Common-wealth, (oft by Ill-willers;)</l>
                     <l>Is vex'd by prowling knaves, and Caterpillars,</l>
                     <l>So is a <hi>Beare</hi> (which is a quiet Beast)</l>
                     <l>By Curres and Mungrels, oftentimes opprest.</l>
                     <l>And tyde to what he doth hee's bound to see,</l>
                     <l>The best and worst of all their cruelty.</l>
                     <l>And for mens monies, what shift ere they make for't,</l>
                     <l>What ere is laid or paid, the <hi>Beare's</hi> at stake for't.</l>
                     <l>Though he be hardly drawne to't, 'gainst his will,</l>
                     <l>Hee's bound to see and beare, and bide much ill;</l>
                     <l>Besides the baiting of a <hi>Beare</hi> is rare,</l>
                     <l>Unlike the baiting of a Horse or Mare:</l>
                     <l>The Horse hath Provender, and Hey for Bait,</l>
                     <l>And doth in peace and quiet eate his meat;</l>
                     <l>When as the <hi>Beare,</hi> is Tugg'd, Lugg'd, Bit &amp; Beaten</l>
                     <l>And eates no Bait, but likely to be Eaten.</l>
                     <l>A <hi>Beare</hi> is like a Watchman by his coat,</l>
                     <l>He weares a Rugge-Gowne alwayes (if you note,)</l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:20966:29"/>
                     <l>And (like a Watchman) oft a <hi>Beare</hi> will be</l>
                     <l>As mannerly, and watch as well as he.</l>
                     <l>And as a grumbling Officer may weare</l>

                     <l>And for his Furre it is such ex'lent stuffe,</l>
                     <l>That Many a Lady weares it in a Muffe;</l>

                     <l>Their formes, their admirable sparing feeding:</l>

                     <l>Ile give one short touch more and make an end.</l>
                     <l>Then for the further honour of the Beares,</l>
                     <l>They (with the stars) are mounted in their Sphears:</l>
                     <l>There <hi>Vrsa Major</hi> in the firmament,</l>
                     <l>Is stellifide, a glorious ornament,</l>

                     <l>Ile write of baiting of the Bulls and Beares.</l>
                     <l>It is a Game so ancient, that I wot</l>
                     <l>Records can scarce shew when we usde it not.</l>
                     <l>Except now, in these sad infectious times,</l>
                     <l>That heav'ns just hand doth plague us for our crimes,</l>
                     <l>The Game is by authority supprest:</l>
                     <l>And Beares, and Bulls, and Dogs, have too much rest,</l>
                     <l>Through want of baiting growne to such a straine,</l>
                     <l>(Hard to be tam'd, or brought in frame againe)</l>
                     <l>Almost all mad for want of exercise,</l>
                     <l>Filling the Aire with roaring and with cries,</l>
                     <l>That those who neer the Bear-Garden are dwelling</l>
                     <l>Do heare such bellowing bawling, yawling, yelling,</l>
                     <l>As if <hi>Hell</hi> were broake loose, or (truth to speake)</l>
                     <l>The Devils at foot-ball were or <hi>Barley-breake.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>There's three couragious <hi>Bulls,</hi> as ever plaid,</l>
                     <l>Twenty good Beares, as er'e to stake was taid,</l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:20966:30"/>
                     <l>And seventy Mastives of such Breed and Races,</l>
                     <l>That from fierce Lions will not turne their faces;</l>
                     <l>A male and female Ape (kind Jacke and Jugge)</l>
                     <l>Who with sweet complement do kisse and hugge,</l>
                     <l>And lastly there is Jacke an Apes his Horse,</l>
                     <l>A Beast of fiery fortitude and force.</l>
                     <l>As for the Game I boldly dare relate,</l>
                     <l>'Tis not for Boyes, or fooles effeminate,</l>
                     <l>For whoso'ere comes thither, most and least,</l>
                     <l>May see and learne some courage from a Beast:</l>
                     <l>And 'tis not only a base Rabble Crew,</l>
                     <l>That thither comes, It may be proved true,</l>
                     <l>That to the <hi>Beare-Garden</hi> comes now and than,</l>
                     <l>Some Gamesters worth ten thousand pounds a man.</l>
                     <l>For rough behaviour that's no great disgrace,</l>
                     <l>There's more hors-play us'd at each deere hors-race,</l>
                     <l>More heads, or legs, or necks, are broake each day,</l>
                     <l>At Cards, Dice, Tables, Bowles, or foot-ball-play.</l>
                     <l>The Game hath been maintain'd, and will, we hope</l>
                     <l>Be so againe (now favour gives it scope)</l>
