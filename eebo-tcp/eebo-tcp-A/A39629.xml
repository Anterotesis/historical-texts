            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Five QUESTIONS PROPOUNDED To the <hi>People of England.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. IF the preſent King came for the good of England, and not for his <hi>own ends</hi> at the Nations Coſt; Why then did he not embrace and improve the happy occaſion of <hi>King James</hi>'s voluntary return from <hi>Feverſham,</hi> ſince it is plain, he could have no other thing in his Eye, by his coming and meſſage to <hi>King William,</hi> and Invitation of him to St <hi>James's,</hi> then an <hi>Accomodation,</hi> for he put himſelf thereby into <hi>King William's</hi> hands and had hardly any other uſe of his own then to ſign a National Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether ſince that very time the Hand <hi>of God</hi> has not eminently ſhown it ſelf againſt <hi>King William</hi> for that unnatural Ambitious, and deſtructive refuſal, and treatement of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, firſt by the <hi>perplextity</hi> that fell immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon him about the very thing he deſired, viz. the <hi>Crown,</hi> witneſs the hot conteſt in the Convention, and with what <hi>Cloſſetting Threats, Bribes, Promiſes,</hi> &amp;c. he carried it, and with that ſmall advantage of Votes above his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, that any Law would ſtand looſely that had no better concurance at its making; In the next place, by the <hi>Baffles</hi> upon his Forces by Sea and Land by the hand of Man, and by the viſible ſevere Hand of God, inſomuch that no time or age, theſe ſix Hundred Years, can par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel ſuch a Years loſs of <hi>Men, Treaſure</hi> and <hi>Shipping,</hi> as this poor Kingdom has ſuſtained ſince the coming of this preſent King. Laſtly, the many <hi>factions</hi> and great <hi>inſtability</hi> of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, ſuch as God is accuſtomed to bring upon thoſe that deviſe miſchief, or ſeek themſelves, or abuſe the providences of God?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether yet it be too late to <hi>retrive</hi> this matter, and recover this bleeding Nation, in caſe <hi>King William</hi> and <hi>Queen Mary</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their natural and Chriſtian Duty to their Father, and incline to forgo their preſent <hi>untimely</hi> and <hi>perplexed Dignity</hi>; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a good agreement may not be made for our Religion, Laws and Liberties, without more <hi>Blood, Treaſure</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi>?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether if <hi>King William</hi> and <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> will not do this, the <hi>People</hi> for their own ſakes, ought not to think of the next beſt expedient, to compel them to it, as by <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing</hi> them for their Fathers return, and by <hi>Refuſing their Purſes</hi> in the maintenance of their unjuſt quarrel againſt him, and perticularly, by oppreſſing <hi>forreign Mercinary</hi> Forces, that are half of them of that very Religion their Lawful King is expelled for profeſſing, and which are all of them brought in without <hi>Advice or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Parliament,</hi> &amp; a Parliament then ſetting: A thing without preſident for above a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years, and what was never done by the greateſt and moſt arbitrary of our lawful and undoubted Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and never attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but by <hi>Vortigern,</hi> the laſt Britiſh King, who to uphold his uſurpation of the Crown, called in the <hi>Saxons,</hi> by which the Kingdom became a Conqueſt to that People?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whether if the <hi>People</hi> of England ſhall ſuffer themſelves to be ſo far impoſed upon, that againſt the Eminent Hand of God and their own Intreſt, they will perſevere in the upholding the title of <hi>King William</hi> and <hi>Queen Mnry for that is the quarrel,</hi> and ſo it is, muſt and will be ſtated, all other things being by <hi>King James</hi> already granted in his <hi>ſoft and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Letter</hi> to the Convention, this time twelve Month, which they would not vouchſafe to read, but has often been made publick, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>correction of paſt Errors, the oblivion of our preſent Faults,</hi> the <hi>Eſtabliſhment of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion,</hi> by ſecureing the Church of England in her Rights, and the Diſſenters in their Liberty, deſiring no more for his own Friends <hi>then in their own Houſes,</hi> and refering the whole to a free Parliament?</p>
            <p>Whether I ſay the <hi>Blood, Miſery</hi> and <hi>Deſtruction</hi> that ſhall follow an obſtinate oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to a lawful King, offering theſe <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Gracious Terms,</hi> will not lye at our doors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and Men, and ſo make it Juſt in him, to acquire his Kingdoms at any price, and rule them, if he Succeed, how he pleaſeth?</p>
