            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> Chriſtian and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Frenchman, neuer
was there offered bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
meanes then at this
time to diſcouer and
ſmel out the ſubtelties
of our enemies, &amp; with
what money Sathan vſually paieth his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſee ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo blinded,
that beeing vppon the poynt of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
they promiſe to themſelues all
aſſuraunce, ſtill coueting to conceale their
abhominable wickedneſſe, with ſleights,
ſhiftes and lyes. Neuertheleſſe, when they
do moſt hide themſelues they are fooneſt
ſpied. For, to ſay the trueth, what goodlier
or more apparant prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce could the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbers
of the quiet of our Fraunce take
holde of, then Religion and the reliefe of
the people: but as the enemie of trueth
hath allured the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him by lyes, ſo hath
<pb facs="tcp:8630:3"/>
hee for their repaſte left them no other
foode vpon his Table, and yet doth that
alſo faile them, when they make it an vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
meſſe, and trueth remaineth Miſtreſſe.
According hereto, the lyes and horrible
ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, that to this day haue bene ſpued
foorth againſt the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> &amp; the
Lord Prince of <hi>Condie,</hi> by certaine ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
enemies to this Crowne &amp; the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Progenie, vnder the pretence of zeale
of Religion doth ouerthrowe them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually they haue ſought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
our ſouraigne Lord the King and
all the French Nation, that theſe Princes
were his euill ſeruaunts, Rebels, and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
perſons, enemies to his Eſtate, in
the preſeruation and encreaſe whereof,
they haue greater intereſt then any other
worldly perſon next vnto his Maieſtie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom they haue the honor very nerely
to appertaine. As alſo in truth, we are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
to giue GOD thankes, eſpecially, in
that after ſo many falſe and ſlaunderous
inductions made vnto the moſt Chriſtian
Maieſtie againſt theſe two Princes, his
good kinſmen and moſt faithfull ſubiects
and ſeruants (by whoſe reliefe this feeble,
weake and pale Realme hath oftentimes
<pb facs="tcp:8630:3"/>
eſcaped falling) it hath pleaſed him to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the Kings eyes, &amp; to let him perceiue
that all the illuſions vnto him preſented,
tended only to the ouerthrow of himſelf,
his Crowne and Eſtate, in offering hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
to his viewe one thing in liewe of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For herevpon his Maieſtie ſmelling
out the cauſes of paſſed miſchiefe, hath fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
in earneſt done as the good Phiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſeeth his Patient pale, weake,
faint, and grieuouſly ſicke, beginneth his

him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all painfull toyle, &amp; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
him to take ſome reſt: euen ſo our
King, caſting his eyes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his poore realm
afflicted with ciuill warres which ſo long
haue bene kindled vnder a falſe and ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
pretence, to the end to begin the
cure, hath firſt ſought to ſet it in peace,
that after ſome time of reſt he might haue
better opportunitie to heale the reſt of
the cauſes of the diſeaſe, &amp; to put from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him thoſe who vnder his authoritie
had by their falſe &amp; wicked perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſo
hardly entreated it. Which when his euill
Councellors perceiued, &amp; ſeeing that they
could no longer goe forward in the ſame
path, they haue ſought with open play to
<pb facs="tcp:8630:4"/>
compaſſe that which ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g they had craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
practiſed, &amp; now haue plainly ſhewed
that it was the State &amp; Crowne that they
leueled at, procuring the writing of diuers
Libels aduices and conſultations of their
ſuffraga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to the end not only to diminiſh
and blemiſh the King of <hi>Nauarres</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
&amp; lawfull ſucceſsion, if it ſhould
pleaſe God to worke his will of the Kings
Maieſtie without leauing any iſſue Male,
but alſo to aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce their own falſe, ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
and ſuppoſed titles and prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces.
Howbeit, although the ſaid Lord King of
<hi>Nauarre</hi> neede not yet to pleade his cauſe
or preſently to aunſwere all theſe ſleights
and counſailes of the wicked, in reſpect of
the ſufficient terme &amp; ſmall likelihood of
occaſion euer to put the ſame in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering the King is (tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks be to God)
yong, in health, &amp; in good diſpoſition, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the ſmall intereſt that in my
opinion the ſayd Lord King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi>
pretendeth to any ſuch ſucceſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as being
a Prince both wiſe &amp; circumſpect, &amp; ſuch
a one as hath not ſo ſmal forecaſt but that
he knoweth vndoubtedly, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
wealth, reliefe, good hap &amp; contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that may redound to him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in
<pb facs="tcp:8630:4"/>
the proſperitie, health, &amp; long and happie
life of the King his Lord, to the ende per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
to be vnder him the ſame that he
is, to liue vnder his liking &amp; in his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
wherby &amp; vnder the fauour wherof
he ſhalbe not only preſerued from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiraties
which his enemies worke againſt
him, but alſo, which is more, if it pleaſe
God to encreaſe him, he ſhal alwaies be by
the King fauoured &amp; aduanced, vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he hath the honor to be the firſt Prince of
his bloud. Neuertheleſſe, how euer it be, I
do not thinke that any man at this day ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
with reaſon and iudgement conceiue any
bad or ſiniſter opinion of the ſayde Lorde
King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> though he lay open his
iuſt cauſes, ſith thoſe that haue no right,
and for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there can be no likelihood at
all, are ſo impudent, raſh, &amp; vndiſcreete, as
to bring to the barre a matter wherevpon
euen their moſt affectionate ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts durſt
not before haue thought: which to ſaye
the trueth, is one of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that
moued me to ſet hand to the pen, to the

am and all my life time haue bene a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
and liued vnder the authoritie of
the Apoſtolicke Romiſh Church: But the
onely cauſe hath bene that being borne a
Frenchman, I haue thought it my duetie
to vphold the rightful cauſe of the French
Princes, vnto whome, after his ſoueraigne
Maieſtie, &amp; for whoſe ſeruice, we are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
bounde and holden to procure all
honor, wealth, &amp; proſperitie, to maintain

euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may perceiue that theſe Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are kindled to the vtter ruine, loſſe &amp;
fubuertion of this miſerable Realm, ſo as

and that compaſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that I take in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
my fellow Citizens and my ſelf with
them in daunger to conſume our ſelues in
that fire that by thoſe ciuill warres, which
vnder this curſed and deteſtable pretence
are like to bee kindled, will ſeaze vpon al
<pb facs="tcp:8630:5"/>
degrees, haue beene to mee as a ſpurre to
haſten my penne to aunſwere theſe dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

            <p>I doe therefore moſt humbly deſire the

Of this Earle of Louain ſprunge that houſe
of Lorraine which yet continueth: for vnto
him ſucceeded Thierry, to Thierry, Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bault:
after Thibault, a certaine Matthewe
was Duke, and ſo ſucceſſiuely vnto the ſayde
Lady Iſabell wife to Rene of Aniew, as is
aforeſayd. So as it is an abuſe and manifeſt
deceit to ſearch the race of Charlemaigne in
the houſe of Lorraine, ſith it is 580. yeeres
ſince it vaniſhed and was quite loſt, euen after
that fower ſundry Famelies haue ſucceeded
one after another in the ſayd Dutchy of Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain.
One of the yongeſt of which houſe, who
was Graundfather to the Dukes of Guiſe,
and Maine now being, drawing into France
with very ſmal wealth, receiued (as alſo after
him his Children) ſo many benefites at the
hands of the Kings, Francis the firſt, Henry
<pb facs="tcp:8630:13"/>
the ſecond, and his poſteritie, that they haue
through the liberalitie of their Maieſties, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
their Patrimonie to a Million of
Frankes of Rent that they houlde in this
Realme, whereas their grandfather Claude
when he maried Lady Antoynet Bourbon,
daughter to the Duke of Vendoſme, had not
aboue 14. or 1500. beſides they haue bene ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored
with the greateſt offices of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Crowne,
as the office of great Maſter, which was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
to be in the houſe of Montmorencie, and other
of the moſt honorable: So as it might be hard
to thinke that nowe they would imitate the
Moyle, whoſe nature is to kicke and ſpurne
at his Mother when hee hath ſucked enough
of her Milke: either that they had ſo vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a minde, as to take weapon againſt the
Royall Famely whereunto they are indebted
in whatſoeuer they are, yea, and that vnder a

from Charlemagne, which is contrarie to all
trueth.</p>
               <p>4 To verefie therefore that the Princes of
Lorraine neuer came out of the houſe of
Fraunce, it will be ſufficient to ſhewe that in
the ſucceſſion of the Dutchy of Lorraine they
obſerue not the Salicke lawe, as it was iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the Fathers aſſembled at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile

of Charles of Lorraine againſt her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
Antony of Lorraine the ſonne of Ferry
the yonger ſonne of Charles. Hereby it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
appeareth that thus they declare the
Princes of Lorraine to bee no Frenchmen,
neither euer to haue bene of the bloud royall
of Fraunce or capable of the Crowne: for the
which and in the ſoueraigne ſucceſſion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the Salicke lawe hath of olde time euen
ſince Pharamond bene religiouſly obſerued:
and thereby not onely the daughters but the
males of them proceeding haue bene exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the Realme of Fraunce, according

The ſtreates were paued with Flowers accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

triumphant Furniture that could at that tyme
be found. To bee briefe ſaith the Historie, the

Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who were accuſtomed to preſcribe

mirth: eſpecially at Paris y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> townes
men marched in great troupes to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
each other for the welcomming of this
King, whom they termed the Bulwarke and
preſeruer of the beſt of their lawes. Theſe
good fathers were no baſterdly French, as
are thoſe of our curſed world, and would haue
kept themſelues farre from informing, much
leſſe from begging thoſe meanes that might
bee imagined for the breach of this goodly
Salicke lawe, which is the onely Oracle of
France, and true rampier of the French dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie:
which alſo, ſith it is euident that the
Princes of Lorrain haue not vſed, it is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
demonſtration that they are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
of the race of our Princes, who haue
ſo highly commended it in their Empier and
ſoueraigne gouernement.</p>
               <p>5 In deed our deceiuers ſince conſidering
that this foundation was too raſhly propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and might breede hatred in the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Princes of Lorraine, whome they
<pb facs="tcp:8630:15"/>
would bring into this bad action, becauſe his
Maieſtie beeing iuſtly agrieued, hath power

ſuch writings as guiltie of treazon, haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
this meane and flatly diſaduowed the
miſerable wretches who for the publiſhing of
theſe vntrueths had hazarded their liues. But
returning into the path of their firſt entent
ſince the death of Mounſier the Kings onely
Brother, they haue perſwaded themſelues
that his Maieſtie may one day happen to dye
without iſſue. But howſoeuer it be, prouiding
long before for their affayres, they haue coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
and ſought to winne one of the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the blood diſcended of the houſe of
Bourbon, the true and onely Heyre of the
Crowne, if it ſhould pleaſe God ſo farre to
puniſh vs as to depriue vs of our good King
without iſſue male: and haue gone about to
perſwade this Prince that it is he who ought
to be the lawfull ſucceſſor, and therefore that
he had neede preſently and alreadie to cauſe
the ſame openly and with effectual and ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
reaſons to be publiſhed.</p>
               <p>6 Wherein both the one and the other doe
highly offend the Kings owne perſon, in that
in his life tyme they diſpute of ſucceſſion,
(which if it might pleaſe God to ſende him a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8630:15"/>
ſonne to enioye it, ſhall neuer fall to them) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that thus thei ſeme to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpire his death:
which in effect is as much as to league them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
againſt nature, againſt good maners,
againſt Chriſtian pietie, &amp; againſt that good
will which we owe to our King, vnto whome
we are bound to pray for good, wiſh for good,
and prognoſticate good, and therfore to waite
for ſuch his hap and miſfortune is repugnant
to all lawes ciuill and naturall. Neither can
good men like, that againſt the Kings will
and during his life men ſhould argue or call
into queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the doubt of his ſucceſſion, which
is nothing ſo long as it ſhall pleaſe God to
leaue him in the world. Vpon this cauſe did
the fifth Counſaile of Toledo in Spayne
which was holden during the Popedome of
Honorius the firſt,<note place="margin">Concil. vol. 2. cap. 4. fol. 739.</note> about the yeere 622. in the
tyme of Heraclius the Emperour and Chin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillus

all ſuch as do enquire or ſeeme to haue
any care or doe ſeeke to vnderſtande who ſhal
be their King after him that hath the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<hi>Becauſe then</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>it is repugnant
to pietie and daungerous to man to thinke vpon
vnlawfull matters to come, or to enforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
of the accidents of Princes, or in respect
thereof to prouide for the time to come: for it is
<pb facs="tcp:8630:16"/>
written. It is not for you to knowe the ſeazons
and tymes which the Lorde hath reſerued to
himſelfe: wee doe by this decree ordeyne, that if
there be any informer of ſuch matters, and who
during the Kings life respecteth any other in
hope of the Realme, or that allureth any vnto
him in that reſpect, that the ſame be by ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of excommunication baniſhed the companie of
the Catholickes.</hi> The ſame decree was reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
in the ſixt Counſaile holden in the ſayd
Towne of Toledo, whereto was added a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
conuenient reaſon whereby the Authors
of ſuch diſcourſes are reproued as men curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of the tyme to come, whom God will not
peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture permit to attaine thereto: Mark
therefore how ſuch people who would bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to be zealous of Catholicke religion and
the Commonwealth, do by making ſuch que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
offend God and his holy Church.</p>
               <p>7 Furthermore, this good Prince of whom
they ſeeke to make a buckler, is (if it pleaſe
him) to conſider that theſe alterations are
wouen for the ſubuertion of him and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melie:
to the ende that beeing by the force of
the ſame diſunited and deuided, the Authors
of this faction may remaine Maiſters of both
partes, and by the loſſe of the one may more
eaſely diſperce the other. That this is ſo it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8630:16"/>
by that Lybell that ſecretly they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſt
abroade into our hands, wherein is one
of the moſt impudent maximes that they dare
ſet downe, namely: That no one of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Bourbon (and doe expreſſely name the
perſon of the Cardinall, vnder whom neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
they would ſhroud the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues) is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the ſucceſſion of the Crowne of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
becauſe now they are growne beyonde the
tenth degree of agnation to the royall houſe,
whereby onely enheritances and ſucceſſions
are by the Ciuill lawes deferred to the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
and beyonde the which alſo the heritage
beeing vacant ſhoulde come to the fiſck,
which in this cace is the aſſembly of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
and Peeres of France, who are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
to a newe election. But herein they doe
malitiouſly deceiue themſelues, becauſe the
royall title of the Crowne of Fraunce is not

neither runneth by ſimple enheritance ciuill,
but the neereſt of the bloud royall is thereto

               <p>8 Now to the end to lay open mine intent,

that among all ſuch as profeſſe obſeruing of

yeeres, ſince vnder one forme, and with one
kind of lawes it was gouerned vnder the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
and authoritie of Kings, of whom this
laſt race hath continewed 600. yeres. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the chiefeſt and moſt perfect ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of this Crowne, that is moſt commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
whereby the realme doth by ſucceſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
by vertue of the Salick law, to the next
Male of the deceaſed King, diſcending of the
<pb facs="tcp:8630:18"/>
Maſculine ligne: For in trueth our Kings
knowing that thoſe of their owne blood are
to ſucceede them, haue the greater cauſe to
keepe, houſband, and preſerue the eſtate and
demains of their Realme as their owne and
certaine Patrimonie: beſides that the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
of the Crowne that are nouriſhed and
brought vp in this greatneſſe doe neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
tyrants, becauſe euen from their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

duetie, humilitie and obedience to their ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne

long as any of the royall blood doe ſuruiue,
the ſame be capaple to attaine to that marke,
and that purpoſing to attempt any bad mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
againſt the Eſtate and perſon of the

aught againſt the perſon of their King, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in reſpect of that naturall affection that
alwaies they haue borne him, and whereof
they beare the bell among all other Nations
in Europe, or els becauſe God neuer permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the royall bloud of Fraunce to reſt onely
in one, whereby the preſumpteous conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

therefore reſting without doubt or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
in this Realme, the ſubiects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

who is moſt likely to become
<pb facs="tcp:8630:19"/>
their King, ſo as now to call in queſtion this
ſucceſſion, is the only direct way to cauſe the
King y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> holdeth the Scepter ouer vs to think
and with himſelfe to imagine that in his
Realme there are ſome, who for the ſatiſfying
of their ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, could willingly wiſh to haue
his place, and for the ſame purpoſe do harken
after his ende. But ſith the bolde impudencie
of men is ſo great that they bluſh not, neither
are aſhamed to diſcloſe themſelues &amp; to giue
all men to vnderſtande of their bad entents,
beſides that neceſſarily the Commune muſt

the falſe then the true, before wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
any further in aunſwering the chiefe
poynts of the Lybelles that they ſcatter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade,
to the end to ſay that after the deceaſe
of the moſt Chriſtian King without iſſue
male, it is not the nowe King of Nauarre,
but his Vnckle the Lord Cardinall of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon
that lawfully ſhould be King: or the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to expreſſe their entents, that it is neither
the one ne the other, but that they muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
to a newe election and nomination of a
Prince, I will here proteſt that I neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to ſee the aduenture of that ſubſtitution
which they pretende, but hartely doe wiſh to
the King my ſoueraigne Lorde a moſt long
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8630:19"/>
and happie life, with as great number of iſſue
capable of this Crowne as there be Starres
in the Firmament.</p>
               <p>9 After which proteſtation, to come to the
purpoſe and ſucceſſion of the houſe of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
I will firſt ſpeake to thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are not brought
vp in the ſtate of this Realme, but onely haue
learned of their Fathers that the Famely of
Bourvon hath the honor to be iſſued from our
Kinges, therefore that the Princes thereof
may ſucceede, when God ſhall permit, to the
Crowne, by the Lawe of ſucceſſion of the
realme. Turning my ſelfe then to theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
I ſay that it is well knowen, that
King Lawes the ninth, canonized and called
ſaint Lewes, had two ſonnes, the elder Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip
the bould, of whome are come our Kings
yet raigning, who alſo had two ſonnes, the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
Phillip the fayer who ſucceeded him, and
after him his three ſonnes, Lewes, Phil. the
long, Charles the fayer, &amp; the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger Charles
County of Valois, who begat Phillip of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois,
who ſucceeded in the Realme after his
Couſen Charles the fayer. After Phillip ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
his ſoune Iohn, &amp; after him Charles
the fifth called the wiſe, ſonne to Iohn. This
Charles had two ſonnes, the eldeſt Charles
the ſixth King of Fraunce, vnto whome ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb facs="tcp:8630:20"/>
Charles the ſeuenth, Lewes the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
and Charles the eight his ſonne, petie
ſonne and petie Neuew. The yonger Lewes
Duke of Orleance, who by Lady Valentine
of Millan had two ſonnes, Charles the elder
father to Lewes the twelfth King of France
after his Couſen Charles the eight was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
without iſſue, and Iohn Earle of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouleſme,
who was Father of Charles alſo
Earle of the ſame lande, and Grandfather to
king Francis the firſt, who ſucceeded his coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
Lewes the twelfth, of which King Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
came Henrie his ſecond ſonne, and father
to Henry now raigning. Hetherto therefore
the branch of Phillip the bould, eldeſt Sonne
to Saint Lewes, neuer failed, &amp; ſo muſt that
fable needes be falſe which the enimies of the
houſe of Bourbo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue ſought to root in mens
mindes, namely, that the diſcontentation of
the late King Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis the firſt againſt Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
of Bourbon that dyed at Rome was for
his pretence to the Crowne of France, which
ſince haue continued in al the Princes of this
houſe, and from whence ſhould be deriued the
troubles and Ciuill Warres of this realme
during the minoritie of the Kings, Francis
the ſecond and Charles the ninth, brothers to
the King nowe raigning. A matter vtterly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8630:20"/>
falſe, and falſely inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, to the ende more and
more to bring into the hatred of the people the
Princes of Bourbon, who neuer accompted
more deerely of any thing, or had greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in ought then to acknowledge, obey and
faithfully ſerue the Maieſties of our Kings,
as their true and ſouereigne Lordes, hauing
the honor ſo neerely to be to them allyed, that
they are of the ſame Houſe and Armes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
difference, except that our Kings are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
from the elder ſonne of Saint Lewes,
and the Princes of Bourbon fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the yonger.</p>
               <p>10 The ſecond ſonne of ſaid ſaint Lewes,
was Saint Robert of France, to whom his
father gaue for his maintenance y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie of
Clermont in Beauuoys. This Robert mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Beatrix daughter and Heire of Archem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bault
of Bourbon, and they two had iſſue, a
ſonne named Lewes, who ſucceeded his ſaid
father in the Countie of Clermount, and ſo
was alſo Earle of March, beſides that in the
right of his Mother hee enioyed the goods of
the ſayd Archembault of Bourbon, namely
the Lordſhip of Bourbo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which in reſpect of
the appertenaunces thereto was of ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
that King Phillip of Valois in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his raigne, which was about the
yeere. 1327. erected the ſaid Landes into a
<pb facs="tcp:8630:21"/>
Dutchie, wherby the ſaid Lewes tooke vpon
him the name and ſtate of Duke of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,
which ſince hath continued in his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
This Lewes had two ſonnes by whom
this ſtock was firſt deuided into two bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches,
the one was named Peter, the other Iames:
Peter is now quite worne out as concerning
the Maſculine ligne, neuertheleſſe wee will
briefly rehearſe his iſſue, and then retourne to
the poſteritie of Iames, who was the yonger
of whom is diſcended the houſe of Vandoſme
from whom the Princes of Bourbon now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
doe fetch their originall.</p>
               <p>Peter of Bourbou being the elder of this
houſe, as is aforeſaid, was of great credit and
authoritie in the time of King Iohn, and had
many daughters, among whom was one ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fayre, whome Charles the fifth couered to
marry, rather then Margaret of Flanders
who had three goodly Counties to her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage:
Flanders, Artois and Henault, whom
he cauſed his brother Phillip the bould Duke
of Bourgondy to marry. An other named
Blanch, was maried to the King of Caſtile,
a third to the Duke of Sauoy, a fourth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Catherin, to the Earle of Harcourt. He
had alſo a Sonne called Lewes who was of
great fame, as well toward y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of Charles
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8630:21"/>
the fifth, as in the beginning of Charles the
ſixth to whom he was appointed tuter, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to his brother Lewes Duke of Orleance,
togither with the Duke of Burgondy their
vnckle by their father. The ſaide Lewes of
Bourbon was Capteine and Leader of the
armie againſt the Turke in Affrike, in the
time of Charles the ſixth, and had to wife La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Anne Daulphine, who brought into that
houſe the Countie Dauphine of Auuergne,
and the lands of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brailles, with the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of Mercure in the ſaid land of Auuergne,
and by her he had a Sonne called Iohn, who
maried Mary daughter to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke of Berry.
To this man was giuen the Dutchy of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergne,
with the Dutchy of Bourbo and
Countie of Clermount.</p>
               <p>11 At Iohn, the ſayde principall braunch
bearing away the elderſhip, the Famelie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to bee deuided, for he had two Sonnes
Charles and Lewes. Charles ſucceeded his
father in Bourbon, Clermont and Aunergne
and Lewes had Montpenſier, which in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end
returned to his poſteritie. Charles marryed
Agnes of Burgondy ſiſter to Duke Phillip
of Burg. and they had iſſue principall two
ſonnes Iohn and Peter. It is ſayd they alſo
had two more of one name, viz. Lewes, of
<pb facs="tcp:8630:22"/>
whom the one dyed yong, the other was Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Liedge and Abbot of Sainct Vaaſt.
Others doe ſaye that they had two Sonnes
Charles who was Cardinal and Archbiſhop
of Lyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; Iohn who was Biſhop of Liedge.
They had alſo ſundry Daughters, as Iane
married to the Prince of Orange: Iſabell to
the Duke of Burgondie, and Margeret to
the Duke of Sauoy, of whom are diſcended
Philibert Duke of Sauoy deceaſed without
iſſue, and Lady Loiſe of Sauoy married to
the Duke of Angoleſme, of whom came the
late King Frances the firſt. But to returne
to the ſaid Iohn and Peter, ſonnes of the ſaid
Charles of Bourbon and Agnes of Burgon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
Iohn the eldeſt had his fathers goodes
and married Iane of Fraunce Daughter to
King Charles the ſeuenth &amp; ſiſter to Lewes
the eleuenth, who neuertheleſſe in the warre
for the Commonwealth repoſed no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence
in the ſayd Iohn of Bourbon, aſwell becauſe
he was come of a Daughter of Bourgondie,
as for that he had not bene payd his mariage
money. The ſayd Iohn had no children by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Lady Iane of Fraunce or Lady Iane of
Bourgondie his Couſen whom he tooke for
his ſeconde wife, and ſo his whole ſucceſſion
fel to his brother Peter, who was called Lord
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8630:22"/>
of Beauuiew. This Peter maried Anne of
France daughter to Lewes the eleuenth. He
was in great credite during Lewes raigne,
but in greater during Charles the eight, ſo
as in the voyage to Naples the ſayde King
left the ſayd Peter Regent of Fraunce. The
ſayde Peter alſo left no iſſue Male but one
Daughter called Suſan, who might haue
great controuerſies for the goodes of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melie:
for the preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting wherof it was wiſely
aduiſed to marrie her to a male of this houſe,
which was brought to paſſe as hereafter ſhall
be ſhewed.</p>
               <p>12 To Lewes of Bourbon of whom wee
ſpake before fell the Countie of Montpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier,
and ſo continued the name and title ſo
long as the ligne of the ſayd Charles his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
brother laſted. He married Gabriel of the
Tower, of whom came Gilbert of Montpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier
Viceroy of Naples after that Charles
the eight had gotten it. He married Clare of
Bouſaigne of whom iſſued fiue children thrée
ſonnes and two daughters, Charles, Lewes,
and Frances, of whom the two laſt died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
iſſue. Charles ſucceeded his father, and
with the conſent of King Lewes the eleuenth
maried the aforenamed Suſan of Bourbon
his Couſen, whereby all the auncient goodes
<pb facs="tcp:8630:23"/>
of this houſe were left to them and confirmed
in their perſons, whereby alſo was exting ui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
a quarrell already framed for the ſayde
goods, which neuertheleſſe ſoone after brake
out againe more fiercely then before, becauſe
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſayd Suſan of Bourbo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wife to her Couſen
Charles and heire of the elder houſe of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon
dyed before her ſayde Huſband Charles
without leauing any iſſue of her bodie, and
therefore Lady Lewes of Sauoy mother to
King Frances the firſt and Rege<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of France
entituled and bare her ſelf for heire to her ſaid
Couſen Suſan, and in deede was in degree
neerer to ſucceede her then the ſayd Charles
her Huſband: wherevpon the proceſſe &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie
began, whereat it was ſayd that the
ſyd Charles tooke ſuch diſpleaſure that he
withdrew himſelf out of the Kings obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce:
&amp; therfore his Maieſtie had a decrée of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his goodes and rightes by confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Alſo ſince that tyme was a compoſition
made betwene the King and his ſayd mother
vpon condition that if hee deceaſed without
heires male then the ſayd goodes ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
into Lorraine. But his Maieſtie not
willing ſo rigorouſly to vſe his rightes and
coueting to deale fauourably with the ſiſters
of the ſaid Charles, he left to them part oft he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8630:23"/>
ſayd goodes: as to the Lady Dutches of Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
the Baronage of Mercure, to the Lady
Loiſe married into the houſe of Roch-ſur-you
the Countie of Montpenſier and landes of
Combrailles: which in ſo doing he rected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Dutchy meete for the heires of the ſayde
Lady, who at this day do beare the ſame name
of Bourbon, and are extract out of the ſecond
principall braunch of this houſe which we left
of aboue vntill we had ended the firſt braunch
of the elder. And now to returne to the ſayde
Sir Charles, in him dyed the ligne male of
the principall ſtock of the houſe of Bourbon.
As for his two Siſters the one called Claude
was wife to good Duke Antony of Lorrain,
whoſe ſtocke yet remaineth. The other Loiſe
was maried into the other principall braunch
of Bourbon, who hath left iſſue of the name
of this houſe.</p>
               <p>13 Now let vs take the ſeconde braunch,
the firſt &amp; chiefe partition of this race, which
is the ſtocke of the latter yonger borne, and
yet remaineth to this day, in the roume of the
eldeſt, and beareth the Name and full armes
thereof, as remayning alone after the default
and ending of the elder. Concerning y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> males
this ligne beginneth againe in Iames of
Bourbon the yonger Sonne of Lewes firſt
<pb facs="tcp:8630:24"/>
Duke of Bourbon, of whom we haue ſpoken
before. This Iames was Conſtable of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
after Charles of Spaine, who flew Charles
King of Nauarre in the time of King Iohn.
He had to wife Iehane of Saint Paule, and
was and ſo named himſelf Earle of Marche.
Of him came one onely ſonne named Iohn,
who ſucceeded hym and married Catherin
Counteſſe of Vendoſme and Caſtres, who
brought into this houſe thoſe two Counties
togither with the landes of Carcuecy, Lupe,
Conde, Eſpernon, Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>doubleau and others.
Of theſe two iſſued three children Male, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
Lewes, and Iohn: alſo three daughters,
Anne wife to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke of Bauiere, Charlot
maried to the King of Ciprus, and Mary to
Robert of the Croſſes, who tooke his ſaide
wife by force and therfore fled, and it was ſaid
he was drowned: In his tyme hee gouerned
King Charles the ſeuenth. Now to retourne
to the iſſue male. Iames had to his protion
the Counties of March and Caſtres: Lewes
the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie of Vendoſme. As for Iohn he had
the Lordſhip of Carcuecy, and maried a goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſip
of his called Margaret a Vandoſmois, by
whom hee had ſome Children, and got a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
to haue her to Wife, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the ſaid children were not aduowed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8630:24"/>
this famely, neither ſucceded in his goods,
but by ſentence were declared illegitimate,
and which is more, the ſaid Iohn of Bourbon
the Father in his Teſtament willed great
giftes, and ſubſtitutions to the behoofe of his
other two ſonnes Iames &amp; Lewes, in whoſe
perſons he planted him ſelfe, and raiſed the
firſt after bough and vnder twigge of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
principall branch.</p>
               <p>14 This Iames of Bourbon eldeſt ſonne
to Iohn, liued in the time of Charles the ſixt,
and had two wiues, the firſt Beatrix of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre
the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger daughter of the houſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,
which was the firſt allia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of thoſe two
houſes. They two had iſſue a daughter na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Leonor. After the deceaſe of the ſaide
Beatrix, the ſaid Iames of Bourbon allyed
him ſelfe by marriage as it is pretended with
Iane Queene of Naples who had before (as
the ſpeech went) promiſed marriage to the
King of Arragon, and deceiued them both:
So as the ſayde Iames of Bourbon beeing
gone into the Realme of Naples was in the
ende forced to leaue the ſayd Iane and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
into Fraunce, where after his returne he
ſtill bare the title and name of King of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
notwithſtanding the ſayd Iane had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
giuen it to others, and finally decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb facs="tcp:8630:25"/>
leauing for his onely heire the ſayd Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor

ſayd Counties of Marche and Caſtres. She
maried Bernard of Armanack Earle of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diar
a yonger ſonne of the houſe of Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack.
Theſe two had iſſue two ſonnes Iohn

of Charles of Anieow Earle of Mayn and of

fauour, but afterward fall into ſuſpition with
Lewes the eleuenth, and was executed at the
Halles in Paris the 24. of Auguſt 1147. he
left fower Children, two Sonnes and two
Daughters, Iames Duke of Nemours and
Lewes Earle of Guyze, the two Daughters
Margaret &amp; Charlot married into the houſe
of Rohan, who deceaſed without iſſue of their
bodies, ſo as in them failed this vnder twigg
both male and female.</p>
               <p>15 Now remaineth to bee ſpoken of the

               <p>Concerning the firſt, they aleadge that the

lawfull matrimony of Anthony of Bourbon,
eldeſt ſonne of the houſe of Bourbon, becauſe
Ladie Iane of Albret mother to the ſaid lord
King was married to the Duke of Cleue
when ſhe ioyned with the ſaid Lord Anthony,

of the ſaid Anthonie of Bourbon, and
Iane of Albret is illegitimate and vncapable

to ſuccede in the Crowne of France, wherin

               <p>2 This point is eaſie to bee anſwered by
the trueth of the matter, which is, that the late
King Francis the firſt deſirous to drawe to
himſelfe, and to diſunite from the Emperour
Charles the fifth the Duke of Cleue, vrged
&amp; forced his ſiſter Lady Margaret of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,

before the time of mariage was lawfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

ſhe complayned of this pretended marriage,

               <p>3 It followeth therfore that the pretended

of the lawfull mariage of the ſayd Antony of

vpon ſimplicitie vnder the authoritie and in

did ſolemnize the ſaid mariage: in which cace

doe you briefly ſee how children borne of ſuch
mariages are legitimate. In our cace wee
haue moreouer aduowed that the pretended
marriage of Lady Iane of Albret, mother to
the now raigning King of Nauarre, was
voyd and of no effect, and for ſuch by all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
iuſtly broken and diſanulled by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church, with whoſe authoritie
the ſayd Lady Iane was permitted to marie
where ſhe pleaſed, which was not done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
preſident. For wee reade in the auncient
Chronickles, that for the like cauſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
Ottho the fourth was diuorſed from
Margaret Daughter to the Duke of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant:
&amp; Lewes Daulphin of Viennois ſonne
to King Charles y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſixt a litle before he dyed,
<pb facs="tcp:8630:35"/>
vſed, as ſome ſay, the like pretence to returne
Catherin daughter to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke of Bourgon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
home again. In later tyme King Charles
the eight of Fraunce, in the yeere 1480. was
by his father Lewes the eleuenth, before hee
was foreteene yeeres old, affianced by words
preſent, and ſo by indiſſoluble marriage vnto
Margaret of Auſtrich, daughter to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
Maximilian, who being then but two
yeeres olde was conueyed into Fraunce and
there brought vp for the ſpace of ten whole
yeeres, after the which they were neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
diuorced by a diſpenſation from Pope
Innocent the eight, who alſo for the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
diſpenſed with Lady Anne of Brittaine,
and gaue her leaue to marrie where ſhe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding during her minoritie her
father Francis Duke of Brittaine had mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
her with the Emperour Maximilian,
&amp; by proxye had celebrated the ſayd mariage.
Nicholas Duke of Lorrain, while his father
Duke Iohn liued, did in the yeere 1460. by
preſent words affiance Lady Iane of France
daughter to King Lewes the eleuenth, and
yet comming to the age of foreteene yeeres,
he did through the Popes diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betroth
Lady Mary of Bourgondy, Daughter to
Charles the laſt Duke of Bourgondy whom
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8630:35"/>
he was going to marrie when death, euen du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the preparatiues of the ſolemnitie of the
mariage, preuented him. So the manifolde
decrees and iudgements paſſed in like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

Nauarre.</p>
               <p>7 Their ſeconde obiection importeth that
the ſayd Lorde King of Nauarre is an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,
and therefore vnworthy to ſucceede in
the Realme of Fraunce, whoſe Kings are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled
<hi>moſt Chriſtian,</hi> in reſpect of the oath
that they take at their ſacring in the hands of
the Archbiſhop of Rheimes: which is, <hi>that to

Religion and faith:</hi> which the ſayd Lord King
of Nauarre cannot doe, as profeſſing an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
already condemned by the Church, and
ſo conſequently can not pretend aught in the

are to diſpute whether an heretick may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued
of that Realme that falleth to him by
ſucceſſion, as this doth to the King of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre.
In the other, whether in this preſent
action the King of Nauarre may bee termed
an Hereticke, and as ſuch a one bee depriued
of his ſucceſſion.</p>
               <p>8 For the firſt I ſaye and maintaine, that
thoſe Ordenances of Emperors, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall

of ſucceſſions, are written and ſpeake onely
of particuler Chriſtians, whoſe goodes and

Catholicke and Apoſtolick doctrine that you

Counſaile, but onely for a particuler aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly

that weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are not the meanes to cure this
miſchiefe. Know you not that the doctrine of

of the Soule and minde? ſeeke therefore for

to heale the ſame, as admonitions, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

are the true and onely Weapons of Gods

<pb facs="tcp:8630:41"/>
the extreeme diligence and care of our moſt
Chriſtian and Catholike Kings for the rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of their people into one only Apoſtolick
Romiſh Religion? what haue wee gotten by
ſo many fyers, ſo much blood, ſuch battailes,
and deſtructions within this Realme for the
ſame? Thoſe that nowe would rule you, are
they not the ſame perſons that led the armies
and practized y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> occaſions of the paſſed wars?
haue they not ſufficiently proued, that neither
ſter nor ſword are meete remedies for this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill?
&amp; that in one day of ſuch troubles Gods
Church is more hurt and offended through
the diſorder of one lewde Souldier, then in a
whole yeere of pacient tolleration, whereby
God may be deuoutly ſerued, the King hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the Clergie aſſured, the Lawe feared, the
gentry cheriſhed and the people eaſed? to bee
briefe, euery one by little and litle reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the waye of good life? which to bee briefe
are the effectes and glorie of the militant
Church, and of the good Shepherdes of the
the ſame. Wee haue burned them quick, they
haue quenched the fiers with their blood: wee
haue drowned them, they haue Spawned in
the concauities of the water: we haue murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them al in their ſleepes, within few daies
they haue reuiued againe: We haue fought
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8630:41"/>
with them and beaten them, but haue not caſt
them downe: To be brief, if we conſider how
we haue behaued our ſelues toward them, we
ſhall ſurely find that we haue left no more to
doe, but either to deſtroy our ſelues and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
all togither, whereby the one ſhall not

to driue them into heauen with the edge of the

y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Church goods in ſuch ſort as he ought?
See wee not ſtill the Kinges Courtes, the
Townes and Country full of ſuperfluitie of
our Biſhops, and other Clergie men? ſuch a

ſee ſo much as one, vnleſſe it were to the

their Churches fall in decay, and the Prieſtes
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> themſelues haue annoynted begge their
foode, the reſt of the poore dye for hunger at
their gates. And in one word to ſay all, theſe
Maiſters haue no money to doe their dueties
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>all, no not ſo much as to procure preaching
which themſelues can not doe, or for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the deuine ſeruice, either to inſtruct the
youth. For euery one doth ſufficiently know
that the late King Charles the nineth, whom
God pardon, and King Henry the third now
raigning, viſiting and comming to thoſe
Townes wherein the principal Vniuerſities
of their Realme are planted, did ordeine that
the Clergie of certaine Dioceſes ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
ſome ſmall portion toward the ſala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Doctors and Rege<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the ſame,
yet was it neuer poſſible for theſe poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who are the ſeedes of iuſtice and vertue,
to reape any one penny. Our Maiſters haue
nowe money enough to helpe to maintaine
warre againſt the King vnder an imaginary
and falſe prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of defending the Catholicke
Religion. You deceiue your ſelues if you
hope to conuert others before ye make cleane
your ſelues, no neuer looke for it: for it will
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8630:42"/>
ſtill be obiected vnto you that <hi>you can ſee a
mote in other mens eyes, but cannot take away
the whole blocke that blindeth your ſelues.</hi>
Why follow you not the example of Moſes,
who when he beheld and ſawe Gods people
offende the deuine Maieſtie with Idolatrie,
did not take the ſworde to put them to death,
but began to crye: <hi>O Lorde this people haue
ſinned, forgiue them, or els blot mee out of thy
booke which thou haſt written.</hi> Let vs liue
well, let vs reforme our ſelues, and let vs not
be ſo careful for the wealth of the world. We
haue ſo long cryed out againſt thoſe of the
pretended Religion concerning this poynt,
that now they can ſay of vs: The Doctor is
to blame, who reproaueth other for the fault
that himſelf hath. Yea they will ſaye worſe,
for ſtill they ſtand vpon the defenſiue, you are
the aſſailants: They haue euermore acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the Kings Maieſtie for their ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Lord, and neuer contemned the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his bloud, as the King himſelfe in his
Edicts hath not ſticked to confeſſe: but you
endeuour to enſtale Straungers againſt the
eſtate and dignitie of his Maieſtie, who both
before he was King and ſince hath prodigally
ventred his life and hazarded his Crowne for
the glutting of your deſires, and putting of
<pb facs="tcp:8630:43"/>
your ouer rude counſailes in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What
reaſon therefore haue you now to match your
ſelues with the meere enemies to the peace
of the Church? enemies to your Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth?
enemies to your King and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his bloud? I ſaye to your moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
and Catholicke King, one that feareth
God, and one who hath (peraduenture) done
more then he ought for the getting by armes
that contention which you do wiſh for. I am
moued ſo to ſay, becauſe in trueth I beleeue
and experience hath taught vs that the more
we ſtirre vp this euill, the more it encreaſeth:
wherefore herein the beſt counſaile that wiſe
men haue left vs, were to reſolue our ſelues
that if this pretended reformed Religion bee
not by the decree and eſtabliſhment of Gods
worde, it will without any warres periſh and
vaniſh of it ſelf, as haue done ſo many former
hereſies: but contrariwiſe, if it be according
to the wil of the holy Ghoſt, we may crye out
at our pleaſures, but it will fulfill his worke.</p>
               <p>10 But my Maiſters, if you be not led by
malice, are you ſo blinde as to thinke that the
authors of this conſpiracie, which they terme
a <hi>holy League,</hi> bee ledde by any zeale of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
Religion? If that were their drift,
wherefore haue not they alſo called into the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8630:43"/>
ſame ſuch Lords Princes of the bloud, as ſtil
continuing Catholickes, and liuing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Romiſh Church, were neuer ſo
much as ſuſpected to bee of the pretended re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion? We know very well that
the Lord Cardinal of Bourbon (whoſe yeres
they haue ſeduced, and whom vnder a vaine
hope of ſmoke they make to weare the knife
wherewith to embrue his hands in his owne
bloud, hauing wreſted from him the fayreſt
and moſt of his Benefices, whereof, by their
ſuggeſtion hee hath depriued his owne Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes)
before he altogether became vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
&amp; when they bounde him to this peeuiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
offering vnto him their fayned League
to ſigne, requeſted that his Neuewes the
Lordes Cardinall of Vandoſme, Prince of
Conty and Earle of Soiſſons might bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſame, wherto theſe our Maiſters
could not intend. Whereof doe they ſuſpect
the Lord Duke of Montpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſier, and the Lord
Prince of Do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bes his ſonne, both being moſt
Catholicke Princes? onely that they bee of
the houſe of Bourbon which they ſeeke to
roote out, and ſo doe make accoumpt to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the Crowne into their owne handes,
trying themſelues onely vpon the ſayd Lord
Cardinall, a man worne and of ſmall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance:
<pb facs="tcp:8630:44"/>
ſo contenting themſelues to make
him the ſtanderd whereby to eſtabliſh their
armes: neither would they auctorize the reſt
amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g their troupes, fearing leaſt they ſhould
haue better eyes then the ſayd Lorde Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
to diſcouer their wicked entents: beſides
that if it ſhoulde ſo fall out that they ſhoulde
come to the drawing of l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ttes for the beane
in the cake, the people would rather haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to theſe Princes as to the braunches
and ſprigges of their Kings, and thoſe who
onely in their degrees and order are capable
of the Crowne of France: either els leaſt the
Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch Nobilitie ſhould bluſh for ſhame at the
preferring of the tirannous dominion of ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
before their French Princes and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Lordes. This is not the firſt day that the
houſe of Bourbon haue bene ſubiect to the
enuie and malice of theſe Eſpaniolized con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators:
for it appeared more euidently whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Duke of Vendoſme father to the now
raigning King of Nauarre, maried the heire
of Nauarre, whom one of their predeceſsors
was very deſirous to match withall. The ſaid
Lord of Montpenſier ſhould be very blinde if
he could not (by the welcome that the parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans
gaue him lately at Orleans with Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
ſhot) perceiue that it is not Catholicke
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8630:44"/>
Religion that they fight for, but the rooting
out of the royall famelie. As alſo before whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in his abſence while he was gone to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
the late Monſier the Duke, brother to
the King into Brabant, they procured the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away of the gouernement of Brittaine
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, which now they clayme to be theirs,
ſome in the right of their mother and other of
their wife. But I hope the King ſhall be able
notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they endeuour to diſpoſſeſſe
him, to make himſelfe whole, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> and after to
heare them in their petitions, if hee finde the
ſame reaſonable. Moreouer to returne to you
my Maiſters of the Clergie, I will ſet you
downe moſt pertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t demonſtrations of their
zeale to the Catholicke Church, and will tell
you that after they had fayled of their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
againſt the Towne of Strauſ borowe,
(by the ſpoyle whereof they hoped for meane
ſufficient to demaunde Mets, Thoul, &amp; Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun,
and therewithall, together with other
the Townes vpon the ſhore of Rhine, which
eaſily they would haue forced, to haue proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
their purpoſe for the reſt of the Realme
of Fraunce) they endeuoured to winne thoſe
of the pretended reformed Religion, vnto
whom they promiſed not only ſuch free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cize
of their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> King now raigning
<pb facs="tcp:8630:45"/>
had permitted them, but alſo, if neede were,
with greater libertie and aſſurance, and to
the ſame ende offered to ſend their male chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and young Couſens for hoſtages into
Germany, vnder the pretence of learning the
Dutch tongue: perſwading the French of the
ſayd Religion, that they ſhould neuer liue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
vnder the King: that by that which was
paſſed they might beleeue that he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe
his Edicts of Pacification, vpon his
firſt oportunitie: that neither y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> King of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,
neither the Prince of Condy had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
ſufficient to defend them: to be brief,
that it was their beſt to offer themſelues into
their protection, who had both the men of
warre, the Clergie, and the gouernors of the
Prouinces at their deuotion. To the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
they alſo ſent the late Lorde of May, to
Duke Caſemire, to winne hym into this
League, and alſo to practize the ſame with
thoſe of the pretended reformed Religion, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
to commit their forces into his hands:
beſides ſetting before him that he was diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of the race of Charlemagne as well as
they: that they might make the one a great
Emperour, the other a great King: that the
Capeti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s had ouer long enioyed their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
and that they were reſolued no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:8630:45"/>
to ſuffer it. As in deede about the time of the
ſiege of Fere, the ſayd May practized all that
he perceiued diſcontented to ſigne the ſayde
conſpiracie, vntill he was wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded at the ſaid
ſiege: whereof when the chief of this drift had
notice, he poſted from Paris vnto him to get
from him the Articles of the League: as alſo
after the deceaſe of the ſayd May, hee ſent to
his houſe to make ſearch amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g al the papers
&amp; reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brances of the ſayd deceaſed. Beleeue
not therefore my Maiſters, that it is the loue
of God that leadeth them, either piety of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
Religion, but ſay boldly that it is no
other but ambition, a wicked and abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
entent to loſe and alter this Eſtate and to
get it into their handes, and ſo to make you
bondmen to their paſſions, or executioners of
their tyrannie. Wherefore I beſeech you to
call to minde the ſaying of Ioel. <hi>Awake</hi> (my
Maiſters) <hi>you that are dronken with your
Wine, weepe and lament, for all your ioye and
mirth is gone farre from you.</hi> Put on your
mourning weedes ye Prieſtes that ſerue at

and our fieldes doe now weepe, ſith they are
become barren: our Wines withered, our

<pb facs="tcp:8630:46"/>
that ſerue God, and in liew of other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons

not thy enheritance. As for your liues,
direct them after the example of the Apoſtle,
who ſayth:<note place="margin">ad Theſſ.</note> 
                  <hi>Wee are as young children among

ſo we doe merueilouſly loue you, and doe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet

My Maiſters, I pray you pardon me,
I knowe I might haue ſpoken more gently
vnto you, but to what purpoſe is it only with
the fingers to touch the wound, or to annoynt
onely the outſide thereof with too eaſie an
oyntment, when you ſee it is tyme to cruſh it
throughly: to expell all corruption that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the whole body? What had I bene the
better to haue miniſtred a tent of lint, when it
wanted a ſharpe coroſiue. Take therefore in
good parte this that I ſay vnto you, for it is
the doctrine y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I haue learned in the Schoole
of the Catholicke Apoſtolicke and Romiſh
Church: the greateſt Doctors whereof with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
humaine paſſions will graunt that al the
Sermons and Preachings wherewith you
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:8630:46"/>
ſtirre vp the people to take armes and ſhed
bloud, are no other then the deuilles Tro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pets
and Drommes: as alſo ſurely if you ſeeke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other weapons then clemencie and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
pietie doe teach, and that with Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
you ſay not you had rather be killed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
kil, I do foreſhew vnto you the wrath of God
vpon you, and that vndoubtedly the propheſie
of Malachie will bee verefied in you in theſe
wordes: <hi>My wrath is kindled againſt the
Shepeheards, whom I will viſite among the
flockes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11 Much leſſe are we alſo to care for the
complaint that ſome of the vnwiſeſt of your
men doe lay vpon the King for exacting ſome
of your tenths, and vſing ſometimes, as the
neceſſitie of his Eſtate requireth, the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralties
of his Churches, wherein they are
much to blame, and do ouergreatly abuſe the
libertie that the conniuence of Princes haue
tollerated in your predeceſſors, in reſpect of
their pietie and endeuours in the diſtribution
of their meanes, poſſeſſions and almoſes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to the poore vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church goods
doe appertaine, and not to you. Beſides that
I will by the way tell you that the wealth of
the Church is the onely poyſon thereof, for
that the greatneſſe thereof conſiſteth not in
<pb facs="tcp:8630:47"/>
temporall goodes and worldly pompe, as the
deuill hath perſwaded moſt of our Clergie,
but in the holy and commendable life of our
Paſtors, and in that heauenly foode that they
giue to their flockes ouer y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which they watch
night &amp; day:<note place="margin">Homil 84. in Matth.</note> And as Chriſoſtome doth well
ſhewe you: the welth of the Church bringeth
you into ſuſpition among both rich, poore,
Theeues, and Slaunderers, that ſeeke your
ſpoyle, beſides that you are therby filled with
cares, lyings in waight, braules, ſtrifes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
feare, couetouſneſſe and perpetuall ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe,
ſuch as the miſerie of our worlde can
teach vs, wherein it is true that the moſt part
of the Clergie haue no other minde, neither
doe moue warre for any other cauſe, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for feare of loſing ſo great rents and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenues,
which wrongfully they deuour out of
the goodes of the poore. Whereby wee may
perceiue that in ſuch men we haue no more
left but the ſhadow, remembrance, and be wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Chriſtian Church ſpringing and
floriſhing in pietie, for whoſe ſake the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
would neuer poſſeſſe any thing: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Gods people nouriſhed the Leuites, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes

thought it good to haue &amp; reteine any thing
for the reliefe of the poore, and of the Paſtors
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:8630:47"/>
thereof, it committed the diſtribution and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
thereof to ſuch among them as by the
Church were thereto elected, becauſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but eſpecially the Princes were either
ſworne enemies to the faith and perſecutors
of the Spouſe of Ieſus Chriſt, either at the
leaſt, weake, of ſmall zeale, or but meanly
grounded therein: wherevpon the treaſure
and common Storehouſe was vſually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the cuſtody of the Biſhop, as vnto
hym that was accompted moſt glorious in
pietie and duetie in the holy diſtribution that
he made,<note place="margin">Soſom. lib. 8. cap. 12. Socr. lib. 7. cap 25.</note> whereof he reſerued onely ſufficient
for the neceſſitie of his owne liuing. Like as
Socrates writeth that Chriſantus daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
onely two Loues for his owne ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
Of this common ſtore committed to
the handes of the Biſhop, is it come to paſſe
that when hee began to ſerue him ſelfe, and
badly to employ to his priuat commoditie,
like a thiefe, that thing which to hym in the
qualitie of a ſteward onely ſubiect to render
accompt, was committed, he found him ſelfe
farre richer, more mightie, and better at eaſe
then the reſt of the Clergie, and therevpon by

they vſed to proclaime by lifting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

hath ſince beene thought more expedient to
miniſter theſe ceremonies in the aſſembly of
the Church, there to call God to witneſſe of
that faith which the ſubiects vowed to their
Prince, and of that duetie wherein the King
bound himſelfe to his Eſtate: to the ende alſo
that afterward the people might knowe, that
from a priuat and perticuler man that he was
wont to be, he was now promoted to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
to the end to commaund. Thus did Ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolius
firſt deale with the Emperor Leo the
firſt in the yere of Ieſus Chriſt 461. and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemius
with the Emperour Anaſtaze in the
yeere 494. of whom hee exacted a perticuler
promeſſe in writing, becauſe both before and
at the tyme that he was proclaimed Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
he had bene and ſtill was an Eutichean
hereticke, whoſe errors had bene condemned
by the decrees of the Counſaile of Chalcedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
holden in the preſence of the Emperor Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
in the yeere of Ieſus Chriſt 455. Of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
daies immediatly vpon the deceaſe of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian
the firſt, they added that the Patriark
of Conſtantinople, ſhould after the example
and imitation of the Kings of Iuda, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8630:55"/>
annoynt, and crowne the Emperours
with a Crowne of Golde in the aſſembly of
the Church, which was firſt obſerued in the
Emperour Iuſtin the ſecond, and afterward
by Pope Leo the 3. tranſlated into the Weſt
to the behalfe of Charles the Great, before
whom, or not long before we doe not finde in
any Hiſtorie that the Kings of France were
euer annointed or conſecrated, but onely ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
crowned, as Gregorie of Tours maketh
mention in his hiſtorie: whereby it appeareth
that none of our Kings of the firſt famely did
euer obſerue this ceremonie.<note place="margin">Greg Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. lib. 2.</note> The firſt then
that vſed it was Pepin, father to Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne,
whome Boniface Archbiſhoppe of
Mentz, did conſecrate, annoint and crowne
by the commaundement of Pope Zachary of
Rome: &amp; that in my opinion, becauſe he was
the firſt of his race, who of a priuate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler
perſon, was eſtabliſhed King againſt
the Merouingiens. After his deceaſe, Pope
Stephen the ſecond did the like to Charles
ſonne to the ſayd Pepin, when he was King
of France, whom alſo Pope Adrian againe
conſecrated, annoynted and crowned, when
he was declared King of the Lombards: and
finally Pope Leo the third did the like to him
with the Imperiall Diadem. And this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
<pb facs="tcp:8630:56"/>
haue euer ſince bene obſerued by our
Kings of France, not that thereby they bee
Kings, but to the ende it may ſeeme as a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie
that they are Chriſtians and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes,
and of priuate perſons are become
Kings to commaund the people. So that in
conſideration hereof, the firſt French Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
Lewes the Meeke, Lothaire, Lewes
the ſecond, and the reſt, who being by natural
ſucceſſion Kings, were promoted to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
did not vſe to take the title of Emperor,
at the day of their conſecration or coronation,
but at ſuch time as their father or former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor
thought good to nominate them for
their ſucceſſors, from which they began to
number the yeeres of their Empire, nothing
reſpecting the ceremonie or ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nitie of their
Coronation: as appeareth by many the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Charters and documents of their daies.
Yea, the Hiſtories doe note, that Charles the
Fat, yongeſt ſonne to Lewes the Meek, was
the firſt that in his yeeres made mention of
the day of his Coronation, and tooke not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
him the title of Auguſtus, vntill the 8. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendes
of Ianuary enſuing, in the yere 866.
on which day Pope Iohn the 8. anointed and
crowned him: which in ſubteltie he thought
good to note, as one that obteyned not the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:8630:56"/>
Empire by ſucceſſion: for Lewes the ſecond,
his neuewe, laſt deceaſed, had not named nor
inſtituted hym his heire: much leſſe had any
choſen him: but the hiſtories doe affirme that
hee for a great ſumme of money bought the
Imperial dignitie of the Pope, becauſe there
were other more fitter for it then he, that layd
clayme thereto, as his elder brother Lewes
and his children Kings of Germany: ſo that
Charles, fearing leaſt (as reaſon and iuſtice
required) they ſhould be preferred before him,
thought good to aduance himſelfe, and to get
the Pope to conſecrate him. To conclude
therfore, it is moſt certaine that this ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
doth make nothing to the right of the
Kings lawful ſucceſſion: neither is any more
then a ſimple token of honor in his behalfe,
whom nature and vſuall order hath cauſed to
be borne or ſuffered to bee elected to rule and
gouerne the Eſtate: ſo that to weene to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
that he that is borne to be your lawful
King by the Lawes of the Realme, hath no
authoritie ouer you before he be conſecrated,
annointed and crowned, is a meere fallation.</p>
               <p>13 It followeth, ſith I haue proued vnto
you, that in this cace the ſayde King of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre
(whom the deepe diſſemblers dare not
openly in their Libelles denye to be the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb facs="tcp:8630:57"/>
of the bloud) ſhould be your natural, true,
and lawfull King, let vs agree together that
it were meere wrong for you to withſtand or
reſiſt him. I ſay further, that in this Realme
there is neither lawe nor order that debarreth
him from lawfull raigne and the Crowne,
notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he would remaine in his now
profeſſed Religion. But contrariwiſe, that
ſuch as are of and doe profeſſe the ſame, are
declared meete and capable of all kindes of
ſucceſſion, by infinite the Edicts, Decrees,
and declarations of our Kings, publiſhed, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouled,
and dayly put in execution by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtes
of the ſoueraigne Courtes, and other
Magiſtrates, who vnder his Maieſties au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
doe miniſter Iuſtice in this Eſtate, &amp;
whoſe common crye tendeth to obliuion and
perpetuall forgetting of the paſſed miſeries
and troubles. As alſo in trueth it is more then
a Catholicke paſſion to compare the Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
with a Iewe or Turke. For beſides that
our Kings doe auctorize and permit the one,
and not the other, in trueth and without affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(for my ſelfe am a Catholick, and in the
ſame faith doe wiſh to dye) we all doe agree
in our faith, ſo as there remaineth no more
but to decide for the moſt part of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
the inſtitution of outwarde ceremonies,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8630:57"/>
which either the tyme or the neceſſitie of the
peoples inſtruction haue procured to bee
brought into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, &amp; be not conteined or

wee doe agree, that in the firſt times the
Chriſtians did liue and ſerue GOD without
them, we can not now leſſe doe then heare the
reaſons of thoſe that craue abolition before
we condemne or pronounce them Heretikes,
leaſt the condemnation goe before the proofe,
and ſo they haue greater cauſe to complaine,
(as already they doe) that wee haue iudged
them vnheard, and haue ended their Proces

                  <hi>Virgill</hi> Biſhop of Saltzbourg in a
Sermon about the yeere of our Lorde 755.
ſaying that there were <hi>Antipodes</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world,
was for the ſame by Boniface Archbiſhop of
Ments, accuſed of Hereſie, becauſe by indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> it ſeemed he would alſo
bring in an other Chriſt. This matter was
debated before Vtilo King of Bauiere, who
at the commaundement of Zachary, denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the ſayd Virgilius to bee one of the moſt
abhominable Heretikes that euer was: So
great was the obſtinacie of the knowledge
conceaued in this age of the <hi>Antipodes</hi> or
<hi>Arteques,</hi> and yet ſince it hath bene vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for trueth: This neuertheleſſe I doe
not alledge, to the ende to reproue the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the ceremonies of the Church, with
which I doe dayly ſerue GOD, eſpecially
knowing, <hi>that in alteration of Lawes aud Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
neceſſity muſt be very apparent in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of matters long before allowed,</hi> but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to admoniſh all men, that in as much as
they are men, it is no meruaile though ſome
will be inquiſitiue whether the authors of the
ſame were led by the will of God, or whether
therein they enterpriſed any thing repugnant
thereto, eſpecially, ſith the queſtion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the maintenance of the peace, liues, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:8630:58"/>
ſoules of ſo many millions of parſons, who
either might, or are already loſt vpon this qua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rell.
And this I will ſay more, that ſith the
fault hath proceeded of our Prelates, who
haue fallen a ſleepe, and haue not mainteined
the fare that they ought for the nouriſhment
of their Flockes, who being ignorant in the
moſt part of the principles of their religion,
haue gone out of their ranck, and doe perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly
require the reaſons thereof: it is moſt
neceſſary gently to giue them a taſte of the
ſame, without ſword or fire, vntil the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
bee at large heard in their defences and
lawfully conuict.</p>
               <p>14 Moreouer I dare aduowe, that in
Realmes and Empires natural Succeſſion,
receiued by the eſtates, is of ſuch force, that
the beſt and moſt Catholicke Parſons neuer
enterprized againſt y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> progreſſe of the ſame,
as occaſions haue bene miniſtred, no not for
Hereſie, although it were condemned, and
with all ſolemnitie accurſed by the Church of
GOD: Notwithſtanding vndoubtedly by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dealing, they might haue hoped for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and that they were in maner aſſured of
manifold afflictions at hand? Had not certein
Biſhops Arriens infected Conſtantius, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he ſucceeded his father, although he were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:8630:59"/>
yong? What was the cauſe that Zeno be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an heritick, was neuertheleſſe made Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
after his father in lawe Leo, but that
the Empire was atteyned for his wife Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adNe,
and little Leo ſonne to the ſaid Zeno,
whom his Grandfather had inſtituted to bée
his heire? in conſideration whereof the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
were content to beare that affliction.
Conſtantine the third and the fifth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
were called to the Empire were heretickes,
but yet in aſmuch as they were lawfull ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
to the laſt deceaſed, the Church would
not meddle with them. When Anaſtaze the
firſt was choſen, no other cauſe moued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarke
of Conſtantinople and the people to
force a promiſe from him that afterward hee
ſhould be a Catholicke, or at the leaſt that he
ſhould not make any alteration or ſtirre vp
any broyle in the Church of God, but onely
becauſe he was then an Eutichian, who was
condemned by the Counſaile of Chalcedon:
and the ſame is the onely caution that you
may exact or require of your King, in cace he
were other then a Catholicke, ſith the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Church neuer deſired greater aſſurance
of the aforenamed then their faith and royall
promiſe. I might bee tedious if I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe
vnto you an infinite number of other
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8630:59"/>
examples, whereby euery one may manifeſtly
perceiue that the holy Primitiue Church ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
accoumpted it ſo ſmal a matter to violate
the lawes of the Eſtate, or to habandon that
obligation that wee owe to ſuch a Prince as
is either lawfull ſucceſſor to the deceaſed, or
els ſolemnly elected. Who is he that wil not
thinke the Biſhoppes of thoſe former tymes
that I ſpeake of to haue bene farre more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in their charge and better liuers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
moſt parte of ours? in reſpect whereof they
might euen with their credite only haue ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
perſwaded the people that thei gouerned,
for Religion and godlineſſe ſake, to haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled,
depoſed, and baniſhed thoſe hereticall
Emperours, aſwel as to haue admitted them
into that ſucceſſion that by the politick order
of the Empire was vnto them due, either to
obey, or yeeld them al fidelitie: was it want of
power, all the world being Chriſtian, euen in
the Prime of the Church about one hundred
yeeres after that the Temples of the Greeke
Idols had bene ſhut vp, whereby not ſo much
as the memorie of them remained among the
ſubiects of this great Monarchie? I will by
the way rehearſe vnto you a Decree of the
Church made for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poſteritie of Kings, leaſt
you ſhuld thinck me either to be led by affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:8630:60"/>
or to haue told you fables. Heare ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the wordes of the Fathers aſſembled in
a Counſaile. <hi>Like as the Inſolencie of wicked
Kings haue euermore bene odious and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to the ſubiects, ſo haue the people alwaies
liked wel of the prouident foreſight of the good:
who therefore could ſuffer or beholde a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
offending in that poinct, or that were deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to expell the posteritie or ligne Royall from
ſuch rights and dignities as thereto doe apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne?
Such dealing doe we therefore expreſſely
forbid, &amp; in fauour of the posteritie of the moſt
excellent Prince Chintillus, we doe renew and
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme the decree that was made the laſt yere
at the Synode houlden in this Church concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the loue and good will that euery one is
bound to beare to the Kings ligne, and to the
defence and preſeruation which all ſubiectes of
the Estate doe owe thereto, to the ende the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
be not maliciouſly defrauded of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
of their predeceſſors in the augmentation
of their Crowne, or their great liberalitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
their ſubiects. Alſo that none doe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
to hurt them, becauſe it is meete that by
the authoritie of a Counſaile we do grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t peace
to the ſucceſſion and poſteritie of thoſe by whoſe
meanes and vnder whoſe protection wee haue
aforetyme bene preſerued.</hi> Admit therfore that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:8630:60"/>
the Church made this Decree in reſpect of
that obligation that ſhe deemed the ſubiectes
ought to the poſteritie of their Kings, either
for the loue and reuerence of thoſe that had
well gouerned their Commonwealths: euen
as GOD, who is the author and holder vp of
Monarchies, would neuer take the Scepter
wholy from Iuda, for his ſeruaunt Dauids
ſake: yet if our ſelues would but call to mind
ſo many good Kings of this race, eſpecially
the father of the houſe of Bourbon, the Lorde
S. Lewes, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his good life the Church
hath canonized, and whoſe memorie ought to
be vnto vs holy &amp; honorable, we ſhould ſhewe
our ſelues moſt wicked, periurde, vnthankful
and diſloyall perſons, if wee ſhould ſeeke or
but make any countenaunce to thinke vpon
innouating any thing againſt this poſteritie.</p>
               <p>15 Good men are not ignorant of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
that theſe great bucklers of the faith
doe take hold of: which are, firſt that the King
of Nauarre being King, would polute, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
&amp; aboliſh Catholick Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in France,
and force his ſubiects to become huguenots.
But to ſay the trueth, this vizard is leſſe then
nothing: for his former behauiours will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
force vs to confeſſe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary: becauſe
our ſelues haue ſeene with what importuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb facs="tcp:8630:61"/>
he hath beſought our Kinges, as beeing
their ſubiect, and perſwaded them to ſuffer
him and his partakers to liue vnder their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
in all libertie of conſcience. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
then ſhould we thinke, that when he were
ſoueraign he would practize againſt his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
any enterprize repugnant to that lawe,
which himſelfe, being in their race, ſought to
enioye vnder the Kings, his Lords? Shal we
preſume that ſuch a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; wiſe Prince,
inſtructed in the feare of God, would become
a Tyrant &amp; torment the ſoules of his ſubiects
againſt that Religion, which with vniforme
conſent haue ſo many hundred yeres bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
in the Church? eſpecially conſidering
that himſelf could not abide to haue his owne
brought into bondage. Moreouer, with you,
ye trompets of ſedition, I doe agrée that then
he ſhould be no more able then now: that ſuch
as would perſwade him that the third part of
the French are Huguenots, are no good A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticians:
alſo that for our preſeruation
in that eſtate wherein we now liue, we neede
no more but to ſet againſt him our walles. I
would therefore aſke you what cauſe you
ſhould haue to feare that he would endeuour
to force you to liue in any other Religion the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the ſame wherein he find you and your ſelues
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8630:61"/>
doe deſire, when in ſo doing he may happen
to haue but euill ſucceſſe, and therewithall
loſe the loue of the whole worlde? were not
this as much as (according to the Prouerbe)
to goe about to ſhaue an Egge.</p>
               <p>16 As alſo the obiection that they make,
namely that in the lands of Bearne and low
Nauarre where he is ſoueraigne, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Apoſtolick Romiſh Religion is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
is in trueth full of ſubteltie, ſlaunder
and enuie: for hereunto he doth pertinently
(in my opinion) aunſwere, that in reſpect of
the land of Bearne, it was not he that forbad
it, neither are his aduerſaries able to proue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
inhibition thereof in his name, or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him,
but contrariwiſe he aſſureth himſelfe that it
will appeare that immediatly or ſoone after
the deceaſe of the late Queene of Nauarre
his mother, his Maieſtie by the Lord of Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mont,
diſpatched his Letters into the country
of Bearne, importing that his will was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
and therein to ſet vp againe the exercize
of the ſayd Religion: Vpon which comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
the States being aſſembled, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
to put the ſame in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, fearing ſuch
troubles and ſeditions as might enſue, the
people beeing haughtie, mutinous, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
enough to bee contented, together with
<pb facs="tcp:8630:62"/>
ſuch ſmall ſtore of Catholickes in the ſayde
Countrey to proſecute the execution thereof
if need ſhould require. What would you then
haue him to doe more? He did not the harme,
but we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t about to cure it, there was none that
deſired to take his medicine. What more can
the Phiſition doe to his Patient but prepare
him the potion which may bee to his health,
and for want of the which if he loſe himſelf, is
he not rather to blame his owne obſtinacie,
then him that could not make him take his
appointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For ſince that time, the Eſtates
beeing diuers tymes aſſembled in the ſayde
Countrey, did nener require his Maieſtie to
reſtore the ſayd Catholick Romiſh Religion,
which alwaies hee offered to doe, and ſtill ſo
long as he liue, wil, if they doe require it. As
for lowe Nauarre, the exercize of Catholicke
Religion is there moſt free: yea, which is
more, throughout that Countrey there is no
aſſembly of the pretended reformed Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
but onely in two places, as is moſt euidently
knowne, neither hath his Maieſtie innouated
any thing at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming throughout the ſayd
lands of Bearne or Nauarre. But what, is it
meete for theſe feares and friuolous doubtes
of a matter that neuer can come to paſſe, to
deſtroye this poore Realme with immortall
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:8630:62"/>
warres? and ſo make vs miſerable before the
tyme? crye out before we be touched? and to
haſten and aduaunce the ſorowes of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
miſchiefes? will you begin to crucifie
and tye vs to a Caucaſus for our whole life
tyme? or will you force vs here to begin our
hell? Is not the King (thankes bee to God)
yong enough, in good health, and of ſufficient
diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſee the raking both of the King
of Nauarre, and of the reſt of the Princes of
his age? why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould we miſtruſt the grace
of God?</p>
               <p>17 As for the Proteſtation that the ſayde
Lord King of Nauarre made the yere 1584.
in a Synode by the Miniſters of his Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
holden in the Towne of Montauban, wherby
he proteſted and declared that he would liue
and dye therein, and defend the ſame: I wot
not well why wee are ſo ſlye as for that cauſe
to blame him, or bee more vehement againſt
him then before, as in deede a number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
too much ouerruled with vnreaſonable
paſſions, haue miſliked it, and haue thervpon
gathered ſome ſiniſter iudgement of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the ſayd Lord King of Nauarre to
the Catholickes, whome moſt hartely I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
with me to conſider. Firſt, that his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
imported not the rooting of vs out,
<pb facs="tcp:8630:63"/>
neither together with vs the Religion of the
Romiſh Church, as the League doth him and
his partakers: ſo that his proteſtation is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
defenſiue, and could not therefore be more
gentle, for the which wee are rather to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
then to reproue him, ſith our ſelues are
bound daily to make the like profeſſion in the
Catholicke Apoſtolicke Romiſh Church: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
that euery faithfull Chriſtian is likewiſe
bound by the Sacrament of Baptiſme to
make the like declaration: eſpecially Kings
and Princes, who ought to be mirors &amp; ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takles
to their ſubiects: yea, the confeſſion of
their faith ſhould ſerue for a publick example
in the aſſemblies made for the Eſtate of the
Church, ſuch as are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Counſailes, Sinodes,
and other like, wherein it hath euermore bene
noted, that Emperours, Kings and Princes
thereat aſſiſtant, did make profeſſion of their
faithes, with proteſtation to defend the ſame.
Hereof wee haue for teſtimonie Conſtantine
the Great, in the Counſaile of Nice: Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſe
the Yonger, in the Counſaile of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:
Martian, in the Counſaile of Calcedon:
Iuſtinian the firſt, in the Counſaile of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople:
Charlemaigne, in the Counſaile
of Francfort, with infinite other Chriſtian
and Catholicke Princes. Sith therefore the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:8630:63"/>
King of Nauarre hath bene brought vp in
that Religion which he holdeth, and that the
King by his Edicts permitteth the free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cize
thereof throughout his Realme, why
ſhould wee miſlike that hee aſſiſting at an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
thereof, proteſteth to liue and dye in
the defence of the ſame? eſpecially ſeing that
it is no let, but that when by a lawfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile,
either generall or nationall, (which the
King and his Counſaile ſhall thincke moſt
ſufficient for that purpoſe) we ſhall haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
him not to bee caried awaye without
reaſon, hee may immediatly returne and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
that hee hath bene miſled, and that hee
weareth not the ſworde but for the defence of
the Romiſh Church, as now hee voweth the
vpholding of his owne. Moreouer, I would
that ſuch as are offended at the ſayd Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſhould know that the occaſion that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the ſayd Lorde King of Nauarre to bee
preſent at the ſayd aſſembly at Montauban,
was not ſmall, neither of ſmall importance to
the reputation of him and his Eſtate: for it is
not vnknowne to all that his enemies had
raiſed a ſpeech aſwell among al forraine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and throughout Europe, as alſo perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culerly
in this Realme, that the ſayde Lorde
King of Nauarre, had put from about his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb facs="tcp:8630:64"/>
the Miniſters of his Religion: that hee
went to Maſſe: to be briefe, that to the ende
by the death of the late Mounſier the Duke,
to inſinuate himſelfe further in his Maieſties
fauour, and to bee neerer vnto him he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined

                  </gap>llicie both to bring him into ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with his owne partakers, and into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
among the Catholickes: ſo as by that
meanes both parts might haue forſaken and
deſpiſed him, and ſo he might become a pray
to their fayned League, as a man light, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant,
and of ſmall ſtedfaſtneſſe, which is
one of the chiefeſt things that euery Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Prince ought to abhorre, eſpecially in cauſes
of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which we may not lightly cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge,
neither without great notice of the cauſe, and
the diſcourſe thereof publickly argued in the
Church of God, but eſpecially in our awne
conſciences. Wherefore good men neither
ought, ne ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> miſlike that the ſayd Lord King
of Nauarre doth proteſt to liue and dye in his
Religion, permitted vnder the Kings autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
by his Maieſties Edicts, publiſhed euen
by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> decree of the States of the Realm: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are wee to terme him an hereticke or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate
perſon, vntill wee haue lawfully by a
free vniuerſall or nationall Counſaile, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:8630:64"/>
ſhall ſeeme moſt expedient) condemned
that opinion which he holdeth. Will ye like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
that I ſhewe you what miſtruſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes
may conceiue of his goodneſſe and
ſinguler clemencie? Then would I pray the
moſt paſſionate to conſider and looke vpon
his famelie: They ſhall finde the ſame to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
for the moſt part of Catholicke Officers.
But of what ſorte? Euen ſuch as are neereſt
about his perſon, who haue him in their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
vpon their honors and conſciences, to whom
he committeth himſelfe, and vpon whom of
himſelf he doth depend, as vpon his keepers,
Maiſters of his Guardrobe, Stewardes, and
many others, who before his face with his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and contentation being in his trayne, do
ordinarely go to the Maſſe, &amp; aſſiſt at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
Seruice miniſtred after the maner of
the Catholick Romiſh Church. To be brief,
euen with this qualitie he acknowledgeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
for his good, faithfull and loyall ſeruants.
This could they not aſſure themſelues of, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet ſerue him with good hearts, beeing
ſuch men of honor as they are, if in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiours
they could perceiue any miſtruſt
(which is the nource of hatred and mallice)
againſt the profeſſors of their Religion, or if
they could finde (which were eaſie to doe) that
<pb facs="tcp:8630:65"/>
he did euill entreate or forbid them to ſerue
God after their maner, and ſo ſought to bee
the tormentor of their conſciences. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
al theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderations alledged againſt
the King of Nauarre, which are neither true
neither of any outwarde apparence, cannot
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences of good men, &amp; truely Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch,
debarre him from beeing ſufficient and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the Crowne of France: yea further, I
ſay that the ſame notwithſtanding, he is your
true and lawfull King, to whome onely you
are bound to obeye in cace during his life, the
ſayde occaſion of ſubſtitution ſhould fall out,
which God forbid, and which alſo neither he
ne wee ought or ſhould deſire, if either wee
were Chriſtians, either els did beare any iot
of hartie good will or affection to our King.</p>
               <p>18 To proceede, let vs ſee whether a king
houlding the Scepter, or raigning ouer any
eſtate, eſpecially ouer ours, may appoint and
nominate any other ſucceſſor then him whom
nature and the Lawe of the Realme haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
him. This queſtion I do not moue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cauſe, for in trueth the perturbers of the
peace of this Crowne, and ſuch as iniuſtly do
pretend to ſet thereinto a foote, haue made a
League which they entitle <hi>Holy.</hi> but al good

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:8630:65"/>
the Spanierd and the Sauoyan, the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
enemies to France and the Royall blood
thereof, through whoſe helpe they hope to lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy
an Army, wherwith to come into the hart
of the Realme, onely, ſay they, ſimply to ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
the moſt Chriſtian King to name a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor

miſchiefe! to ſeeke to force vs to enfringe
the ſucceſſiue lawe of this Realme, whereof
we haue ſo many worldes enioyed the bleſſed
good hap? What impudency thoſe that haue
not almoſt whereof to liue in their owne hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
to goe about to preuent and ouerthrowe
the order and Eſtate of ſo great an Empire?
This is a wonderfull bouldneſſe, to ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour

the French King, and their owne lorde being
yong, healthy, and ſuch a one as it if pleaſe

yea ſuch a-one as would not for the getting of

finding them ſelues in Armes, might haſten

Ambition and deſire to Raigne vndertake?
Moreouer, I doe moſt humbly beſeech his

               <p>19 Sith therefore the people and ſubiects

neither diſpence vppon whatſoeuer occaſion

three benefites repugnant to the other:
which are, forgiueneſſe of ſinnes: the cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

in the Church of God to keepe, teach,
and maintaine our ſoules in the knowledge
of his holy will, to the ende thereby to obteine
his grace and fauour in the life to come. For
notwithſtanding man was created to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage

wherein it pleaſed God to breake and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the vayle and rigor of the auncient law,
and to forgiue our offences through the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of his deare Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, for the

vs in pledge his holy Sacraments, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations

hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted and ſent his Apoſtles, Prieſtes

ſufficiently to teach vs thoſe things that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayne
to our faith and beliefe, reforming
our actions by admonitions and gentle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions,
that thereby together with Gods
grace, wee may atteyne to euerlaſting ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
neither hath God giuen them any other

               <p>21 But in aſmuch as the people haue not
to deale therewith, alſo that the Biſhoppe of

meerely and ſimply Spirituall, and in no

what ſhal we then ſay if Emperours or other

to ſee them raigne with all power, and be as

that he may graunt priuiledge to ſome

our king, it is not lawfull for the Pope, or any
Biſhop whatſoeuer, to excommunicate either
towne, or communaltie ſubiect to the Realm
of Fraunce. By reaſon whereof in the yeere
1488. the Atturney generall appealed as of
abuſe from the excommunication that the
Pope had laid vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Inhabitants of Gau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
becauſe they had dealt hardly with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
Maximilian their Earle, and Vaſſall
to the King of Fraunce, to whome onely hee
ought to haue had recourſe, as vnto his Lord,
for remedie: the Pope hauing no authoritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the ſubiects of this Crowne. To y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſame
ende alſo Charles the fifth by an Edict vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in his Parliament in the yeere 1369. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely
forbad all Biſhops, and Prelates, for
whatſoeuer cauſe, to lay the ſentence of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vpon any Towne, Communaltie,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:8630:79"/>
Colledge, or body corporate of his Realme,
the ſame beeing vnder the onely correction
and power of himſelfe, and of none other in
the world: which Edict was alſo renewed by
Lewes the 11. in the yeere 1467. whereof is
growne a cuſtome inuiolably obſerued in
France, as the Oracle of Apollo, of Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as of abuſe in the Court of Parliament
againſt the Pope and his Cleargie: without
which remedy, the Prieſtes would in France
erect an other and more mightie Monarchie
then the Kings, for the maintenance and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of the which al good Frenchmen ought
rather to dye then ſuffer it to be diminiſhed.
So, that the Pope and Biſhops can proceede
no further, then to excommunication of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler
perſons, according to the order of old
tyme obſerued by the holy Decrees and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall
conſtitutions. Thus to conclude,
you ſee how to proceede againſt Kings and

I thinke not but ſuch decrees proceeded
of a meruelous paſſion of the Popes of thoſe

vpon the Decretals, being of a contrary
aduice, doe alledge great difficulties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon,

expounde them, in cace by the ſentence of

that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſubiects ſhall be diſcharged of all right
of vaſſelage: otherwiſe they doe iudge the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
not to be extinct or diminiſhed by the
excommunication of their Lord, which laſt in
ſundry conſiderations full of Religion and
ciuill pietie ſeemeth to be of great appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
and too too true. Firſt, that we are bound to

tendeth not in worldly matters to

whether it be lawfull for a King or

Phillip of France, doubted not to bend them

vntill King Phillip aſſembled the Prelates
of Fraunce, by whoſe ſentence he was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a Sciſmaticke, Hereticke, inuader of the

concurring with the generall Counſailes of

the Church a greater deformation: and to
make the King of Fraunce his Serieant or

ſuch a one as ſhould haue no authoritie to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

earneſtly doe proſecute that publication of

that they are French men: but rather that

Thus doe you ſeee, howe by the aduice and
iudgement of the honeſteſt &amp; greateſt French
Catholikes, liuing vnder the traditions of
the Romiſh Church, this Counſaile of Trent
may not be accompted other then a notorious
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:8630:97"/>
conſpiracie and coniuration againſt the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
and dignitie of this Crowne, aud of
the Subiectes thereof, of whatſoeuer calling
that ſhall find them ſelues offended, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſhould greatly iniury any one of ours
of whatſoeuer eſtate, in calling him Heretick,
for not obeying, ſubmitting him ſelfe, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
againſt his Countrey, to the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
conſpiracies of the Pope, and ſtraungers
that doe enuie the greatneſſe of this Eſtate.
Eſpecially the King of Nauarre, whome the
matter chieflieſt doth concerne, ſhould haue
greateſt cauſe to be agrieued, in reſpect that
at this day he hath the Honor to be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
branch of the Royall tree of France, and
ſo conſequently more neerely bound then any
other to preſerue and mainteyne the rightes,
liberties and dignities of this glorious and
redoubtable Monarchie.</p>
               <p>56 Moreouer the ſayd Lord King of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre
demaundeth of you, by vertue of what
doe you eſteeme hym an Heretick and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat
parſon? For it is certaine, that he onely
may be tearmed an Heretick, who vpholdeth
a falſe doctrine contrary to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the ould and newe Teſtament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
amiſſe in any one of the Articles of
our faith, as did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Manicheans, Neſtorians,
<pb facs="tcp:8630:98"/>
Sabellians, Arrians and their like. Now to
ſay trueth, they would perſwade vs, that the
opinion houlden by the ſaide Lorde King of
Nauarre was monſtrous: we haue bene hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
after them like Dogges: wee haue
bene forbidden their company as of infidels
and miſcreants. I beſeech you therefore, let
vs carefully looke into the confeſſion of their
faith, and we ſhall find them Chriſtians, ſuch
as agree with vs in the articles of our belief:
doe worſhip the ſame God: ſeeking ſaluation
in the ſame Ieſus Chriſt: Chrildren of the
ſame father: beleeuing the ſame Bible, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them ſelues in the ſame Goſpell, as in
the ſame Buckler of their faith: requiring
part in the ſame inheritance and in vertue of
the ſame Teſtament, as we. The whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie
betweene them and vs conſiſteth in
that, that they finding many mens additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and conſtitutions in the Church, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the ſimple and pure ordenances of the
Goſpell, doe craue pourging and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in cace of refuſall thereof for feare
of their ſoules and deſire of ſaluation haue
withdrawn themſelues, as men content with
the ſimple forme ordeyned in the Primitiue
Church, &amp; wee haue thought that ſauing our
conſciences wee may ſtay therein attending
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:8630:98"/>
neceſſary reformation. Either of vs ſeeke ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
and tend to one ende, and by the ſame
meanes are all one and the ſame woorke of
Gods hand: all faithfull ſeruants in the faith
in one Baptiſme: all Grapes of one Vine:
yea, all braunches of one Grape: wee muſt
therefore knowe why one ſhould be an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
rather then an other, ſith wee are all of
like faith: vſe like bookes: &amp; tend to like end.
This is it (in my iudgement) that cauſeth the
King of Nauarre to complaine, that wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
he is termed an Hereticke, before his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
hath bene condemned in a free, holy,
and determined Counſaile, whereat euery
one may ſafely appeare. As for the obſtinacie
to him obiected, I would weete for what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
hee ſhould in this cauſe bee obſtinate?
what good? what aduancement? what peace?
what eaſe may he therein hope for? He hath
habandoned the Courte of his Soueraigne
Lord the King: he hath long through the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telties
and ſlaunders of his enimies, bene out
of his fauour, which is the miſhap that with
greateſt impatience he hath borne: Hee hath
bene depriued of moſt of his houſes: alwaies
in the fielde: ſometimes badly prouided, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
enuironed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; his life in a thouſand daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
where as otherwiſe he had bene aſſured
<pb facs="tcp:8630:99"/>
at his Maieſties handes of all fauour, amitie,
honor, peace, and humaine felicitie. Any man
therefore of iudgement can neuer be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that this Prince, whom in other matters
we know to be wiſe and diſcrete, would haue
choſen to haue ſpent the moſt parte of the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of his youth in miſerie and perpetuall
care, only vpon a contradictorie and obſtinate
mind, not proceeding other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the honor of God and the ſaluation of
his ſoule. Moreouer, beſides the infinite abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the ſayd Counſayle, whereby it is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
none, it is not vnknowne to al men that
in France the King of Nauarre is not ſuch a
one, as by the policie of the Realme ought to
bee depriued of the ſucceſſion of the Crowne
when it ſhould fall to him: becauſe thoſe of
his partie liuing therein vnder the Kings
good liking and obedience are not incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to enter vppon all kinde of goodes and
inheritances which to them may apperteyne
either naturally, or ciuilly, according to the
lawes commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly receiued in this Monarchie,
by the ordenances of the generall Eſtates of
the ſame, as the ſubiects thereof doe knowe
&amp; ordinarely it is adiudged in the ſoueraigne

and other is all one. Theſe bee the effects of
the reaſons, which euery one according to his
capacitie may extend, whereby the ſayd Lord
King of Nauarre ſayth and vphouldeth that
he is no Hereticke. Firſt, the lawe and decree
whereon the enemies ground their ſlaunder,
which is the Counſayle of Trent, is argued
of diuers nullities. That we muſt accoumpt
of it as of foreiudgements, for <hi>the force of law
is to be maeinteyned vntill the cauſe of Nullitie
be decided:</hi> with this exception, <hi>Quod praeiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium

the moſt Chriſtian King and Soueraigne
Courtes did neuer approue the ſayde Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile,
as it is moſt certaine and euident. So
that although the nullities thereof might bee
couered vnder a conſequent approbation of
the Counſaile, yet could not that take place
in this Realme, which, by the teſtimonie of
the Popes themſelues is not bound to take
<pb facs="tcp:8630:100"/>
law or to accommodate it ſelf to the ſentence,
publication or pleaſure of any Prince or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate
whatſoeuer in the world. Let therfore
the Spanyard or Sauoian co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pell their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
to liue according to the decrees therof,
yet haue not the moſt Chriſtian King and his
Parliaments preſcribed it for a lawe to them
ſelues. Beſides, to come more perticulerly
thereto, the King of Nauerre, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
he bee a Chriſtian King and ſoueraigne
Prince, and ſo acknowledged by his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
eſpecially by the Pope, yet was he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſummoned or heard in the ſayde Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile,
ſo that conſequently the decrees and
iudgements there paſſed are not deemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, to binde him, either to force him
to the obſeruing of the ſame. Againe, admit
hee had bene heard, alſo that the lawe of the

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:8630:100"/>
to ſende euen the ranckeſt thiefe in the

vpon one of the greateſt Chriſtian Princes
that Heauen hath permitted to bee borne, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of ruling you whenſoeuer it ſhal pleaſe
God to permit? or depriue him of that right
which Nature hath giuen him, without hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
or ſummons, either vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of his
reazons? Is the maner to proceede in ſuch
cauſes, to come with the ſworde drawne and
force men to beleue you, at whatſoeuer price?
Wil you be his Iudges, that be his enemies,
and are armed to depriue him of his life and
goodes? Shall the Pope, whoſe reformation
is chiefly in queſtion, bee his partie? No, no,
Warres and weapons were neuer meanes
to atteyne to vnion. If one be in the darke,

If he be infected he muſt be waſhed, not drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
If he bee ſicke, tende him, ende him not:
Who ſo will reunite the Church, muſt ſeeke
to bring backe thoſe that are out of the way,
and to call againe ſuch as haue ſtrayed: for
on the other ſide, warre and rigour tendeth to
ſtay and roote them out, not to bring them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
but to make them to be no more at all,
which in deede is a remedie worſe then the

diſeaſe. For ſo me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may ſay we haue but a bad
cauſe in hand, when in liew of reaſon we haue
recourſe to force. But Chriſtians, what muſt
ye then do? as men capable of reaſon ye muſt
conuince the King of Nauarrre, and all that
be of his opinion by apparant reaſons. For
the vnderſtanding whereof, aſſemble the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
Church, &amp; ſo conſequently the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

In ſuch an aſſembly denounce him an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke:
excommunicate him: or deale otherwiſe

               <p>27 It is requiſite, ſaye you, to roote out

for if wee flatter not our ſelues, this is their

theſe men of God embraced conſpiraties

their Lord. The King, ſay our Cenſors, muſt
reforme himſelfe: but we muſt not tell him ſo
with weapons, reprouing and iniurying his
Maieſtie by worde, writing and deede, yea by
captiuating his affections, and forcing him
to hate that which he loueth, as if hee were
not a man capable of the loue of thoſe whom
perticulerly hee acknowledgeth for his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſeruants. This were a miſerable ſtate for
a King, to be forced to hate where he loueth,
and to loue where he would hate: to bee able
to doe what he would not, and to deſire to doe
that he cannot: to be briefe, to be a ſlaue to the
enuies, ſtrifes and diuerſities of his ſubiects.
It is too much: euen the greateſt Ariſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians
cannot like of it. Whervpon I would
fayne aſke theſe reformers, what made them
ſo rich and mightie as now to vndertake to
raiſe warre againſt their King: but euen the
exceſſiue benefites of his Predeceſſors &amp; him
ſelfe? What place doth or may the ſtatelieſt
of them hold in France, but of meane Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:8630:102"/>
and ſuch as it hath pleaſed the King to
loue? Were they not our Kings that haue
aduanced them, and mainteined them in their
wealth? wherefore then doe they ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
the good hap of thoſe who haue no other
beginning or aduauncement then ſuch as vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
themſelues on? Why doe they ſo much
miſlike that the King ſhould loue the Lorde
Duke of Eſpernon, or any other, like as his
predeceſſors fauoured their au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceſters? Know
they not that all things haue their time, their
beginning, progreſſe, encreaſe, and end? what
further fauour doe they hope for at the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,
whom they would cauſe the King to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
by prouiſion? ſith in the meane tyme
they ſuborne his ſubiects, yea ſo farr to turne
them from receiuing any Garniſon on his
behalfe? and ſpread a brute among the people
that there yet remaine ſome of the race of the
auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Gods worthy to rule ouer them? To
bee briefe, they take the courſe too truely to
fulfill the propheſie of the late King Frances
our Kings Grandfather, whom many hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
perſons did many times heare ſaye,
that <hi>if they vſed the ſeruice of thoſe who now

theſe Maſtiues haue ſo well learned to

Call to minde ye Frenchmen, a true ſaying
of Sainct Auſten, importing, that <hi>it is vnpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for that Counſaile to bee blameleſſe, whoſe
meanes, ende, and effects are vile, vicious, and
reprehenſible.</hi> Neither is it Religion or pietie
that ſtirreth them vp, but a South winde and
Spaniſh heate, wherwith they be driuen, that

for the King of Wiſigotes wholy to
ſubdue the King of Nauarre and to deſtroye
him, whatſoeuer it coſt, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to loſe all his low
Countries, which by that onely meanes hee

generally of the whole Spaynes, and moſt
of his other Lordſhips, whereof he might ſtand
in great feare, if GOD ſhould permit him to
haue ſo ſtrong and mightie an enemie as the
King of France. Let not therefore the moſt
Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Maieſtie, and the King of Nauarre,
flatter themſelues, but bee aſſured that the
Piedmontain and the Pope with their parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
are determined to doe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Spaniard that

Maieſtie of our King, who haue riſen and doe

whereat the King beeing moued, as at a moſt

and then cloked this goodly deede, leaſt

the Kings brother, and to what end, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
whom the forwardeſt had bene trayned vp in
the Schole of theſe perturbers of our peace,
as being their creature, witneſſe that nowe
he is with them, and then vſed all his ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to plonge that yong Prince in all vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſſe,
lechery and heate of youth: yea
hee did better his buſineſſe: for hee betrayed
him to the King of Spaine, &amp; ſould the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard
to the States, and the Huguenotes to
all others. Whereby hee made money of all
with the price of the honor, reputation and life
of his Maieſtie, or rather of all France. The
like did alſo three or foure other bad parſons,
who all had bene brought vp, and were giuen
to his highneſſe by one ſelfe hand, to the ende
to habandon hym for a praye, to the firſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce
that might happen, among a greate
number that night and day they deuiſed for
the atteining to their entents: yea they went
ſo farre as to ſet him at debate with the King

that were neere to either of them, to cauſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and bloud to liue in miſtruſt of it ſelfe, ſo
to procure the ruine and loſſe of one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or of both togither, and with them of this
miſerable Realme. During which their
ſleightes, they did neuertheleſſe perticulerly
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:8630:105"/>
thinck vpon the king, whom when they found
to be merueylous zealous in Catholike reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
they began to practiſe ſome Spaniſh
workemen to drawe vnto him, and vnder the
vaile of Religion to bewitch him, and ſo who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endeuoured themſelues, if they could, to
haue caſt him headlong into ſome miſhap, as
great as the ſame wherein they ꝓlonged poore
King Sebaſtian of Portugall, who by ſuch
meanes ſerued for a warme breakefaſt to the
Spaniſh King, and got hym a faire corner of
lande through the ſubtelties of the Spaniſh
Ieſuites, concurring with the Portingal Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites,
or peraduenture both co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpired againſt
the eſtate of that poore yong King, ſo to cauſe
hym deſperatly to venture hym ſelfe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he dyed, &amp; with him the Scepter of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall,
which vndoubtedly God had long vſed
to the great benefite &amp; bleſſe of all Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Theſe were the driftes of the good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of our Kings, who (thanked bee God)
was more circumſpect and wary to put from
about him ſuch wicked ſpirites. Certainly it
is moſt neceſſary and expedient for a King to
be Chriſtian, deuout, zealous of Catholicke
faith, and to feare God: but withall it is moſt
daungerous for his perſon and Eſtate, if hee
become ſuperſticious and an hypocrite. Firſt
<pb facs="tcp:8630:106"/>
he thereby loſeth all iudgement to diſcerne
the enuious friends or enemies to his Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
then he forgetteth the principall cauſe for
the which he is a King: which is the care and
gouernement of his people, for the exercize
whereof onely he is bound, choſen and bound
to ſerue God in that miniſterie: laſtly, in the
world that we liue in, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the moſt corrupt
ſoules that euer were, the whole worlde doth
miſtruſt and wonderfully ſuſpect him whom
they ſee make ſo great a ſhewe, whether for
enuy that euery one beareth to his more then
common zeale, either els for that in trueth it
often falleth out, that things of greateſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance
conteyne leaſt trueth. Now then,
theſe malicious perſons haue but one onely
ſubtile entent left, which alſo it is meete for
the people to knowe. For yet they goe reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
gently about their matters, and doe
giue out that they require onely abolition of
the Edicts of pacification, and to procure the
exercize of one onely Religion in France, to
the ende vnder that pretence to embarke the
King, and almoſt to force him (as aforetyme,
fearing leaſt the ouer long peace of this
Realme ſhould cloſe vp the paſſed vlcers, they
had done) to breake off that amitie and good
wil which it pleaſed him to ſhewe to the King
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:8630:106"/>
of Nauarre, and thoſe of the pretended refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Religion, ſo that by ſuch meanes they
will cauſe him with the ſworde that he ſhould
holde in one of his hands to cut off the other:
wherof muſt enſue the loſſe and ſworne death
of the ſayde Lorde King of Nauarre, againſt
whoſe perſon perticulerly, as beeing their
principall mark, they are determined to arme
themſelues. After whoſe end alſo, if the King
(of whom they ſhall then ſtand no longer in
neede) will not in the meane tyme dye, either
through melancholy, or choller, &amp; ſo ſpeedely
quit them his roume, they knowe in their
Italian League Articifers enough to ſende
him into Abrahams boſome: whereby they
ſhall for ſo many good and commendable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices
done to our France, bee thought more
worthy to be crowned then now, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
at this preſent they cauſe ouer loude to
bee ſong their pretended merites by all the
Spaniſh pentioners, and feede Spyes in the
Court, at whoſe mouthes they ſet out their
woundes receiued in the waſting of this
Crowne, after the maner of the auncient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,
who exhibited themſelues naked to
the people in beggiug the Suffrages of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
and offices. Thus when through their
wiſedome they ſhal haue killed the King and
<pb facs="tcp:8630:107"/>
the King of Nauarre, who are y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> two thornes
that trouble their feete, for the one they will

with an abſolution ſealed in leade in the

This is the whole ſtory which thoſe that loue

deſire of thoſe, who, if they maye finde

For if it be Religion, for the which they ſeme
to bring you into the fielde, your ſelues doe
knowe that our Kinges haue not ſpared life,
ſtate, meanes, or friendes for the remedying
thereof within theſe fiue and twentie yeeres:
which notwithſtanding, what effect haue ſo
many murders, ſuch plentie of battailes, and
ſuch ſtore of bloud ſpilt, wrought? Weene you

You know they were chiefe of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties
Counſaile, Leaders of their Armyes,
or rather, authors of all paſſed miſchiefes: en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteyning
the King in that will and opinion
wherein he then was, namely, that weapons

to tollerate it, (ſith we all agree in one belief
and Creede of the Apoſtles,) then to hazarde
his whole Eſtate, by weening to heale vp a
wounde, which God willing, maye by daylie
conuerſation bee ſuppled: for vndoubtedly
ſome diſeaſes are of ſuch a nature, that it is
more expedient for the Patient to beare the
griefe thereof, then for his cure to vſe ouer
daungerous and doubtfull remedies, whoſe
tryall is more ſharpe and intollerable the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the

peaceable Prince, theſe zelators of their own
wealth, rather then of Chriſtianitie being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
doe now euidently ſhewe their bad

of the people, vpon the deformations of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
and vpon the diſtribution of Dignities,
notwithſtanding all men knowe, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the laſt they are better prouided, and
haue greater cauſe to praiſe the parting, then
to complaine of that honor that the King hath
done them. As for the reſt, themſelues are the
onely cauſe of all miſchiefe, engendred by ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
warres, which euer ſince the reſolution
vpon their forecaſt thei haue nouriſhed in this

mother of pietie, eſtabliſhment of Iuſtice, and

wherwith our moſt Chriſtian and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

and monſters borne in this Commonwealth,
for the nouriſhing and bringing vp of whom
I feare wee may bee called enemies to God
and our owne nature, which by companying
with theſe wilde beaſtes we doe corrupt. But
to returne to our purpoſe. Concerning the
hereſie falſly pretended againſt the King of
Nauarre, although the reaſons aforeſayd bee
moſt true, waightie, and ſuch as can haue no
contrary aunſwere vailable, yet as a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:8630:110"/>
I do moſt humbly beſeech the ſaid King
of Nauarre, diligently to thinck vpon his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres,
yea, although in his minde hee could
conceiue no other conſideration then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation
and peace of ſo much people (in that
he by whom the offence commeth is accurſed
of God) whether he ſhal not more grieuouſly
offende God and his owne conſcience, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a cloake and prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſo many miſeries
to his Countrey and the French nation, for
whoſe defence he is borne, then with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and common cuſtome of old receiued, in
erring, if there be any error therein. Let him
alſo iudge whether he bee not bound to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
before God, for the liues of ſo many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who through his occaſion ſhal periſh, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
for the blaſphemies that conſequently will
be committed. Let him aduiſe himſelfe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee were not better to doe as the good
and gentle Houſeholder, who ſometimes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
the ſeueritie of his age to play with
his children, and with clemencie giueth them
ſpace to meaſure the force of his amitie excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
their inſolent youth and bolde raſhneſſe,
ioyning and going cloſe with them: after the
example of the wiſe and well aduiſed Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,
when his people were moſt obſtinatly
reſolued to oppoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues directly againſt
<pb facs="tcp:8630:111"/>
his meaning. For my parte (Sir) I beſeech
your Maieſtie to giue mee leaue to tell you
that all good Frenchmen, true Catholickes,
and faithfull ſubiects to you &amp; this Crowne,
doe euen in humaine reaſon greatly bewayle
the ſtate of our poore Fraunce, in ſeeing that
your enemies are ſo well at eaſe, or doe (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture)
nouriſh about your Maieſtie ſome
ſuch perſons as keepe their vizarde from bee
plucked off. For in truth (Sir) it lyeth in you
through the grace of the holy Ghoſt, to yeeld
more fruite to the Church of GOD, (for the
aduauncement whereof you haue hetherto
thought to fight,) and more ouer to procure
your ſelfe to bee eſteemed more profitable,
commodious, and honorable to all, by plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
peace in time in this Realm, and giuing
an example to the reſt of Chriſtiandom, with
aſſurance to the King that raigneth ouer you
and his ſubiects who looke vpon you by your
good life, and gentle common conuerſation,
which in all other actions your aduerſaries
them ſelues doe ſeeme to confeſſe, then by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other worldly meanes that you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chooſe.
Beſides, that it is an vndoubted and political
maxime, miſlike it who will, that it is not for
Kings, who haue authoritie and gouernment
ouer ſo many ſeuerall braynes, which GOD
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:8630:111"/>
may reſerue vnto you, if it ſo pleaſe him, or he
be ſo determined in his priuate counſaile, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the Deuilles do rage, to ſet
other where then in their Cloſets, vpon any
of theſe extremities: becauſe it would bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to toyne and compoſe theſe together,
eſpecially in the world wherin you are borne,
wherein alſo your ſelfe doe well knowe, and
haue by domeſticall examples learned, that it
behoueth you and all other the Princes in
this world, to bow to make your ſelues to be
obeyed, &amp; to preſerue your eſtates by meanes
more then artificial, and ful of humaine wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
in reſpect of the frowarneſſe, peeuiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

perticulerly in this caſe, wherein our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
enemies haue for theſe 25. yeeres accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
the French nation to the vſe of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
and the veryeſt fooles, (of whom there

finde moſt meete to receiue the obiect of their
trayterous and diſloyall ambition: together
that by this meanes they ſhould diminiſh the
loue of the people to their King, perſwading
the moſt paſſionate that the fault was in him
why Fraunce had no greater peace, vnder
which pretence they haue ſpued forth and by
their creatures diſperſed abroade an infinite

But the ende of their intents doe now ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently

               <p>2 In his reſpect I will onely ſay, that the

the ſame, as one that contented himſelf

which iuſtly he might haue made, as King of

did euer employ any other then to the ſeruice

to roote them out, either the withſtanding of

pleaſed his Maieſtie to ſtretch forth his arme
to them, and to offer them ſuch conditions of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:8630:117"/>
peace as himſelf liked of, with libertie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
he hath not onely together with them
vnarmed himſelfe, and yeelded his Houldes
into the handes and power of his Maieſtie,
and fallen downe at his feete, but which is
more, haue returned their whole power toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
againſt thoſe that haue come to his and
their ſuccour, (witneſſe the ſiege of Newha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen)
and haue diſunited themſelues from all
confederaties and Leagues, which in reſpect
thereof they were entered into with ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and all this to the ende to ſubmit them
ſelues to the Kings good will, who hath liked
thereof, and ſo confeſſed in all his Edictes of
Pacification, with other the perticuler good
deedes and fauours, which the ſayde King of
Nauarre confeſſeth to haue receiued of the
hand and good will of his Maieſtie, who hath
freely and liberally for the wealth of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
permitted to thoſe of the ſayd Religion,
the free exercize thereof, notwithſtanding the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpired enemies to this Crowne, and to the
Princes of the bloud, haue often gone about
to bring into ſuſpition the actions, not onely
of the ſayd Lord King of Nauarre, but alſo of
all other the Princes of Bourbon, who onely
of the Royall famelie doe remaine. Beſides,
I aſſure my ſelfe if any man would endeuour
<pb facs="tcp:8630:118"/>
(as it were neceſſary and meete) by effectual
reazo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s debated in a lawful aſſembly of Gods
Church, to enforme the ſayde Lorde King of
Nauarre, that hetherto hee hath bene decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
and that his bringing vp in his Religion
hath bene very bad, hee is not obſtinate, but
eaſely may be reduced and brought to ſubmit
himſelfe to ſentence giuen by force of Gods
worde. In the meane tyme, we cannot blame
him who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his mother hath nourſed &amp; brought
vp in a certaine Religion, publickly permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by his Maieſties Edicts and ordenances,
for ſtanding firme in the ſame, and deſiring to
continue in that which he beleueth to belong
to his ſaluation. O Frenchmen, is it meete
the Kings Edicts ſhould ſtand the wicked in
ſtead of a bayt, to roote out, &amp; with the ſword
or guile more then barbarous to deſtroye, the
hearts &amp; liues of the Princes, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath
graunted to bee borne ouer vs? Will wee
graunt that to force that belongeth to reaſon?
In my opinion, we deceiue our ſelues, if we
weene by weapons to wreſt any thing from
Mars: eſpecially in whatſoeuer concerneth
Religion, which among honeſt and the beſt
men goeth nearer, and is of greater efficacie
then all other humaine actions. So as to the
contrary, I doe ſtedfaſtly beleeue that wee
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:8630:118"/>
haue the more cauſe to hope well of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
of the ſaid Lord King of Nauarre,
if it ſhould happen: For ſith his enemies are
forced to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that of himſelf he is a Prince
wiſe, well taught, diſcreete, and reaſonable,
alſo that our ſelues ſee him aſſured and by
weapons in expugnable, in that which from
his infancie hee hath bene perſwaded to bee
good for him, in reſpect of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> feare that he hath
of God, how great a peece of the work ſoeuer
offereth it ſelf to his view, or whatſoeuer hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
hazard there be any apparance that he
ſhould feare in the conſeruation of a mightie
earthly Kingdome, whereof as yet he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptiue
heire, it is an inuincible argument
for vs to knowe, that hee loueth and feareth
God aboue all things. Let vs therefore giue
him a taſte of our reaſons, ſith he is ſo very ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
to the ende we may at his hand winne
that we deſire, and which wee ought and may
ſpedely hope for, without perticulerly hating
his perſon: without offending him, without
prouoking him, and without encurring the
wrath of God, by procuring the ſhedding of
the innocent bloud of ſo many thouſands of
our brethren, and together with them the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
of our poore Countrey. As yet in
troth it is too great an abuſe to terme the ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:8630:119"/>
Lord King of Nauarre a Rebell, or Traytor
to the Kings Maieſtie, for keeping himſelfe
from being ſlayne, and for oppoſing to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
the walles of thoſe, who being ſhado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
in their owne houſes, did onely withall
inſtance, and moſt humble petition require
the King to permit them to liue in peace of

know neuer to haue ſo much loued any thing
as to liue his Maieſties moſt humble &amp; moſt

are eye witneſſes, neither neede we
any greater proofe for the iuſtification of him
who neither doth, neither euer did deſire of
the King his Lorde, any other thing then to
liue in his good fauour, and to bee of him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpted
a moſt humble, and moſt obedient
ſubiect and kinſman.</p>
               <p>3 For this cauſe, in this action let al good
Frenchmen co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, that the ſayd Lord King
of Nauarre is, as they, the Kinges good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
a Chriſtian, one that feareth God, and a
louer of his Countrey, ſo as for his ſake wee
neede not take armes or beate our braynes,
as doe ſome that be perſwaded by the wicked
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:8630:119"/>
counſaile of theſe firebrandes: he is the ſonne
of the famely: he is not a Spaniard that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to your walles, and to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doores of your
houſes: he is a true Frenchman, one that deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
peace, and one that would obey the King
his Lord, in whatſoeuer lyeth in him: he is a
louer of the lawes of the Realme, a ſworne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
to the ſedicious, an oppreſſor of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and a defender of the Commonwealth.
Beſides, he hath aboue all other the French
nation the honor to bee the firſt Prince of the
bloud royal, &amp; heire apparant to the Crowne,
in caſe God ſhould cal our King without lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
any iſſue male of his body. Let euery
one therefore conſider, that al his enemies ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections
are but meere cauillations: Let the
French nation iudge whether they haue not
more cauſe, or are not greatlier bound to loue
and acknowledge the King of Nauarre, then

and of them was borne a Sonne of the ſame

At his deceaſe hee left two Daughters, of

Of that mariage came Gaſton of Foix that

haue recourſe to God by hartie praier, that
if the ſayd Lorde King of Nauarre, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

we are vppon the poynt to beare if wee be ſo
wicked, periured and diſloyall, as to preferre
ſtraungers and enemies to our Crowne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our naturall Princes, to whom we haue
ſolemnly ſworne our faith before God, &amp; who
for theſe 600, yeres haue ſo gratiouſly gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

which Iephta Iudge of Iſrael obiected to

               <p>4 For contrariwiſe, our King and Princes
of Bourbon who are all of one bloud, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended

Iuglers would faſty pretend the original of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Lorrains: euen as he alſo was of the race of
the Merouingians. Pope Innocent the third
writing to the Nobles &amp; Prelates of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
about the yere 1200. eloquently teſtifieth the
trueth of this ſtorie, ſpeaking of Phillip Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus

Grandfather to S. Lewes, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he euidently

ſo as otherwiſe we muſt argue this y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes
decretall Epiſtle of falſhood. Moreouer, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gino
the Hiſtoriographer, who liued almoſt in
the ſame tyme, Ado of Vienne, Ottho of Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingen,
Martin of Pole, Sigiſbert, Aimoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
&amp; others, do name Robert great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
to Hugh Capet, Ottho his great Vnc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
<pb facs="tcp:8630:122"/>
by the father, and Robert his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Princes and Dukes come of the noble
ligne of Fraunce, of the which likewiſe, euen
of the Kings of Fraunce, Odo before he was
elected King, did beare the armes and blaſon
which were Flowerdeluces ſowed vpon an
azure field without number: which alſo were
not altered before the tyme of Charles the
ſixt, who reduced them to three. And certaine
it is, that Odo durſt not haue enterprized to
beare the armes of France if he had not bene
a Prince of the Royall famelie: The proofe
whereof is cleare of doubt, in that wee doe
moreouer knowe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the ſayd Odo was by the
Eſtates of France, nominated for tutor and
gouernor to Charles the Simple in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noritie:
which in this Realme is neuer grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to any but thoſe to whom the ſucceſſion
may likewiſe fall: as was adiudged after the
deceaſe of Charles the Faire in the yeere
1327. in fauour of Phillip of Valois, ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
tutor to the wombe of the Queene then
great and the child to come: Againe, after the
deceaſe of Charles the 5. and Lewes the 11.
Alſo in our age the Eſtates offered the ſame
office to the late King of Nauarre, father to
the King now raigning, in reſpect of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noritie
of Charles the 9. Finally, wee reade
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:8630:122"/>
that by a common conſent, the Frenchmen
declared the ſayd Odo King of France, and
after him his brother Robert: and after them
Raoule come of a brother to Hugh Capet,
who was the fourth of his famelie that bare
the title and name Royall, but the firſt peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
poſſeſſor of the Realme: ſo that ſith eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man ſeeth by our auncient Hiſtories, with
what vertue and marueilous aſſurance our
Predeceſſors did euermore reſiſt the force of
ſtraungers that ſought to plant their name
in the Royal famelie, we may not, neither can
thinke them to haue bene ſo fainthearted, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
and vnconſtant, as of their owne motion
and free will to haue choſen the Capets, if
they had not beene of the houſe and famelie of
their Kings, meer for ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Realm:
To whom, for the proofe and verification of
the contrary, wee doe finde they had recourſe
for the conſeruation of this law, ſo relligiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
euermore obſerued among them, and vpon
the which they haue ſtill accompted the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
&amp; dignitie of this Realme wholly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende.
Beſides, I would gladly deſire theſe
makebates of our tyme to ſhewe me any one
Hiſtorie that maketh mention of any, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
made difficultie or obiected to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
that they were no Princes of the bloud
<pb facs="tcp:8630:123"/>
of the Kings their predeceſſors, and meete to
ſucceede in the Crowne.</p>
               <p>5 But to take away all ambiguitie, and to
verifie the diſtent of our Kings and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Bourbon, to be of the famelie not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

euery one, to mark and conſider the meanes,
which ſuch alwaies as haue gotten the vpper
hand of a Lordſhip, whereto they had no other
right but habilitie haue houlden: and then I
hope they will thincke that the gouernment

<pb facs="tcp:8630:127"/>
of his Citizens are ſuſpected, becauſe he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
his owne ſhadowe. Remember the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fable of the Pigeons, who when they
had elected the Ringdoue to rule them, were
ſoone wearie of her courteous and gentle go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,
which they termed, <hi>ſoft and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi>
and in her roume choſe the Kite, who in
liew of wel entreating of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did eate, beate,

of their firſt election, but the Kites tyrannie
could neuer brooke it, whoſe ſucceſſors do yet
to this day practize their roine vpon them.
Once it fell out that the Frenchmen through
wicked counſaile, in liew and place of their
naturall Prince whom they bare ſomewhat
heauy, were ſuborned to elect one Giles a
Romaine, of whom they were ſoone wearie,
after they had caſted what it was to liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one whoſe humour and birth did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with his ſubiects: and it fell our well for
them that their King was of power ſufficient

3 The firſt reaſon is, becauſe the father and

perſon, ſo as the father ſeemeth not dead in

made in the perſon of his ſonne, who is parte
of his fleſh and bones, <hi>and is therefore termed
ſonne of the houſhould, as the other father of

<hi>The father is dead, and in a maner not dead,
becauſe he hath left one like himſelfe.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the fathers deceaſe the ſonne purchaſeth

vpon him the adminiſtration and vſe of

to bee conſidered in the father, is no doubt
tranſported to the perſon of the ſonne, how
perſonall ſoeuer the ſame be, and he is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
capable, as a ſtraunger enheritour cannot
be: in ſuch wiſe that the ſonne by nature and
ciuill lawe ſubſtituted in his fathers roume
and place, is to enioye all priuiledges, digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and rightes that might to the deceaſed
haue apperteyned. This ciuill reaſon confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
it ſelfe to infinite examples of the lawe.
Firſt, wee knowe that the ſonne dying before
his father, the neuewe entereth the roume of
the deceaſed, and enioyeth the ſame rights as

<hi>that the ſame departing before the father, his

to the landes and noble Lordſhips of

that the obligations wherein the father ſtand

that in cace there were no more but the onely

can not be broken. Beſides that the renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was a part of the donation in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract
of Matrimonie, whereby the mariage of the

by the reſtoring of the ſame, the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the

may not be permitted, eſpecially becauſe the

learned do for the ſaid Lord Cardinall, bring
in the example of Siluius King of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,
who was preferred before Iulus his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
brother Aſcanius ſonne: but in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the argument is not alike, for Aſcanius
dyed not in his father Aeneas tyme, but had
worne the Crowne 38. yeeres, or there about
after his deceaſe, and when hee dyed the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
thereof was reſtored to Siluius, to
whom it rightly did apperteyne, as being the
true enheritance of his mother Lauinia. For
it is euident that Aeneas after the deſtruction
of Troy, landed in Italy with his ſonne Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canius,
and ſo well ordered his affayres, that
hee married Lauinia daughter to Latinus
King of Alba Longa, whom hee afterwarde
ſucceeded, &amp; of that mariage begat Siluius:
ſo that Aſcanius raigne ouer the Latins in
Italy, was by tyrannie, and without any vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable,
or more apparant title then the ſworde:
for the Realme belonged to Siluius in the
right of his mother Lauinia. Secondly, they

that it was by force, either that the Realme of
the ſayd Cherebert was deuided, euen in the

ſayd Childebert, among all his brethren, and
yet that afterwarde the weapons of the ſayde
Gontran were the ſtronger, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Fredegond
had procured the death of Sigiſbert, which
ſoone after Gontran repented, and hauing

               <p>The fourth is of Honoricus ſonne to Giſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus

that he would haue the eldeſt of his children

age, but onely the order of ſenioritie, wherein
the neuewe continueth by ſubſtitution of him
in the roume and place of his father, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue
of the ſonne. The like was obſerued
in Barnarde ſonne to Pepin, Charles the
Great eldeſt ſonne, before whom was prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the Empire Lewes the Mecke, ſecond
ſonne to the ſayd Charles. But this example
may moſt eaſily be aunſwered, becauſe it was
the ſame Charles their common father, that
had deuided his Dominions among his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and had giuen Italy to Pepin his eldeſt
ſonne, which alſo was reſerued to the ſayde
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8630:141"/>
Bernard his ſonne, and therefore after the
pertition made by the ſayd Charles, he could
pretend no further in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſucceſſion that might
come in queſtion: beſides that at that time the
Empire was not properly ſucceſſiue: for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the neereſt in bloud to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
Emperour did ſucceede, yet durſt hee
not ſo intitle himſelfe, vntill by the conſent of

and crowned.<note place="margin">Onuphr. de Comit. Impor.</note> Much leſſe alſo was the
Imperiall dignitie ſucceſſiue after the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Princes electors of the ſame in the
tyme of Ottho the 3. of the houſe of Saxony,
or by the opinion of the ſkilfulleſt of our
worlde, in the tyme of Fredericke the 2. ſo as
there is no likelihoode to drawe an electiue
Empire into conſequence, with hereditarie
and patrimoniall Kingdomes. The 5. indge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie of Arthois,<note place="margin">Paul. Acmi. in Philip. Pulch.</note> which was
in ſtrife in the time of Philip the Faire King
of France, betweene Maude wife to Ottho
Earle of Bourgondie, daughter to Robert
Earle of Arthois, ſlaine at the battaile of
Courtray, and Robert the ſonne of Phillip,
who likewiſe was ſonne to the ſayd deceaſed
Earle Robert: in which caſe the aforeſayde
Countie of Arthois, was by the ſayd French
King adiudged to Maud, who was preferred
<pb facs="tcp:8630:142"/>
before her neuewe Robert, being yet in infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
And in troth the hiſtorie ſetteth downe no
other perticuler occaſion of this iudgement,
but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was giuen by the mere motion of the
ſayd King Phillip, Lord of the fief. Neither
is it ſayd that his Maieſtie tooke any other
aduice but of his owne will, &amp; the neede that
then he had of Ottho the ſayd Maudes huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:
together with the ſmall ſeruice that of
long time he might attend of the ſaid Robert
a yong childe,<note place="margin">1. l. ff. de vſucap.</note> and at that tyme there needed
a good warrier to be oppoſed againſt the Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings,
to the ende to ſuppreſſe their boldneſſe
and cuſtomary rebellions. So as in reſpect
of the ſayd Roberts very youth, the ſayd King
Phillip thought it meete to infringe the law
and cuſtome vſually obſerued in like cauſes.
But God be praiſed, in whatſoeuer may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
betweene the ſaid Lords the King of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,
and his Vnkle the Cardinall of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,
we cannot incurre that daunger, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were to be feared the great yeeres of the
ſayd Lord Cardinall already olde, worne, and
by reaſon of his order eſtraunged from al vſe
of armes, in reſpect of the flouring tyme of
the King of Nauarre, a Prince brought vp in
the ſame, and in gonernment of Eſtates.</p>
               <p>The ſixt is for the Countie of Champagne,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:8630:142"/>
betweene Henry the ſeconde ſonne of Earle
Thibault,<note place="margin">Geofroy Ardoin du voyage de la terre ſaincte.</note> &amp; the daughter of the ſayd Earles
eldeſt ſonne wife to Erard of Breno, in which
caſe by arreſt of the Court of Parliament of
the Peeres of France, in the yeere 1216. the
ſayde Countie was adiudged to Henry the
Vnckle, againſt his neuewe, daughter to his
elder brother. But it may eaſely be anſwered,
the eldeſt ſonne of the ſayde Thibault going
into the holy Land, had expreſſely ordeyned
that in caſe he dyed in the ſayd expedition, or
otherwiſe without iſſue male, then that his
brother ſhould ſucceede in the ſayd Countie,
with endowing his daughter, wife to the ſaid
Breno with a compete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſumme. The ſeuenth
happened betweene the children of Charles
the ſecond King of Sicil,<note place="margin">Collenut. in hiſt. Neapol.</note> ſonne to the brother
of King S. Lewes, who married the heire of
Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gary, and of that mariage begat Charles
Martel and Robert. The father gaue and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to the ſayde Martell the Realme of
Hungary, and in his life tyme cauſed him to
be thereof crowned, whereby he did a while
enioye it and then dyed, leauing his ſonne
Charles, to whom Charles the Grandfather
confirmed the donation of the ſayd Realme,
made to his father Martell: and to his ſecond
ſonne Robert he gaue the Realm of Naples.
<pb facs="tcp:8630:143"/>
So that by the truth of this hiſtorie, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that this was a pertition by the ſaide
Charles the ſecond made betweene his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
which they could not reſiſt, and whereof
neither y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſayd Martel, nor his ſonne Charles
had cauſe to complaine: for the Realme of
Hungary was farre greater, more rich and
wealthy, then that of Naples, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
rent and diſmembred by the Arrago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
as it is euident, by al hiſtories of thoſe times.
Our Interpretors doe yet more briefly aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere

tyrannie which the ſayd Lewes exerciſed
againſt this poore orphan, vnder pretence of

gouerning and defending him. Beſides, it is
ſo farre from being our caſe, that it is certain
that the young childe enioyed his fathers E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,

addeth a trimme conſequence, which impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
that in the cace now in queſtion, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the late Lord Prince of Conde, being
foure in number, ſhould deuide with their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
the ſayd Lorde of Bourbon and the King

               <p>The firſt heades of this Reaſon might bee
true, if we ſhould conſider the Neuewe onely
and in his owne perſon, but in this action we
regard him as ſubſtitute in the continuation
of his late Fathers right, and yet not by any
extraordinary fiction or priuiledge whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,

whereby <hi>the father is ſaid to liue ſo long as the

               <p>9 Yet are we to annſwer the deduction of
Iames de Per. where he ſaith that the reaſon
why Robert King of Sicill, Lewes Duke of
Bourbon, and Robert Earle of Arthois ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
not Charles y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Faire King of France,
but that Phillip Earle of Valois, his Coſſen
germaine, obteyned it, was, becauſe hee was
found to be in the fourth degree to the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
King, and the Earle of Arthois in the 8.
and the King of Sicill in the 7. But imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
he cutteth off himſelf againe, when he
confeſſeth that the Duke of Bourbon was
alſo in the 4. and therefore by reaſon ſhould as
ſoone haue ſucceeded, not that we muſt deny
that the ſucceſſion of the Crowne of France,
<hi>non deferatur proximiori agnato,</hi> but I ſaye
firſt, that we haue more then ſufficiently vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that the ſayd Lorde King of Nauarre, is
not <hi>vlterior gradu,</hi> then the ſayd Lord Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
his Vnkle, and <hi>that according to naturall
and ciuill reaſon.</hi> But I will moreouer add in
the example by this writer propounded, that
the proximitie of degrees was not the cauſe
of the alleadged iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in fauour of Phil.
of Valois, but it was becauſe certainly <hi>when
once the ſucceſſion of a Realme is entred one
ligne and progenie, the reſt of all that braunch
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:8630:146"/>
muſt faile before we may paſſe into an other, or
inhable the ſame, how neere ſoeuer it bee.</hi> The
reaſon is moſt euident, becauſe <hi>ſith the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is gotten to their kinſman, they al are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted
more capable then any other kindred,
feudorum exemplo, wherein to them onely, and
to all thoſe that are of the ſame ligne whereof
the deceaſed was, the commoditie doth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne,
and that is it that is ſayd ad proximio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res

the reaſon why the King of Sicil, neither the
Earle of Arthois could pretende nothing in
the Crowne of France, which once obteined
to S. Lewes, excluded the ligne of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd,
who diſcended of Robert Earle of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thois,
and of Charles the firſt King of Sicil,
children to Lewes the 8. and brother to S.
Lewes. Likewiſe Lewes Duke of Bourbon
could not bee admitted to make chalenge to
the ſame Realme, becauſe hee was ſonne to
Robert of Fraunce, the yonger ſonne of the
ſayd S. Lewes, whoſe ſucceſſion was entred
into the ligne of Phillip the 3. ſurnamed the
Bould, his eldeſt ſonne, of whom came two
ſonnes, Phillip the Faire, who was King by
right of elderſhip, and Charles Earle of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois,

father to the ſayd Phillip, true ſucceſſor
to his Coſſen Charles the Faire, ſonne of
Philip the Faire, who both were come of the
braunch of the ſayd Phillip the Bould, eldeſt

fell out after the deceaſe of Charles the 8.
King of France, to whom ſucceeded Lewes

Iuſtinian: alſo this new conſtitution, <hi>facta in

after the opinion of Paule de Caſtro
in his explication of Sceuola, vpon y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile
of Gallus, together with many other
ſkilfull perſons: <hi>ſo that the father is not quite

                  <hi>though by a new

<hi>in totum falſum videri, quod veritatis primor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio

cannot be termed yonger in reſpect of the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
deceaſed, who neither in himſelfe, neither
in any qualitie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wee may ſuppoſe vnto him,
is any way to bee regarded, yet when he ſhall
beholde his neuewe, the ſucceſſor, continuing
and making a part of his late father, he ſhall
finde a faire argument, and obiect of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of the others ſenioritie with his iunio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
Firſt, this principle is not alwaies true,
neither doth the habilitie or inhabilitie of the
father perpetually take holde of the children.
As for example, <hi>eius qui ante amiſſam patris
dignitate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> natus fuerit:</hi> Againe, <hi>de liberis illius
liberti, qui in ſeruitutem redactus ſit.</hi> To bee
brief, herein we may ſay as Alphons teacheth
vs: <hi>The father taketh not from the children
thoſe things that kinde, Countrey, and nature
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:8630:148"/>
giueth them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">liqueritue l. de bon. ff bert.</note> as is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> right of elderſhip, which
is truely ſet in the perſon of the father, being
eldeſt of the houſe, but it is graunted to him
and his by the lawe, cuſtome, and common or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Realme: and therefore is tranſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to his children. Moreouer, the deduction
made by thoſe of the contrary opinion, might
be admitted, <hi>ſi per filium patri incapaci quip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piam
quaerendum foret,</hi> and not otherwiſe, as
we find <hi>illius exemplo, qui ex haeredatus liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

emancipatus non vetabitur.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ſupra in rat. nepo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> And in one word,
the incapacitie, or inhabilitie of the father,
<hi>might hurt the ſonne afterward borne, but not
him that were begotten before, to whom his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
calamitie can be no detriment:</hi> ſo that the
right of elderſhip being perfect, ſound, and to
the father obteyned in his life tyme, is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
and tranſferred to his poſteritie.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon is, that the right which
is not obteyned, cannot in any whatſoeuer
qualitie, bee tranſported or tranſferred to any
heire whatſoeuer: and therefore wee doe vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſay that <hi>haereditas no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> adita, non tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur,</hi>
as doth not alſo the age, which is inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable

that the ſonne of the elder can prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
nothing, neither could the father obteyne to
him the right of his yeres, wherein the ſonne

               <p>The fourth obiection is taken of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
conſideration obſerued in the common
diſpoſitions of euery one, to call into the firſt

               </p>
               <p>This reaſon were hard to be decided, if we
would conſider the neuew onely in his owne
perſon and cauſe, but we haue often ſayd, that
<hi>in deede in his own right: but by his father ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiuely,</hi>

as firſt borne, he is in the firſt degree and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>10 The fifth reaſon is taken of that wee
knowe that the ſame degrees that are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

But it hath bene decreed of the ſonne and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uew

the Doctors that make the obiection, doe not
note, that the ſame was firſt aduiſed, for the

Finally, ſith the ſucceſſion of the libertin

to his ſecond brother: to which iniunction the
ſayd Andrewe obeyed very carefully, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for beating the Soudan of Babilon, was

queſtion, it doth not in the text appeare that
there was euer a Neuew, ſonne to Andrewes

the ſecond brother: ſo that this decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

               <p>The eight reaſon by our Doctor allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,

But the age and perticuler forebirth
gaue this priuiledge to the late Antony of

ſo that ſith this qualitie of elderſhip hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:8630:152"/>
to haue tranſferred the right that hee had in

for in trueth by the order of lawe, if any
thing reſteth in actions, petitions, proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

               <p>12 The laſt reaſon is taken out of the text
of the cuſtumary of the towne of Paris, the
head Cittie of the Realme, whereby the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
Eſtate thereof ſhould be ruled: Now
by the ſame it is expreſſely inferred that the

our writer forgotten to ſay that it is the order
of the Romaines lawe conteyned in the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
decrees of the Emperours, before the
which <hi>in the olde decemuirall law, there was
no repreſentation in collaterall ligne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Herevpon wee maye alleadge reaſon of
double difference, firſt in reſpect of the Ciuill
law, which hath had no conſideration at all of
enheritaunce vndeuided, and not ſubiect to
pertition amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſucceſſors, as alſo it hath not
reſpected ſenioritie or innioritie of the heires
of the deceaſed, but being in like degree, hath
equally acknowledged them in the ſucceſſion
to them fallen: whereupon it followeth, that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:8630:153"/>
ſith contrary to our pollicie, <hi>moribus &amp; ferè
iure gentium omnium instituta,</hi> require theſe
two qualities in the obteyning of a Realme,
that is, that <hi>onely one and he the neereſt: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thoſe of equall degree, the firſt borne bee
preferred:</hi> The ſame lawe, <hi>and obſeruation of

as is largely before diſcourſed: ſo that to
argue betwene the qualities of ciuill and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
enheritances, and ours both politicall
and quite altered, there is, vnder correction,
no purpoſe, reaſon, or apparance.</p>
               <p>The other reaſon ſhal concerne the article

               <p>Theſe bee the ſtrongeſt reaſons that thoſe
of the contrary opinion can alleadge, which
alſo I haue further augmented then our wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
leaſt it ſhould ſeeme to the learned Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
(to whome onely in this laſt article I
meane to ſpeak) that I would omit or diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
any thing that thei could imagine againſt
the trueth, which by this meanes I thincke to
haue layd ſo open, for that euery one may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
it an eaſie matter to aunſwer all their
friuolous allegations, by the grounds of the
knowledge of the lawes, which both the one
and the other would vſe. Wherefore there is
no more for the Frenchmen to doe, but when
occaſion ſhall fall out, to reſolue vpon the moſt
certaine and reaſonable opinion for the ſayd
Lorde King of Nauarre, ſonne to the elder
brother, allowed by a great number of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
both Canon, and Ciuill, euen by the two
notable lights of the Lawe, Innocent for the

pollicie, who make no difficultie thereof, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the doubt diſperſed ouer the Land to
any other ende, but to deſtroye both the one
and the other, and ſo to giue opportunitie to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:8630:154"/>
a third, to become Lord of the Realme, vnder
whom this Eſtate will neuer floriſh, and the
tyrant, the inſtrument of the deuill, who durſt
enterprize the ſame, ſhall periſh miſerably
with all ſuch inſtruments as to that effect he
may haue vſed. Let therefore the perturbers
of the peace of this Realme, if they be, I ſay
not Chriſtians, but euen men, capable of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
reaſon, ponder, not the politick Iuſtice
of the ſocietie of this ciuill life, but onely the
hazard wherin they ſhal at once plunge their
memorie, honor, wealth, life and ſoule: and
they ſhall ſee, vnleſſe they will wilfully bee

ſhall ſtaye in fauour of theſe: when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
may aſſure themſelues of the loſſe of the

<pb facs="tcp:8630:155"/>
Princes, and fellow countrymen, and for euil
entreating them, and aſſiſting the Tyrants,
tormentors of their conſciences, and abuſers
of the honors that they haue receiued of our
Kings, and the Princes of the bloud of the

but yet, when GOD ſhall haue
wrought his wil vpon him, are ye not certain
who ought to be his ſucceſſor? Liue you not
vnder a Chriſtian Monarchy, that hath lawes
eſtabliſhed for that purpoſe? Would you liue
to be called corrupters, and perturbers of the
foundations of the Crowne, vnder the which,
and by the ſucceſſion whereof your fathers
haue obteyned and left vnto you the name,
honor, and title of Nobilitie, which ye beare?
What weene you the curious poſteritie may
thinke of you, when they finde it written that
the French Nobilitie tooke Armes againſt
their King, to name vnto him a ſucceſſor, and
<pb facs="tcp:8630:156"/>
vnder the pretence thereof to depriue him of
all authoritie, reſpect, &amp; honor vnto him due,
euen by him that ſhould ſucceede him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Salick law, who with this decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
ſhould ſtil be aſſiſted by theſe firebra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
of this tyme, to the ende to make him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
and ecclipſe the bright ſunne of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie?
What opinion would you wiſh Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Princes to conceiue of your fidelitie,
when they ſhall knowe that without regarde
of your bond to this Crowne, you ſhall haue
aſſiſted the enemies therof againſt your King
and the Lawes of the Realme? Would you
your King ſhould haue occaſion of ielouzy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him whom they pretend to cauſe to be
nominated, who alſo by ſuch as ſhall haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced
him, might bee perſwaded to lift his
hornes ouer high, and ſo to become a cenſor
ouer his Lorde? To be briefe, I tell you the
world could neuer beare two Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes. What
greater reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence may ye hope for of ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

Princes who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God by his holy wil hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed
ouer you? Is it not felicitie enough
for you to bee borne men? to bee made Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians?
to haue bene brought vp Frenchmen?
See ye not well enough, that the Lord Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
of Bourbon is but the vizard and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:8630:156"/>
to runne into armes for the glutting of

the lawes, not onely of this Realme, but alſo
of all other the beſt ordered Eſtates that euer

I haue ſhewed you, that it is the King of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre

Shall I with Cicero ſpeaking of Ceſar and

but would ſet vp their owne: They will

if ye take not heede: ſo that God will
