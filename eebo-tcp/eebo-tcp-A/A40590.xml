            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Full and True RELATION Of his Excellency the Pope's Nuncio Making his Publick Entry at <hi>Windſor</hi> on <hi>Sunday</hi> the Third of this Inſtant, <hi>July</hi> 1687.</head>
            <p>THE Town of <hi>Windſor</hi> was ſo full of all ſorts of People (from all parts) that ſome of the Inhabitants were aſtoniſhed, and 'twas very difficult to get Proviſions or Room, either for Horſe or Man; nay many Perſons of Quality, and others, were forc'd to ſit in their Coaches and Gallaſhes, almoſt all the Day.</p>
            <p>So great were the expectations of all People to ſee this Ceremony, ſuppoſing it to be greater than ordinary, by reaſon there has not been any Publick Miniſter of State from the Pope, for above 140 Years, that hath made any Publick Entry, as I am inform'd.</p>
            <p>All the Spectators ſuppoſed he would ſet out a little after Noon, but did not till between Five and Six of the Clock in the Afternoon; at which time his Excellency took Coach (it being one of his Majeſties for that purpoſe) at his own Lodgings, the Duke of <hi>Grafton</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Cotterel</hi> being in the Coach with him; his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency was Cloath'd in Purple, and a Gold Crucifix hanging at his Breaſt.</p>
            <p>The Firſt that appeared in this Ceremony, was one of the Knight Marſhal's Men on Horſe-back, and after him two others followed on Foot; after them went his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies Foot-men, being Twelve in Number, their Coats being all of a dark gray colour'd Cloath, with White and Purple Lace. After them followed the Coach of State, in which was his Excellency, having four Pages to attend him, two on each ſide, taking hold of the Coach; their Coats were very richly Laced. His Excellency had Three Coaches with Six Horſes a piece in each Coach. Immediately after his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, in two of his Coaches were Ten Prieſts; his Coach of State going empty. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them went the Lord Chancellors, Two of the Lord Preſidents, the Lord Privy Seals, and the Lord Chamberlains Coach; there were Eighteen Coaches more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides them, with Six Horſes a piece; in which Number the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi>'s was one, and the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi>'s another. In this Order they went up to the Caſtle, where they ſtay'd about a quarter of an Hour, and then his Excellency re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd back to his Lodgings.</p>
