         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

more or less, but to advance and set up Self, and
Self-Interests; the which that they might the better, and with the more
Self-security effect, they Proclaimed <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> that so they

for mine own part I could not own, nor in the least allow of their Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

Innocency and the cleanness of our hands, as to all manner of acts of <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi>
and <hi>Oppression,</hi> I caused 1500. <hi>Declarations</hi> to be Printed and
Published, the 12th. day of the 11th. Month, Vulgarly called <hi>January,</hi> in
the year 1659. which is also joyned to the Latter end of my <hi>Fannaticks
Mite, cast into the Kings Treasurie;</hi> in which I declared my
Judgement, and the Judgement of that small Company that were in
Society with me, both concerning <hi>Fighting, Swearing,</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and our obedience to <hi>Magistracy,</hi> and <hi>Magistrates,</hi> and our
present disrelish to them then in being, as in the 23, and 24. lines of the
said <hi>Declaration,</hi> (if recourse thereunto had) is evident: And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
my self with two more of the said Declarers, in this late
<hi>Imprisonment,</hi> about the late <hi>Insurrection,</hi> and also upon refusing to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
to the <hi>King</hi> by an Oath, we have been Cruelly Imprisoned, in
the Gate-house Dungeon, and two of us also most abusively (with
others) were Printed as <hi>Traytors,</hi> although the thought of those, and
such like Acts of Violence, and Bloodshed, are even an Abhorring to
our Souls.</p>
            <p>And seeing we have the Word of the <hi>King</hi> passed to us, for our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
under him, in our Liberties in our Meetings, to discharge our
Duty to our God, and each to other, in that way that God hath Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
himself unto us in his revealed Will, the Holy Scriptures of Truth,
so long as we on our Parts without Acts of <hi>Violence, Hostility, Plottings,
Contrivings,</hi> or <hi>Underminings,</hi> shall behave our selves peaceably and
quietly under him.</p>
            <p>And seeing we on our parts, have never in the least <hi>forfeited our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,</hi>
by any thing that we have either <hi>Acted,</hi> or in the least <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,</hi>
and yet our peaceable and quiet <hi>Meetings,</hi> have been beset
with rude and debauched <hi>Souldiers,</hi> Rending and Swearing, attended
with the <hi>Rude Rabble;</hi> and that since our late <hi>Inlargement</hi> by the <hi>Kings
Coronation Favour;</hi> And all this for speaking in the Name of <hi>Jesus of
Nazareth, a man approved of God,</hi> Acts 2. 22. He that is pretendedly
owned <hi>of you</hi> all, and contended for <hi>by you</hi> all; and yet such is the
Inveteracy of the spirits of some, that they are Eagerly fighting against
those that in the singleness of their Souls serve this Jesus in the <hi>footsteps
of the Flock of God gone before;</hi> of whom, because the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
and the generality of the Commonnalty of this Land of our Nativity,
are misinformed of some of us, and that we with some, are of the
Judgement, <hi>that killing is no Murther;</hi> Intend to lay a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64317:3"/>
upon us; for the guilt and opinions of some, whom we as little own,
as they that are ready to Inflict the punishment; I have therefore thought
good once more to set Pen to Paper, and in plainness of Speech, to give
the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>People,</hi> and you their <hi>Representative,</hi> a fresh discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Intents of our hearts, and the bent of our spirits, in the single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our Souls, in the sight and presence of him, who is the searcher
of all hearts, that sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> revenging God who is of a more purer Eye, then
to approve off, or to behold Iniquity with approbation thereunto.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore declare our Judgements as to the present <hi>Governour,</hi>
and <hi>Government,</hi> and our Opinion touching <hi>Government</hi> simply so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered;
And then I hope <hi>Daniel</hi> like, neither the <hi>King,</hi> his <hi>People,</hi>
nor you their <hi>Representative,</hi> shall find any just cause against us, save in
the <hi>matters of our God;</hi> in which (the Lord assisting us) we shall resolve
in Gods way to go on in, <hi>and if therein we perish, we perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore first of all, I shall let you know, that we do own <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
and that we both do and shall Resolve to be obedient to <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,</hi>
because they be <hi>Ordained of God,</hi> according to Rom. 13.
1, 2. And therefore on our parts we dare not resist them, but shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to vers. 7. <hi>Render unto them Tribute, Custom, Fear and Honour:</hi>
and for as much as we have seen the hand of him who changeth the
Times and Seasons, who removeth <hi>Kings</hi> and setteth up <hi>Kings, Dan.</hi> 2.
21, 37. <hi>Dan. 5, 18, 19. 1 Sam. 15. 1, 23. 1 Sam.</hi> 16. 12. to be great in this
change in setting up <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Second;</hi> we do therefore own him to
be the Lawful King of these three Nations of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
And to whom we shall willingly submit in all Civil things, that
we do find to be agreeable to the Mind of God, revealed in that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory,
his Holy Scriptures of Truth; and if at anytime he shall require
from us any thing that we cannot in Conscience Actually obey him in,
we shall not in the least resist him violently, nor by force of Arms oppose
him, but shall patiently suffer under him the penalties for our not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him; And as we own him, so we shall receive, own and obey
Actively or Passively, all others his Civil Magistrates, set up and sent
by him, for the punishment of <hi>Evil Doers,</hi> and the <hi>praise of them that do
well,</hi> according to 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 14. And this we shall do in the singleness
of our Souls, without <hi>Evasions, Equivocations,</hi> or <hi>mental Reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, As we do own <hi>Magistracy</hi> to be of God; so we cannot
look upon our selves to be concerned in the affairs of this, or any other
Nation, so as to have to do with <hi>Government,</hi> as to our own particulars,
although we were indowed with such Qualications and Estates, as might
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64317:4"/>
render us Capable thereof; because we look upon our selves to be a
People <hi>chosen out of the World,</hi> and such as shall be <hi>hated of the World,</hi>
Joh. 15. 19. and for the sake and Name of Christ shall be <hi>Haled before
Kings, Rulers, Governonrs, Magistrates,</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> of this World, as he
himself hath foretold us, <hi>Mat. 10. 17, 18. Mark 13. 9. For all that will
live godly in Christ Jesus shall Suffer Persecution, 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 12. And
therefore we look upon it to be our Duties, to behave our selves as
Pilgrimes and strangers on Earth, as the Flock of God gone before us did,
and were, <hi>Heb. 11. 13. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 11. And to sit loose to the things of
this World, and to <hi>use the World as if we used it not, and as not abusing
it,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 30, 31. but that our <hi>Moderation</hi> therein and in all things,
<hi>may be known to all men; because the Lord is at hand,</hi> Phil. 4. 15. And
not <hi>Martha</hi>-like to be too much <hi>Cumbred</hi> with the <hi>things of this World,</hi>
but with <hi>Mary,</hi> to look after that <hi>one thing necessary,</hi> and to choose that
<hi>good Part</hi> which shall not be taken from us, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 41, 42. And as
we are <hi>Risen with Christ, so to seek those things which are above, where
Christ sitteth at the right ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d of the Father,</hi> Col. 3. 1. <hi>And so to lay
up for our selves Treasures in Heaven, where neither Rust nor Moth do
corrupt, and where Thieves cannot break thorow, nor steal,</hi> Mat. 6. 20.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We shall and do own the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England, convened</hi>
and gathered together by the <hi>Kings Writs,</hi> to be the Lawful and onely
Lawful Assembly of the Nation, for the Confirming, Establishing, Making
and Repealing of Laws and Statutes, for the better well-being of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Civil things; but we cannot find from the Word of God, any
Warrant for the greatest of Men or Councils, either Civil or Ecclesiastical,
to Alter or Abrogate any of the Laws of God made by that great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of Heaven; or to prescribe any other kind or manner of <hi>Worship,</hi> then
what the great <hi>Jehovah</hi> in his <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the Holy Scriptures of
Truth, hath Established, Rratified and Confirmed, by <hi>Miracles, Signs,</hi> and
<hi>Wonders,</hi> and <hi>divers Gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own Will,
Heb.</hi> 2. 4. And in which the Flock of God gone before us Acted, who
continued <hi>stedfastly in the Apostles Doctrine and Fellowship, and in Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Bread and Prayer,</hi> Acts 2. 42. to which <hi>Directory</hi> onely, we both
do must and shall conform to and none other. And if by the hands of the
Rude Multitude, by your continued Tolleration, or otherwise by your
Appointments, we shall therein or therefore perish, we perish. Yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but by the way let you know, That for some time past I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
and taken special notice, that when <hi>Parliaments</hi> have gone about
that work, of Setling and Ordering of Matters concerning the <hi>Worship</hi>
and <hi>Service</hi> of God, their Designes have Suddenly been Blasted, their
Councils confounded, and their Enemies Forreign or Domestick, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64317:4"/>
by which means they have been forced to leave that work, or
else by the hands of those that called them, or by the Armies Force they
have been violently dispersed.</p>
            <p>And now I shall Really Inform you of our Resolutions herein, and
shall declare, That if this great Assembly shall go on to Intermedle with
the <hi>Regulating</hi> of our <hi>Consciences,</hi> as to the <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> of
our God, or give it into the hands of the Church-men of <hi>England</hi> so to
do, we shall not by force of Armes, nor the least Violence Oppose them,
nor Comply with any that shall Oppose them; neither shall we Resolve
to Conform to them in the least, in what is Inconsistent with the Laws
of our God, left us in Scripture Record: But under our penalties,
for our refusals, we shall with <hi>Israel</hi> of old, groan under such Egyptian
Bondage; And we question not, but that the Captain of our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in his own due time, by a mighty hand, and a stretched out Arm,
will release and relieve us, to the comfort of his poor Oppressed Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ones, and to the confusion of His, and His Peoples Enemies; And
with <hi>Israel</hi> of old, we shall resolve to <hi>stand still and behold the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our God,</hi> which he will work for us, let our Sufferings be under
(you, or them) what they will, for our not Actually obeying mans
Traditions.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We look upon it to be our bounden Duty notwithstanding,
though we Suffer for it by the hands of Men, yet to follow the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of <hi>King Jesus</hi> the Captain of our Salvation, who himself was
<hi>made perfect through Sufferings, Heb.</hi> 2. 10. Who, that his own Flock
might the better avoid that great Danger of <hi>Forswearing,</hi> either by
Ignorance, Forgetfulness, Mistakings, or by reason of Fear, Favour
or Affection, he perswadeth them <hi>not to Swear at all,</hi> Mat. 5. 34. who
also telleth us, Mat. 5. 20. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Except our Righteousness, shall Exceed
the Righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, we shall in no wise enter
into the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> And therefore, in Vers. 37. he requireth,
that our <hi>Yea</hi> should be <hi>Yea,</hi> and our <hi>Nay Nay;</hi> and he addeth this as a
Reason, for saith he, <hi>Whatsoever is more then this cometh of Evil,</hi> or
of that Evil one: as much as if he should have said, when you either as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
or deny a thing, you shall do it with such singleness of heart, and
such sincerity of Soul, being in <hi>me,</hi> or in my Way Order or Worship, as
that you shall not cause the Name of God, nor his Gospel to be Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed
or Evil spoken off, by reason of your deceitful denyals or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmings,
but that you speak the Truth in me, who a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> made of my
Father unto you, both <hi>Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification,</hi> and
<hi>Redemption;</hi> And so am become to you the <hi>Lord your Righteousness,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64317:5"/>
Iere.</hi> 23. 6. who as I judge, doth not tye us distinctly to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the termes, <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay,</hi> but to the substance of the Verity
or Truth of the thing asserted, although the termes may differ, as do his
own, who saith, <hi>Verily verily, I say unto you,</hi> John 3. 3. who also useth
the same Expression above twenty times in that Gospel by Saint <hi>John,</hi>
the which <hi>Verily, Verily,</hi> had it been an Evil, or if it had come of that
Evil one, and he himself speaking it had been his Evil, to have tied us
from it, as an Evil, and yet Acted it himself; and so he would have
layed himself under a guilt, the which to say, I really believe is no less
then Blasphemy: So that he tieth us, as I judge, not to the circumstance
of the words, but to the substance of the Matter, and that without
<hi>Swearing,</hi> in saying, <hi>Swear not at all:</hi> So that though we cannot
<hi>Swear</hi> to <hi>King Charles,</hi> yet we can and shall be freely willing to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi>
to <hi>King Charles,</hi> what we can safely and upon a Scripture Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
promise. And as we are not our selves free to plot, contrive, nor
by force of Armes to undermine Him, nor His Government; so to
prevent the shedding of Blood, and the breach of the Peace of the three
<hi>Nations,</hi> we shall and will be ready and willing to discover all <hi>Plots,
Conspiracies,</hi> or any thing that by force of Arms we shall know of
against Him, to some Justices of the Peace, or other His Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
within 24. Hours after the knowledge of such Plot or force
Intended; and shall resolve (the Lord assisting us) to be as true and
faithful in our <hi>Yeas</hi> and <hi>Nays,</hi> whether Promisary or Testimonial, to
<hi>King Charles</hi> and his Subjects, of what Rank or Quality soever they
be, as our Brethren of <hi>Holland</hi> are to their <hi>States,</hi> and to their fellow
Citizens and Townsmen; And we hope our performances therein will
be found far more Real, then the Multitudes either are or have been,
who have been ready to Swear for his to <hi>Day,</hi> and against it to <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi>
whose own Interests generally cause their mouthes to open, in such
Swearings and Forswearings, more then Conscience; The which we
dare not do, lest we be found Transgressing the Law of our Saviour,
and his faithful servant, who say, <hi>Swear not, and Swear not at all,</hi>
Mat. 5. 34. Jam. 5. 12.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, We look upon it to be our Duties, to be a peaceable, a quiet,
a harmless, and an Innocent People, and to keep our selves from all
Manner of Acts of <hi>War, Uiolence,</hi> and <hi>Hostility;</hi> Because to kill,
Inslave, bring under, ruine, or destroy our Friends, were most Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane;
And to do so to our Enemies, we dare not, because our Law-giver
by his faithful servant, Rom. 12. 17. &amp;c. requireth us to <hi>Recompence
to no man Evil for Evil;</hi> But that we <hi>Provide things honest in the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64317:5"/>
fight of all men;</hi> And that if possible, as much as in us lyeth, we should live
peaceably with all men; who requireth us not to <hi>avenge our selves</hi> but
rather to <hi>give place unto wrath;</hi> because it is written, <hi>Vengeance is mine,
and I will repay it, saith the Lord:</hi> Therefore saith he, if <hi>thine Enemy
hunger, feed him, if he thirst, give him drink; for in so doing thou
shalt heap coals of fire on his head;</hi> And <hi>be not overcome with Evil, but
overcome Evil with good:</hi> yea, and so saith our Saviour himself, Mat. 5.
44. <hi>But I say unto you, Love your Enemies, Blesse them that curse you,
do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use
you; that you may be</hi> (or that you may Evidence your selves to be) <hi>the
Children of your Father, which is in Heaven;</hi> for he <hi>maketh his Sun to
rise on the Evil, and on the Good,</hi> and his <hi>Rain to fall on the Just, and on
the Unjust: for if you love them which love you, what reward have ye?
Do not even the Publicans the same?</hi> And if ye <hi>salute your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
onely,</hi> what do ye <hi>more</hi> then <hi>others? do</hi> not even the <hi>Publicans the
same? Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven
is perfect.</hi> And we look upon it to be our Duties to follow our Lord and
Master, who left himself a Pattern for us to follow, who saith, Mat. 11. 29.
<hi>Learn of me, for I am lowly and Meek, and ye shall find rest for your
Souls;</hi> who, saith the Apostle, 1 Pet. 2. 21. 23. <hi>When he was reviled,
reviled not again, when he Suffered, he threatned not; but committed
himself to him who judgeth Righteously.</hi> Much more might be said to
their particular, the which for brevity sake I shall omit; And shall
thus affirm, That for this cause, and such Requirements as these are,
we dare not have to do with Weapons of War, nor that the Acts of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
in any case be found in our hands, no not for the best things, and to
advance or promote either the Gospel or Kingdom of Christ by any
such way or means, we dare not in the least have so much as a thought,
but look upon it to be our Duties Patiently to wait and earnestly, according
to that other Requirement of Christ, to Pray, <hi>That his Kingdom may come,</hi>
that so his <hi>Will may be done on Earth as it is in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 6. 10. And
as we have declared in the said <hi>Declaration,</hi> in 1659. That we could
not hold Society with, nor own those that were in the same Faith and
Order with us, and from whom we then stood at a distance, that Acted
with the Carnal Weapon, Weapons of War, and Acts of Hostility
then; so <hi>still,</hi> we look upon it to be our Bounden Duty so to do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is so frequently forbidden in Scripture, and also because it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
such an <hi>Odium</hi> upon the Truth, and also upon the peaceable Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ple
of God that are in Gospel Order, and walk close to the Appointments of
Christ in all his Ordinances, and in Church-fellowship, as it is at this day:
And therefore we cannot have to do with any such as do so Act, or that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64317:6"/>
look upon it to be their Liberties, or Priviledges so to Act; And shall have
as little to do with them now as then, or with any one that hath so acted,
unless they shall freely relinquish the same, and shall acknowledge their
failing and Evil in their so acting, whether it be either against, or for
<hi>King Charles</hi> the first, or <hi>King Charles</hi> the second; It being so cleerly
made out to us, and also to several of them that formerly so acted from
the Holy Scriptures, to be contrary to the qualifications of a Gospel Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
to have to do with the <hi>Weapons</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> or the <hi>Sword</hi> of <hi>slaughter,</hi>
whose Weapon onely ought to be the <hi>Sword of the Spirit, which is the
Word of God,</hi> to cut down, kill and slay, wound and bring under
every <hi>Imagination,</hi> and every <hi>high thought, that Exalteth it Self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Knowledge of Jesus Christ;</hi> and to bring every Soul to the
Obedience of Christ, in all his Lawes, Statutes, Ordinances, and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
In order whereunto,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, We look upon it to be agreeble to the pure Will and Mind
of God, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t there be a free <hi>Toleration</hi> for Men and Women to <hi>Worship</hi>
God, without either Constraint or Restraint; And that no Acts of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
be used against them therein, to force the <hi>Conscience</hi> of any, no
not of the meanest of the Sons and Daughters of Men, of what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
or Judgement soever they be of; because Jesus Christ out of
that exceeding Love of the Father, was sent to lay down his Life for
the <hi>Sins of the World,</hi> John 1. 29. and to be a <hi>Redemption for that
first Transgression,</hi> Heb. 9. 15. under the guilt of which all the whole
Bulk of Mankinde that ever were, are, or ever shall be, by Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
do lie under; and from the punishment of which by Jesus Christ
they shall all be released, and restored, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. And not onely so,
but they are also by Jesus Christ, that second <hi>Adam,</hi> brought into a
Capacity to have that Salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with Eternal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 10. whose work was to <hi>come to seek and to save that which
was Lost,</hi> as he himself saith, <hi>Luke</hi> 19, 10. And therefore he gave out
his Universal Commission, the Benefit whereof <hi>extendeth to all;</hi> and
therefore to be <hi>Preached to all,</hi> Mat. 28. 19. Mark 16. 15.</p>
            <p>And we having this Universal Gospel to Preach, to wit, <hi>That God was
in Christ Reconciling the World unto himself by Jesus Christ, not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
their Trespasses unto them,</hi> and hath committed unto us <hi>the
Ministry of Reconciliation;</hi> now then we are <hi>Ambassadours for Christ,
as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you</hi> (yea) (you great Tall
<hi>Cedars</hi> of <hi>England</hi>) [we pray] <hi>you in Christ stead be ye reconciled unto
God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19, 20. And have a care I beseech you in the Fear of the
great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that ye neither slight our Message, as you tender the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64317:6"/>
good of your own Souls to Eternity; neither be ye, I pray you, as those
Pharisees, and Hypocrites, against whom a Wo was pronounced by our
Master <hi>King Jesus,</hi> Mat. 23. 13. who shut up the Kingdom of Heaven
against Men, who neither desired to go in themselves, nor suffered those
that were entring to go in: O I beseech you have a care of this, for
Men are backward enough of themselves, and should you but seem to
hinder them, haply their disobedience may be put upon your score;
And he that is found forwards now to hinder, will be found most guilty
at that Day, when Christ shall dispence to every Man according as his
work shall be, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. O I beseech you once again, yea and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
I intreat you, have a care every one of you, as you tender your
own good to Eternity, that you hinder none, though never so Rich, nor
never so poor; for God is <hi>no respecter of Persons, but in every Nation, he
that feareth him and worketh Righteousness, is accepted of him,</hi> Acts 10.
34. Hinder none, be they never so young, nor never so old; for our Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder
the Master of our Family, Jesus Christ who is a Son over his own
House, comes to some Early in the Morning, <hi>Mat. 20. 1, &amp;c.</hi> even whilst
they are tender &amp; young, even so soon as they come to Reason and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
God by the Incomings of his Holy Spirits, comes to hire them
into his Vineyard; to some he comes at the third hour, in their Youth,
to others at the sixth Hour in their Manhood, to others at the ninth
Hour in their declining Age; and to some again at the 11th. Hour, even
in their old Age: O then I say again, I beseech you have a care, that none
be hindred of their entrance into the Vineyard of Christ, of no Age or Sex
whatsoever; for he may be loytring in the market place of the World this
day, that may be hired into the Vineyard of Jesus Christ to Morrow; for
Christ of a <hi>Persecuting Saul,</hi> may Suddenly make a <hi>Preaching Paul,</hi> one
voice from Heaven can do it; through mercy I know it by good Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and therefore I am the boulder to assert it; And that provoketh me
the more earnestly, to Beg again and again, that no Violence be used, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Housholder, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 1. is said to Hire, not to Frighten, nor Beat,
Force, or Constrain, but to Hire Labourers, to go into his Vineyard,
telling them what they shall have for their pains, if they will Labour
when they are there; And as I told the King in my <hi>Fannaticks Mite,</hi>
in Page the ninth of the last Impression, <hi>That a Gospel Minister was not as
a General in an Army, to Frighten, Beat, or Fight men into Faith; but
as an Embassadour, to perswade and Invite, and gently Treat with,
and to Intreat into the Way of God; the one being Gospel or Evangelical,
but the way of Force being Diabolical and of the Devil,</hi> and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from the Fruits of the Flesh; a part whereof I told the <hi>Mayor</hi> of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64317:7"/>
               <hi>London,</hi> in Christian Love to his Soul, the danger thereof, in my <hi>
                  <hi>Alarm</hi>
given to him in his Quarters,</hi> in Page 34. in which some of them are
clearly laid down, and how they will exclude a Soul from Heavens
Glory.</p>
            <p>Again, it is required, that <hi>all things be tryed, and that which is good be
held fast;</hi> But how shall there be a trying of all things, if there be a
constraint onely to one? for how can there be a choice, where the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g
any but one is restrained? the which restraint confounds the choice.
Again, if those of the <hi>Episcopal Government,</hi> do look upon <hi>Toleration</hi> or
<hi>Libertie of Conscience,</hi> simply so considered, to be a Sin, Then I query if
it be not an Evil to <hi>Tolerate</hi> any? and whether that Evil is not then more
Aggravated, if they shall <hi>Tolerate</hi> that <hi>Opinion</hi> or <hi>Religion</hi> that they
would have us Swear against, because they say it is Idolatrous and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful?
And whether there is not a farther Aggravation, if the worser be
allowed, and the better be suppressed? And whether they will not Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
themselves to be such, as judge not as God judgeth, if they shall
<hi>Tolerate</hi> the Great, the Rich and Mighty, and suppresse the Mean, the
Poor and the Low? when God <hi>Respecteth not Persons,</hi> but in <hi>every
Nation, he that feareth him, and worketh Righteousness, is accepted of
him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore I would earnestly Beg every one, (the bent of whose
spirit carryeth him that way) according to the Requirement of the
Apostle, to <hi>try their spirits whether they are of God or not,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 1.
and to Examine their Wisdom in this case of <hi>Persecution,</hi> whether it be
that Wisdom that is <hi>from above,</hi> which is <hi>first Pure, then Peaceable,
Gentle, and Easie to be Intreated, full of Mercy and good Fruits, without
Partiality, without Hypocrisie,</hi> Jam, 3. 17.</p>
            <p>Whether it be without Partiality? whether they would be willing to
be served so themselves? whether if they have at any time undergone
<hi>Persecution</hi> for Conscience sake, and have not cryed out against it as
abominable, as the Roman <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Episcopals</hi> have done, in that
Grand Usurper <hi>Oliver Cromwels</hi> dayes, and the General <hi>Baptists,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident

with others now do, and as that People of the Presbyterian perswasion

which is contrary to the true Spirit of God, whose <hi>Fruit is Love, Joy,

            <p>Was not your Loyalty to <hi>King Charles</hi> the <hi>first,</hi> and <hi>King Charles</hi> the

Did you cry out of them, and think you that others, will not

against <hi>King Charles</hi> the <hi>first,</hi> nor <hi>King Charles</hi> the <hi>second,</hi> or against

hand of God follow them for their cruel and unjust Actings to you and
the <hi>King,</hi> as most of you do say it did? And can you be the same to

            <p>Oh! Consider with your selves apart, and discourse it each with other
seriously<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what such a Judgment, as I in the singleness of my soul have laid
before you, can, or ever did do you harm; who never did any Acts of
Violence for, nor against you or the King; nor ever shall resolve to do;
who have not gone with a defensive Weapon so much as to defend my
self with, above this fifteen years; and am of the same Judgment with our
Brethren of <hi>Holland,</hi> whose innocent and harmless behaviour, confident
I am, many of you in that time of your absence from this Land of your
Nativity, are well acquainted with; the which I am confident the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of you have no just exception against, either for endeavouring to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64317:8"/>
Government, or to pull down Governours, or by fraud or force,
to have to do with any mans Possession, Goods, or Estate; who am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to <hi>do by another, as I would have another do by me,</hi> and am as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
another should Live as my Self; whose Indeavour in all my Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
have been to perswade Persons to forsake and avoid all acts of
<hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Oppression,</hi> and to cleave to God with purpose of heart,
and to perswade those that have Owned God in his Own way, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
stedfast in the same, and to prove Faithful to him, whose Lawes
teach the best Loyalty to our Earthly <hi>Princes,</hi> and purest Love to all, yea
to our very Enemies; who with single-heartedness to all, and without
either Fawning or Flattery, have and shall still resolve to tell every
one, with whom I have to do, the worst of their Condition, and
shew them the danger they are in, by reason of their misactings; with
an earnest desire that in order to their Eternal well-being, they would
refuse the Evil and choose the Good.</p>
            <p>And so I have at this time done with you, the great <hi>Council</hi> of
the <hi>Nation,</hi> and if for my plainness of speech either as to the matter or
manner of it, you shall become mine Enemy, because I deal so plainly
with you, I shall let you know, that notwithstanding, I shall in the
singleness of my Soul pray for you, and for your Convertion, not in
the least Indeavouring, or Plotting your Confusion.</p>
            <p>And now I shall earnestly desire both the <hi>King,</hi> his <hi>People,</hi> and you
their <hi>Representative,</hi> to judge with Equity our Innocent Cause, that
so when you shall your selves be Summoned at that great Session, before
that great Tribunal and Righteous Judge, who shall give to every man
according as his work shall be, that then you be found Innocent and
without Blame, as to your actings against the peaceable Ones of Christs
Flock, whose Sentence, of either, <hi>Come, ye Blessed, Inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi>
or, <hi>Go ye Cursed into Everlasting Fire,</hi> will be of an Eternal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and that upon the account of Mens actings to his People, either for
doing them good, or for refusing to do them that good they might have
done them; who looketh upon what is either neglected or done to them,
to be done unto himself: And hence it is, that he uttered that from
Heaven, saying, <hi>Saul, Saul, why <hi>Persecutest</hi> thou me? I am Jesus
whom thou Persecutest,</hi> Acts 9. 3, 4. And after the same manner will
be his Sentence at that great Day of account, even, <hi>Go ye Cursed into
Everlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels; for when I
was Hungry ye fed me not, and naked, ye clothed me not, Sick and in
Prison, and ye visited me not; For inasmuch as ye did it not to one of these
little Ones, ye did it not unto me.</hi>

O then I beseech thee, whoever thou be, that art of a Persecuting
spirit; I say again I would Beg thee seriously to consider, O Persecuting
spirit, that if the Lord Christ, will thus severely punish the neglecting
the <hi>doing good</hi> to his People, when Hungry, Naked, Sick, and Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned;
What then will be the Portion of those that cause them to come
into such difficulties and straits, as Imprisonments, Hungrings, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness,
and Sickness; And cause them to be thrown as it were on
heapes, one upon another, as some of the <hi>Baptists</hi> lately have been in
one Room some 9. Foot broad, and 14. Foot long in <hi>New Gate?</hi> And
much after the same way in several other Gaols and Prisons in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Enough to breed Infections and Diseases, had not the God whom
we serve appeared mightily in our Behalfes.</p>
            <p>And seeing the Eternal Sentence, will be so severe against such
<hi>Violent Actors,</hi> In love to their Souls I cannot choose but give them a
timely Caution, and in their behalfes with that servant of the Lord,
Deut. 32. 29. Cry out and say, <hi>O that they were wise, that they would
understand this, that they would consider their latter End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now let not the <hi>King,</hi> his <hi>Peers,</hi> nor his <hi>People,</hi> be angry, and
I will speak but this once more in the behalf of my self, and all that
are of the Separation, of what Judgement soever, that so if possible I
may be Instrumental, that the Peace of the Nation be preserved, and
kept; And this I shall humbly Beg, that if you are not willing that we
should serve our God, in that way which we have received, But that
we shall be taken into custody for our so doing; that then you would
Commissionate some Peace Officers for that work to have to do with us;
And that we be not left to the mercy of the Rude Multitude, nor
the Violent Laws of the Mercenary Souldiers, whose actings towards
the peaceable, have been very Rude and Inhumane, in <hi>London</hi> and
<hi>Westminster;</hi> where at one Meeting, they wounded one man so
dangerously on his—Arm, that it is greatly feared, he will lose
the use of one of his hands.</p>
            <p>At another Meeting-place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they Rudely came and drank up the Wine
that was provided by that Congregation, to Celebrate that Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Communicating at the Table of the Lord.</p>
            <p>At another Meeting-place, the Congregation being generally dispersed
before they came, in revenge whereof the Souldiery set on the Rude
Multitude, to break in Pieces the Table that they used to make use of to
Celebrate the Lords Supper upon.</p>
            <p>At another Meeting-place, they Rudely behaved themselves, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

casting some of them head-long down the Stairs, but the Stairs

being winding, and some People upon them, the force of the falls
(through mercy) being thereby broken, there was not much harm
done as to the People, the greatest harm that was done, was by one of
the Souldiers to himself; for he set that up then upon his own score,
the which (unrepented off) will exclude him Heavens Glory, if the
saying of our Apostle be true, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9. who would <hi>not have men
to be deceived,</hi> for saith he, <hi>Neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor
Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with Man-kinde,
nor Thieves, nor Covetous,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall Inherit the Kingdom of God:</hi>
And such was one of them, as I am Informed, by one who saith, that
at the very Interim of time charged him with it, in the face of the
Congregation; and if such Acts of Deceit should be winked at and
allowed, we should be in as bad a Condition, as when our Houses
were searched, upon the late <hi>Insurrection,</hi> when, who would, came
and forced into Houses, and took and bore away what they pleased,
to the great hinderance of some, as can be clearly Evidenced: And
when our Pockets were searched in the main Guard, and our Knives
and other things taken from us, and never restored to us again: and
if such <hi>Acts of Violence</hi> be not restrained, our peaceable and well
governed Land, in a short time may (it is to be feared) become <hi>Achel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dama.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore in the behalf of my self, and all others, whose
Light it is to walk in a <hi>Separated way,</hi> if by your Appointments, we
shall be taken into custody for our peaceable Meeting together, in the
Service of our God; I shall humbly Beg, that we may have the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of free-born <hi>Englishmen,</hi> and that which the worst of Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
enjoy; who though the Lawes both of God and man, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
to the shamefullest death, yet they are apprehended by <hi>Peace-Officers,</hi>
and Peaceably preserved from the hands of <hi>Violence</hi> and
Cruelty, till they be Legally Charged, Adjudged and Condemned;
The which Security, if this great Assembly shall vouchsafe us, and that
the Nation be forbidden to make any tumultuous Insurrections, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Peace of the Nation, And that they forbear to commit any
<hi>Acts of Violence</hi> upon us, either in our Peaceable <hi>Assemblings</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or apart at our Habitations, or elsewhere, till further Order from
the <hi>Assembly;</hi> The which if this <hi>National Assembly</hi> shall vouchsafe us
the Privilede of, we shall in all humility and thankfulness acknowledge
it: But if not, Yet it shall be our great care in our <hi>Meetings,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
our Duties in obedience to our God, and to follow that Christian
Advice of his Servant, in 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 1. To make Prayers, Supplications,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64317:9"/>
Intercessions, and giving of Thanks for all men, for Kings, and all that
are in Authority; that under them we may lead a peaceable and quiet
life in all godliness and honesty;</hi> because it is <hi>good and acceptable in the
sight of God our Saviour:</hi> And this shall be the Resolution of <hi>Him,</hi>
whose onely End and Aim is the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> the <hi>good</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> the
<hi>Well-being</hi> of his <hi>People,</hi> and the Eternal Benefit of all your Souls;
<q>Who in the Singleness of heart, in the sight of the all-seeing
God, shall Subscribe himself, a Friend to your Souls, in
order to your Eternal well-being, in the behalf of himself,
and those he hath Communion withal.</q>
