            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVHereas <hi>John Pennyman</hi> of late did bring or cauſe to be brought unto the Exchange, in <hi>London,</hi> ſeveral Books and Writings, and amongſt others the holy SCRIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURES of Truth, which teſtifie of Chriſt, with other Writings and Teſtimonies recorded of the holy Servants of God, and Martyrs of Jeſus; with intention to deſtroy and burn the ſame (as by his outward Actions and Expreſſions might juſtly be judged and ſuſpected.) Now we the People of the Lord (called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers)</hi> do declare unto all People, That we do utterly diſown and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie againſt that Action, of the ſaid <hi>John Pennymans,</hi> touching the ſaid Books and Writings (ſo far as he had any Intention, or did give juſt cauſe of Jealouſie or Sufpition of ſuch Intention, to deſtroy and burn the ſame) and that he therein was inſtigated by the Devil, what ever otherwiſe his pretences, are or might be; even that ſpirit that ruled in thoſe, who in the dayes paſt crucified Chriſt, and perſecuted and ſhed the Blood of his Holy Servants, Prophets, and Martyrs; and in endeavouring to Burn and Deſtroy their Writings, manifeſts that it would do the ſame things now, if it had the ſame Power. And we do further declare and teſtifie, That we dearly and truly own the holy Scriptures, before mentioned, given by inſpiration, as a true and infallible Teſtimony of Chriſt, ſpoken forth by his own Spirit, (which is our Guide and Leader) and that they are written for our learning; and the Writings and Teſtimonies of, and concerning the Lord's faithful Servants, and Martyrs is a good ſavour to us, and their memorial is bleſſed forever. And we further declare and teſtifie, That we have no union nor fellowſhip with the ſaid <hi>John Pennyman,</hi> nor that ſpirit that now rules in him, he being departed from that pure, meek, holy Spirit, which ſometimes he had ſome knowledge of: And that he hath given juſt cauſe (before the ſaid Action, and ſince alſo) of jealouſie and fear, that he is in meaſure broken and diſcompoſed in his Mind and Underſtanding; nor can he have any union or fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with us, until he ſhall publickly condemn this Action of Folly and Wickedneſs committed by him, and give a full Teſtimony of his unfained Repentance for the ſame. And we alſo teſtifie, That if any Perſon whatſoever ſhall Act or Speak any thing that is evil, under pretence of a Motion from the Spirit of God, we utterly deny that Motion to be of God; for the Holy Spirit of God never did, nor never will move to that which is evil; and all evil is of the Devil. And this we have thought fit thus publickly to declare, for the vindication of Truth, and the Lord's People, who profeſs and enjoy it, that the Innocency of the Upright may be cleared and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, and all Iniquity and Unrighteouſneſs judged and condemned, and God and his pure, holy Truth exalted, over all Unclean, Dark, Deluded, Arrogant, and Imaginary ſpirits whatſoever.</p>
