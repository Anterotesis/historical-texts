            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Discourse is a Sacrifice to Truth, and Honour; not Vanity or Distemper. The Vindication of my Misfortunes from your Calumnies; and the Story of Both: Plainly, and Faithfully delivered; without Art, or Passion: not studious of Revenge, or Glory; but Conscient of mine own Integrity, I am resolv'd to Iustifie it.</p>
            <p>I have been 6 Moneths the Patient Subject of your Injurious Clamours; &amp; 6 Eternities had been the same to me, would you but have Bounded your Intemperance within your Proper Circle: (for, in your Ale, you have a Praerogative to be Angry, or Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, at Pleasure) but to finde my Name brought upon a Forreign Stage; my Infamy Transplanted; Paquetts stuff'd with your Invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Scandalls, and Letters dispatchd Expresse to that Ignoble Purpose; Vn-guarded, Vnsealed; with Designe to be yet more Publique: your Malice Immortall too; never leave—To these Indignities, let me be Pardon'd; if I render a Severe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt.</p>
            <p>Nor haue I much to Thank you for at Home; where you have not left one Atome of my Reputation without a Wound: nay, in that precise Instant, while I have been Paying my Vows to Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and Friendship, you have Murthered me at the very Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, as an Apostate to Both: as a Traytour to the most Sacred, the most Inviolable Bonds of Humane Nature. Oh the Inconsiderate, and Inverted Extremes of Popular Affections! your Love? There's Tyranny; there's Torture in it; Drowning and Strangling, in your very Enterteynments, and Embraces: but let me Prosper, as I finde no hing more Civill then your Displeasure. You would never else have pressed me to any thing so much to <hi>mine</hi> Advantage, and
<pb facs="tcp:55782:3"/>
               <hi>your</hi> Dishonour; to a Defence, so much your Condemnation. (for I know, you Hate me, as the Living Monument of your Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; as the Reproach of your Inconstancy.) Would I Boast any Act of <hi>Mine,</hi> it should be <hi>This,</hi> &amp; <hi>Thus.</hi> No Spirit, but That which Ruin'd Kent, could have doubled so supinely. Yet, (in earnest) it were a sad Chapter, did not the Inconsistence, and Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in it, carry so rank a Tincture of Impossible, and Ridiculous. I shall now Approach to my Charge; and Proceed thence to my Answer: (Briefly as I can) but with Caution, and-Praemise; lest I seem to Act the Temerity I Condemne; and in stead of a Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to deliver a Slander.</p>
            <p>To Kent, <hi>first,</hi> and in <hi>Generall;</hi> with <hi>This Protest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do beleeve, there never was so Numerous a Concurrence of such Honest, Resolute Soules, to so Brave a Purpose, within that narrow Compasse of Ground, and Time, in the World; (<hi>All Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances considered</hi>) In a Stragling, Disarmed County. within the Power, and Contribution of an Enemy. Not a single Wall, for a Retrait: not Three Persons to Repair to for Protection: within Two dayes March of an Experienced, Succesfull Army. Vnder the very Nose of the Country-Militia: whose Immediate Businesse and Commission, at that Instant, was with all their Force, and Cunning, to Crush, or Contermine them. I might Adde; that they had been formerly Baffled by Vnworthie Spirits in the Head of them. This notwithstanding, they made in 12 dayes 12000 Men Effective. Reduced the Royall Navy. Gave an Amuse, &amp; Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to their Adversaries: An Example, Encouragement, and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to their Friends. They gave themselves the glory of <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> an Action wherein the whole Nation (stood at Gaze, and) durst not <hi>second</hi> them. They made war <hi>alone</hi> upon the Masters (in effect) of three Kingdomes. They <hi>Rose,</hi> Naked, and Solitary: they <hi>stood so;</hi> and <hi>so</hi> they <hi>Fell.</hi> Their Defeat was rather a Surprize, then a Conquest. They came short not 12 houres of their owne wishes; in which Criticall Opportunity, they were Engaged, and Lost; for want of Discipline, not Courage: in the very Twilight of
<pb facs="tcp:55782:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Order, &amp; Confusion. Nor could Obedience, or Execution be Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably expected from a Multitude, where no Authority, of above 6 houres standing, was acknowledged, that might Require it. In one word: They spake fair for Monarchy, and Liberty; let their Ashes finde Peace for it, and their Memories Honour; and let those that come after, mend it.</p>
            <p>Descending now to Particulars; I must avowe, that our Age Produces not any where, Persons of more Gallantry, Loyalty, and Reason: of a more Primitive worthinesse, then in Kent.</p>
            <p>But for a Corrective; there is a mixture too, of the Tamest Slaves, and the most Insolent Tyrants, that ever Sacrificed to Fear, or Cruelty. Wretches that wait upon dangers, and Hover over Armies like Vultures, to Prey upon the Unfortunate. Of which number, (Gentlemen) <hi>You</hi> are: (<hi>Your</hi> Names I know not, but I am told, there are such Things in Nature) <hi>You,</hi> I mean, that write your selves spectatours of, and Actours in this Businesse; and upon that score Insinuate for Truth your most unhandsome reports. To <hi>you</hi> it is my Vindication directs it self; <hi>Wherein</hi> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to prove the Contrary: and <hi>whereby,</hi> I oblige my self to make it good. (take me in what Latitude you please)</p>
            <p>As for those Credulous, and Passionate Natures whom your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions have corrupted, I wish them a seasonable return to their Better Counsells; and not to make <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> out of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tales:</hi> and to Inferre Consequences of Infallibility from Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the Rode. <hi>Phy, Phy:</hi>—But no more. I have a Civility yet left for <hi>some</hi> of <hi>these,</hi> for whose <hi>mistaken sakes,</hi> I half repent my Innocence.</p>
            <p>I should adde something <hi>now</hi> to those Spirits of Censure, and Contemplation, that endure no other Measure, or Test of Reason, then their Particular Iudgements. Those Pragmaticall pieces of Ill-manner'd Impertinence, that appear born to no other end, then unprofitably to Vex Affayres with their Importune and serious Follies. Those that cry The <hi>Prince upon my Knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Counsell</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Designe</hi> &amp;c. 40000 Scotts: 20000 Irish. True
<pb facs="tcp:55782:4"/>
by <hi>him</hi> that <hi>made</hi> me. I had it by <hi>Expresse</hi> from the Commissioners &amp;c. <hi>These; These</hi> are the Kil-Cowes. These walking Gazetts: these Fripperyes of Intelligence. What Person, or Action, (although never so Honourable, if Vnfortunate) stands secure from the Lash of their Pedantique Saucinesse? and their Praerogative is; they are Contemptible. But I hasten: <hi>And now let Heaven and Earth be Iudges. Here's my Charge:</hi> To a scruple.</p>
            <p>Tis Vox Populi, (sayes my Authour) that l' Estrange began the businesse of Kent, wherein he Engaged his Noble friend Mr. Hales: whom he urged, not to <hi>take up,</hi> when he might have <hi>come off</hi> with his Honour; nor to <hi>Persist,</hi> when he might have <hi>made it good</hi> with his Sword: but upon the losse of Maidstone, flew to his house, (whither he had perswaded him before) and there surprised <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>his,</hi> with such affrights, as made him Quitte his Estimation, and his Country <hi>at once.</hi> All which, l' Estrange did (<hi>some</hi> say) moved by his Interests, or (as <hi>Others</hi>) by his Fears: whereas, had but they Rallyed their own Troupes, (which (as themselves affirm) lay then not far off) and joyned with the undisturbed Forces of East-Kent; They might have bidden Fairfax his Army in the Head.</p>
            <p>Thus, at Randome, when they had Vomited their Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and Infamous follies; the Close was ever <hi>to the Tune of—A Plague of God confound them, they have undone us all.</hi> And <hi>this,</hi> I cannot much deny. I think we put you into a Capacity of beeing <hi>All</hi> undone: of <hi>your selves,</hi> possibly, some twenty, or thirty might have come to cast the dice for your lives, the rest look <hi>on,</hi> and there an end of the Businesse. (<hi>Gentlemen: such things as these have been done in the Memory of Man.</hi>)</p>
            <p>There are, that say, the temper of my Stile was Bolder then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Growth of our Affaires; and Particularly, of those two letters: the First, to the Committee at Derby-house. The Other in Return to the Lord Fairfax; (of which, hereafter.) and that this liberty Exasperated the fury, and Revenge of the Army upon the County. (I crave your Pardons. <hi>I thought it had been as dangerous to Arm ten thousand men, as to give the Reason for it.</hi>) (was ever any man
<pb facs="tcp:55782:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so <hi>be-smeared</hi> with <hi>Ale,</hi> and <hi>Custard?</hi>) But <hi>this</hi> is all (I hear) you have against me. And to <hi>this</hi> I shall vouchsafe a Refutation. I may live to give you a <hi>Personall accompt,</hi> if Heaven, and the Parliament Please: till <hi>then,</hi> accept of <hi>this,</hi> in <hi>black</hi> and <hi>white.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Truth</hi> it is, and <hi>Reason;</hi> or I am deceived: (Plain how ever) and meant for a <hi>Conviction,</hi> not a <hi>Charme:</hi> not coloured with either Phrase, or Argument, to Engage your Phansie, or abuse your Iudgement; nor yet LAMENTABLY COMPLAINING, to provoke your Charitie: but founded upon the Infallible testimony of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration it self: and upon <hi>that</hi> Bottom, your worst is below my Scornes. In a word: if any soule remain <hi>yet</hi> unsatisfied, in poynt of <hi>opinion,</hi> as to <hi>this</hi> Matter; I desire him either to <hi>reserve</hi> it, or <hi>Rejoyne:</hi> and <hi>Owne</hi> it too, unlesse he weares a Name he is ashamed to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge. Nay; if Malice, or Detraction it <hi>self</hi> be not yet Pacified I offer further; <hi>and to all the world.</hi> Let them dissect, and Rifle the whole Series of my life, and when they have done, produce the worst; I shall no more Blush at that story, then at mine Humanity. At the present, I am Obliged to speak to <hi>this, wherein</hi> I shall not break the order of the Affaire in complement to your Praeposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous passions. In substance, I shall deliver what I <hi>did;</hi> what I <hi>Advised</hi> and <hi>would</hi> have done: (whereof you are pleased to say nothing) and what I did <hi>not,</hi> (which you pretend I <hi>did</hi>) in Relation to this distemper of Kent.</p>
            <p>To begin with the Rise of the Whole: the foundation of this Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell was laid in Canterbury: (for it proved but a Glorious confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) A <hi>Petition</hi> was <hi>there</hi> formed by the Grand-jury in behalf of the County, insisting upon the Kings Rights, and the Peoples liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties according to the Lawes of the land, &amp; the Declarations of the present Parliament, It was <hi>well</hi> taken, and <hi>better</hi> meant, but (as it happened) not so luckily <hi>contrived</hi> or <hi>worded.</hi> That which admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster'd Spirit, and Occasion to this Resolve, was <hi>part</hi> Emulation, <hi>part</hi> Revenge, cööperative with those Native Principles of Fidelity they caried still about them. To be plainer yet. Essex gave the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; and Fortune, <hi>this</hi> Opportunity. The two Houses had sen
<pb facs="tcp:55782:5"/>
down Commissioners of Oyer and Terminer to take <hi>Cognizance</hi> of a <hi>Riote</hi> in <hi>Canterbury</hi> the Christ-masse <hi>before.</hi> The Iury gave in <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noramus,</hi> and <hi>so</hi> converted that intended Tragaedy into a Scaene of Mirth. Hereupon, the people began to talk another language; to contemplate the mortality even of a perpetuall Parliament: and <hi>Flesh'd thus</hi> upon a Committee, they determined <hi>next</hi> to <hi>Fly</hi> at <hi>all,</hi> and Step in boldly to the <hi>Rescous</hi> of their <hi>Invaded liberties:</hi> in which He at they drew up this Petition <hi>That done,</hi> the newes is presently at London that Essex and Kent are associated. For <hi>my</hi> private Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction I went down to <hi>see: where,</hi> I found little to <hi>that</hi> purpose. Much talk of a Petition, and the people prone to promote it, but as to the conduct of those Inclinations, (for ought I could disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) much to seek. No <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Quality</hi> to <hi>avow</hi> it. No <hi>Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences</hi> to <hi>Strengthen</hi> it. Nor (as yet) any <hi>Commissioners</hi> agreed upon for the <hi>Menage</hi> of it: and this disorder the Deputy Lievetenants understood <hi>more</hi> then <hi>enough;</hi> who <hi>fell in</hi> immediatly with their Troupes to <hi>suppresse</hi> it: and <hi>That,</hi> with bold and Publick Me<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <p>COpies hereof I delivered you; to Disperse, and Post up in all your Mercate-Townes. My next application was to the Gentlemen of EAST-KENT, and ROCHES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER; betwixt whom, I did (Personally) Accomplish, and Enterchange This paction, and assurance: that <hi>Both</hi> should be ready for the <hi>First</hi> Opportunity; and not fail to <hi>second, either the Other, whethersoever Acted,</hi> or <hi>suffered first.</hi> (whereof, I advertised MAIDSTONE, and other parts:)</p>
               <p>By this; the Deputy-Lievetenants had posted up an Antipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test: but to matter of Violence they durst not proceed, (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by those Letters we intercepted) without the Entire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of what power the Parliament was Master of in the County: which, hereupon, they Incontinently laboured to draw together. Upon the Neck of this; I moved you to tender an EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GAGEMENT, to all the Petitioners; which (accordingly) you did; and in these words.</p>
               <p>Wee doe Solemnly and Religiously Oblige our Selves<note place="margin">ngage-</note> with Our Lives, and Fortunes, to oppose Effectually what Person, or Persons - soever shall presume to Interrupt, and Molest us in the Iust and Legall Presentment, of our humble De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, to the two Houses of Parliament, and to the Utmost of our Endeavours to save Harmlesse and Protect Each the Other in a Priviledge so undoubtedly our Owne. And so not onely Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, but Practised and Encouraged, by This Present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And Further; in case any Single Person, shall be for this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement

Prosecuted; All of us to Rise as One Man, to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue. This, so help us God, as we shall Respectively Perform, and Resolutely.</p>
               <p>In this very Article of Time, comes the Kentish Committee with a Troup of Horse to SITTINGBORNE. I was then at TUNSTALL, two miles off: where, upon Consultation; 4 or 5 of us concluded to make a Party, and fall into their Quarters next night. In which Resolve; <hi>I was so far from Involving Master Hales, (as these Sonnes of Fortune pretend) that when his House was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded for our first Rendez-vous, and his Person for the first Attempt, I was the onely Soule Dissenting. And for the County: They drew me</hi> in, not <hi>I, Them.</hi> Next morning, we heard that ROCHESTER bridge was drawn. after-noon, the Enemy quitted the Towne, and so put an end to that nights designe. Master BIXE onely (one of the Committee) they left; and <hi>Him</hi> the people seized upon; with about sixscore Armes, in the Church. Upon <hi>This;</hi> with a matter of 18 Horse, we marched to SITTINGBORNE: where, having armed as many as we could, we fixed our Quarters. In which condition, by a prone, and universall vote, you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted your selves to my Conduct. Thus invested by your Election, (as Virtuated also by Commission) soon as the Watch was set, I treated with BIXE; and upon his Parole, gave <hi>Him</hi> a <hi>Condition all Liberty;</hi> as <hi>you</hi> the <hi>Reasons</hi> for it: which, although In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputable, occasioned 6 or 7 of the Company to withdraw, swearing that L'ESTRANGE was a TRAYTOUR.</p>
               <p>The morning following, I dispatch'd Invitations to FEVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHAM, and CANTERBURY to joyn with us. Their <hi>Answer</hi> was; <hi>They would look to Themselves.</hi> It should seem there were <hi>others</hi> of that Opinion too: for by the next day, we wanted a third part of our Men. In this Exigence, I proposed to draw up a REMON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STRANGE, to which, you all consented, and this was it.</p>

               <p>Hence-forward, every hour brought us (thither) some fresh signification of Good. To be Short: in 4 dayes, we Mustered 400 Horse and Foot, and found the whole County Ripe to be formed into a Posture: CANTERBURY, and ROCHESTER, more Particularly prepared, by the Prudence, and Example of the Gentry there Engaged.</p>
               <p>Matters thus advanced; I understood that Master Hales was willing to wedd the Quarrell: upon which Notice, I presented him a Troup of Horse for his Guard to our Quarters; and <hi>there</hi> delivered up the whole Affair Entirely to <hi>his</hi> Menage: <hi>under whose Command we made this further Progresse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From SITTINGBORNE, to MAIDSTONE; where we found a Prone, and most Effectuall Reception: both from the Towne, and Country. A partie was thence ordered to AYLES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORD, (a Garison of the Enemies, some 3 miles off) which, soon after, we took in. It afforded us, 7 Brasse Gunnes; 4000 Armes: Powder, Ball, and Match proportionate. (<hi>The Criticall Particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of Persons, Times, and Places, I have lost with my Papers</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:55782:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>Dureing this Action; we received intelligence, that the Enemy was drawing into a Body, and design'd for MAIDSTONE. Their strength between 500, and 3000 (wide, at the Rate of Common AEstimation) upon the matter: about a thousand we supputed them, and upon that Praesumption, proceeded. Hinder their Conjunction we could not: and to Engage them United, had been Madnesse: upon their Owne ground too; and that with a Party inferiour, both in Number, and Order. Further: We expected Relief, they Despaired on't. Every Hour made us Stronger, and Weakened them. That Body of theirs was the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (to a Man) of what their interests Personall, or Publique could Raise in the Country: Ours but the Infancy of a Brigade, made up of the Contributary Alleageance of a Few Villages, without any Reference of Mixture to CANTERBURY, RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHESTER; or those more populous places. From these Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations we Concluded to make good our Quarters, but not by a Praecipitate forwardnesse to hazard the Blasting so fair an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation in the Budd.</p>
               <p>In this interim, Two Gentlemen of the Lower House (by Name, OXINDEN, and WESTROE) Signified that they had in Charge from the House, to the Gentry there convened; which, upon a Conference, they delivered, and to this Effect. <hi>That the Parliament had taken Notice of a Disorder in Kent, but not the Reasons: which they desired likewise to understand. In Generalls; they had heard of an Odd kinde of Petition; and some Peevish Differences betwixt the County, and the Committee: against whom, if there lay any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, they should have Audience, and Reparation: An Ordinance of Indemnity for what was Passed; if they would Desist here: and a Seasonable Consideration of all their Regular Requests for the Future.</hi> (Many superadditionall Flashes of Complement, and State they had, for the better grace of the Businesse: But this was the summe of their Embassage, to which, they press'd a Positive, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Answer.)</p>
               <p>The <hi>Return</hi> we gave them, was to <hi>This</hi> sence: <hi>We could not Fight,
<pb facs="tcp:55782:8"/>
and Treat at Once. Let the Enemy Retire into a Distance, whence not to Incommode our Quarters. We should have Liberty, to Discourse: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, we had another Game to play.</hi> From any Violence during such a Treaty, they Offered to secure us, but further, they would not Undertake: nor could we Rest Satisfied with that.</p>
               <p>The next news, is a Hott, and Insignificant <hi>Alarme. Whence, Where, How,</hi> by <hi>Whom,</hi> no man knowes: but there wanted not, that Sware the Towne was Entred. Upon the Whole: some Flying Parties they had Abroad, for Diversion, and Discovery: but their Body lay Entire, about two miles off. Thus Enformed, we drew out, With pretense to Fight them: and (once upon Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) the People were half madd to make it earnest. Yet, upon further Collection, (<hi>which I willingly Omitt</hi>) they were perswaded to <hi>keep the Peace.</hi> The Enemy had drawn up two Troupes of Horse, in View, under the Protection of 800 Foot; which they had so disposed of, it was no easie matter to Retrive them, but to Distodge them, Impossible. Our Retrait was, in it self, fair, and undisturbed, but attended with Circumstances Mischievous, and Unhandsome: for which, we found no Remedy, but by Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to Fixe, and Charme that Spirit of Inconstancy, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>
               <p>With this Resolve, upon our March, we were Encontred by a Trumpet from the Enemy with this Errand. <hi>That the Deputy Lievetenants, (upon the Mediation of Two Members of the House, Commissioners of Interposition to that Praeventionall purpose) desired a Parly.</hi> The Motion was Entertained; and they appointed Me their Agent. (<hi>An Office, of how Coy a Nature with a Slippery Multitude, I was not now to Learn.</hi>) To Contract the story: we <hi>Treated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their first demands were high. I signified, that my Delegation was to make a Peace, not a Bargaine: and to that end, (if they so Pleased) I would propound; at a word. I did so: and left them to Advise, while I stepped over to mine owne Partie. (For I was studious to decline all Possibility of Exception.) To them, I made <hi>Suppositions, Thus,</hi> or <hi>so:</hi> much below what we Agreed upon) with
<pb facs="tcp:55782:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which, they were so far satisfied, they would have been Glad of Lesse: Nay, <hi>they wished but to Hold their Owne, That night, and they Declared as much.</hi> Upon this Accompt, I hastened back, and gave this Issue to the dispute. (In which Intervall, the <hi>Enemy</hi> had <hi>taken</hi> Prisoners, near 200, that were comming up to us: and <hi>we, Aylesford.</hi>)</p>

               <p>Immediatly upon the Signing of these Articles, we discovered Horse and Foot upon their march toward MAIDSTONE. They came from ROCHESTER; to our Relief: and by us Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned: but, as <hi>Then,</hi> unexpected. At their Approach, Our Men gave a Shout, and Advanced. Whereupon; I Rode up: told them, <hi>We had Agreed: upon what Terms: and that they were bound in Honour to make every Syllabe Good.</hi> They cryed; <hi>No: No Agreement: Plague ô you, and your Agreements.

Whereof, this was the Sequele: <hi>Of the Enemies Infantry, within two dayes, there were not 6 Persons left together.</hi>
               </p>

but in EAST-KENT most of all. The Rendry of the Shipps in the Downs, and 3 Castles; over, and above.</p>
               <p>It rested now, onely to Amasse and Form these divided Forces; which we had seasonably done, had not that Superstitious Nicety of Keeping the Day, and Place, Retarded us.</p>
               <p>Nor was it more our Concerne, then Care: however frustrated by Impertinence, and Confusion. Of this Truth, I could Produce many Honourable, and Feeling witnesses: as Sr. Iohn Mayne: Colonell Thornhill, Colonell Colepepper, Colonell Hanin<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on &amp;c.—How often did we presse you <hi>to Line your Country-Gentlemen with Souldiours: and to Entreat Those Nobly that Offered themselves? To chase an Head, without which, you Were a Tumult, not An Army: To Reduce your Counsells to a number Capable of Secrecy, and Dispatch: Not by</hi> 40 <hi>or</hi> 50 <hi>at a Time, and as many Opinions, as Faces, to Expose and Embroyle your Debates, Consuming Entire Dayes sometime, Without any Result?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Perdere quos vult Iupiter, hos dementat.</hi> All we could doe, amounted to nothing, beyond the Conscience of having dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged our duties.</p>
               <p>The Plain truth is; you cherished Traytours in your very Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes: Not upon designe, but facility: and whose Infusions were eminently significant, in all your Consults: still some trick or other, to spill more time, even <hi>then,</hi> when every remayning Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was worth a Kingdom. Their names I will not stoope to Remember; I need not: they wear their Crimes now on their foreheads: Suffice it; that you once had notice of them.</p>
               <p>Again: Your souldjery was so Zealous, &amp; your Gentry (many of them) so Cautious, it was no hard matter for a cunning iustru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to corrupt such Dispositions into either Extreme of Rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or Reservation: and from <hi>Hence</hi> proceeded those frequent, and Praetenslesse Heats, and Colds, of Mutiny, and Desertion.</p>
               <p>But I Resume my propose: and come now to the Manifestation of what I <hi>said,</hi> as well as what I <hi>did.</hi> (For there is scarce a <hi>Syllable,</hi> or <hi>Action</hi> of <hi>Mine,</hi> which hath not stood the <hi>Torture:</hi> which hath

               <p>To this; let me mind you; that of above 200 <hi>Missives,</hi> upon your Errand, I never sealed up any One but with the View, and Approbation of the Company: And touching dispatches of a more Publique Nature; (an Employment which I neither Courted, nor Refused) not a Title passed, without a severe <hi>Examen:</hi> and Once Voted; it became the <hi>Counsells</hi> Act; ceased to be <hi>Mine.</hi> Yet suppose it <hi>Mine,</hi> Still: and make your best on't. <hi>Two Letters onely are wanting, which I cannot Recove<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r; (viz: One, to the City: the Other, in Answer to the Lord Fairfax his Demands) of the rest, I shall present you the true Copies, and Occasions.</hi>

Upon due consideration, he concluded, for SANDWICH, with his Lady, and Family: and from thence, to play the After Game as he should see Occasion.

At CANTERBURY, I desired a passe from the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners. They told me, the Enemy was Interposed: and upon their march, in two divisions, for CANTERBURY, and DOVER. something there passed of Bandye, and Retort betwixt us: (how much I had abused them, and they, me) but in fine, <hi>they gave me: a discharge; for my self, servants, and horses, to Passe free, either into Essex; over the seas, or whither I pleased.</hi> (By this time, a man might read the Fate of Kent without an Oracle) I repaired Hence, again to SANDWICH: Hired a Catch: laid in Provision Embarqued the Horses, and fignified to M<hi rend="sup">ris.</hi> Hales, from Sr. Anthony Aucher, that his Lady, and some other Gentlewomen desired her company, much: and that they would be all ready by such an hour precise, and at such a place. We came sooner then the hour, but (it seems) the Town was too Hot for <hi>Them</hi> before: (for they were all gone, and no notice whither) we were now in a new Streight: and there succeeded yet a worse. It was a low wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: the Vessell could not stir, that night. The Sea before us: the Enemy behinde us: and the People in a Mutiny round about us: nay more; at that very instant conspiring to Apprehend us: and in such a fashion too; It was aequally dangerous, to flatter, or Reprove their Disorders. Overhearing these discourses, I privily agreed with a Shallop: Appointed the Master of the Catch to
<pb facs="tcp:55782:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
weigh, next floud: and Steere such a Course; where we would that night expect him. Soon as the Bote was ready, we Aborded: One servant, with my self. Scarce had we quitted the Peer, But a matter of 20 Rogues with Cock'd matches, were upon the Back of us: damning themselves, if they did not fire, unlesse wee came a Shore. The Master (an Independent) would have landed us: but I stood rather inclin'd to Venture a Bullet, then to be sure of a Halter, Clap'd my sword to his Brest, and advised him to keep the Channell. Some shot they made: followed us about a mile: but (as it pleased God) without any Mischief. In this rotten Barque, with one Man, and a Boy, we Fetch'd Calais: But the Catch was Arrested.</p>
               <p>Hitherto, what I <hi>did</hi> or <hi>said: Now</hi> to my <hi>Intentions: what I would have done.</hi> (For my very <hi>Thoughts</hi> escape you not: I wonder how you miss'd <hi>Originallsinne</hi>)
<list>
                     <item>First, <hi>I desired you to Offer a Negative Engagement; and to Disarme all that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to take it.</hi> Your <hi>Answer was: No: it would Disoblige the Country.</hi> (It was a huge Complement; rather then disgust your Enemies, to Ruine your Friends: nay your selves: for those very men I Hinted at, Ioyned afterwards with Gibbons against you)</item>
                     <item>Secondly, <hi>I Pressed you (Hourly almost) to Dispatch Commissioners to Negotiate an Association betwixt SVRRY, KENT, and ESSEX: and that Two, Respectively,</hi> of <hi>Each, might,</hi> in <hi>Each County, Sit, Consent, and Act. in Order to the Commune In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of you all.</hi> You told me, <hi>That was done alreàdy, You were sure of ESSEX, and SVRRY.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Thirdly, <hi>I wish'd you to Attempt TILBVRY Fort; to open a fairer way of Correspond betwixt ESSEX, and KENT: and to Protect the County of ESSEX, till they should Embody.</hi> (There were too that proffered to undertake it) <hi>That</hi> (you said) <hi>was designed a surer way: and the Time resolved upon.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Fourthly, <hi>I drew up an Order at MAIDSTONE, requireing every man upon a severe Penalty to deliver up all his armes within so many houres into the Publique Magazine.</hi> (This was Voted, but not Executed: and upon the Storm, you felt the mischief of that Neglect)</item>
                     <item>Fifthly, <hi>To make sure of all the Passes,</hi> [Near MAIDSTONE, Principally; <hi>and to fortifie Turnbridge also</hi>] I did urge to you, 500 times, Among other Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, One was: <hi>It would charge the Country.</hi> [I am of Opinion, that their Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb facs="tcp:55782:15"/>
who were of this minde, would have Reedified the Bridges.]</item>
                     <item>Sixthly, I moved that it might bee Published at the head of every Troup and Company, upon our Rendezvous at BURRHAM-HEATH. <hi>That wee were no longer Petitioners, but Souldiours. The Quarrell, the Kings; which we determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed [as Obliged] to prosecute through all Extremities: &amp; if any Person apprehended greator Businesse at his Home; hee had fair Liberty [Leaving his Armes] to repair to his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests.</hi> [This perhaps might have been seasonable, for we ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d many Souldiours that <hi>wanted</hi> Armes, and many Country People that were <hi>weary</hi> of them]</item>

               <p>Gentlemen, If this signifies <hi>Treason,</hi> I'le dye a Round-head.</p>
               <p>A word now of Deduction from what I have said, and to my whole Charge at Once.</p>
               <p>It is OBJECTED: <hi>That I Engaged the County: Mr. Hales:</hi> Urged <hi>him not to come off; and Hindred him from Persisting: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him, first, from Rochester to his House; and thence, Out of the Kingdom: moved to this,</hi> by Interests; or Feares: <hi>Whereas, had but Wee Rallyed our Troupes &amp;c.</hi>—And again: <hi>My Letters were too Sharp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ANSWER, <hi>The Grand Iury Engaged the County: Master Hales Acted upon his Own Sense.</hi> (Not a Pinn matter, whether Thus, or so) <hi>As for comming off: It never came to the Question. Nor did I Hinder him from persisting;</hi> (Nor could I, if I would have done it) <hi>I told him that Maidstone was gone; and withall, that I was yet confident of the Businesse) I knew nothing of his going from Rochester, Home:</hi> (the Commissioners did: and his Errand vvas, Mony for the Souldiours) <hi>Neither did I advise, or know of his Quitting the Kingdom.</hi> (Sir Anthony Aucher can testifie the Resolve was for SANDWICH, and that I neither did nor could counsell any other, After: for I savv him not) <hi>Moved by my Interests, I Confesse I was.</hi> (That is: by Considerations of Honour, and Friendship (<hi>those are a Gentlemans Interests</hi>) not by your Dirty, and Mechanique Principles of profit, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse.) <hi>As for my Feares:</hi> I would have <hi>That Thing (whose Robe neither Hides his Eares, nor Protects his Shoulders)</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:55782:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Know; that <hi>I Came not off upon Canterbury Articles.</hi> To the matter of <hi>Rallying Our Troupes:</hi> We commanded none, And <hi>For my Letters:</hi> Questionlesse <hi>the Wretch was huge good Natur'd that thought them so Severe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Summe</hi> the <hi>whole Story is Canterbury Newes; not One Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, True.</hi> But Right, or Wrong; <hi>so the Truth be lost, No matter How.</hi> In such Cases, Every man spends his judgement; and hee that hath Least; spends most.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To Recollect a Little.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now (in the Name of Wonder) why Mr. HALES, of all the rest? what was <hi>Hee</hi> Guilty of? (beyond the Crime of Labouring to preserve such thanklesse Peasants) <hi>His Example, Honesty, and Fortune contributed more of Advantage to this Action, then All you Together, that ever Clamoured against him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For my part:</hi> I was praepar'd for't. I foresaw it; and said as much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in case the Businesse succeeded not. (Thanks to my dear Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) <hi>How often have I been Lick'd whole by the same Tongue that Wounded me!</hi> I shall again. If not: there's neither <hi>Peyne</hi> nor <hi>Danger</hi> in it. Nay; it were a <hi>Pleasure</hi> to me, did not the <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Pitty</hi> I bear to <hi>Knaves,</hi> and <hi>Fools,</hi> Correct it. (That is: to the Malitious Authors, and Credulous Promoters of such Groundlesse Calumnies) Nothing in Nature tickles me, like the Phansie of <hi>Machiavell in a blew Apron: Maximes of State, and the Interests of Princes: betwixt</hi> IMPRIMIS <hi>and the</hi> TO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TALL SUMME. <hi>Or what think you of</hi> POLYPHEMUS <hi>the Grasier; with a Basket-Hilt, and a Cup of</hi> NORTHDOWNE <hi>Ale, Cursing</hi> ULISSES? These are not Themes (My Masters) for Melancholy, or Indignation. Vanity it self is not so Comicall. But lest I take too much on't, I divert; and into a Relation (Perhaps) not Impertinent.</p>

                           <p>
                              <hi>First, as a Spye:</hi> To this, I returned, their power Extended not; for they Acted by a Commission Limited to Articles, whereof that was not One. <hi>Next, as a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</hi> To <hi>That,</hi> with much Circumstance; as that I had ever served the King; and that an Enemy and a Traytour were Inconsistent. &amp;c.—In conclusion; the Major Part acquitted me, which notwithstanding: my Definitive sentence was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted 2 dayes longer: under pretence of giving me Leisure for Consideration.

               <p>Thus far; <hi>Mine Owne Vindication to Kent.</hi> In a word now; <hi>The Vindication of Kent to the World:</hi> and from <hi>These Objections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>They Rose too soon. 7, 9 Other Counties would have joyned, if they had Stay'd but a Fortnight Longer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:55782:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>I Answer.</hi> There was no Complication to that End. Nay; ESSEX, and SURRY had already Reproched KENT for sitting still so long. <hi>Again.</hi> KENT had been <hi>up</hi> a Fortnight, when <hi>Yet</hi> they Appeared not. <hi>Further,</hi> what Impediment was this Forwardnesse to their Designes. 16000 Men in Armes for their Rise; (in the County, there were not Fewer) and no Enemy left free, to Interrupt them. They that durst not <hi>Then</hi> Rise, will (I Fear) Lye still <hi>For ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But, to bee Short. They could not waite Longer: The last of May was the day Resolved upon at Canterbury for their Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi> For Praevention whereof, there were Troupes Ready to Seize upon the Leading men of the County: &amp; had done it, had they not, in that Instant Risen.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>They Rose upon their Owne Score</hi> (say some.) <hi>To This.</hi> 'Tis true, but <hi>They Fought upon the Kings.</hi> The Petition was not the <hi>Cause,</hi> but the <hi>Occasion:</hi> and had they Quarrelled upon any other Accompt, They had been Crush'd in three dayes. Had they first, Cryed up the <hi>King</hi> and, under that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion grown Powerfull, deserted him; this had (indeed) been <hi>Parliamentary</hi> and <hi>Iewish.</hi> But to Arme for Liberty, and Fight for Monarchy, (as they did) was an Action Noble, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of themselves. In the Pride of their Fortunes, they Chose the <hi>Prince</hi> his <hi>Generall,</hi> and avowed his <hi>Fathers</hi> Quarrell.</p>
               <p>To this Objection; I shall Conclude with a <hi>Maxime:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The First Thing in Intention, is ever the Last in Execution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>They would not Enterteyne Officers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Answer.</hi> There was a <hi>Delay,</hi> but no <hi>Refusall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to speak to every Capriccious Humour, were End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse.
