         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Vindication of William Penn, Proprietary of Pennſilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
from the late Aſperſions ſpread abroad on purpoſe to
Defame him.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>WIlliam Penn</hi> having been of late Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
as being a Papiſt, and Dead,
I thought meet to give a ſhort Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the riſe and ground of that
ſlanderous Report, and Detect it with an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
of his own Letters received ſince, to ſhew
that he is alive.</p>
            <p>One of the firſt and moſt furious Fomentors
and Authors of that late Lying Report of <hi>W.
Penn</hi>'s being a Papiſt (after diligent Enquiry
made) appears to be <hi>Thomas Hicks,</hi> a Baptiſt
Teacher, the envious falſe Dialogue-Maker, who
has been openly prov'd a notorious Forger, Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
and Defamer of the People called Quakers,
wickedly and maliciouſly rendring them no
Chriſtians, but Deceivers and Impoſtors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and defaming them in their ſufferings, which are
for Conſcience towards God, inſinuating, that <hi>The
ſatisfaction of their wills and luſts, and promoting
their carnal Intereſt, to be the chief motive and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement
thereto, and the great thing in their Eye,</hi>
(as in his Dialog. 1. <hi>p.</hi> 75. As alſo his lies and
ſlanders, That he <hi>had it under</hi> W. P'<hi>s Hand to
manifeſt him the falſeſt Villain upon the Earth;</hi>
and that ſeveral of <hi>his Friends had been with him
to ſee it, and were ſatisfied it was ſo;</hi> and <hi>deſired
him not to look upon the reſt of Friends as upon</hi>
W. P. And further, <hi>That the Books his Name
was too, were not of his own Writing, but that he
kept a Jeſuite for that purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I having Information of this falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and Slander, and being chiefly concern'd
in the Affairs of <hi>W. Penn</hi> in his Abſence, look'd
upon my ſelf oblig'd in Conſcience to vindicate
his Innocency and Chriſtian Reputation: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I took with me <hi>R. Davis</hi> and <hi>R. M.</hi> with
ſeveral others upon the <hi>Exchange,</hi> and asked
<hi>Tho. Hicks,</hi> If he had it under <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s Hand
to manifeſt him as aforeſaid? To which he
Anſwered, <hi>Yes, he had.</hi> Then I deſired him
to name one of the Friends that was ſo ſatisfied;
his ſhuffling Anſwer was, <hi>There was a great many
of them, but could remember the Names of none
of them, it being four or five years ago.</hi> I then
deſired to ſee his Letter? He Anſwered, <hi>He had
none.</hi> I Queried, What he had under his own
Hand then? He Replied, <hi>He had it in Print.</hi>
I demanded the Title? he anſwered, <hi>The ſandy
Foundation, for which he was put in the</hi> Tower.
Note, That an Explication was ſincerely given
forth by <hi>W. Penn,</hi> concerning the ſaid Book,
Entituled, <hi>Innocency appearing with open Face,</hi>
which gave ſuch ſatisfaction that he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ſet at Liberty.</p>
            <p>So this was the ſubſtance of his Anſwer, by
which you may perceive the feebleneſs of his
falſe ſuggeſtion, and the baſeneſs of his Spirit:
then as to his groſs Lye of <hi>W. P</hi>'s <hi>keeping a Jeſuit to
write his Books,</hi> when I charged him with it, to
that he was Mute, and would give me no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
but ſhuffled to another thing.</p>
            <p>Hereby you may ſee that the ſaid <hi>Tho. Hicks</hi>
appears to be a buſie Slanderer as well as a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
Forger of notorious falſhoods, as before
charged.</p>
            <p>The falſe ſuggeſtion of <hi>Tho. Hicks</hi> taking Air,
did encourage others to add hereto, and amongſt
the ſeveral Stories this was one, That <hi>W. Penn</hi>
perverted one Mr. <hi>Edſaw,</hi> a <hi>Suſſex</hi> Gentleman,
to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, who lived and died
near his Houſe. The firſt that I could find who
was ſo bold to affirm this, was <hi>F. F.</hi> who quoted
the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi>'s Steward for his Author,
to whom I applied my ſelf, and he affirmed, he
Reported it not, neither knew any thing of it:
That being detected, <hi>F. F.</hi> charged it upon Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Gratwick</hi> of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> Brother-in-law to the
ſaid Captain <hi>Edſaw,</hi> to whom Meſſengers were
ſent by <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s Wife to know the Truth
thereof, and he alſo denied it, and ſaid, <hi>He
would ſpit in the face of any man that would charge
it upon him.</hi> This he declared before ſeveral
Witneſſes, and ſaid, If ſhe were not ſatisfied
with what he had there declared, he would
wait upon her, and give her what ſatisfaction
ſhe pleaſed under his hand, for he ſcorn'd to abuſe
ſo Civil a Gentleman behind his back: ſo the
riſe of that Story lodges as yet at <hi>F. F</hi>'s door.
And for the pretended perverted Perſon Captain
<hi>Edſaw</hi> (for ſo he was called) they who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to be further ſatisfied may enquire of the
Warden of the <hi>Fleet,</hi> where, by the Book it
doth appear the ſaid <hi>Robert Edſaw</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Priſoner to the <hi>Fleet</hi> for Debt the 27th of
<hi>November</hi> 1678. and not known to go abroad
after Commitment to his dying day, which was
the 30th of <hi>September</hi> 1681. where he died and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105864:2"/>
not in <hi>Suſſex;</hi> and for what he profeſſed as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
he had it not to ſeek many years before
he was Priſoner: Job 13. 4. <hi>But ye are Forgers of
Lies, ye are all Phyſitians of no value.</hi> Pſal. 58. 3.
<hi>The wicked are eſtranged from the womb, they go
aſtray as ſoon as they be born, ſpeaking lies.</hi> Pſal.

            <head>Next follows the Abſtract of ſeveral Letters from
William Penn Proprietary of Pennſilvania, to
P. F. &amp;c. Dated at Upland, Nov. 1. and from
Weſt-River, Decemb. 16, Mary-land, 1682.</head>
            <p>THat of <hi>November,</hi> 1. 1682. ſignifying his
ſafe Arrival, and that day ſix weeks they
loſt ſight of Land in <hi>England,</hi> they ſaw it in
<hi>America:</hi> and being about twelve Leagues off
from the Coaſt, the Air ſmell'd as ſweet as a
Garden new blown. As they Sail'd up the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they received Viſits and Invitations from the
Inhabitants, the People being Joyful to ſee him,
both <hi>Dutch, Swedes</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> coming up to
<hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> they received and entertained him
with great expreſſions of Joy after their ſort.</p>
            <p>Next day after his Arrival, he had the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſummon'd together to the Court-houſe at
<hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> where poſſeſſion was legally given
him; and after that he made a Speech to the
old Magiſtrates, and the People, ſignifying to
them the End of his coming, the Nature and
End of Government, and that eſpecially he came
to Eſtabliſh, aſſuring them of their Spiritual and
Temporal Rights, Liberty of Conſcience and
Civil Freedoms: All he pray'd, expected or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
was Sobriety &amp; loving Neighbour-hood;
then he renewed their Commiſſions and ſo left
them. He went from thence to a place called
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pland,</hi> where he called an Aſſembly, and
gave them as ample ſatisfaction as at <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi>
ſo they Signed an Acknowledgment, and were
very Joyful: The <hi>Swedes</hi> ſent one Captain <hi>Lacy
Cook</hi> to acquaint him, <hi>They would Serve, Love
and Obey him with all they had, and that it was
the beſt Day they ever ſaw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> is laid out and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
and many pretty Houſes are run up of late
upon the River and backwards, that do very
well. An Houſe for <hi>W. Penn</hi> is a Building,
whoſe Family, that went with him, are all come
ſafe; and Entertainment for all beyond expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
and to their content. The Air is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
clear and ſweet, the Food good and
plentiful, and as pleaſing as one can eat. There
is alſo good Malt Drink: In fine, the Country
is without Exception. At <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi>
have their Food much as in <hi>Holland,</hi> and have
curious Sallating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Excellent Bread, both
of Wheat and Maſlin, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Grain.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> they ſaw; the men were ſtrong
and Tall, the Women comely, as ſome Gip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
are in <hi>England;</hi> the Children very pretty;
they all wear ſome Clothes, and ſome of them
wear Broggs.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Weſt-River, Mary-land, Decemb.</hi> 16. 1682.
he writes, That an Aſſembly was held at <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
alias <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pland,</hi> where <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> was annex'd
to <hi>Pennſilvania:</hi> The Foraigners were Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd,
and all the Laws paſt that were agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>England,</hi> and more fully worded. The
Aſſembly-men were there to their great ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and ſuch an Aſſembly for Love, Unity
and Concord, ſcarcely ever was known in and
about outward things in thoſe Parts.</p>
            <p>This done, they Adjourn'd; and <hi>W. Penn</hi>
took his Journey for <hi>Mary-land,</hi> where he was
kindly received by the Lord <hi>Baltemore,</hi> and the
Chief in his Province: They Treated at one
Col. <hi>Taylors,</hi> about ſetling the bounds between
their Provinces: And a ſolid Conference they
had, preparatory to a future Concluſion, the
ſeaſon permitting no long Eſſays or Treaties.
They Civilly parted after two Daies Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p>The day following the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
him to <hi>W. Richardſons,</hi> which was 3
miles, and then return'd: They went two miles
farther, to one <hi>Tho. Hookers,</hi> to a Meeting, where
the preſence of the great God was enjoyed with
them.</p>
            <p>The Firſt day following he intended to be at
<hi>Choptank</hi> on the Eaſtern Shore, where the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels,
Magiſtrates and People of ſeveral Ranks
and Qualities purpoſed to be.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral other Reports I have been
Inquiſitive to find out the Authors of, and I find
them all ariſe from the ſame ground with the
before mentioned.</p>
            <p>I hope therefore this ſhort Scrutiny and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts,
will ſatisfie thoſe, who are not willing
to believe Lies, that <hi>William Penn</hi> is not a
dead Jeſuit, and in time I doubt not but
their folly will Correct them that Imagin him
a live one, and alſo Caution others to be
careful how they Report things upon Hear-ſay,
to the Defamation of the Innocent. Publiſhed
in ſincerity by him who is a Lover of Truth but
a hater of Falſhood, and an abhorrer of thoſe
that ſay, <hi>Report, and we will Report it.</hi>
