         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

money from them, that then the ſaid Committee would ſend for
them up, provided they could make it appear<note n="b" place="margin">The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> delay.</note>: And the ſaid <hi>Ieoffries</hi>
further ſaid, that the Committee at the Dutchy houſe<note n="c" place="margin">The Petitioners prove the County hath paid the money.</note> made a
queſtion whether the County had paid the Committee at <hi>Hartford</hi>
the money they were ſo charged with.</p>
            <p>Upon Tueſday the Petitioners with 6 of their witneſſes were ſent
for in before the Committee at the Dutchy houſe,<note n="d" place="margin">Note their ſlighting of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſo great conſequence for the publick good.</note> who told them
that they had ſent a letter to the Committee at <hi>Hartford</hi> by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier,<note place="margin">February 3.</note>
but knew not whether the ſaid Carrier had delivered their ſaid
letter, or no, for they had not then received their anſwer from the

hands ſubſcribed thereto; which was accordingly done. Then
they deſired the names of the Committee and others againſt whom
the charge lay;<note n="f" place="margin">The charge ſent in.</note> which was likewiſe ſent in ſubſcribed. Then they told
the Petitioners<note n="g" place="margin">The 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> delay.</note> that the charge that was laid againſt the Committee
at <hi>Hartford,</hi> muſt be anſwered by way of accompt, and examined by
them, whereby it might the better appear whether the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
were juſtly charged, which (ſaid they) ſhould be done before
they would ſend for them up, to avoid future trouble and charge:
To which the Petitioners anſwered, ſaying, that the charge laid
againſt the Committee of <hi>Hartford</hi> &amp;c. was a diſcovery in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
of the Common-wealth, which they would prove by their
<note n="h" place="margin">What need ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts where the proof is perſonal?</note> witneſſes, and that it concerned not the accompts, and therefore if
they pleaſed to ſend for the ſaid Committee &amp;c. their witneſſes
were ready to teſtifie their charge upon oath: And herein the ſaid
Petitioners deſired to know their mindes; Whoſe anſwer was, that
they ſhould within few days have their anſwer, in the mean time
wiſhed that ſome of them would give their attendance to know
their pleaſure when they would ſend for them.</p>
            <p>Upon Tueſday the Petitioners ſent one <hi>John Gates</hi> to the Dutchy
houſe to the Committee that was there,<note place="margin">February 10.</note> who appeared not willing
to ſpeak with him, they ſending their Accomptant M. <hi>Jeoffries</hi> to
him, who told the ſaid <hi>Gates,</hi> that the Committee had<note n="i" place="margin">The fourth delay.</note> ſent a man
for the accompts, but received as yet no anſwer: and the ſaid <hi>Gates</hi>
replyed, ſaying, the Petitioners deſired an anſwer to their Petition,
and to prove their ſaid charge, which could be done without ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts.
Then the ſaid M. <hi>Jeoffries</hi> ſaid, that if the Petitioners have
nothing to doe with the accompts, the Committee would have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to doe with them; that he knew their minde, and bid the ſaid
<hi>Gates</hi> to take that for their anſwer.</p>
            <p>Upon Thurſday the Petitioners ſent the ſaid Committee another <note place="margin">February 12.</note>

a day that they might preſent their witneſſes, which they had in a
readineſſe to make proof of their charge (as aforeſaid,) who having
read the ſame ſent for them, to come before them with two of their
witneſſes being then preſent: the ſaid Committee then ſeemed to
be very affable,<note n="a" place="margin">The fifth delay</note> and deſired that one or two of them would attend
them on Tueſday next, and ſaid that they had written to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
of <hi>Hartford,</hi> and that if in caſe they did not hear from them
by that time, they would grant their warrant to be ſent to them by
a Meſſenger that might make affidavit thereof, and that the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners

being brought in, it would ſatisfie the buſineſſe without further
trouble. Whereupon <hi>Iohn Brockedon</hi> replyed, ſaying, that he and
<hi>William Bagwell</hi> (the ſaid Petitioners) would attend them upon
Tueſday next, which was agreed upon.</p>
            <p>Upon Tueſday the ſaid Petitioners attended the ſaid Committee,<note place="margin">1651 February 17.</note>
and being ſent for in before them, the ſaid <hi>Brockedon</hi> intimated that
according to their Honours direction, they came for an anſwer to
their Petition delivered the 12 of this moneth: whereupon M. <hi>Henry
Robinſon</hi> the Chair-man ſaid, there was a warrant drawn up by their
direction, which the ſaid Petitioners ſhould have to ſend by one that
could make affidavit of the delivery thereof, and that it ſhould be
ſealed up and directed to the Committee at <hi>Hartford.</hi> Whereupon
the ſaid <hi>Brockedon</hi> replyed, ſaying, Under correction it is proper we
ſhould know what is written in the warrant:<note n="c" place="margin">The Committee agreed the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners ſhould ſee the warrant before it was ſealed up.</note> and they or one of
them ſaid it was but reaſon. Then the Clark of the ſaid Committee
ſaid, the Petitioners and the reſt might withdraw themſelves, and he
would regiſter the ſaid warrant, and thereupon by order of the ſaid
Committee they did withdraw themſelves out of the room and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
Then M. <hi>Robinſon</hi> came forth<note n="d" place="margin">Now they muſt not ſee the ſaid warrant.</note> and told the Petitioners that
the effect of the warrant was for the Committee of <hi>Hartford</hi> to
bring in their accompts, and the money they are charged with, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.
And the ſaid <hi>Brockedon</hi> replyed and ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> We have nothing
to doe with the accompts concerning this buſineſſe, we are for the
Common-wealth, and deſire our witneſſes may be examined, which
we have in readineſſe to make good our charge. To which the ſaid
M. <hi>Robinſon</hi> replyed again ſaying, Pray give leave that the money
may firſt be demanded, and if you can have it without further trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<note n="e" place="margin">Here the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee refuſe to take the oaths of the witneſſes then preſented to them.</note> what need your witneſſes be examined? ſend away the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
(ſaith he:) and ſo departed, and all the reſt of the Committee
went alſo out of the room where they ſate. And a little after the
Clark brought forth a Packet directed to M. <hi>Barber,</hi> Captain <hi>Davis,</hi>
M. <hi>Puller,</hi> and the reſt of the ſtanding Committee for the County
of <hi>Hartford,</hi> and delivered the ſame to the Petitioners (which was
ſealed up and directed as aforeſaid) who deſired of the ſaid Clark
a copy of the ſaid warrant, and of what is contained touching their
buſineſſe in the ſaid packet: whereupon the ſaid Clark anſwered and
ſaid, that he had no order from the Committee to give any copies:
and ſo departed.</p>

The ſame Tueſday in the afternoon the ſaid Petitioners Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffes

who went the Thurſday following to <hi>Hartford,</hi> and delivered the
ſame to Captain <hi>Dauges</hi> (one of the Committee there) who brake
the ſaid Packet open, and when he had read the contents thereof, he
ſaid he underſtood it not, and wiſhed the ſaid meſſenger to carry the
ſame to the ſtanding Committee, promiſing him by the Faith of a

            <p>Upon Tueſday the Plaintiffes and two of their witneſſes repaired

meſſenger to make affidavit of the delivery of your Honours warrant
to the Committee at <hi>Hartford</hi> according to your direction, which
was done upon Saterday the 21 of this moneth. The ſaid Chair-man
anſwered, that he ſhould not need to make affidavit, for they had
received an anſwer from the ſaid Committee of <hi>Hartford,</hi> and did
read part thereof, expreſſing that they had no notice of what<note n="c" place="margin">How could they aſſeſſe and receive monies without an Ordinance of Parliament?</note> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance

            <p>Upon Tueſday the ſaid Petitioners Plaintiffes preſented unto
the ſaid Committee at the Dutchy houſe the ſaid Petition,<note place="margin">March 9.</note> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to be their laſt unto them in this buſineſſe, wherein they gave
the ſaid Committee a hint of the Act of the 15 of <hi>October</hi> 1649,
which gives power to the ſaid Committee to take the oathes of two
credible witneſſes, that can teſtifie any diſcovery (as aforeſaid) and
that they the ſaid Plaintiffes had often attended their Honours with
ſeverall witneſſes to prove upon oath their aforeſaid charge exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before them againſt the Committee of <hi>Hartford</hi> &amp;c. that was in
being in the year 1643. And having their witneſſes in a readineſſe
with their affidavits drawn up, humbly deſired their Honours to
take their oathes, and that they would likewiſe pleaſe to give order,
that (according to their deſires in their former Petition) they might
have the copies of the accompts for the future benefit of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169304:6"/>
that thereby they might without any further delay
proceed for the right and benefit thereof. The Plaintiffes (after an
houre and halfes attendance) were by the ſaid Committee ſent for
into the room where they ſate, and there being a full Committee,
the then Chair-man ſtood up and ſaid to the Plaintiffes, <hi>viz.</hi> We
have read your Petition,<note n="a" place="margin">The 10 delay.</note> and notwithſtanding we have much buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
yet in ſhort, the copies of the accompts you deſired<note n="b" place="margin">They ſay they deny them not, and yet the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners cannot have them.</note> we have
not denyed them, and you may have them, as we have already or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered:
And we doe not deny to take the oaths of your witneſſes,<note n="c" place="margin">They ſay again they deny not to take their oaths, &amp; yet refuſe to give them their oaths, though they were there preſented for that purpoſe.</note> if
you will aſſigne out any particular ſumme, and the particular party,
or parties, that hath received more then he hath paid. To which the
ſaid <hi>Brockedon</hi> (one of the ſaid Plaintiffes) replyed ſaying, We can
prove by our witneſſes that there is detained 13 weeks and 3 days
pay (as hath been often repeated) due to the Souldiery, that was
collected and received of the Inhabitants of the County of <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
by that Committee,<note n="d" place="margin">The particulars whereof was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready delivered to the ſaid Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee the third of <hi>Febr.</hi> laſt.</note> or others under them, againſt whom the
charge is. And before the Plaintiffes could preſſe further to have
the oath adminiſtred to the witneſſes, then and there preſent, the ſaid
Chair-man with the Hammer in his hand ſaid that they were in haſte,
and deſired that the Plaintiffes would take what they had expreſt
for an anſwer; and withall (to prevent the ſaid Plaintiffes further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply)
took the Bell in his hand and rung it. Whereupon the ſaid
<hi>Brockedon</hi> ſaid, We muſt then take this for an anſwer. And ſo the
Committee roſe, being as weary of the Plaintiffes importunity on
the Common-wealths behalfe, as they the ſaid Plaintiffes were of
their delays.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the ſaid Petitioners Plaintiffes and Diſcoverers for
the Common-wealth, finding by wofull experience nothing but
delayings and continuall diſcouragements to themſelves and their
witneſſes, and that all proceedings tended to perplex and tyre them
out with fruitleſſe anſwers and attendances, and that they were at
laſt diſmiſt without any appointment for further hearing, and
thereby deprived of all further hope of ſatisfaction from the ſaid
Committee, They the ſaid <hi>Bagwell,</hi> and <hi>Brockedon</hi> to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to your Honours, and to whomſoever ſhall be concerned in the
knowledge thereof, That they have not undertaken a diſcovery of
the premiſes upon ſlight, but ſound and ſolid grounds, deemed
themſelves bound in conſcience as well for vindication of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
as in ſervice to the Common-wealth, To cauſe ſome few of
their witneſſes being but ſeven in number, upon their oaths<note n="e" place="margin">In regard the Committee would not adminiſter the oath unto them.</note> before a
