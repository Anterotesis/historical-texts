            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>ALas! what dark benighting Clouds or shade</l>
               <l>Of Gloomy Fate has this Invasion made</l>
               <l>On the bright Confines of far shining day,</l>
               <l>And there Eclips'd the light refulgent Ray</l>
               <l>Of Sacred Honour, and transplendent Worth,</l>
               <l>Which Wisdom still from thence was beaming forth?</l>
               <l>But can it be that he's so quickly gone,</l>
               <l>Rapt from the Earth so soon the Muses Son,</l>
               <l>Who from the evening world such Lawrels won,</l>
               <l>As with Eternal Green must wreath his brow,</l>
               <l>Till Time shall be no more, and Fate shall bow?</l>
               <l>Fame cannot be unjust to him she bore,</l>
               <l>And with him on her Silver wings did soare</l>
               <l>Higher than <hi>Pegasus</hi> durst ever rise,</l>
               <l>His Name engraving in the starry skies.</l>
               <l>Great ROCHESTER, <hi>Minerva</hi>'s darling-wit,</l>
               <l>Inspir'd by her, the famous Heroe writ</l>
               <l>Such Mysteries as puzzle'd dull Mankind</l>
               <l>The meaning of those deep Profounds to find:</l>
               <l>And having long paus'd on the Mystick Theam,</l>
               <l>Like the Magicians upon <hi>Pharoahs</hi> dream,</l>
               <l>They did confess that they had sought in vain,</l>
               <l>Till the renowned Author did explain</l>
               <l>The weighty Syllogisms. For none could bring</l>
               <l>More Loyal attestations for their King.</l>
               <l>Truely Heroick, more than can be told;</l>
               <l>Indu'd with vertues far exceeding gold,</l>
               <l>Or all the precious Oriental Jems</l>
               <l>The bounding Ocean holds, that <hi>India</hi> hems.</l>
               <l>Flow, brynie Orbs; weep, <hi>Britains</hi> Isles for him,</l>
               <l>Till in salt tears thou like to <hi>Delos</hi> swim.</l>
               <l>For can such Sapience unregarded set?</l>
               <l>Or can ungrateful Man his worth forget,</l>
               <l>Whose Candid Soul in a sublimer sphere</l>
               <l>Divinest Attributes deserves to share?</l>
               <l>Should his great <hi>Requiems</hi> now be left unsung,</l>
               <l>No doubt the Golden Lyres by Angels strung,</l>
               <l>In doleful Numbers from the high-rais'd Pole,</l>
               <l>On which the glittering Orbs of Heaven do roul,</l>
               <l>Would nightly from Seraphick Hierarchs sound,</l>
               <l>To wake the drousie world through Earths vast round,</l>
               <l>The great Idea's of his far-stretch'd fame,</l>
               <l>And Sapience Angelical proclaime.</l>
               <l>With Conduct and with Courage was he fill'd,</l>
               <l>Those great Foundations on which Empires build.</l>
               <l>In War renown'd, at home for Peace besought:</l>
               <l>For with his Pen as well as Sword he fought:</l>
               <l>Equally dreadful to correct the proud,</l>
               <l>And send Chimera's to their Mother-Cloud.</l>
               <l>Though great by Birth, yet condescendent still</l>
               <l>To all that sought him with compliant Will.</l>
               <l>Meek in himself, true Honours brighter eye,</l>
               <l>The only Badge of true Nobility.</l>
               <l>For Pride in Greatness gets Contempt and Scorn;</l>
               <l>Which dwells in Baseness rais'd, not Nobly born.</l>
               <l>Heroick Virtues shin'd in him so bright,</l>
               <l>That they oft daz'd the sharpest Eagles sight</l>
               <l>Of prying Envy, which is only fed</l>
               <l>On Honours Ruines, when 'tis Captive led.</l>
               <l>'Tis sure, the Fates were cruel to supplant</l>
               <l>The Man, whom now so much this Isle must want;</l>
               <l>Yet wanting him, in loss for ever lye;</l>
               <l>Too good for Earth, now rap'd above the Sky,</l>
               <l>Where Hallelujahs he Triumphant sings,</l>
               <l>Born up aloft on high Cherubean wings,</l>
               <l>To eccho Praises to the King of Kings:</l>
               <l>Whilst ore the bright Empyrean fields he strays,</l>
               <l>Crown'd with a Wreath of never-fading Bays;</l>
               <l>Admir'd by the Angelick Orders there,</l>
               <l>Whose beaming Faces are Eternal fair;</l>
               <l>And yet from his diviner Soul did gain</l>
               <l>A pleasing sense of Joy which they sustain</l>
               <l>In endless Bliss, and coeternal Praise:</l>
