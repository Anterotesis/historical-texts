            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ONe reason which moved me to Write and Print this Little Book, was, because, though there are many Excellent Heart-affecting Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses in the World that tends to Convert the Sinner; yet I had a desire to try this sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Method of mine:
<pb facs="tcp:44053:3"/>
Wherefore I Make bold <hi>thus</hi> to Invite and Encourage the <hi>Worst</hi> to come to <hi>Christ</hi> for Life.</p>
            <p>I have been Vile <hi>my self,</hi> but have obtained Mercy, and I would have my Companions in Sin partake of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy too, and therefore I have <hi>writ</hi> this Little Book.</p>
            <p>The Nation doth swarm with Vile Ones <hi>now,</hi> as ever it did since it was a Nation. My
<pb facs="tcp:44053:3"/>
Little Book in some places can scarce go from House to House, but 'twill find a suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Subject to spend it self upon. Now since <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> is willing to save the Vilest, why should they not by Name be somewhat ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, and bid come to him under that Name?</p>
            <p>A great Sinner, when Converted, seems a booty to <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>; he gets by saving such an
<pb facs="tcp:44053:4"/>
one; why then should both <hi>Jesus</hi> lose his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the Sinner lose his Soul at once, and that for want of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation?</p>
            <p>I have found through God's grace, good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in Preaching upon this Subject, and <hi>perhaps</hi> so I may, by my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon it too. I have, as you see, let down this Net for a draught, the Lord catch some great Fishes by it, for the magnifying of his
<pb facs="tcp:44053:4"/>
Truth. There are some most Vile in <hi>all</hi> Mens eyes, and some are so in their <hi>own</hi> eyes too; but some have their Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to shroud their vileness under, yet they are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do: And for all these, God hath sent a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>Jesus:</hi> and to all these the Door is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
            <p>Wherefore prethee, Profane Man, give this
<pb facs="tcp:44053:5"/>
little Book the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Come; Pardon, ana a part in Heaven and Glory, cannot be hurtful to thee. Let not thy Lusts and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drive thee beyond the door of Mercy, since it is not lockt nor bolted up against thee. <hi>Manasseh</hi> was a bad <hi>Man,</hi> and <hi>Magdalen</hi> a bad <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi> To say nothing of the <hi>Thief</hi> upon the <hi>Cross,</hi> or of the <hi>murderers</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> yet they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>mercy; Christ</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb facs="tcp:44053:5"/>
received them.</p>
            <p>And dost thou <hi>think</hi> that those once so bad, now they are in <hi>Heaven, repent</hi> them there, <hi>because</hi> they left their <hi>sins</hi> for <hi>Christ</hi> when they were in the <hi>word?</hi> I cannot <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> but that <hi>thou thinkest</hi> they have verily got the <hi>best</hi> on't. Why <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> do thou likewise: <hi>Christ</hi> at <hi>Heaven</hi> Gates, says to thee, <hi>come hither;</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi> at <hi>the gates</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> does call thee <hi>to come to him, Sinner,</hi> what
<pb facs="tcp:44053:6"/>
sayest thou? Whether wilt thou go? Don't go into the <hi>Fire,</hi> there <hi>thou</hi> wilt be <hi>burned!</hi> Don't let <hi>Jesus</hi> lose his <hi>longing,</hi> since 'tis for <hi>thy Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; but <hi>come to him and live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One word more and so I have done. <hi>Sinner,</hi> here <hi>thou</hi> dost hear of <hi>Love,</hi> prethee don't <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke</hi> it, <hi>by turning it into wantonness.</hi> He that dies for <hi>slighting Love,</hi> sinks <hi>deepest into Hell,</hi> and will <hi>there</hi> be <hi>tormented</hi> by the <hi>remembrance</hi> of that <hi>evil,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:44053:6"/>
more than by the <hi>deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est cogitation</hi> of all his <hi>other sins.</hi> Take <hi>heed</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, do not make <hi>Love</hi> thy <hi>Tormenter, Sinner.</hi>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Luke xxiv. 47.</bibl>
               <q>— Beginning at Jerusalem.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THe whole Verse runs thus: <hi>And that repentance and remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sins should be preached in his Name among all Nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Words were spoken by Christ, after he rose from the Dead, and they are <hi>here</hi> rehearsed after an Historical manner, but do contain in them a formal Commission, with a special <hi>Clause,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. The Commission is, as you see, for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44053:14"/>
the Preaching of the Gospel, and is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry distinctly incerted in the Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord by <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark. Go teach all Nations, &amp;c. Go ye into all the World and preach the Gospel unto every Creature, Matt.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. Only this <hi>Clause</hi> is in special mentioned by <hi>Luke,</hi> who saith, That as Christ would have the Doctrine of Repentance and Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sins preached in his Name among all Nations, so he would have the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to have the first proffer thereof. <hi>Preach it,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>in all Nations: but begin at Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apostles then, though they had a Commission so large as to give them Warrant to go and preach the Gospel in all the World, yet by <hi>this Clause</hi> they were limited, as to the beginning of their Ministry: They were to <hi>begin</hi> this Work at <hi>Jerusalem. Beginning at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I proceed to an Observation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Words, I must (but briefly) t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Word, the Rule of Worship, was rejected of them, and in its place they had put and set up their own Traditions: They had rejected also the most weighty Ordinances, and put in the room thereof their own little things, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 15. <hi>Mark</hi> 7.) <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was therefore now greatly backslidden, and become the place where Truth and true Religion was much defaced.</p>
            <p>It was also now become the very sink of Sin, and seat of Hypocrisie, and gulf where true Religion was drowned. Here also now reigned Presumption, and groundless Confidence in God, which is the bane of Souls. Amongst its Rulers, Doctors, and Leaders, Envy, Malice, and Blasphemy vented it self against the Power of Godliness, in all places where it was espied: As also against the Promoters of it; yea, their Lord and Maker could not escape them.</p>
            <p>In a Word, <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Shambles, the very Slaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop for Saints. This was the place wherein the Prophets, Christ, and his People, were most horribly persecuted and murdered. Yea. so hardned at <hi>this</hi> time was this <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in her Sins, that she feared not to commit the biggest,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44053:15"/>
and to bind her self by Wish under the guilt and damning evil of it; saying, when the had murdered the Son of God, <hi>His Blood be upon us and our Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> did both by Doctrine Miracles, and Holiness of Life, seek to put a stop to their Villanies; yet they shut their eyes, stopt their ears, and rested not, till, as was hinted before, they had driven him out of the World. Yea, that they might, if possible, have extinguished his Name, and exploded his Doctrine out of the World, they against all Argument, and in despite of Heaven, its mighty hand, and undeniable proof of his Resurrection, did hire Souldiers to invent a Lye, saying, <hi>His Disciples stole him away from the Grave</hi>; on purpose that Men might not count him the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the World, nor trust in him for the Remission of Sins.</p>
            <p>They were, saith <hi>Paul,</hi> contrary to all Men: For they did not only shut up the Door of Life against themselves, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad that it should be opened to any else. <hi>Forbidding us,</hi> saith he, <hi>to preach to the Gentiles, that they might be saved, to fill up their sin alway, Matt.</hi> 23.35 <hi>chap.</hi> 15.7, 8, 9. <hi>Mar.</hi> 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>After all their abusings of wise Men, and Prophets, God sent unto them <hi>John Baptist,</hi> to reduce them, and then his Son to redeem them; but they would be neither reduced nor redeemed, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted both to the Death. Nor did they, as I said, stop here; the Holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles they afterwards persecuted also to Death, even so many as they could, the rest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I come now to shew you what it was to preach the Gospel to them. It was, saith <hi>Luke,</hi> to preach to them <hi>Repentance and remission of Sins in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44053:16"/>
Christs Name.</hi> Or as <hi>Mark</hi> has it, <hi>to bid th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m repent and believe the Gospel,</hi> Mar. 1.15. Not that Repentance is a cause of Remission, but a sign of our hearty reception thereof. Repentance is therefore here put to intimate, that no pretended Faith of the Gospel is good, that is not accompanied with it. And this he doth on purpose 'cause he would not have them deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: For with what Faith can he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect remission of Sins in the Name of Christ, that is not heartily sorry for them? Or how shall a man be able to give to others a satisfactory account of his unseigned subjection to the Gospel, that yet abides in his impenitency?</p>
            <p>Wherefore Repentance is here joined with Faith in the way of receiving the Gospel. <hi>Faith</hi> is that without which it cannot be received <hi>at all:</hi> And <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> that without which it cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>unseignedly.</hi> When therefore Christ says, he would have Repentance and Remission of Sins preached in his Name among all Nations; it is as much as to say, <hi>I will that all men every where be sorry for their sins, and accept of mercy at Gods hand thorow me, lest they fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his wrath in the Judgment.</hi> For as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44053:17"/>
I said, without Repentance, what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence soever men have of Faith, they cannot escape the wrath to come. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>God commands all men ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry where to repent</hi> (in order to their Salvation) <hi>because he hath appointed a day in the which he will Judge the World in Righte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>usness by that man whom he hath ordained,</hi> Acts 17.30.</p>
            <p>And now to come to this <hi>Clause, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at Jerusalem:</hi> That is, that Christ would have <hi>Jerusalem</hi> have the first of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of the Gospel.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This cannot be so commanded, because they had now any more right of themselves thereto than had any of the Nations of the World; for their Sins had divested them of all self-deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor yet, because they stood upon the <hi>advance ground</hi> with the worst of the Sinners of the Nations. Nay, rather the Sinners of the Nations had the <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>-ground</hi> of them. For <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was long, before she had added this Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to her sin, worse than the very Nations that God cast out before the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It must therefore follow that this <hi>Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>use, B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gin at Jerusalem,</hi> was put into
<pb facs="tcp:44053:17"/>
this Commission of meer Grace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion; Even from the <hi>overflowings</hi> of the Bowels of Mercy. For indeed they were the worst, and so in the most deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition of any People under the Heavens.</p>
            <p>Whatever therefore their relation was to <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> or <hi>Jacob,</hi> however they formerly had been the People among whom God had placed his Name and Worship, they were now degenerated from God, more than the Nations were from their Idols, and were become guilty of the highest Sins which the People of the World were capable of committing. Nay, none can be capable of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of such <hi>pardonable</hi> Sins as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against their God, when they slew his Son, and persecuted his Name and Word.</p>
            <p>From these Words therefore thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, we gain this Observation;</p>
            <p>That Jesus Christ would have mercy offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the first place to the biggest Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>That these <hi>Jerusalem</hi> Sinners were the biggest Sinners that ever were in the World, I think none will deny, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that Christ was the best Man that ever was in the World, and also was their

Lord God. And that they were to have the first <hi>offer of his Grace,</hi> the Text is as clear as the Sun; for it saith, <hi>Begin at Jerusalem.

            </p>
            <p>One would a-thought, since the <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem-sinners</hi> were the worst, and greatest Sinners, Christ's greatest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and those that not only despised his Person, Doctrine, and Miracles, but that a little before had had their hands up to the elbows in his Heart-bloud, That he should rather have said, Go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the World, and preach Repentance and Remission of Sins among all Nations; and af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er that, offer the same to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Yea, it had been infinite Grace, if he had said so. But what Grace is this? Or what Name shall we give it, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that this Repentance and Remission of Sins, which is designed to be preached in all Nations, should first be offered to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> in the first place to the worst of Sinners:</p>
            <p>Nor was this the first time that the Grace which was in the Heart of Christ, <hi>thus</hi> shewed it self to the World. For while he was <hi>yet alive,</hi> even while he was yet <hi>in Jerus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lem,</hi> and perceived even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb facs="tcp:44053:18"/>
these <hi>Jerusalem-sinners,</hi> which was the most vile amongst them; he still in his preaching did signifie that he had a desire that the worst of <hi>these</hi> worst should in the <hi>first place</hi> come unto him. The which he sheweth where he saith to the better sort of them, <hi>The Publicans and Harlots enter into the Kingdom of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you,</hi> Matt. 21.31. Also when he compared <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with the Sinners of the Nations, then he commands that the <hi>Jerusalem-sinners</hi> should have the Gospel at present confined to them. <hi>Go not,</hi> saith he, <hi>into the way of the Gentiles, and into any of the Cities of the Samaritans en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ye not: but go rather to the lost Sheep of the house of Israel,</hi> Matt. 10.5, 6. chap. 23.37. But go <hi>rather</hi> to them, for they were in the most fearful <hi>plight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These therefore must have the <hi>Cream</hi> of the Gospel, namely, the first <hi>offer</hi> thereof in his Life-time: Yea, when he departed out of the World, he left this as part of his last Will with his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that they also should offer it <hi>first</hi> to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> He had a mind, a careful mind, as it seems, to priviledge the worst of Sinners with the first offer of Mercy, and to take from among <hi>them</hi> a People to be the first fruits unto God and to the Lamb.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44053:19"/>The fifteenth of <hi>Luke</hi> also is famous for this, where the Lord Jesus takes more care, as appears there by three Parables, for the lost Sheep, lost Groat, and the Prodigal Son, than for the other Sheep, the other Pence, or for the Son that said he had never transgressed. Yea, he shews that there is Joy in Heaven, among the Angels of God, at the repentance of one Sinner, more than over Ninety and nine Just Persons, which need no repentance, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>After this manner therefore the mind of Christ was set on the Salvation of the biggest Sinners in his Life-time. But joyn to this, <hi>this</hi> Clause, which he care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully put into the Apostles Commission to preach, when he departed hence to the Father; and then you shall see that his Heart was vehemently set upon it, for these were part of his last words with them, <hi>Preach my Gospel to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but see that you begin at Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor did the Apostles overlook <hi>this</hi> Clause, when their Lord was gone into Heaven: They went <hi>first</hi> to them of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> and preached Christ's Gospel to them. They abode also there for a season and time, and preached it to no
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44053:19"/>
body else, for they had regard to the Commandment of their Lord.</p>
            <p>And it is to be observed, namely, that the first Sermon which they preached af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Ascension of Christ, it was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the very worst of these <hi>Jerusalem-sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers</hi>; even to those that were the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> Acts 2.23. For these are part of the Sermon; <hi>Ye took him, and by wicked hands have Crucified and slain him.</hi> Yea, the next Sermon, and the next, and also the next to that, was preached to the self-same murderers, to the end they might be saved, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 14, 15, 16. <hi>chap.</hi> 4, 10, 11. <hi>chap.</hi> 5, 30. <hi>chap.</hi> 7.52.</p>
            <p>But we will return to the first Sermon that was preached to these <hi>Jerusalem-sinners,</hi> by which will be manifest more than great Grace, if it be duly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <p>For after that <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest of the Apostles, had in their Exhortation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded these Wretches to believe that they had killed the Prince of Life, and after they had duly fallen under the guilt of their Murder, saying, <hi>Men and Brethren, what shall we do?</hi> He replies by an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Tender to them all in general, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering them as <hi>Christ</hi>-killers. <hi>That if
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44053:20"/>
they were sorry for what they had done, and would be Baptized for the Remission of their sins in his Name, they should receive the gift of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Acts 2.37, 38.</p>
            <p>This he said to them all, though he knew that they were such sinners. Yea, he said it without the least stick, or stop, or p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>use of Spirit, as to whether he had best to say so or no. Nay, so far off was <hi>Peter</hi> from making an Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst one of them, that by a particular Clause in his Exhortation, he endeavours, that not one of them may escape the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation offered. <hi>Repent,</hi> saith he, <hi>and be Baptized every one of you.</hi> I shut out <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a one of you.</hi> For I am commanded by my Lord, to deal with you, as it were, one by one, by the Word of his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But why speaks he so particularly? Oh! there were reasons for it. The People with whom the Apostles were now to deal, as they were Murderers of our Lord, and to be charged in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral with his Blood, so they had their various and particular acts of Villany in the guilt thereof, now lying upon their Consciences. And the guilt of these their various and particular acts of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, could not perhaps, be reached to a removal thereof, but by this particular

               </gap> here! How willing was <hi>Peter</hi> and the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> by his Ministry, to catch these Murderers with the Word of the Gospel, that they might be made <hi>Monuments</hi> of the Grace of God! How unwilling, I say, was he, that any of these should escape the hand of Mercy! Yea, what an amazing wonder is it, to think, that above all the World, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove every body in it, <hi>These</hi> should have the first offer of Mercy! <hi>Beginning at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But was there not something of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>this Clause</hi> of the Commission? Did not <hi>Peter,</hi> think you, see a great deal in it, that he should <hi>thus</hi> begin with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44053:21"/>
               <hi>these</hi> men, and <hi>thus</hi> offer, so particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>this</hi> Grace to each particular man of them?</p>
            <p>But, as I told you, This is not all. These <hi>Jerusalem-sinners</hi> must have this offer again and again; <hi>Every one of them,</hi> must be offered it over and over. Christ would not take their first rejection for a denial; nor their second repulse for a denial: But he will have Grace offered once, and twice, and thrice, to these <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem-sinners.</hi> Is not this amazing Grace! Christ will not be put off. These are the <hi>Sinners,</hi> that are sinners <hi>indeed.</hi> They are Sinners of the biggest sort, consequently such as Christ can, if they convert and be saved, best serve his ends and designs upon. Of which more anon.</p>
            <p>But what a pitch of Grace is this! Christ is minded to amaze the World, and to shew that he acteth not like the Children of men. This is that which he said of old, <hi>I will not execute the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my wrath, I will not return to destroy Ephraim, for I am God and not Man,</hi> Hos. 11.9. This is not the manner of Men; Men are shorter winded; Men are soon moved to take Vengeance, and to right themselves in a way of Wrath and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44053:22"/>
But God is full of Grace, full of Patience, ready to Forgive, and one that delights in Mercy. All this is seen in our Text. The biggest sinners must <hi>First</hi> be offered Mercy. They must, I say, have the Cream of the Gospel offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. unto them.</p>
            <p>But we will a little proceed. In the Third C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>apter we find, that they who escaped Converting by the first Sermon, are called upon again, to accept of Grace and Forgiveness for their Murder com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon this Son of God. You have killed; yea, <hi>you have denyed the Holy one and the Just, and desired a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer to be granted unto you.

               </gap>rk, He falls again upon the very Men that actually were, as you have it in the Chapters following, his very <hi>Betrayers and Murderers,</hi> Acts 3.14, 15. As being loth that they should escape the mercy of Forgiveness. And Exhorts them again to repent, <hi>that their sins might be blotted out,</hi> Ver. 19.20.</p>
            <p>Ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in, in the Fourth Chapter, he charges them afresh with this Murder, <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. But withall tells them, <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in no other.</hi> Then like a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Decoy,</hi> he puts himself also among them, to draw them the better under
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44053:22"/>
the Net of the Gospel; saying, <hi>There is none other Name under Heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved,</hi> Ver. 12.</p>
            <p>In the fifth Chapter you find them railing at him, because he continued preaching among them Salvation in the Name of <hi>Jesus.</hi> But he tells them, That that very <hi>Jesus</hi> whom they had slain and hanged on a Tree, him God had raised up, and exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance to <hi>Isra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>'Tis true, after they began to kill again, and when nothing but killing would serve their turn; then they that were scattered abroad, went every where preaching the Word. Yet even some of them to hankered after the Conversion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel only to them. Also the Apostles still made their abode at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> in hopes that they might yet let down their Net for another draught of these <hi>Jerusalem-sinners.</hi> Neither did <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who were the Ministers of God to the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44053:23"/>
               <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but offer the Gospel in the first place to those of them that for their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness were scattered like Vagabonds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Nations. Yea, and when they rendred Rebellion and Blasphemy for their Service and Love; they replied, <hi>It was necessary that the Word of God should first have been spoken to them, Acts</hi> 1.8. <hi>chap.</hi> 13.46, 47.</p>
            <p>Nor was this their Preaching unsuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful among these People: But the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> so wrought with the Word <hi>thus</hi> spoken, that thousands of them came flocking to him for Mercy. Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of them closed with him at the first; and afterwards two thousand more; for now they were in number about five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand; whereas before Sermons was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to these Murderers, the number of the Disciples were <hi>not above a hundred and twenty, Acts</hi> 1.15. <hi>chap.</hi> 2.41. <hi>chap.</hi> 4, 4.</p>
            <p>Also among these People that thus flocked to him for Mercy, there was <hi>a great company of the Priests, chap.</hi> 6.7. Now the Priests were they that were the <hi>greatest</hi> of these <hi>biggest</hi> Sinners; they were the Ringleaders, they were the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors and Ringleaders in the mischief. 'T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as they that set the People against
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44053:23"/>
the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> and that was the cause why the upro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r increased, until <hi>Pilate</hi> had given Sentence upon him. <hi>The chief Priests and Elders,</hi> says the Text, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded</hi> (the People) <hi>the multitude, that they should ask</hi> Barabas, <hi>and destroy Jesus,</hi> Mat. 27.20. And yet <hi>behold,</hi> the Priests, yea, a <hi>great</hi> company of the Priests <hi>became obedient to the Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh the Greatness of the Grace of <hi>Christ!</hi>! That he should be thus in love with the Souls of <hi>Jerusalem-sinners!</hi> That he should be thus delighted with the Salvation of the <hi>Jerusalem-sinners</hi>! That he should not only <hi>will</hi> that his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel should be offered them, but that it should be offered unto them <hi>first,</hi> and <hi>before</hi> other Sinners were admitted to a hearing of it; <hi>Begin at Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was this Doctrine well believed, where would there be place for a doubt, or a fear of the Damnation of the Soul, if the Sinner be penitent; How bad a Life so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he has lived, how many soever in number are his sins!</p>
            <p>But this Grace is hid from the Eyes of Men, the Devil hides it from them; for he knows it is alluring; he knows it has an attracting Vertue in it. For this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44053:24"/>
is it, that above all Arguments can draw the Soul to God.</p>
            <p>I cannot help it, but must let drop another Word: The first Church, the <hi>Jerusalem</hi>- Church, from whence the Gospel was to be sent into all the World; was a Church made up of <hi>Jerusalem-sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> These great Sinners were here the most shining Monuments of the exceeding Grace of God.</p>
            <p>Thus you see, I have proved the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and that, not only by shewing you, that this was the practice of the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in his Life-time; but his last Will, when he went up to God; saying, <hi>Begin to preach at Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, it is yet further manifested, in that when his Ministers first began to preach there, he joyned his Power to the Word, to the Converting of thousands of his Betrayers and Murderers; and also many of the Ringleading Priests, to the Faith.</p>
            <p>I shall now proceed, and shall shew you,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Reasons of the point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>And then make some Application of the whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Observation you know, is this, <hi>Jesus Christ would have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest Sinners,</hi> to the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44053:24"/>
               <hi>Jerusalem-sinners; preach Repentance, and remission of sins, in my Name, among all Nations, Beginning at Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reasons of the Point are,</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Because the biggest Sinners have most need thereof.</hi> He that has most need, Reason says, should be helped first. I mean, when a helping hand is offered, and now it is. For the Gospel of the Grace of God is sent to <hi>help</hi> the World, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.9. But the biggest sinner has most need. Therefore in reason, when Mercy is sent down from Heaven to men, the worst of men should have the <hi>first</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of it. <hi>Begin at Jerusalem.</hi> This is the reason which the Lord <hi>Christ</hi> himself renders, why in his Life-time he left the best, and turned him to the worst; why he sat so loose from the Righteous, and stuck so close to the Wicked. <hi>The whole,</hi> saith he, <hi>have no need of the Physician, but the sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance,</hi> Mark 2.15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Above, you read, that the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> said to his Disciples, <hi>How is it that he eateth and drinketh with Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and Sinners?</hi> Alas, they did not know the reason. But the Lord renders them one, and such an one as is both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44053:25"/>
and cogent; Saying, <hi>These</hi> have <hi>need, most need.</hi> Their great necessity requires that I should be most friendly, and shew my grace <hi>first</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>Not that the other were sinless, and so had <hi>no</hi> need of a Saviour: But the <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> and their Companions, were the biggest sinners, they were, as to view, worse than the <hi>Scribes,</hi> and therefore in reason should be helped first, because they had most need of a Saviour.</p>
            <p>Men that are at the point to dye, have more need of the Physician, than they that are but now and then troubled with are Heart-fainting-qualm. The Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and Sinners were as it were, in the mouth of Death, Death was swallowing of them down; and therefore the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> receives them first, offers them mercy first. <hi>The whole have no need of the Physician, but the sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</hi> The Sick, as I said, is the biggest sinner, whether he sees his Disease or not. He is stained from Head to Foot, from Heart to Life and Conversation. This man in every mans judgment, has the most need of mercy. There is nothing attends him from Bed to Board, and from Board to Bed again, but the visible characters,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44053:25"/>
and obvious symptoms of eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. This therefore is the man that has need, most need, and therefore in reason should be helped in the first place. Thus 'twas with the People concerned in the Text, they were <hi>the worst of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Jerusalem-sinners,</hi> sinners of the biggest size, and therefore such as had the greatest need: Wherefore they must have mercy offered to them, before it be offered any where else in the World. <hi>Begin at Jerusalem,</hi> offer mercy first to a <hi>Jerusalem-sinner:</hi> This man has most need, he is farthest from God, nearest to Hell, and so one that has <hi>most need.</hi> This mans sins are in <hi>number</hi> the <hi>most,</hi> in <hi>cry</hi> the <hi>loudest,</hi> in <hi>weight</hi> the <hi>heaviest</hi> and consequently will sink him soonest: Wherefore he has most need of mercy. This man is shut up in Satans hand, fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est bound in the cords of his sins; one that Justice is whetting his Sword to cut off, and therefore has most need, not only of mercy, but that it should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to him in the first place.</p>
            <p>But a little further, to shew you the true nature of this Reason, to wit, <hi>That Jesus Christ would have mercy offer'd in the first place to the biggest sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:44053:26"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> Mercy ariseth from Bowels and Compassion, from Pity, and from a feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Condition of those in misery, <hi>In his Love, and in his Pity, he saveth us,</hi> And again, <hi>The Lord is p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tiful, very peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and of great mercy,</hi> Isa. 63.9. Jam, 5.11.</p>
            <p>Now where Pity and Compassion is, there is yearning of Bowels; and where there is that, there is a readiness to help. And, I say again, The more deplorable and dreadful the Condition is, the more directly doth Bowels and Compassion turn themselves to such, and offer help and deliverance. All this flows from our first Scripture proof, <hi>I came to call them that have need</hi>; to call them <hi>first,</hi> while the rest look on, and murmur.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> was a Revolter from God, a man that had given himself up to Devilism: A company of men, the ten Tribes, that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiped Devils, while <hi>Judah</hi> kept with his God. But <hi>how shall I give thee up, Ephraim? How shall I deliver thee Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>But where do you find that ever the Lord did thus rowl in his Bowels for, and after any Self-righteous man? No, no, they are the Publicans and Harlots, Idolaters and <hi>Jerusalem-sinners,</hi> for whom his Bowels thus yearn and tumble about within him.

            <p>But I say, why all these, <hi>thus</hi> named? why have we not a Catalogue of some Holy men that were so in their own eyes, and in the judgment of the World? Alas! if at any time any of them are mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how seemingly coldly doth the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of Scripture present them to us? <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> a Night-Professor, and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the Pharisee, with his Fifty Pence; and their great ignorance of the methods of Grace, we have now and then touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon.</p>
            <p>Mercy seems to be out of his proper Chanel, when it deals with Self-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men; but then it runs with a full stream when it extends it self to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest sinners.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44053:27"/>
by Man's worthiness; so not much set one by saving of any such. But more of this anon.</p>
            <p>And here let me ask my <hi>Reader</hi> a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: Suppose that as thou art walking by some Pond-side, thou shouldst espy in it, four or five Children all in danger of drowning, and one in more danger than all the rest; judge which has most need to be helped out first? I know thou wilt say, he that is nearest drowning: Why, this is the case; the bigger Sinner, the nearer d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ning; therefore the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sinner, the more need of mercy; yea, of help by mercy in the first place. And to this our Text agrees, when it saith, <hi>Beginning at Jerusalem.</hi> Let the <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem Sinner,</hi> says Christ, have the <hi>first</hi> offer, the <hi>first</hi> invitation, the <hi>first</hi> ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of my grace and mercy, for he is the biggest sinner, and so has most need thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Christ Jesus would have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy offered in the <hi>first place</hi> to the biggest sinners, because when <hi>they,</hi> any of <hi>them,</hi> receive it, <hi>it redound, most to the fame of his Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Christ Jesus, as you may perceìve, has, put himself under the term of a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, a Doctor for curing of Diseases:

            <p>When <hi>John</hi> told <hi>Christ,</hi> that they saw one casting out Devils in his Name, and they forbad him because he followed not with them: What is the answer of <hi>Christ?

And to this end, has not only commanded that the biggest sinners should have the first offer of his mercy; but has, as Physicians do, put out his Bills, and published his doings, that things may be read and talked of.

            <p>And it is observable, as I said before, we have but very little of the Salvation of little sinners mentioned in God's Book, because that would not have answered the design, to wit, to bring glory and fame to the Name of the Son of God.</p>

and now men take Encouragement, and bring from all quarters their Diseased to him, being helped by what they had heard, to believe that their Diseased should be healed.</p>
            <p>Now, as he did with those outward Cures, so he does in the proffers of his Grace and Mercy; he proffers <hi>that</hi> in the first place to the biggest Sinners, that others may take Heart to come to him to be saved. I will give you a Scripture or two, I mean, to shew you that Christ by commanding that his Mercy should in the first place be offered to the biggest of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, has a design, thereby to encourage and provoke others to come also to him for Mercy.</p>

               </gap>ere is yet one hint behind. 'Tis said that God saved these FOR <hi>his love.</hi> That is, as I think for the setting forth, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of his love, for the advance of his love in the Hearts and minds of them that should come after. As who should say, God has had Mercy upon, and been Gracious <hi>to</hi> you, that he might shew to others for their encouragement, that they have ground to come to him to be saved. <hi>When God saves one great Sinner, 'tis to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage another great Sinner to come to him for Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He saved the <hi>Thief,</hi> to encourage <hi>Thieves</hi> to come to him for Mercy. He saved <hi>Magdalen,</hi> to encourage other <hi>Magdalens</hi> to come to him for Mercy. He saved <hi>Saul,</hi> to encourage <hi>Sauls</hi> to come to him for Mercy. And this <hi>Paul</hi> himself doth say, <hi>For this cause,</hi> saith he. <hi>I obtained Mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all long suffering for a Pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.16.</p>
            <p>How plain are the words! Christ in saving of me, has given to the World a Patern of his Grace, that they might see, and believe, and come, and be saved.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44053:33"/>
That they that are to be born <hi>hereafter,</hi> might believe on Jesus Christ to life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.</p>
            <p>But what was <hi>Paul?</hi> Why he tells you himself, <hi>I am,</hi> says he, <hi>the chief of Sinners; I was,</hi> says he, <hi>a Blasphemer, a Pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus therefore you see that this third Reason is of strength, namely, That Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ would have Mercy offered in the <hi>first place</hi> to the biggest Sinners, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, by their Forgiveness and Salvation, others, hearing of it, will be encouraged the more to come to him for M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rcy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may well therefore be said to God, <hi>Thou delight<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But who believes that this was Gods design in shewing Mercy of old? Namely, That we that come after might take cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to come to him for Mercy; or that Jesus Christ would have Mercy offered in the first place to the biggest Sinners, to

            <p>Nor will Christ Jesus miss of his design in profering of Mercy in the <hi>first place</hi> to the biggest Sinners. You know what work the Lord, by laying hold of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria,</hi> made among the People there. They knew that she was a <hi>Town-Sinner,</hi> an Adultress. Yea, one that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the most audacious manner, lived in Uncleanness with a man that was not her Husband. But when she, from a turn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Heart, went into the City, and said to her Neighbours, <hi>Come</hi>: Oh how they came! how they flocked out of the City to Jesus Christ! <hi>Then they went out of the City, and came to him, and many of the Samaritans</hi> (People perhaps as bad as her self) <hi>believed on him, for the saying of the woman, which testified, saying, He told me all that ever I did</hi> (John 4.39.)</p>
            <p>That word, <hi>He told me all that ever I did,</hi> was a great Argument with them; for by that they gathered, That tho he knew her to be vile, yet he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise her, nor refuse to shew how willing he was to communicate his Grace unto

her: And this fetched over, fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This woman, as I said, was a <hi>Samaritan-Sinner,</hi> a Sinner of the worst Complexion. For the <hi>Jews</hi> abhorred to have ought to do with them (<hi>verse</hi> 9.) wherefore none more fit than she to be made one of the <hi>Decoys</hi> of Heaven, to bring others of these <hi>Samaritan Wild-Fowls</hi> under the Net of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e Grace of Christ. And she did the work to purpose. Many, and many more of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> believed on him, <hi>Verse</hi> 40, 41, 42. The Heart of man, tho set on Sin, will, when it comes once to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion that God is willing to have Mercy upon us, incline to come to Jesus Christ for life; witness those turn-a-ways from God, that you also read of in <hi>Jeremiah</hi>; for after they had heard three or four times over, that God had Mercy for back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliders, they broke out and said, <hi>Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.</hi> Or as those in <hi>Hosea</hi> did, <hi>For in thee the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Mercy, and the revelation thereof, is the only Antidote against Sin. 'Tis of a thawing nature: 'twill lose the Heart that is frozen up in Sin: yea, 'twill make the Unwilling willing to come to Jesus Christ for, Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:44053:35"/>Wherefore do you think was it that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ told the Adulterous woman, and that before so many Sinners, <hi>That he had not Condemned her,</hi> but to alure her, with them there present, to hope to find favour at his hands. (As he also saith in another place, <hi>I came not to Judge, but to Save the World),</hi> for might they not thence most rationally conclude, That if Jesus Christ had rather save, than damn an Harlot, there was encouragement for them to come to him for Mercy.</p>
            <p>I heard once a story from a Souldier, who with his Company had laid Siege against a Fort, that so long as the Besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were perswaded their Foes would show them no favour, they Fought like Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; but when they saw one of their Fellows taken, and received to favour, they all came tumbling down from their Fortress, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I am perswaded, did men believe that there is that Grace and Willingness in the Heart of Christ to save Sinners, as the Word imports there is, they would come tumbling into his Arms: But Satan has blinded their Minds, that they cannot see this thing.

So when Satan loseth his strong men, them that are mighty to work Iniquity, and <hi>dextrous</hi> to manage others in the same, then is his Kingdom weak (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.) Therefore I say, Christ doth offer Mercy in the first place to such, the more to weaken his Kingdom. Christ Jesus was glad to see Satan f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of some notorious Sinners out of his Clutches, (<hi>Luke</hi> 10.17, 18, 19.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Samptson,</hi> when he would pull down the <hi>Philistians</hi> Temple, took hold of the two main Pillars of it, and breaking them, down came the House. Christ came to destroy the works of the Devil, and to destroy by converting Grace, as well as by redeeming Blood. Now Sin swarms and lieth by Legions, and whole Armies, in the Souls of the biggest Sinners, as in Garrisons: Wherefore the way, the most direct way to destroy it, is first to deal with such Sinners, by the Word of his Gospel, and by the Merits of his Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>For Example, tho I shall give you but a homely one; Suppose a Family to be very Lowzy, and one or two of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to be <hi>in chief</hi> the breeders; the way, the quickest way, to clear that Family, or at least to weaken the so swarming of those Vermine, is, in the <hi>first place</hi> to sweeten the Skin, Head, and Cloaths of the <hi>chief breeders:</hi> And then, though all the Family should be apt to breed them, the number of them, and so the greatness of that Plague there, will be the more impaired.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:44053:37"/>Why, there are some people that are in chief the Devils <hi>Sin-Breeders</hi> in the Towns and Places where they live. The Place, Town, or Family where they live, must needs be horrible lowsie, and as it were, eaten up with <hi>Vermin:</hi> Now let the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> in the first place cleanse these great Breeders, and there will be given a nip to those swarms of Sins that use to be committed in such places through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Town, House, or Family where such <hi>sin-breeding</hi> Persons used to be.</p>
            <p>I speak by Experience; I was one of these lowzy ones, one of these great <hi>sin-breeders</hi>; I infected all the Youth of the Town where I was born, with all manner of youthful Vanities. The neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours counted me so, my practise proved me so: Wherefore <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> took me first; and taking me first, the Contagion was much allayed all the Town over. When God made me sigh, they would harken, and enquiringly say, <hi>What's the matter with</hi> John? They also gave their I various opinions of me: But as I said, Sin cooled, and failed, as to his full <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier.</hi> When I went out to seek the Bread of Life, some of them would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and the rest be put into a muse at home. Yea, almost the Town, <hi>at first,</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:44053:37"/>
at times, would go out to hear at the place where I found good: Yea, young and old for a while had some reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on them; also some of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that God had mercy upon me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> came crying to him for mercy too.</p>
            <p>But what need I give you an Instance of poor I; I will come to <hi>Manasseh</hi> the King: So long as he was a ringleading Sinner, the great Idolater, and chief for Devilism, the whole Land flowed with wickedness; <hi>For he made them to sin,</hi> and do worse than the Heathen that dwelt round about them, or that was cast out from before them. But when God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted him, the whole Land was reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Down went the Groves, the Idols, and Altars of <hi>Baal,</hi> and up went true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in much of the Power and Purity of it. You'll say, The King reformed by Power. I answer, doubtless, and by Example too; for People observe their Leaders; as their Fathers did, so did they, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.41.</p>
            <p>This therefore is another Reason, why <hi>Jesus</hi> would have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners, because that is the best way, if they receive it, most to weaken the kingdom of Satan, and to keep it poor and low.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:44053:38"/>And do you not think now, that if God would but take hold of the hearts of some of the most notorious in your Town, in your Family, or Countrey, that this thing would be verified before your faces? It would, it would, to the Joy of you that are godly, to the making of Hell to sigh, to the great suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Sin, the glory of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the joy of the Angels of God. And Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters should therefore, that this Work might go on, take advantages to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade with the biggest Sinners to come into <hi>Christ,</hi> according to <hi>my</hi> Text, and <hi>their</hi> Commissions: <hi>Beginning at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, Jesus Cbrist</hi> would have mercy offered in the <hi>first</hi> place to the biggest sinners. <hi>Because such, when converted, are usually the best helps in the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst temptations, and fittest for the support of the feeble minded there.</hi> Hence, usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you have some such in the first plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Churches; or quickly upon it. Churches would do but sorrily, if <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> did not put such Converts among them; they are the Monuments and Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Mercy. The very sight of such a Sinner in God's House, yea, the very thought of him, where the sight of him
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44053:38"/>
cannot he had, is oft-times greatly for the help of the Faith of the feeble.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When the Churches</hi> (said <hi>Paul) that were in Judea, heard this concerning me, that he which persecuted them in time past, now preached the Faith which once he destroyed, They glorified God in me,</hi> Gal. 1.20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Glorified God</hi>] How is that? Why, they praised him, and took courage to believe the more in the mercy of God: For that he had had mercy on such a great sloner as he. They glorified God [<hi>in me</hi>] They wondred that Grace should be so rich, as to take hold of such a Wretch as I was; and for my sake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in <hi>Christ</hi> the more.</p>
            <p>There are two things that great sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are acquainted with, when they come to divulge them to the Saints, that are a great relief to their Faith.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Contests that they usually have with the Devil at their parting with him.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44053:39"/>
what the vile ones find at first; but when at the opening of hearts the one finds himself to be as the other, the one is a comfort to the other. The lesser sort of sinners find but little of this, till after they have been some time in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; but the Vile Man meets with his at the beginning. Wherefore he, when the other is down, is ready to tell that he has met with the same before. For I say, he has had it before. Satan is loth to part with a great Sinner. What, my true Servant (quoth he) my old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, wilt thou forsake me now? Having so often sold thy self to me to work wickedness, wilt thou forsake me now? Thou horrible Wretch, dost not know, that thou hast sinned thy self beyond the reach of Grace, and dost think to find Mercy now?

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> And as for the Secrets of Satan, such as are Suggestions to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion the Being of God, the truth of his Word, and to be annoyed with devilish Blasphemies: None more acquainted with these than the biggest sinners at their Conversion; wherefore thus also they are prepared to be helps in the Church to relieve and comfort the other.</p>
            <p>I might also here tell you of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests and Battels that such are engaged in, wherein they find the beffettings of

Satan, above any other the Saints. At which times Satan assaults the Soul with darkness, fears, frightful thoughts of Apparitions; now they sweat, pant, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and struggle for life.</p>
            <p>The Angels now come down to behold the sight, and rejoyce to see a bit of Dust and Ashes to overcome Principalities and Powers, and Might, and Dominions. But, as I said, when these come a little to be setled, they are prepared for help for others, and are great Comforts unto them. Their great sins give encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Devil to assault them, and by these temptations <hi>Christ</hi> takes advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to make them the more helpful to the Churches.</p>

            <p>'Twas <hi>Paul</hi> that must go to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> because <hi>Paul</hi> was the most out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious of all the Apostles, in the time of his unregeneracy: Yea, <hi>Peter</hi> must be he that after his horrible fall, was thought fittest, when recovered again, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and strengthen his Brethren. See <hi>Luke</hi> 22.31, 32.</p>
            <p>Some must be Pillars in God's House, and if they be Pillars of Cedar, they must stand while they are stout and stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy sticks in the Forrest, before they are cut down, and planted or placed there.</p>
            <p>No man, when he buildeth his House, makes the principal parts thereof, of weak or feeble Timber; for how could such bear up the rest; but of great and able Wood. <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> also goeth this way to work, he makes of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest Sinners, Bearers and Supporters to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44053:41"/>
the rest. This then may serve for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reason, why <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> gives out in Commandment, that Mercy should in the first place be offered to the biggest Sinners, <hi>Because such when converted, are usually the best h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Another reason, why <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> would have Mercy offered in the <hi>first place</hi> to the biggest Sinners, is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>They, when converted, are apt to Live him most.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This agrees both with Scripture, and Reason. Scripture says so. <hi>To whom much is forgiven, the same loveth much. To whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little,</hi> Luk. 7.47. Reason says so. For as it would be the unreasonablest thing in the world, to render hatred for love, and contempt for forgiveness; so 'twould be as ridiculous to think that the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a little kindness should lay the same obligations upon the heart to love, as the reception of a great deal. I would not disparage the love of <hi>Christ</hi>; I know the least dram of it, when it reaches to <hi>forgiveness,</hi> is great above all the world; But comparatively, there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> greater extentions of the love of <hi>Chris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:44053:41"/>
to one, than to another: He that has most sin, it forgiven, is partaker of the greatest love, of the greatest forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>I know also, that there are some, that from this very Doctrine, say, <hi>Let us do evil, that good may come</hi>; and that turn the Grace of our God into Lasciviousness. But I speak not of these, These will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ruled by <hi>Grace</hi> nor <hi>Reason. Grace</hi> would teach them, if they know it, to deny Ungodly Courses; and so would <hi>Reason</hi> too, if it could truly sense the Love of God, <hi>Tim.</hi> 2 11, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Doth it look like what hath any Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with Reason or Mercy, for a man to abuse his Friend? Because Christ died for men, shall I therefore Spit in his Face? The Bread and Water that was given by <hi>Elisha</hi> to his Enemies, that came the Land of <hi>Israel</hi> to take him, had so muc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But to forbear to Illustrate till anon; one reason why Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ist Jesus shews Mercy to Sinners, <hi>is that he might obtain their
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44053:42"/>
Love,</hi> that he may remove their base af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, firm base objects, to himself. Now if he loves to be loved a little, he loves to be loved much; but there is not any that are capable of loving much, save those that have much forgiven them. Hence 'tis said of <hi>Paul,</hi> That he labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more than them all, to wit, with a labour of love, because he had been by Sin more vile against <hi>Christ</hi> than they all, 1 Cor. 15. He it was that persecuted the Church of God, and wasted it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.13. He, of them all, was the only raving Bedlam against the Saints: <hi>And being exceeding mad,</hi> says he, <hi>against them, I persecuted them even to strange Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> Acts 26.11.</p>
            <p>This raving Bedlam, that once was so, is he that now says, <hi>I laboured more than them all; more for Christ than them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> Paul, <hi>what moved thee thus to do?</hi> The love of <hi>Christ,</hi> says he. It was not I, but the grace of God that was with me. As who should say; <hi>O Grace!</hi> 'Twas such Grace to save me! 'Twas such marvelous Grace for God to look down from Heaven upon me, and that secured me from the wrath to come, that I am captivated with the sense of the rich<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of it. Hence I act, hence I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44053:42"/>
For how can I otherwise do, since God not only separated me from my Sins and Companions, but separated all the powers of my Soul and Body to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? I am therefore <hi>prompted</hi> on by this exceeding love, to labour as I have done; yet not I, but the grace of God with me.</p>
            <p>Oh! I shall never forget his love, nor the circumstances under which I was, when his love laid hold upon me. I was going to <hi>Damascus</hi> with Letters from the High Priest to make Havock of God's People there, as I had made Havock of them in other places. These bloody Letters was not imposed upon me. I went to the High Priest and desired them of him, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.1, 2. And yet he saved me! I was one of the men, of the chief men that had a hand in the Blood of his Martyr <hi>Stephen,</hi> yet he had mercy on me! When I was at <hi>Damas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yea, joyned mercy to mercy, until he had made me a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Grace.

            <p>I will tell you a Story that I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ead of <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi>; the Name of the Book I have forgot. I mean of the Book in which I found the Relation; but the thing was thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Martha,</hi> saith my Author, was a very holy Woman, much like <hi>Lazarus,</hi> her Brother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but <hi>Mary</hi> was a loose and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>nd Lectures, when she could come at them in <hi>Jerusalem</hi>; but
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44053:44"/>
               <hi>Mary</hi> would frequent the house of Sports, and the company of the vilest of Men for lust. And though <hi>Martha</hi> had often desired that her Sister would go with her to hear her Preachers: Yea, had often entreated her with Tears, to do it, yet could she never prevail; for still <hi>Many</hi> would make her excuse, or reject her with disdain for her Zeal and Preciseness in Religion.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Martha</hi> had waited long, tried many ways to bring her Sister to good, and all proved ineffectual. At last, she comes upon her thus. <hi>Sister,</hi> quoth she, <hi>I pray thee go with me to the Temple to day, to hear one preach a Sermon.</hi> What kind of Preacher is he, said she? <hi>Martha</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>It is one</hi> Jesus of Nazareth, <hi>he is the handsomest man that ever you saw with your eyes. Oh! he shines in Beauty, and is a most excellent Preacher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what does <hi>Mary?</hi> After a little pause, but goes up into her Chamber, and with her Pins and her Clouts, decks up her self as fine as her fingers could make her. This done, away she goes, not with her Sister <hi>Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ha,</hi> but as much unobserved as she could, to the Sermon, or rather to <hi>See</hi> the Preacher.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:44053:44"/>The Hour and Preacher being come, and she having observed whereabout the Preacher would stand, goes and sets her self so in the <hi>Temple,</hi> that she might be sure to have the full view of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Person. So he comes in, and she looks, and the first glimps of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son pleased her. Well, <hi>Jesus</hi> addresseth himself to his Sermon, and she looks earnestly on him.</p>
            <p>Now at that time, saith my Author, <hi>Jesus</hi> Preached about the <hi>lost Sheep,</hi> the <hi>lost Goat,</hi> and the <hi>prodigal Child.</hi> And when he came to shew what care the Shepherd took for one lost Sheep, and how the Woman swept to find her Piece which was lost, and what Joy there was at their finding; she began to be taken <hi>by the Ears,</hi> and forgot what she came about, musing what the Preacher would make on't: But when he came to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and shewed that by the lost Sheep was meant a great Sinner; by the Shepherds care was meant God's love for great Sinners; and that by the joy of the Neighbours, was shewed what joy there was among the Angels in Heaven over one great Sinner that repenteth; She began to be taken <hi>by the Heart.</hi> And as he spake these last words, she thought
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44053:45"/>
he pitched his innocent Eyes just upon her, and looked as if he spake what was now said, to her. Wherefore her heart began to tremble, being shaken with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and fear; then her Eyes run down with tears apace; wherefore she was forced to hide her face with her <hi>Handkerchief,</hi> and so sat sobbing and crying all the rest of the Sermon.</p>
            <p>Sermon being done, up she gets, and away she goes, and withal, enquired where this <hi>Jesus</hi> the Preacher dined that day? And one told her, at the house of <hi>Simon the Pharisee.</hi> So away goes she, first to her Chamber, and there strips her self of her wanton Attire; then falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her knees to ask God forgiveness for all her wicked life. This done, in a modest dress she goes to <hi>Simon</hi>'s house, where she finds <hi>Jesus</hi> set at Dinner. So she gets behind him, and weeps, and drops her tears upon his Feet like Rain, and washes them, and wipes them with the Hairs of her Head. She also kiss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When <hi>Simon</hi> the Pharisee perceived what the Woman did, and being ignorant of what it was to be forgiven much (for he never was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given more than Fifty Pence.) He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44053:45"/>
to think within himself, that he had been mistaken about <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> because he suffered such a Sinner as this Woman was, to touch him. Surely, quoth he, this Man, if he were a Prophet, would not let this Woman come near him, for she is a Town Sinner, (so ignorant are all Self-righteous men of the way of <hi>Christ</hi> with Sinners) But lest <hi>Mary</hi> should be discouraged with some clownish carriage of this <hi>Pharisee,</hi> and so desert her good beginnings, and her new steps which she now had began to take towards eternal Life, <hi>Jesus</hi> began thus with <hi>Simon. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> saith he, <hi>I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on. There was,</hi> said Jesus, <hi>a certain Creditor had two Debtors, the one owed him Five hundred Pence, and the other, Fifty. And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore which of them will love him most? Simon answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and said, I sup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I entred into thy house, thou gavest me no Water for my Feet: But she hath washed my Feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44053:46"/>

            <p>Thus you have the Story. If I come short in any Circumstance, I beg Pardon of those that can correct me. 'Tis three or four and twenty Years since I saw the Book, yet I have as far as my memory will admit, given you the relation of the Matter.

the great Sinners box of Oyntment. And the reason is, such sinners have not <hi>great</hi> sins to be saved from; or if they have, they look upon them in the <hi>diminishing-glass</hi> of the Holy Law of God. But I rather believe that the Professors of our days want a due sense of what they are; for verily, for the generality of them, both before and since Conversion, they have been sinners of a lusty size: But if their Eyes be holden, if Convictions are not shown, if their knowledge of their sins is but like to the eye-sight in twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, the Heart cannot be affected with that grace that has laid hold on the man, and so <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> sows much, and has little coming in.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly, Christ Jesus</hi> would have Mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners, beacause <hi>Grace, when it is received by such, finds matter to kindle upon more freely than it finds in other sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Great Sinners are like the <hi>dry Wood,</hi> or like <hi>great Candles,</hi> which burns best and shines with biggest light. I lay not this down, as I did those Reasons before, to shew, that when great Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are Converted, they will be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to others, though that is true; but to shew that <hi>Christ</hi> has a delight to see Grace, the Grace we receive, <hi>to shine.</hi> We love to see things that bear a good gloss, yea, we chuse to buy such kind of matter to work upon, as will, if wrought up to what we intend, cast that lustre that we desire. Candles that burn not bright, we like not; Wood that is green will rather smother and <hi>spu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:44053:48"/>Hence <hi>Christ</hi> desires the biggest Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in him there is Matter to work by, to wit, a great deal of sin; for as by the Tallow of the Candle, the Fire takes occasion to burn the brighter; so by the sin of the Soul, Grace takes occasion to shine the clearer. Little Candles shine but little, for there wanteth matter for the Fire to work upon; but in the great Sinner, here is more matter for Grace to work by. Faith shines, when it work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth towards <hi>Christ,</hi> through the sides of many and great Transgressors; and so does Love, for that much is forgiven. And what matter can be found in the Soul for Humility to work by so well, as by a sight that I have been and am an abominable Sinner? And the same is to be said of Patience, Meekness, Gentleness, Self-denial, or of any other Grace. Grace takes occasion by the vileness of the man, to shine the more; even as by the ruggidness of a very strong Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or Disease, the vertue of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine is best made manifest. <hi>Where Sin abounds, Grace much more abounds.</hi> Rom. 5.20. A black string makes the Grace burn clear. Some say when Grace and a good Nature meet together, they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44053:48"/>
do make shinning Christians; but I say, when Grace and a great Sinner meets, and when Grace shall subdue that great Sinner to it self, and shall operate after its kind in the Soul of that great Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then we have a shinning Christian; Witness all those of whom mention was made before.</p>

            <p>I have often marvelled at our Youth, and said in my heart, What should be the reason that they should be so generally at this day debauched as they are! For they are now Profane to amazement: And sometimes I have thought one thing, and sometimes another: That is, why God should suffer it so to be. At last I have thought of this: How if the God whose ways are past finding out, should suffer it so to be now, that he might make of some of them the more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Saints hereafter. I know Sin is of the Devil, but it cannot work in the world without permission: and if it happens to be as I have thought, it will not be the first time that God the Lord

            <p>'Tis rational to think, that by such Cogitations as these, the unbelieving World will be torn in pieces before the Judgment of <hi>Christ:</hi> Especially those that have lived where they <hi>did</hi> or <hi>might</hi> have heard the Gospel of the Grace of God.

            <p>This Reason therefore standeth fast; Namely, That <hi>Christ,</hi> by offering mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the <hi>first place</hi> to the biggest Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, now, <hi>will stop all mouths of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent at the day of Judgment,</hi> and cut off all excuse that shall be attempted to be made (from the thoughts of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>I have often thought of the day of Judgement, and how God will deal with sinners at that day: And I believe it will be managed with that sweetness, with that equitableness, with that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Righteousness, as to every sin, and circumstance, and aggravation thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that men that are damned, before the

            <p>And thus much for the Reasons. I will conclude with a word of Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>FIrst, Would <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> have Mercy offered in the <hi>first place</hi> to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest sinners? <hi>Then this shews us how to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44053:55"/>
make a right judgment of the heart of Christ to Men.</hi> Indeed we have advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to guess at the goodness of his Heart, by many things; as by his taking our nature upon him, his dying for us, his sending his Word and Ministers to us; and all that we might be saved. But this of <hi>beginning to offer mercy to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> is that which heightens all the rest; for this doth not only confirm to us, that Love was the cause of his dying for us, but it shews us yet more the depth of that Love: He might have dyed for us, and yet have extended the benefit of his death to a few, as one might call them, of the best-conditioned sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to those who (though they were weak, and so could not but sin) yet made not a trade of sinning; To those that sinned not lavishingly: There are in the World, as one may call them, the moderate Sinners; the sinners that mix Righteousness with their Pollutions; the sinners that, though they be sinners, do what on their part lies, (some that are blind would think so) that they might be saved. I say, it had been Love, great Love, if he had dyed for none but such, and sent his love to such: But
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44053:56"/>
that he should send out <hi>conditions of Peace</hi> to the biggest of Sinners! yea, that they should be offered to them first of all! (for so he means when he says, <hi>Begin at</hi> Jerusalem.) This is wonderful! this shows his heart to purpose, as also the heart of God his Father who sent him to do thus.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more incident to Men that are awake in their Souls, than to have wrong thoughts of God; Thoughts that are narrow, and that pinch and pen up his Mercy to scanty and beggarly conclusions, and ridged legal conditions; supposing that it is rude and an intrenching upon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, to come our selves, or to invite others, until we have scraped and wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and rubbed off as much of our dirt from us as we think is convenient, to make us somewhat orderly and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some in his sight. Such never knew what these Words meant, <hi>Begin at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi> Yea, such in their hearts have compared the Father and his Son to nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly rich Men, whose Money comes from them like drops of blood. True, says such, God has Mercy, but he is loth to part with it. You must please him well, if you get any from him:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44053:56"/>
He is not so free as many suppose, nor is he so willing to save as some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Gospellers imagine: But I ask such, If the Father and Son be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakably free to shew Mercy, why was <hi>this</hi> Clause put into our Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to preach the Gospel? Yëa, why did he say, <hi>Begin at Jerusalem?</hi> For when men, through the weakness of their wits, have attempted to shew other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons why <hi>they</hi> should have the first prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of Mercy, yet I can prove (by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny undeniable Reasons) that they of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (to whom the Apostles made the <hi>First</hi> offer, according as they were commanded) were the biggest Sinners that ever did breathe upon the face of God's earth (set the unpardonable sin aside) upon which my Doctrine stands like a Rock, That <hi>Jesus</hi> the Son of God would have Mercy in the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Neither is there, set this aside, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Argument like it, to shew us the willingness of <hi>Christ</hi> to save Sinners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, as was said before, all the rest of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44053:57"/>
the signs of <hi>Christ</hi>'s mercifulness might have been limitted to Sinners that are so and so qualified; but when he says, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at Jerusalem,</hi> the Line is stretched out to the utmost, no man can imagine beyond it, and it is folly here to pinch and pare, to narrow, and seek to bring it within scanty bounds, for he plainly saith, <hi>Begin at Jerusalem.</hi> The biggest Sinner, is the biggest Sinner; the <hi>biggest</hi> is the <hi>Jerusalem-sinner.</hi>

                     </gap>n by this also, you must learn to judge of the sufficiency of the merits of Christ</hi>; not that the Merits of <hi>Christ</hi> can be <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,</hi> for that they are beyond the Conceptions of the whole World, being called <hi>The unsearchable riches of Christ</hi>; but yet they may be <hi>apprehended</hi> to a considerable degree. Now the way to apprehend them most, is to consider what offers, after his Resurrection, he makes of his Grace to Sinners; for to be sure he will not offer beyond the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Merits; because as Grace is the cause of his Merits, so his Merits are the basis and bounds, upon and by which his Grace stands good, and is let out to Sinners. Doth he then command that his Mercy should be offered in the <hi>first place</hi> to the biggest Sinners? It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that there is a sufficiency in his Blood to save the biggest Sinners. The Blood of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> cleanseth from all Sin. And again, <hi>Be it known unto you Men and Brethren, That through this Man</hi> (this Man's Merits) <hi>is preached to you the forgiveness of Sins, and by him All that believe are justified from All things from
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44053:58"/>
which they could not be justified by the Law of Moses,</hi> Acts 13.38.</p>
               <p>Observe then thy Rule to make Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Sufficiency of the blessed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of thy Saviour; if he had not been able to have reconciled the biggest Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to his Father by his Blood, he would not have sent to them; have sent to them in the <hi>first place</hi> the Doctrine of Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sins; for Remission of Sins is through Faith in his Blood: We are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied freely by the Grace of God, through the Redemption that is in the Blood of <hi>Christ.</hi> Upon the square, as I may call it, of the worthiness of the Blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> Grace Acts, and offers Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Sin to Men, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.7. <hi>chap.</hi> 2.13, 14. <hi>Colos.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22.</p>
               <p>Hence therefore we must gather, That the Blood of <hi>Christ</hi> is of infinite value, for that he offereth Mercy to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest of Sinners: Nay further, since he offereth Mercy in the <hi>first place</hi> to the biggest Sinners; Considering also that this first act of his, is that which the World will take notice of, and expect it should be continued unto the end; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so it is a disparagement to a Man that seeks his own Glory in what he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, to do that for a spurt, which he
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44053:59"/>
cannot continue and hold out in: This is our Lord's own Argument, <hi>He began to build,</hi> saith he, <hi>but was not able to finish,</hi> Luk. 14.28, 29, 30.</p>
               <p>Shouldest thou hear a Man say, I am resolved to be kind to the Poor, and should begin giving with handfuls of <hi>Guinea's,</hi> you would conclude that either he is wonderful rich, or must straighten his hand, or will soon be at the bottom of his Riches. Why this is the Case, <hi>Christ</hi> at his Resurrection gave it out that he would be good to the World; and first sends to the biggest Sinners, with an intent to have Mercy on them. Now the biggest Sinners cannot be saved but by abundance of Grace, 'tis not a little that will save great sinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. And I say again, since the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> mounts thus high at the first, and sends to the <hi>Jerusalem-sinners,</hi> that they may come first to partake of his Mercy; it follows that either he has unsearchable Riches of Grace and Worth in himself, or else he must straighten his hand, or his Grace and Merits will be spent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World's at an end. But let it be believed, as surely as spoken, he is still as full as ever! He is not a jot the poorer for all the Forgivenesses that he
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44053:59"/>
has given away to great Sinners; Also he is still as free as at first, for he never yet called back this Word, <hi>Begin at the Jerusalem-sinners.</hi> And as I said, since his Grace is extended according to the worth of his Merits; I conclude, that there is the same vertue in his Merits to save now, as there was at the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
               <p>O the Riches of the Grace of <hi>Christ!</hi> Oh the Riches of the Blood of <hi>Christ!</hi>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Stand thou also among those that are called the biggest sinners. And what then? Why the Text <hi>swoops</hi> you all; you cannot object your selves beyond the Text: It has a particular message to the <hi>biggest sinners.</hi> I say, it <hi>swoops</hi> you all.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But I am a Reprobate?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Now thou talkest like a fool, and medlest with what thou understandest not: No sin; but <hi>the sin of final impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi> can prove a Man a Reprobate. And I am sure thou hast not arrived as yet unto that: Therefore thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standest not what thou sayest, and makest groundless conclusions against thy self. Say thou art a Sinner, and I will hold with thee. Say thou art a great sinner, and I will say so too. Yea, say thou art one of the biggest sinners and spare not, for the Text yet is beyond thee, is yet betwixt Hell and thee; <hi>Begin at Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> has yet a smile upon thee: And thou talkest as if thou wast a Reprobate, and that the greatness of thy sins do
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44053:61"/>
prove thee so to be; when yet they of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> were not such, whose sins I dare say, were such, both for bigness and heinousness, as thou art not capable of committing beyond them; unless now, after thou hast received Conviction that the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is the only Saviour of the World, thou shouldest wickedly and despightfully turn thy self from him, and conclude he is not to be trusted to for Life, and so crucifie him for a Cheat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But I say, what is this to him, that would fain be saved by <hi>Christ?</hi> His sins did, as to greatness, never yet reach to the nature of the sins that the sinners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Text, had made themselves guilty of. He that would be saved by Christ, has an honourable esteem of him,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44053:61"/>
but they of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> preferred a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer before him; but as for him, they cried, away away with him,'tis not fit that he should live. Perhaps thou wilt object, <hi>That thy self hast a thousand times pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Take therefore incouragement, Man; Mercy is, by the Text, held forth to the biggest sinners. Yea, put thy self into the number of the worst by reckoning, that thou mayest be one of the first, and mayest not be put off till the biggest sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are served: For the biggest sinners are first <hi>invited</hi>; consequently, if they come, they are like to be the first that shall be <hi>served.</hi> 'Twas so with <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem; Jerus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The first in their own eyes shall be <hi>served</hi> last, and the last, or worst, shall be first. The Text insinuates it, <hi>Begin at Jerusalem</hi>; and Reason backs it, for they have most need. Behold ye therefore, how God's ways are above ours; we are for <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> the worst last, God is for <hi>serving</hi> the worst first. The Man at the Pool, that to my thinking, was longest in his Disease, and most helpless as to his Cure, was first healed, yea, he only was healed; for we read that <hi>Christ</hi> healed him, but we read not then that he healed one more there, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>

The Man in the Gospel made the desperate condition of his Child, an argument with <hi>Christ</hi> to haste his Cure: <hi>Sir, Come down,</hi> saith he, <hi>ere my Child die,</hi> Joh. 4 49. And <hi>Christ</hi> regarded his haste, saying, <hi>Go thy way, thy Son liveth,</hi> Ver. 50. <hi>Haste</hi> requires <hi>haste. David</hi> was for speed; Deliver me speedily; hear me speedily, answer me speedily, <hi>Psal.</hi> 31.2. <hi>Psal.</hi> 69.17. <hi>Psal.</hi> 102.2. But why speedily?

               <p>Thy stubbornness affects, afflicts the Heart of thy Saviour. Carest thou not for this? Of old, <hi>He beheld the City,

This is doing things with an <hi>high hand</hi> against the Lord our God, and a taking him, as it were, <hi>at the Catch!</hi> This is, as we lay among men, to seek to put a trick upon God, as if he had not sufficiently fortified his Proposals of Grace by his holy Word, against all <hi>such</hi> kind of fools as these. But look to it,</p>
               <p>Such will be found at the day of God, not among that great company of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem-sinners,</hi> that shall be saved by Grace, but among those that have been the great abusers of the grace of God in the World. These that say, <hi>Let us sin that Grace may abound, and let us do Evil that Good may come,</hi> their Damnation is just. And if so, they are a great way off of that Salvation that is by <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the <hi>Jerusalem sinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have therefore these things to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to that <hi>Jerusalem-sinner</hi> that would
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44053:72"/>
know, if he may be so bold to venture himself upon this Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Dost thou see thy sins?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Art thou weary of them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Wouldst thou with all thy heart be saved by Jesus Christ? I dare say no less, I dare say no more. But if it be truly thus with thee, how great so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thy sins have been, how bad soever thou feelest thy heart, how far so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art from thinking that God has mercy for thee; thou art the Man, the <hi>Jerusalem-sinner,</hi> that the Word of God has conquered, and to whom it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth free Remission of sins, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that is in Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>When the Jayler cried out, <hi>Sirs, What must I do to be saved?</hi> The answer was, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.</hi> He that sees his sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, is brought to his wits-end by them, and he that is <hi>so,</hi> is willing to part from them, and to be saved by the grace of God.</p>
               <p>If <hi>this</hi> be thy Case, fear not, give no way to Despair, thou <hi>presumest not,</hi> if thou believest to life everlasting in Jesus Christ. Yea, Christ is prepared for such as thou art.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:44053:73"/>Therefore take good courage and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. The design of Satan is to tell the Presumptuous, that their presuming on Mercy <hi>is good</hi>; but to perswade the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, that his believing <hi>is impudent bold dealing with God.</hi> I never heard a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous man in my life, say that he was afraid that he presumed; but I have heard many an honest humble Soul say, that they have been afraid that their Faith has been Presumption. Why should Satan molest those whose ways he knows will bring them to him? And who can think that he should be quiet when men take the right course to escape his hellish snares. This therefore is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why the truly humbled is opposed, while the Presumptuous goes on by <hi>Wind</hi> and <hi>Tide.</hi> The truly humble, Satan hates, but he laughs to see the foolery of the other.</p>
               <p>Does thy hand and heart tremble? Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee the Promise smiles; <hi>To this man will I look</hi> says God, <hi>even to him that is poor, and of a co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Also our Text stands firm as ever it did, and our Observation is still of force, <hi>That Jesus Christ would have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest Sinners.</hi> So then, let none <hi>Des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is then, not the abundance of sins committed, but the not coming heartily

to God by Christ for Mercy, that shuts men out of doors: And though their not coming <hi>heartily</hi> may be said to be <hi>but</hi> a Sin; yet 'tis <hi>Such</hi> a Sin, as causeth that all thy other sins abide upon thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forgiven.</p>

               <p>Thus doing, his Soul hates; but the Penitent, humble, broken-hearted Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, be his Transgressions red as Scarlet, red like Crimsom, in number as the Sand; though his transgressions cry to Heaven against him for Vengeance, and seem there to cry louder than do his Prayers, or Tears, or Groans for Mercy; yet he is safe. <hi>To this man God will look,</hi> Isa. 1.18. <hi>chap.</hi> 66, 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Would Jesus Christ have Mercy offered in the <hi>first place</hi> to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest Sinners? <hi>Then here is ground for those, that as to practice, have Not been such, to come to him for mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although there is no Sin little of it self, because it is a contradiction of the Nature and Majesty of God; yet we must admit of divers numbers, and also of aggravations: <hi>Two</hi> Sins are not so
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:44053:74"/>
many as <hi>three</hi>; nor are <hi>three,</hi> that are done in ignorance, so big as <hi>One</hi> that is done against light, against knowledge, and Conscience. Also there is the Child in Sin, and a Man in Sin that has his Hairs gray, and his Skin wrinkled for very Age. And we must put a differen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e betwixt these Sinners also. For can it be, that a Child of Seven, or ten, or six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old, should be <hi>such</hi> a Sinner, a Sinner so vile in the Eye of the Law, as he is who has walked according to the course of this World, forty, fifty, sixty, or seventy Years? Now the Youth, this Stripling, though he is a Sinner, is but a little sinner, when compared with such.</p>
               <p>Now I say, If there be room for the first sort, for those of the <hi>biggest</hi> size; certainly there is room for the <hi>lesser</hi> size? If there be a Door wide enough for a Gyant to go in at, there is certainly room for a Dwarff. If Christ Jesus has Grace enough to save great sinners, he has sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Grace enough to save little ones. If he can forgive <hi>five hundred pence,</hi> for certain <hi>he can forgive fifty,</hi> Luk, 7.41, 42.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But you said before, that the little sinners must stand by, untill the great ones have
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44053:75"/>
received their grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and that's discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, There are two sorts of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Sinners such as <hi>are</hi> so, such as <hi>feign</hi> themselves so. There are those that feign themselves so, <hi>that I intended there,</hi> and not those that are indeed comparatively so. Such as feign themselves so, may wait long enough before they obtain For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenness.</p>
               <p>But again, A Sinner may be compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively a little sinner, and sensibly a great one. There is then <hi>two sorts of greatness in sin</hi>; greatness by reason of number, greatness by reason of throughness of conviction of the horrible nature of Sin. In this last sense, <hi>he that has but one sin,</hi> if such a one could be found, may in his own eyes find himself the biggest sinner in the world. Let this Man, or this Child, therefore put himself among the great sinners, and plead with God as great sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners do, and expect to be saved with the great sinners, and as soon, and as heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily as they.</p>
               <p>Yea, a little sinner, that comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is truly so, if he shall graciously give way to Conviction, and shall in God's light, diligently weigh the horrible na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his own sins, may yet sooner ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44053:75"/>
Forgiveness for them at the hands of the heavenly Father, than he that has ten times his sins, and so cause to cry ten times harder to God for Mercy.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>grievousness</hi> of the Cry is a great thing with God; for if he will hear the Widdow, if she cries <hi>at all,</hi> how much more if she cries most <hi>grievously</hi>? Exod. 22.22, 23.</p>
               <p>It is not the number, but the true sense of the abominable nature of Sin, that makes the Cry for Pardon lamentable. He, as I said, that has many sins, may not cry so loud in the ears of God, as he that has far fewer; he in our <hi>present</hi> sense that is in his own eyes the biggest sinner, is he that soonest findeth mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The offer Then is to the Biggest sinner, to the biggest sinner First, and the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rcy is first obtained by him that first confesseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be such an one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are men that strive at the throne of Grace for Mercy, by pleading the greatness of their Necessity. Now their Plea, as to the prevalency of it, lieth not in their counting up of the <hi>number,</hi> but in the sense of the <hi>greatness</hi> of their sins, and in the vehemency of their cry for Pardon. And it is observable, that though the Birth right was <hi>Rubins,</hi> and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44053:76"/>
for his foolishness, given to the Sons of <hi>Joseph</hi>; yet <hi>Judah</hi> prevailed above his Brethren, and of him came the <hi>Messias,</hi> 1 Chron. 5.1, 2.</p>
               <p>There is a heavenly subtilty to be man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged in this matter. <hi>Thy Broth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r came with subtilty and hath taked away thy bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> The blessing belonged to <hi>Esau,</hi> but <hi>Jacob</hi> by his diligence made it his own, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.35. The offer is to the biggest sinner, to the biggest sinner first, but if he forbears to cry, the sinner that is a sinner less by far than he, both as to number and the nature of transgression, may get the blessing first, if he shall have grace to bestir himself well; for the loudest Cry is heard furthest, and the most lamentable, pierces soonest.</p>
               <p>I therefore urge this Head, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I would have little sinners go and tell God that they are little sinners, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to think to obtain his Mercy; for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, so they are never like to have it: For such words declare, that such a one hath no true sense at all of the nature of his sins.</p>
               <p>Sin, as I said, in the nature of it, is horrible; though it be but one single sin as to act; yea, though it be but a sinful
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44053:76"/>
thought; and so worthily calls for the damnation of the Soul.</p>
               <p>The Comparison then, of little and great Sinners, is to go for good sense a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men: But to plead the fewness of thy sins, or the comparative harmlesness of their quantity before God, argueth no sound knowledge of the nature of thy Sin, and so no true sense of the nature or need of Mercy.</p>
               <p>Little Sinner when therefore thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to God, though thou knowest in thy Conscience, that thou, as to acts, art no Thief, no Murderer, no Whore, no Liar, no false Swearer, or the like, and in reason must needs understand, that <hi>thus</hi> thou art not so profanely vile as others; yet when thou goest to God for Merey, know no mans sins but thine own, make mention of no mans sins but thine own. Also labour not to lessen thy own, but magnifie and greaten them by all just Circumstances, and be as if there was never a Sinner in the World but thy self. Also cry out as if thou wast the only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done Man; and that is the way to obtain God's Mercy.</p>
               <p>It is one of the comeliest Sights in the world, to see a little Sinner commenting upon the greatness of his sins; multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>As therefore I said to the great Sinner before, let him take heed <hi>lest he presumes</hi>: I say now to the little Sinner, let him take heed <hi>that he don't dissemble</hi>: For there is as great an aptness in the little Sinner to dissemble, as there is in the great one. <hi>He that hideth his sins shall not prosper,</hi> be he a sinner little or great, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Would <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy offered in the <hi>first place</hi> to the biggest Sinners? <hi>Then this shews the true cause why Satan makes such head as he doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</hi>

               <p>There is nothing like Faith to help at a pinch; Faith dissolves Doubts, as the Sun drives away the Mists. And that you may not be put out, know your time, as I said, of believing is always. There are times when some Graces may be out of use, but there is <hi>no</hi> time wherein Faith can be said to be so. Wherefore Faith must be always in exercise.</p>
               <p>Faith is the <hi>eye,</hi> is the <hi>mouth,</hi> is the <hi>hand,</hi> and one of these is of use all day long, <hi>Faith</hi> is to <hi>see,</hi> to <hi>receive,</hi> to <hi>work,</hi> on

to <hi>eat</hi>; and a Christian should be seeing or receiving, or working, or feeding all day long. Let it rain, let it blow, let it thunder, let it lighten, a Christian must still believe: <hi>At what time,</hi> said the good man, <hi>I am afraid, I will trust in thee,</hi> Psal. 56.2, 3.</p>
               <p>Nor can we have a better encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to do this, than is by the Text set before us, even an open heart for a <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem Sinner.</hi> And if for a <hi>Jerusalem-Sinner</hi> to come, then for such an one, <hi>when</hi> come. If such a one <hi>To Be</hi> saved, then for such a one that <hi>Is</hi> saved. If for such a one <hi>To</hi> be pardoned his great transgressions, then for such a one who <hi>Is</hi> pardoned these, to come daily to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ</hi> too, to be cleansed and set free from his common Infirmities, and from the Iniquities of his holy things.</p>
               <p>Therefore let the poor Sinner that would be saved, labour for skill to make the best Improvement of the grace of Christ to help him against the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Devil and his Sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tengthly,</hi> Would <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> have Mercy offered in the <hi>first place</hi> to the biggest Sinners? <hi>Let those men consider this, that</hi> (have, or) <hi>may in a day of

trial have spoken or done what their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession or Conscience told them they should not, and that have the guilt and burden thereof upon their Consciences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether a thing be wrong or right, Guilt may pursue him that doth contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Conscience. But suppose a man should deny his God, or his Christ, or relinquish a good Profession, and be under the real guilt thereof? Shall he therefore conclude he is gone for ever? Let him come again with <hi>Peter's</hi> tears, and no doubt but he shall obtain <hi>Peter's</hi> Forgiveness. For the Text <hi>includes the biggest sinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And 'tis observable, That <hi>before this Gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He that Revolteth in the day of Trial, if he is not shot quite dead upon the place, but is sensible of his Wound, and calls out for a <hi>Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> shall find his Lord at hand to pour Wine and Oyl into his Wounds, that he may again be healed. And to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him to think that there may be Mercy for him: Besides what we find Recorder of <hi>Peter,</hi> you read in the <hi>Acts,</hi> some was through the violence of their Trials, compelled to Blaspheme, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:44053:82"/>
yet are called Saints, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>Hence you have a Promise or two that speaks concerning such a kind of Men, to incourage us to think that at least some of them shall come back to the Lord their God. <hi>Shall they fall,</hi> saith he, <hi>and not arise? Shall they turn away, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn?</hi> Jer. 8 4. <hi>And in that day I will assemble her that halteth, and I will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her that was driven out, and her that I have Afflicted. And I will make her that halteth a Remnant, and her that was cast off, a strong Nation; And the Lord shall reign over them in Mount Zion for ever.</hi> What we are to understand by her that halteth, is best expressed by the Prophet <hi>Elijah, Mic.</hi> 4.6, 7. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.19. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.21.</p>
               <p>I will conclude then, that for them that <hi>have</hi> halted, or <hi>may</hi> halt, the Lord has Mercy in the Bank, and is willing to accept them if they return to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>Perhaps they may never be after that of any great esteem in the House of God, but if the Lord will admit them to favour and forgiveness: O exceeding and undeserved Mercy! See <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> has bags of Mercy that was never yet broken up or unsealed. Hence it is said, he has goodness <hi>laid up</hi>; things <hi>reserved</hi> in Heaven for his. And if he breaks up one of these bags, who can tell what he can do!</p>
               <p>Hence his Love is said to be such as <hi>passeth Knowledge,</hi> and that his Riches are <hi>unsearchable.</hi> He has, <hi>no body</hi> knows what; for <hi>no body</hi> knows who!

For this the Text is plain. What Man or Angel could have thought that the <hi>Jerusalem-sinners</hi> had been yet on this side of an impossibity of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life and Mercy? Hadst thou seen their actions, and what horrible things they did to the Son of God: Yea, how stoutly they backed what they did, with resolves and endeavours to persevere, when they had killed his Person, against his Name and Doctrine: And that there was not found among them all that while as we read of, the least remorse or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret for these their doings: Couldst thou have imagined that Mercy would ever have took hold of them, at least so soon! Nay, that they should, of all the World be counted those <hi>Only</hi> meet to have it offered to them in the <hi>very first place</hi>!

               </p>
               <p>I tell you the thing is a Wonder, and must for ever stand for a Wonder among the Sons of Men. It stands also for an everlasting Invitation and Allurement to the biggest Sinners to come to <hi>Christ</hi> for Mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:44053:84"/>Now, since, in the Opinion of all Men, the Revolter is such a one; if he has, as I said before, any Life in him, let him take incouragment to come again, that he may live by Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> Would <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> have Mercy offered in the <hi>first place</hi> to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest Sinners? <hi>Then let God's Ministers tell them so.</hi> There is an Incidence in us, I know not how it doth come about, when we are Converted, to contemn them that are left behind.

               <p>But would it not become us better, since we have tasted that the Lord is gracious, to carry it towards them so, that we may give them Convincing ground to believe, that we have found that Mercy which also sets open the Door for them to come and partake with us.</p>
               <p>Ministers, I say, should do thus, both by their Doctrine, and in all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.</p>
               <p>Austerity doth not become us, neither in Doctrine nor in Conversation: We our selves live by Grace; Let us give as we receive, and labour to perswade our fellow-sinners which God has left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind

               </p>
               <p>And as I have said concerning Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, so I say to all the Brethren, carry
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:44053:85"/>
it so, that all the World may see, that indeed you are the Sons of Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Love your Saviour</hi>; Yea, shew one to another that you love him, not only by a seeming love of Affection, but with the love of Duty. Practical Love is best. Many love <hi>Christ</hi> with nothing but the lick of the Tongue. Alas! <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> the Lord; must not be put off thus: <hi>He that hath my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and keepeth them,</hi> saith he, <hi>he it is that loveth me,</hi> Joh. 14.21.</p>
               <p>Practical Love, which stands in Self-denial, in Charity to my Neighbour, and a Patient enduring of Affliction for his Name: This is counted Love.</p>
               <p>Right Love to <hi>Christ,</hi> is that which carries in it a provoking Argument to others of the Brethren, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24.</p>
               <p>Should a Man ask me how he should know that he loveth the Children of God? The best answer I could give him, would be in the Words of the Apostle <hi>John; By this,</hi> saith he, <hi>we know we love the Children of God, when we love God, and keep his Commandments,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.2.</p>
               <p>Love to God and Christ, is <hi>then</hi>

                  </gap>, when we are tender of his Name; and then we shew our selves tender of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:44053:86"/>
his Name, when we are afraid to break any the least of his Commandments. And when we are here, then do we shew our love to our Brother also.</p>
               <p>Now we have Obligation sufficient thus to do, for that our Lord loved us, and gave himself for us, to deliver us from Death, that we might live through him.</p>
               <p>The World, when they hear the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that I have asserted and handled in this little Book, to wit, That <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> would have Mercy offered in the <hi>first place to the biggest Sinners</hi>; will be apt, because themselves are Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, to think that this is a Doctrine that leads to Looseness, and that gives liberty to the Flesh; but if you that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, love your Brethren; and your Neighbours truly, and as you should, you will put to silence the ignorance of such foolish Men, and stop their mouths from speaking Evil of you.</p>
               <p>And, I say, let the love of <hi>Christ</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain us to this. Who deserveth our Heart, our Mouth, our Life, our Goods, so much as <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who has bought us to himself by his Blood, to this very end, that we should <hi>be a peculiar Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:44053:86"/>There is nothing more seemly in the World, than to see a Christian walk as becomes the Gospel; nor any thing more unbecoming a Reasonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than to hear a man say, <hi>I believe in Christ,</hi> and yet see in his Life, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery and Profaneness. Might I, such men should be counted the basest of men; such men should be counted by all, unworthy of the Name of a <hi>Christian,</hi> and should be shunned by every good man, as such who are the very Plague of Profession.</p>
               <p>For so it is written, <hi>We should carry it towards them. Whoso has a Form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and deny the power thereof, from such we must turn away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It has oft-times come into my mind, to ask, by what means it is, That the Gospel Profession should be so Taunted with Loose and Carnal Gospellers? And I could never arrive to better Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the matter, than this, Such men are made Professors by the Devil, and so by him put among the rest of the Godly. A certain Man had a fruitless Figg-Tree planted in his Vineyard; but by whom was it planted there? Even by him that sowed the Tares, his own Children, among the Wheat, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.6. <hi>Matt.</hi>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:44053:87"/>
13.37, 38<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 39, 40. And that was the Devil. But why doth the Devil do thus? Not of love to them, but to make of them Offences and Stumbling blocks to others. For he knows that a loose Professor in the Church, does more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to Religion, than ten can do to it that are in the World.</p>
               <p>Was it not, think you, the Devil that stirred up the Damosel that you read of in <hi>Acts</hi> 16. to cry out, <hi>These are the Servants of the Most high God, that shew unto us the way of Salvation?</hi> Yes it was, as is evident, <hi>For Paul was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to hear it.</hi> But why did the Devil stir up her to cry so? But because that was the way to blemish the Gospel, and to make the World think that it came from the same hand as did her Sooth-say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Witchery, <hi>Ver.</hi> 16.17, 18. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, O Lord, becomes thy House for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let therefore, whoever they be that profess the Name of <hi>Christ,</hi> take heed that they Scandal not that Profession which they make of him, since he has so graciously offered us, as we are Sinners of the biggest size, in the <hi>first place,</hi> his Grace to Save us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:44053:87"/>HAving thus far spoken of the riches of the Grace of Christ, and of the freeness of his Heart to imbrace the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem-sinners</hi>; it may not be amiss to give you, yet, <hi>as a caution,</hi> an intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of one thing, namely, <hi>That this grace and freeness of his Heart is limited to time and day; the which, whoso over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth, shall perish notwithstanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, as a King, who of Grace, send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out to his Rebellious People an offer of Pardon, if they accept thereof by such a day, yet beheadeth, or hangeth those that come not in for mercy until the <hi>day</hi> or <hi>time</hi> be past: So Christ Jesus has set the Sinner a day, <hi>a day of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an acceptable time,</hi> but he who standeth out, or goeth on in Rebellion beyond that time, is like to come off with the loss of his Soul, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13, 16, 17, 18, 19. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.41, 42.</p>
               <p>Since therefore things are thus, it may be convenient here to touch a little upon these particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That this Day, or Time, thus limited, when it is considered with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to this or that man; is, <hi>oft-times</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:44053:88"/>
undiscerned by the person concerned therein, and <hi>always</hi> is kept secret as to the <hi>shutting up</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>And this in the wisdom of God is thus, to the end no man, when called upon, should put off turning to God to another time: <hi>Now,</hi> and <hi>to Day,</hi> is that and only that which is revealed in Holy Writ, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.22. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12.1. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>b.</hi> 3.13, 16.</p>
               <p>And this shews us the desperate haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards which those men run, who when <hi>invitation,</hi> or <hi>conviction</hi> attends them, put off turning to God to be saved till another, and as they think, a more fit season and <hi>time.</hi> For many by so doing, defer this to do, till the day of God's patience and long-suffering is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and then, for their Prayers and Cryes after mercy, they receive nothing but mocks, and are laughed at by the God of Heaven, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. <hi>Isa.</hi> 65.12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>chap.</hi> 66.4 <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another thing to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered is this, namely, that the day of God's grace with some men, <hi>begins</hi> sooner, and also sooner <hi>ends</hi> than it doth with others. Those at the <hi>first</hi> hour of the day, had their Call sooner than they
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44053:88"/>
who were called upon to turn to God at the sixth hour of the day; yea, and they who were hired at third hour, had their Call sooner than they who were called at the eleventh, <hi>Matt.</hi> 20.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 6.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The day of God's patience began with <hi>Ishmael</hi> and also ended, before he was twenty years old. At thirteen years of age he was Circumcised; the next year after, <hi>Isaac</hi> was born; and then <hi>Ismael</hi> was fourteen years old. Now that day that <hi>Isaac</hi> was weaned, that day was <hi>Ishmael</hi> rejected: and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that <hi>Isaac</hi> was three years old be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was weaned; that was but the seventeenth year of <hi>Ishmael</hi>; wherefore the day of God's grace was ended with him betimes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.24, 25. <hi>chap.</hi> 21.2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.30.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Cains</hi> day ended with him betimes, for after God had rejected him, he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to beget many Children, and build a City, and to do many other things. But alas, all that while he was a Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and a Vagabond. Nor carried he any thing with him after the day of his rejection was come; but this doleful language in his Conscience, <hi>From God's Face shall I be hid,</hi> Gen. 4.10, 11.12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p n="3">

                     </gap>pentance, though he sought it carefully with tears,</hi> Heb. 12.14, 15, 16.</p>
               <p>Many instances might be given, as to such tokens of the displeasure of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such as fool away, as the Wise Man has it, the prize which is put into their hand, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.16.</p>
               <p>Let these things therefore be a further caution to those that sit under the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious sound of the Gospel, and hear of the Riches of the Grace of God in Christ to poor sinners.</p>
               <p>To slight Grace, to despise Mercy, and to stop the Ear when God speaks, when he speaks such great things, so much to our profit, is a great provocation.</p>
               <p>He offereth, he calls, he woes, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, he prays, he beseeches us in this day of his Grace to be reconciled to him: yea, and has provided for us the means of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:44053:89"/>
reconciliation himself: Now this despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, must needs be provoking; and it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But some man may say unto me, Fain I would be saved, fain I would be saved by Christ: But I fear this day of Grace is past, and that I shall perish, notwithstanding the exceeding riches of the Grace of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> To this doubt I would answer several things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> With respect to this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> With respect to thy desires.</p>

               <p>Consequently those <hi>past grace,</hi> must be such as are denied the awakening fruits of the Word Preached. <hi>The dead that hear,</hi>

he may withdraw man from his purpose</hi> (his sinful purposes) <hi>and hide pride from man,</hi> Job 33.14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>All this while God has not left the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nor is come to the end of his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards him, but stands, at least, with the door of Grace, a chair in his hand, as being loth, as yet to bolt it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</p>

Master the Devil, Sin and the World? And has these desires put thy Soul to the flight? Hast thou through desires betaken thy self to thy heels? Dost fly to him that is a Saviour from the wrath to come, for life? If these be thy desires, and if they be unfeigned, fear not: Thou art one of those <hi>Runaways</hi> which God has commanded our Lord to receive, and not to send thee back to the Devil thy Master again, but to give thee a place in his House, even the place which liketh thee best. <hi>Thou shalt not deliver to his Master,</hi> saies he, <hi>the Servant which is escaped from his Master unto thee. He shall dwell with thee, even among you in that place which he shall chuse, in one of thy Gates where it liketh him best; thou shall not oppress him,</hi> Deut. 23.15, 16.</p>
               <p>This is a command to the Church, consequently to the Head of the Church; for all commands from God come to her through her Head. Whence I conclude, that, that as <hi>Israel</hi> of old was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Runaway</hi>-Servant who escaped from a Heathen Master to them, and should not dare to send him back to his Master again: So Christ's Church now, and consequently Christ himself may not, will not refuse that soul that has made

               <p>Wherefore if thy desires be firm, sound, unfeigned, to become the saved of Christ, and his servant: Fear not, he will not, he will in no wise put thee away, or turn thee over to thy old M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Though election is, in order, before calling, as to God, yet the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Calling must go before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of my Election, as to my self. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore souls that doubt of the truth of their Effectual Calling, do but plunge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44053:93"/>

               <p>Wherefore, at present, lay the thoughts of thy Election by, and ask thy self these questions; Do I see my lost condition? Do I see salvation is no where but in Christ? Would I share in this salvation by Faith of him? And would I, as was said afore, be throughly saved, to wit, from the filth, as from the guilt? Do I love Christ, his Father, his Saints, his Word and Ways? This is the way to prove we are Elect.

               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:44053:93"/>Let us therefore, upon the sight of our wretchedness, fly and venturously leap in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Arms of Christ, which are now as open to receive us into his Bosom, as they were when nailed to the Cross. This is coming to Christ for Life aright; this is right <hi>running away from thy Master to him,</hi> as was said before. And for this we have multitudes of Scriptures to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, incourage, and comfort us in our so doing.</p>
               <p>But now let him that doth thus, be sure to look for it, for Satan will be with him to morrow, to see if he can get him again to his old service; and if he cannot do that, then will he enter into dispute with him, to wit, about whether he be elect to Life, and called indeed to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of this Christ, to whom he is fled for succour, or whether he comes to him of his own presumptuous Mind. Therefore we are bid, as to come, so to Arm our selves with that Armour which God has provided; that we may resist, quench, stand against, and withstand all the Fiery Darts of the Devil, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 11, 12, 13, 14, l5, 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>If therefore thou findest Satan in this Order to march against thee, remember that thou hadst this <hi>Item</hi> about it; and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:44053:94"/>
betake thy self to Faith and good Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; and be sober, and hope to the End.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But how if I should have sinned the sin unpardonable, or That called the sin against the Holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If thou hast, thou art lost for ever: But yet before it is concluded by thee that thou hast so sinned, know that they that would be saved by Jesus Christ, through faith in his blood, cannot be counted for such.</p>
               <p n="1">l. Because of the Promise, for that must not be frustrate: And that saies, <hi>And him that cometh to Christ, he will in no wise cast.</hi> And again, <hi>Whoso will, let him take of the Water of Life freely,</hi> Joh. 6.37. Rev. 21 6. chap. 22.17.</p>
               <p>But, I say, how can these Scriptures be fulfilled, if he that would indeed be saved as before, has sinned the sin unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? The Scriptures must not be made void, nor their truth be cast to the ground. Here's a Promise, and here's a Sinner; a Promise, that saies he shall not be cast out that comes; and the sinner comes, wherefore he must be received: Consequently, he that comes to Christ for life, has not, cannot have sinned that sin for which there is no forgiveness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:44053:94"/>And this might suffice for an answer to any coming soul, that fears, though he comes, that he has sinned the sin against the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But again, He that has sinned the sin against the Holy Ghost cannot come, has no heart to come; can by no means be made willing to come to Jesus Christ for life; for that he has received such an opinion of him, and of his things, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and holds him back.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He counteth this blessed Person, this Son of God, a <hi>Magician,</hi> a <hi>Conjurer,</hi> a <hi>Witch,</hi> or one that did, when he was in the World, what he did, by the <hi>power</hi> and spirit of the Devil, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.34. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.24, 25, <hi>&amp;c. Mar.</hi> 3.22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. Now he that has this opinion of this Jesus, cannot be willing to cast himself at his foot for life, or to come to him as the only way to God, and to Salvation. And hence 'tis said again, that such an one puts him to open shame, and treadeth him under foot, that is, by contemning, reproaching, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying, and despising of him, as if he were the vilest one, or the greatest Cheat in the World: and has therefore, as to his esteem of him, called him accursed, crucified him to himself, or counted him

one hanged, as one of the worst of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6. and <hi>chap.</hi> 10.29. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>His Blood,</hi> which is the meritorious cause of mans redemption, even the blood <hi>of the everlasting Covenant, he counteth an unholy thing,</hi> or that which has no more vertue in it to save a Soul fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> sin, than has the blood of a Dog, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. For when the Apostle saies, <hi>he counts it an unholy thing</hi>; he means, he makes it of less value than that of a <hi>Sheep</hi> or <hi>Cow,</hi> which were clean according to the Law. And therefore must mean, that his blood was of no more worth to him in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, than was the blood of <hi>Dog,</hi> an <hi>Ass,</hi> or a <hi>Swine,</hi> which always was, as to sacrifices, rejected by the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as unholy, or unclean.</p>
               <p>Now he who has no better esteem of Jesus Christ, and of his Death and Blood, will not be perswaded to come to him for Life, or to trust in him for Salvation.</p>

               <p>Object. <hi>But if this be the sin unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, why is it called the sin against the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, and not rather the sin against the Son of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is called the sin against the Holy Ghost, because such count the works he did, which were done by the Spirit of God, the works of the spirit of the Devil: Also because all such as so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Christ Jesus the Lord, they do it in despight of that testimony which the Holy Ghost has given of him in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures; for the Scriptures are the breathings of the Holy Ghost, as in all other things, so in that testimony they bear of the Person of the Works, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, Resurrection, and Ascention of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Sinner, <hi>This is the sin against the Holy Ghost.</hi> What saist thou? Hast thou committed it; nay, I know thou hast not, if thou wouldst be saved by Christ. Yea, 'tis impossible thou shouldst have done it; if indeed thou wouldst be saved by him.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:44053:96"/>
No man can desire to be saved by him, whom he yet judgeth to be an Impostor, a Magician, a Witch. No man can hope for redemption by that Blood which he yet counteth an unholy thing. Nor will God ever suffer such an one to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, who has after light, and profession of him, thus horribly, and Devil-like, contemned and trampled upon him.</p>
               <p>True, Words, and Wars, and Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies against this Son of Man are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable; but then they must be done ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly and in unbelief. Also all blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous thoughts are likewise such as may be passed by, if the Soul afflicted with them, indeed is sorry for them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13, 14, 15. <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.28.</p>
               <p>All but this, Sinner, all but this! If God had said he will forgive one sin, it had been undeserved Grace: But when he saies, he will pardon all <hi>but</hi> one, this is grace to the height. Nor is that one unpardonable otherwise, but because the Saviour that should save them is rejected and put away.</p>
