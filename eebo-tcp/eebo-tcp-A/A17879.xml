            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

According to the humour of this Song, the Starres mooued in an exceeding strange and delightfull maner, and I suppose fewe haue euer seene more neate artifice, then Master <hi>Innigoe Iones</hi> shewed in contriuing their Motion, who in all the rest of the workmanship which belong'd to the whole inuention, shewed extraordinarie industrie and skill, which if it be not as liuely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest in writing as it appeared in view, robbe not him of his due, but lay the blame on my want of right apprehending his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for the adoring of his Arte. But to returne to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; about the end of this Song, the Starres suddainely vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, as if they had beene drowned amongst the Cloudes, and the eight Maskers appeared in their habits, which were infinitly rich, befitting States (such as indeede they all were) as also a time so farre heightned the day before, with all the richest shew of solemnitie that could be inuented. The ground of their attires was massie Cloth of Siluer, embossed with flames of Embroidery, on their heads, they had Crownes, Flames made all of Gold-plate Enameled, and on the top a Feather of Silke, representing a cloude of smoake. Vpon their new transformation, the whole Scaene being Cloudes dispersed, and there appeared an Element of artificiall fires, with seuerall circles of lights, in continuall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, representing the house of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> who then thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies his speech to the Maskers.</p>

            <p>The Pages returne toward the Scaene, to giue their attendance to the Maskers with their lights: from the side of the Scaene ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a bright and transparant cloud, which reached from the top of the heauens to the earth: on this cloud the Maskers led by <hi>Prometheus,</hi> descended with the musicke of a full song; and at the end of their descent, the cloud brake in twaine, and one part of it (as with a winde) was blowne ouerthwart the Scaene.</p>
            <p>While this cloud was vanishing, the wood being the vnder-part of the Scaene, was insensibly changed, and in place thereof appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red foure Noble women-statues of siluer, standing in seuerall ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, accompanied with ornaments of Architecture, which filled all the end of the house, and seemed to be all of gold-smithes work. The first order consisted of Pillasters all of gold, set with Rubies, Saphyrs, Emeralds, Opals, and such like. The Capitels were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and of a new inuention. Ouer this was a bastard order with Cartouses reuersed, comming from the Capitels of euery Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laster, which made the vpper part rich and full of ornament. Ouer euery statue was placed a history in gold, which seemed to be of base releaue; the conceits which were figured in them were these. In the first was <hi>Prometheus,</hi> embossing in clay the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a woman, in the second he was represented stealing fire from the chariot-wheele of the Sunne: in the third, he is exprest putting life with this fire into his figure of clay; and in the fourth square, <hi>Iupiter</hi> enraged, turnes these new made women into sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Aboue all, for finishing, ran a Cornish, which returned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer euery Pillaster, seeming all of gold and richly carued.</p>
