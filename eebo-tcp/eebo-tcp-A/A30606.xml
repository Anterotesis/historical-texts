            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Know well what Reverence Subjects owe to their Soveraigne, and am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the puiſſance and Majeſty of a King of great Brittaine, believe, I ſhould not preſume to write to ſo great a Monarch, if the Loyalty of a Subject, the honour of Your vertues and ſome particular obligations of my own, did not command me to neglect all other reſpects, and prefere Your ſafety, honour, and <hi>bonum publicum,</hi> before any dangers or blame, I foreſee may incurre, and the rather becauſe I ſpeake in your owne care only, without publiſhing or imparting to others that which I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto Your Majeſty, The cauſe is briefly thus.</p>
            <p>Wandring abroad in the world, I was informed of certaine ſecret conference in <hi>Holland,</hi> and how to relieve the diſtreſſed eſtate of the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> and I have ſeene diverſe diſcourſes out of <hi>England,</hi> of the neceſſity to maintaine the Ancient authority of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> how to aſſure Religion from oppreſſion, and alteration, and how to reforme the government there both in Church, and Common-wealth, audacious arguments, and as inſolently handled.</p>
            <p>I meane not to trouble Your Highneſſe with pedlors ſtuffe, and ſo ſtale wares, as <hi>Vox populi and votiva Angliae,</hi> but to inform You of ſome books (amongſt many others) <hi>T.T.Troth.</hi> The practiſe of Princes, and the lamentation of the <hi>Kirke</hi>; which are the works of ſuch <hi>Boutefeus,</hi> as are able to ſet the whole State on fire, imbroyle the Realm and aliene the hearts of people from their Prince, for theſe Maskers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Viſards of Religion, ſeeke to undermine Loyalty, and either to ingage you abroad in forraigne wars, or in danger Your perſon at home in Civill; And yet I write not to confute theſe learned ſcriblers (more worthy to be contemned then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered) but to advertiſ Your Highneſſe of them, that by an <hi>obſta principiis,</hi> you may upon ſuch ſmoake prepare all things needfull to quench ſuch a fire, when it ſhall flame, and firſt breake out, which is may doe when you leaſt looke for it; For by nature theſe ſpirits, are fiery hot ſpurs, and fitter for any thing, then that they moſt profeſſe, <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Patience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that they may plainely appeare in their own likeneſſe, Your Highneſſe may bee pleaſed to mark and conſider how ſawcily and preſumptuouſly they contemne Monarches ſcorne and diſgrace them, The Emperour <hi>Tom Tell-Troth</hi> calls a quiet lumpe of Majeſty; and in ſcorne of him, tells his Reader he cannot wrong a

Things are grown to a great deale worſe paſſe then before, and to the great greif of goodneſſe and good men, without Gods ſpeciall mercy reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy leſſe.</p>
            <p>This is the picture and portraiture they make of your Government, and they dare cenſure their Soveraign, and like mad-men they alſo rave againſt your Councell <hi>pag.</hi> 13. what a miſerable thing is it to ſee wicked Counſellors get ſuch a hand over the King, that he is wholly ruled by them, neither dares he favour a good man nor his cauſe further then they admit.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But to leave the perſons and their errors, and come nearer to the matter, let us enquire what remedies theſe zealous brethren preſcribe to cure the wounds of the State, and ſalve the Kings honour: You have two occaſions (ſaith <hi>Tom-tell-troth)</hi> to have the honour of your Mayden Armes (for which the old Martyrs would have ſuffered death) firſt to reeſtabliſh your own Children in <hi>Germany,</hi> and next to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Gods Children in <hi>France.</hi> And there is no way to vindicate your honour but by fighting with him that hath Cozened you, and by driving the Enemy out of their Country: For men hardly think you are their father, for the lamentable eſtate you ſuffer them to runn into.</p>
            <p>How violent and ignorant are theſe diſcontented Empericks, who appoint re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies worſe then the diſeaſe? For no wiſe man would counſell you to hazard all by taking armes againſt the two greateſt Monarches in Chriſtendom, againſt whom you have no juſt quarrell of your own part, or for the Common-wealth. And yet I know that <hi>Anno</hi> 1623. a pamphlet was publiſhed without the Authors name, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiled, Certaine reaſons why the King of <hi>England</hi> ſhould give over all treaties, and enter into war with <hi>Spaine:</hi> and that for two cauſes: the one for the preſcription of the <hi>Palatin,</hi> which he calls the head of all theſe evills. And the other for that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> poſſeſſe by force the patrimony of the Infants, and eject the <hi>Palatin</hi> and his wife out of the ſame (contrary to hopes and promiſes made for their reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) and therefore there is juſt cauſe why the Father ſhould vindicate the honour of his Sonne. So here are two motives to perſwade the King to breake off all amity and further negotiation with <hi>Spaine</hi> only, and in poſt to proclaime war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55957:5"/>
them. The preſcription of the <hi>Palſgrave,</hi> and the invading, and detaining of his Eſtate. War and hoſtility are the meanes preſcribed for this reſtitution, and the finall end of all is, to breake off all treaties, all entercourſe and correſpondencie with <hi>Spaine</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Colerick courſe certainly, whereof King <hi>James</hi> approved not, and although they ſeeme to vilifie and abuſe his Judgement, yet his ſpeech uttered in Parliament was more ſolid and provident then the precipitation of theſe projectors. For ſaid he, in matters of this waight, I muſt firſt conſider how this courſe can agree with my conſcience, my honour, and the juſtneſſe of the cauſe; And next, how I ſhall be enabled to performe the ſame: a breif ſpeech, ſound, and methodicall: For, ſurely, if the title and Crown of <hi>Bohemia</hi> was unlawfully uſurped by the <hi>Palſgrave</hi> (which his wiſeſt and greateſt Friends ſought ever rather to excuſe, then defend) then his preſcription was well grounded upon <hi>lex Talienis, aquum &amp; bonum,</hi> and reaſon of State. And ſo they would perſwade you to undertake the patronage of a quarrell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and diſhonourable, which would lye as a heavie and ſinfull burthen upon the conſcience of a pious and juſt Prince.</p>
            <p>Therefore I take this to be the foundation of all theſe controverſies, whether the <hi>Palſgrave</hi> were lawfully and juſtly elected King of <hi>Bohemia:</hi> For if he were not, you altogether looſe, and not vindicate your honour to fight for him, being not a King injured, but an injuror: For no war can be juſtifiable, but that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun upon juſt and urgent occaſions, wherein Juſtice, prudence, honour and ſafety ſhall beare the ſtandard of <hi>England.</hi> Neither were it convenient that <hi>England,</hi> which hath ſo long triumphed in her peace and proſperitie, ſhould now thus raſhlie be drawn fatally to maintaine the errors of ambition, and a quarrell unneceſſary for you, not properly pertaining to <hi>England,</hi> nor to your Majeſtie, but by conſequence and participation.</p>

                  <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Sonne of Archduke <hi>Charles,</hi> and nephew to the Emperour, was ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted King of <hi>Bohemia An.</hi> 1617. by an Aſſembly of the States of <hi>Prague,</hi> upon the Emperours ſummons; when <hi>Mathias</hi> declared that ſeeing his glaſſe was almoſt run, to leave the Kingdom ſetled in peace, and to prevent all Civill diſſention, he requeſted that after his deceaſe, they would agree to accept of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> for his ſucceſſor (whom for his vertue and piety he had adopted his Sonne) provided that during his life, without his ſpeciall commiſſion, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould not intrude him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the government of his realme, and ſhould alſo take his oath to ratifie and confirme the priviledges granted to the Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:55957:5"/>Hereupon the 7. of <hi>Iune</hi> the three States of <hi>Bohemia</hi> gave this anſwer to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours propoſition, That for his requeſt, and for the fatherly affection that he did ever beare to that kingdom, they conſented and agreed to accept <hi>Ferdinand</hi> for their King, and thereupon they aſſigned the 24. of <hi>Iulie</hi> for the day of his Coronation at <hi>Prague,</hi> upon which day this decree was ſolemnly read, and the States aſſembled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked (according to Cuſtome) by the cheif Burgrave, if any did diſlike, or could ſhew cauſe to contradict this Free Election, they all freely and orderly with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall applauſe approved it, and upon that ſo good warrant the Burgrave proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and offered unto him (as their Cuſtome was) a certaine contribution of his inauguration. So here is an Election made, <hi>Frequenti Senatu, &amp; plenâ curiâ,</hi> the Emperours aſſent (who was King in <hi>Eſſe</hi>) a conſent of the States in a generall aſſembly, and <hi>modo &amp; formâ</hi> according to Law and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, And <hi>Ferdinand</hi> himſelf was preſent, and brought upon the ſtage to take the Oath uſually miniſtred to his predeceſſors, and to conclude the whole Country ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his regality by doing really the homage unto him, So as no defect was in the proceeding, no Competitor, no barre or oppoſition to his claime, neither was there any packing or partiality in the Election, and by this ſolemnity he was created actually King, and albeit his government was not to commence, untill after the death of <hi>Mathias,</hi> yet the Royalty he had in <hi>Eſſe,</hi> their Oathes at his Coronation, their homages, and their contribution was a full confirmation of his title <hi>in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenti,</hi> (and the rather becauſe the States themſelves did him all the honour apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to their King) ſo he was more then an heir apparant, for they could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do that which they had done, and diſpence with their Oathes, no more then <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond of <hi>England</hi> could unKing <hi>Henry</hi> his Sonne (though he take Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him) becauſe he was created King by order and Authoritie.</p>
               <p>Beſides, after this Election, by the Emperours inveſtiture, being poſſeſſed of the Electorate of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> it ſtood as reall livery and ſeiſin of his right, honour, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, which no man could avoid or defeate, and furthermore, there is extant one Letter from the States, and two from the Directors themſelves, written in the life time of <hi>Mathias</hi>: which were ſent to King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> wherein they all give him the title of King of <hi>Hungaria</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and call him their good Lord and Prince, and moreover they all promiſed to provide him a Crown fitt for their King and Lord, So ſoone as God ſhould take to his mercy the Emperour <hi>Mathias,</hi> Therefore if the State only had abſolute power to Elect their King: then was <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> orderly, generally, and freely Elected: And if they had not ſuch power, how had they power afterwards to create another? how could the power ſerve the turne for <hi>Frederick</hi> and be defective for <hi>Ferdinand?</hi>

               <p>And although to dazell the eyes of men, ſome have objected, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the firſt did ſollicite the States in his life time to Elect his Sonne <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and <hi>Maximilian</hi> uſed the like mediation in the behalf of <hi>Rodolphus</hi> his Sonne, which proveth the States had power to chuſe their King.</p>
               <p>I anſwer. The times were then troubleſome, and the Country dangerouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and ſo as it was probable that factions in Religion would breed factions in the State: And therefore, ſeeing <hi>Abundans caut. la non nocet,</hi> to prevent all ſiniſter practiſes, they provided wiſely to ſettle their Succeſſor in aſſurance and ſecurity with advice and conſent of the kingdom: the which they did in their life time by way of requeſt, becauſe the States of <hi>Bohemia</hi> were not yet bound to ſettle the heires: for <hi>haereditas non eſt viventis ſed defuncti</hi>: heires are ever in expectation till their Parents dye, and when they take poſſeſſion they ceaſe to be heires and become owners.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is no good argument, becauſe the conſent of the States were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, therefore ſucceſſion hath no place: For all well governed kingdoms, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive, have alſo a ſhew and a forme of Election. In <hi>England</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond requeſted the conſent of the Parliament, that in his life time he might ſee his Sonne crowned King, ſo did King <hi>Edward</hi> the third ſollicite for <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. and when <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. was Elected King, the words of the act are, we do chuſe you our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord and King, <hi>ex Rotul. Parl.</hi> 1. <hi>R.</hi> 3. therefore it is plaine that Election doth not exclude ſucceſſion, but ſucceſſion guideth the Election.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:55957:7"/>For in the ſame record this is expreſly added; it is agreed by the three eſtates that <hi>K. Rich.</hi> 3. is lawfull King of <hi>England</hi> by inheritance, and due election. So as inheritance and election are not two things incompatible, eſpecially in thoſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, where Cuſtome hath given a Royall prerogative to the blood of a Familie.</p>
               <p>But yet I will make the matter clearer. <hi>Anno</hi> 1547. it was enacted in <hi>Bohemia</hi> (as by the record appeareth) that according to the Edict of <hi>Carolus quartus,</hi> and the order of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus,</hi> and to the <hi>literae reverſales</hi> of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> 1. the States ſhould ever and only proceed, and no otherwiſe. And the States of <hi>Bohemia</hi> cannot now claime any ſuch Laws, Liberties, or Cuſtomes, to eject a King out of the right line and familie, wherein the Crown hath been ſo long inveſted, ſpecially till the iſſue be extinct: For, by the words of the Law, <hi>non aliter eis competeret libera Electio</hi>: and whereas they tell a tale of a Cuſtome in <hi>Bohemia</hi> to chuſe ſtrangers, and the Sonnes of the King of <hi>Poland</hi> (eminent for their vertue) they may aſwell tell a tale of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis de Gaule.</hi> And for that which <hi>Aeneas Silvius</hi> reporteth of <hi>Carolus</hi> the ſeventh of <hi>France, Sternbergius</hi> was the <hi>primus Motor</hi> of that to the King of <hi>France,</hi> to avoid a miſcheif by an hereticall intrudor, who deſired that a Catholique Prince might prevent <hi>George Podibradius</hi> an <hi>Huſsite,</hi> who (as he did foreſee) was like by violence to uſurpe the Crown, as appeareth by <hi>Dubravius l.</hi> 30.</p>
               <p>And although I confeſſe that the Champions of this cauſe, artificially lay their colours, yet can they not make black white, but as <hi>Iuglers</hi> only make it ſeeme ſo to others. For this my laſt argument is unanſwerable.</p>
               <p>The Princes Electors, when the States of <hi>Bohemia</hi> laboured at <hi>Franckford</hi> that they would not accept <hi>Ferdinand</hi> as an Elector, but ſuſpend his voice, <hi>quod nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam plenarium adeptus eſt Imperium,</hi> they rejected them and their motions; and made this anſwer to the <hi>Bohemians</hi>; That <hi>ex cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Bullae,</hi> only he who was the lawfull Succeſſor of <hi>Mathias</hi> ought to be admitted to the Election as King of <hi>Bohemia:</hi> And they ſo judged it, firſt becauſe the States of <hi>Bohemia</hi> the ſeventh of <hi>Iune</hi> 1617. Solemnly accepted <hi>Ferdinand</hi> for their King, and confirmed their act by Oath: therefore no queſtion ought to be made of his claime and title. Secondly they alleadged that <hi>Juriſdictio Electoralis nulli competit niſi Regi Bohemiae jure haeredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio, &amp; nemo alius niſi Rex ad Electionem unquam erat vocatus.</hi> Thirdly, they ſaid King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had lawfully received of the Emperour <hi>Mathias</hi> his Inveſtiture, the Office of Electorate, and the cheif Cup-bearer, and was put in poſſeſſion thereof, and further they added, that <hi>Maximilian</hi> the ſecond (<hi>Anno</hi> 1562.) was ſummoned by the name of King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and Elector, to be at <hi>Franckford</hi> to chooſe the King of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and this being in his Fathers life time he ſigned the Decree, (though he had no other Election, Ceremony, or poſſeſſion then <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had) and the like they avouched of <hi>Rodolphus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, ſeeing the Nobleſt Iudges, (the Colledge of Electors) have adjudged this controverſie, by reaſon, cuſtome, preſidents, and law, who will not rather o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey learned authority, then be miſled by wrangling ſubtil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore two other hainous crimes, and crying ſinnes they charge him with, for which he ought to forfeit his claime to the Crowne.

               <p>Now touching the <hi>Directors,</hi> who were the principall perſons and agents in this Election, two things are to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Originall.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, what lawfull authority, and whoſe Commiſſion they had for their warrant.</p>
               <p>For their Originall, it had a beginning in this manner, when the Emperour <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> languiſhed at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> by a long ſickneſſe, Count <hi>Fhurn</hi> took advantage of the time, and conſpiring with many of his Confederats, upon a ſuddaine ſurpriſed the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55957:9"/>
Caſtle of <hi>Prague,</hi> the Emperours Armory, and the Court, and in a rage they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended his Majeſties Lieutenants and Cheife Officers of the Realme, the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Slavata, Methansky</hi> Marſhall of the kingdom, and Secretary <hi>Fabricius,</hi> whom they caſt headlong out of a window forty cubitts high from the ground, who yet miraculouſlie were preſerved, and afterwards they Hollandized bravely, for they took the Scepter and Crown of <hi>Bohemia</hi> into their own hands: and to make good their tumultuous proceedings, they leavied an Army, and took upon them to create new Magiſtrats (whom they called <hi>Directors</hi>) to govern the State, and to excuſe themſelves of theſe inſolencies, they writ their Letters to King <hi>Mathias</hi> dated the 27. of <hi>March</hi> 1618 and alleadge a few poore reaſons to excuſe and ſhaddow their proceedings. Firſt, that the Preſident and the reſt were enemies to the State, and ſought to diſturbe the peace of the Realme, and alſo, whereas King <hi>Rodolphus</hi> granted them free exerciſe of their Religion (which, ſay they, was confirmed by your Majeſtie) that theſe men purpoſed to deprive us of the benefit of theſe your grants, and therefore, ſaid they, we were forced for our defence, to enter into league againſt them: ſo they oppreſſed the Magiſtrats before they ſenſibly felt the ſmart of perſecution, and to prevent a thing only purpoſed (as they gave out) they really &amp; actually rebelled. But this was only a cunning ſhift: for they practiſed to draw the Provinces of <hi>Moravia, Sileſia</hi> and <hi>Luſatia</hi> to joyne with them, and not content to keep themſelves within the limits of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> they did riſe a degree of miſcheif higher, and ſollicited the upper <hi>Auſtria</hi> (the Emperours own inheritance, and no way ſubject to their Directorſhip) to runn the like deſperate courſe with them, as if their end and ſcope had been to ſet all the Empire in combuſtion, and to have a King and a Religion of their own Edition.</p>
               <p>Although theſe exceſſes of diſorder were inexcuſable to be offered to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour (whom in their own Letters they acknowledge to be <hi>á Deo ſibi prastitum Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem &amp; Dominum, ac Magiſtratum clementiſſimum)</hi> yet King <hi>Mathias</hi> with great mildneſſe and clemencie ſought to pacifie rather then to provoke their furies: and therefore on the 6. of <hi>Iune</hi> 1618. he anſwered their Letters thus: That it did not become Subjects to take Armes againſt his Lieutenants (though they had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended before they did complaine of their injuries received, and ſought redreſſe by order of Juſtice: For he proteſted he never intended to abrogate or ſuſpend their priviledges, or revoke his letters of tolleration, and therefore they did him injurie without better grounds to forge ſuch ſlanders againſt his Governour. And further he promiſed to compound all quarrells, and eaſe their greivances by a moderate courſe of commiſſion. Laſtly ſeeing there appeared no enemies in <hi>Bohemia</hi> to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt and perſecute them, he adviſed them to diſmiſſe their Armies, and levie no more forces, and he aſſured them reciprocally he would diſmiſſe his Souldiers, <hi>cui cauſam</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>dederat veſtra conſcriptio,</hi> and for the better aſſurance he vouchſafed to write unto them againe the 18. of <hi>June,</hi> and a third time alſo to ratifie what he had graciouſlie promiſed. To all which letters they never returned thankes nor anſwer, but like Salvages, marched to <hi>Budviſe</hi> and <hi>Comotonium</hi> where they compelled the Magiſtrats to revolt from the Government of the Caſtle, and (which was a treaſon in the higheſt degree) they took <hi>Carleiſtein,</hi> where the Kings Crown and treaſure
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55957:9"/>
were kept, they depoſed the Burgrave, ſeized upon the Kings rents and revenues, and converted all to their own uſe, which was an Apiſh imitation of the union of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>treche.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So here is Riott in the beginning, tumult in the proceedings, and treaſon in all.</p>
               <p>But now for the lawfull authority of the Directors, whence had they their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vocation and commiſſion? they took upon them an abſolute power, more like <hi>Tribuni plebis,</hi> then Officers of the Crown, nay a more high power, to degrade a new King, and at their own pleaſures to create ſuch Magiſtrats as they liked, and to diſpoſe at their pleaſures the Crown and the kingdom: a power unknown in any orderly State, greater then the <hi>Ephori</hi> and <hi>Hermoſtae</hi> of the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> or the <hi>Archontes</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> or <hi>Highstewards</hi> of <hi>England</hi> (who notwithſtanding were ordinary and lawfull Magiſtrats, and eſtabliſhed by conſent of the States) but theſe arrogate and uſurpe a power to degrade old Kings, and create new (a tranſcendent prerogative which no wiſe State will admit, nor truſt any ſubjects with ſuch unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited power,) and if they be not Magiſtrats, <hi>Idolum nihil eſt</hi>: and if they be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats, I follow the Biſhop of Rocheſters judgment; <hi>à ſuperiore eſt poteſtas eorum, &amp; ab eo ſolo deſtitui poſſunt, à quo inſtituuntur</hi>; Anſwer me then Categoricallie: were they choſen by the King or States generall? or were they his Lieutenants, or Regents in his abſence, or <hi>Procuratores Regni?</hi> No ſuch thing, no commiſſion, no <hi>durante beneplacito,</hi> no authoritie appeareth, no power from thoſe that had power and ſuperioritie to grant it.</p>
               <p>Neither were they choſen by the Kings and States of the Countrie, but by Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of a faction, who contrary to order and Cuſtome, preſumed to uſurpe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and Domineere over the Countrie: The King is the head of the State, the Clergie a part of the State yet neither was the King, nor the Archbiſhop of <hi>Pragu,</hi> nor the Biſhops of the Realme, the Chancellor, the Preſident of the Councell, the Marſhall, nor the principall Secretarie, nor the Burgrave, nor moſt of the Nobilitie preſent, either at the creation of their irregular Officers, or at the Election of the Palſgrave: All this was done by Count <hi>Thurn,</hi> and a few ſeditious perſons, who had no power themſelves to give ſuch power to others, and could have no ſupreame power, unleſſe they would unking <hi>Mathias</hi>: which no man could do by Law, or order: for it is a falſe Paradox, that the States of any kingdom are above the Prince, and may bind his hands &amp; depoſe him. And no man can demonſtrate, that the ſtates and Directors of <hi>Bohemia</hi> had ever power to depoſe one and Elect another Prince.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> (kingdoms meerelie Elective) yet the Kings Office is to aſſemble the States, as the Emperour doth at the Diett and the Danes alſo are bound to chooſe the Sonne of the laſt King, as they confeſſed themſelves in their apologie 1523. And therefore they did Elect <hi>Schioldus,</hi> Sonne of that Monſter, <hi>Lother</hi> King of <hi>Denmark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, where a Prince is Soveraign, no Subject can be partaker of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie, which is a qualitie not communicable, for it reſideth in the union of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die politique, and if it be devided (without the Princes conſent) it looſeth the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigntie.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And ſeeing all ſubordinate Magiſtrats have their Authoritie, <hi>jure humano, &amp; non poteſtate ſua ſed alienâ:</hi> And ſeeing theſe Directors of <hi>Bohemia</hi> were not choſen nor admitted by the whole State, but (which was worſe) uſurped an Authoritie <hi>inconſulto Rege,</hi> I may ſay of them truelie whom theſe uſurpers elected, that which God himſelf ſaid <hi>Oſee</hi> 8. <hi>Ipſi Regnant, &amp; non ex me, Principes extiterunt, &amp; non cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novi eos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore I will conclude, that this Election of the Count Palatine was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law and reaſon, being made by Conſpiratours (who uſurped an authoritie which they lawfullie had not) and by private men and not by the King, nor Officers of the Realme, nor the Generall States.</p>
               <p>And I the rather hold this opinion; becauſe King <hi>Iames,</hi> in his oration to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament 1620. uſed theſe words, very judiciallie, Kings and kingdoms were before Parliaments, the Parliament was never called for the purpoſe to meddle with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt the King, the Church, or State matters, but <hi>ad conſultandum de relus arduis, Nos &amp; Regnum noſtrum concernentibus</hi>; as the writ will informe you. I was never the cauſe, nor guiltie of the Election of my Sonne by the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> neither would I be content that any other King ſhould diſpute whether I am a lawfull King or no, and to toſſe Crowns like <hi>Tennis-balls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides if the Count Palatine had been elected in any ſhew of order, a maine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect yet lyeth as a block in his way: For the <hi>Aur.

               <p>NOw I come to the maine point which the Puritans call the head of all theſe evills, the proſcription of the Palſgrave; wherein we muſt examine whether it were done <hi>de jure,</hi> or injuriouſlie, and whether there be juſt cauſe why the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould vindicate the honour of his Sonne; the grounds of the proſcription were too ſolid. For after the Aſſemblie at <hi>Franckford</hi> 1619. where, by the pluralitie of voices, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was Elected (the Palſgrave not contradicting it) the Count <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine</hi> took the Crown of <hi>Bohemia</hi> (as it were) from the head of the Emperour, he joyned with the Directors, begun this unfortunate tragedie made himſelf head of the union (the moſt dangerous that ever was contrived in <hi>Germany</hi>) conſented to the invaſion of the Lower <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and at <hi>Retz</hi> the States being aſſembled 2. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> 1620. <hi>Fredericum Palatinum Dominum &amp; Protectorem elegerunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides he aſſiſted all the malcontents of the State, and raiſed Armies for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as if he had not been fullie ſatisfied with the Crown of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> except he had likewiſe diſpoſſeſſed him of the Empire, and forced him to flye into <hi>Spaine</hi> for ſuccour, as it is evident by the Records of <hi>Cancellaria Anhaltina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay the ſame Count <hi>Palatine</hi> in his Letters to the Duke of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> confeſſeth that he took upon him the Crown of <hi>Bohemia:</hi> Firſt, that the kingdom might not be longer reſtrained from the exerciſe of their Religion: Secondly, that they might enjoy their priviledges: Thirdly and cheifly, that the Election of the King of the <hi>Romanes</hi> might be in the power and choice of the Proteſtant Electors: faire Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours on a falſe ground: zeal to Religion out of Charity is made to break the peace of <hi>Europe,</hi> and to maintaine the liberties of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> he muſt needs violate the Laws and orders of the Empire, and to enlarge the Dignitie of the Secular Electors, he would tread upon all the Eccleſiaſticall.</p>
               <p>But to ſay more plainly, he ſcorned to hold the ſtirrup, while the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria</hi> did mount and ſurmount him.</p>
               <p>But to proceed; was their end only to releive <hi>Bohemia</hi>? no ſurely: For they ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the revolt of <hi>Hungaria</hi>: they joyned with <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> vaſſall: and if you look well into the ſcope and intention of theſe correſpondents, you ſhall ſee a <hi>Meduſaes Head.</hi>

               <p>HAving thus curiouſly examined the grounds and cauſes of the Proſcription of the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> and how they ſtand in Law and conſcience, without any partiality, neither taking affection to the one part (whom I know not) nor to the other (whom I pittie) but as the truth of the cauſe leadeth me, I aske this queſtion: Why is King <hi>James</hi> accuſed for not taking armes to vindicate the honour of his Son ſo proſcribed? And why ſhould the King of <hi>England</hi> give over all treaties, and enter into war with <hi>Spaine,</hi> if the Palatine be not reſtored; being the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did, nor could proſcribe him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Emperour?

               <p>And there is no reaſon why the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> might not ſuccour the Familie whereof he is the Root, ſeeing theſe lands were the proper poſſeſſion of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, And by him freely given to the family.</p>
               <p>Neither did Spaine breake the treatie with <hi>England, an.</hi> 1604. in any article, by that ſupport, and therfore they ſhall do well to ſet the ſaddle on the right horſe, and accuſe the Emperour for proſcribing the <hi>Pal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Emperour cannot, except he would hazard to looſe part of his owne inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, (the upper <hi>Auſtria</hi>) and what, if that cannot (during the Duke of <hi>Baviers</hi> life) be yet effected; will you breake of all treaties with <hi>Spaine,</hi> for a matter hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not compaſſe, nor prevaile to effect? Will you make a perpetuall deadly feud with <hi>Spaine,</hi> becauſe he cannot yet therein fully ſatisfie you?

               </p>
               <p>Well, how ſhould the King helpe his children, and ſhew his royall wiſedome as well as naturall affection, and regard the kingdome, as well as his cradle? A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret treaſure (ſaith he) lies hid in your peoples hearts, wee will contribute more to redeeme the credit of our nation, then to regaine the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> men and mony are the engines of war, ſend forces that ſhall be able to make their way thither.</p>
               <p>Mark I humbly pray your Majeſtie, how ignorance roveth and looſeth it ſelfe, and yet he ſaith as much as any other can object. If you aske him, ſhall they march into the <hi>Palatinate</hi>? No ſaith he; there is great difficulty to get thither, the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> is ill ſeated for us to warre in, being remote from the ſea, and ſurrounded with enemies, and the proteſtant league is beheaded (which ſhould have ſuccoured you) and therfore here ſolveth that you muſt not confirm the action to the bare <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi>; for ſo it will never have an end, but draw it ſelfe into ſuch a circle of troubles, as wee may look twelve years hence to ſee two ſuch armies keep one another at a bay in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> as now they doe in the low Countries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:55957:13"/>So by this his Argument, to recover the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> you muſt not march thither, For the reaſons he wiſely alleadgeth, for that it is out of your way.

               <p>And as for your glorious Father, I proteſt, for all his favours to them, (which were many and great) yet how ſhamefully they ſpake of him both living and dead, I cannot with modeſty relate.</p>
               <p>Nay they have dared to ſheere the graſſe from under their feete, and laugh at his councell; and therefore they have planted ſo many low-country-men in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to ſerve their turne, who robbed you, and tranſported all your gold thither, that the States might make their benefit of it, which your Starre-chamber can well witneſſe: and theſe men are yours externally, theirs in heart and affection, neither hath your Majeſty cauſe to repoſe too much truſt in them, for their Aſtrologer Dr. <hi>Fink</hi> long ſince foretold them of a Starre riſing out of the eaſt, which I perceive they long to ſee come into <hi>England,</hi> that they might adore him.</p>

               <p>And for that argument of the greatneſſe of <hi>Spaine,</hi> I ſay it is therefore the greater honour to England, to have ſo great a Prince to ſeeke and imbrace your amity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> the third 1604. ſent the great Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> with an olive branch in his hand to ſeeke peace, bury al offences, and reconcile the two Kingdoms with a perfect <hi>Amnestia,</hi> here you ſee their greatneſſe is no obſtacle to amity, and the rather, becauſe there never was till of late, betweene <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall contention, nor any antipathy between the two crowns: but now there is; true, but <hi>ab initio non fuit ſic</hi>: and curſed be he that would make variance continue perpetually betweene Kings and Realmes.</p>

               <p>But of all others <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> by his actions, his marriage, and his titles, did incorporate in a perfect union theſe two crownes, as if nature had determined by an holy Sacrament inviolably to couple and linke together theſe three Kingdoms, and by an union of blood to confirme that amity (for of him all the Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> are deſcended.)</p>
               <p>Wherupon, after the civil warres in <hi>Eng.</hi> were ended (K. <hi>H.</hi> 7. a politick Prince) ſought to match his Sonne Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> with the Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that there might continue a perpetuall ſucceſſion of conſanguinitie between the two crownes, and therefore renewed the old league with <hi>Philip</hi> the firſt of <hi>Austria. an.</hi> 1505. the which continued warmely and faithfully untill the ſchiſme and unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. made ſome variance unfortunately betweene them</p>

               <p>Theſe are the ſcar-crowes of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> vaine and untrue, for <hi>Maximillian</hi> the Emperour after that great union, made a league with King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 1507. and held ſo good correſpondency with him, that at <hi>Turvey</hi> he did his Maieſty the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt honour that ever was done to <hi>England,</hi> to take a hundred crownes a day to ſerve under his ſtandard, and he further promiſed King <hi>Henry</hi> to aſſiſt and aid him to take poſſeſſion of the crowne of <hi>France.</hi>

For, notwithſtanding all his ſupereminent of titles and Kingdomes, <hi>Anno</hi> 1543 they embraced one anothers friendſhip, and renued it againe, <hi>tractatu auctioris amicitiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly, King <hi>Edw</hi> 6. being dead, the ſame <hi>Charles</hi> 5. (as if hee had foreſeene how one of theſe crownes ſtood in neede of the other) married his legitimate ſon to Queene <hi>Mary</hi>; with ſuch conditions as were moſt honourable and profitable. And after her death nothing but a quarrell of Religion ambition, and faction broke the bond, which prudently, and out of his temperate diſpoſition, King <hi>Philip</hi> 3. la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to tye a new, and binde with a faſter knot, if his Royall offer had beene as wiſely accepted, as by the Count of <hi>Villa Mediana</hi> it was nobly tendred.</p>
               <p>By all which appeareth their folly and vanity, that thinke there can be no peace made with <hi>Spaine,</hi> nor articles kept, nor faith nor fidelity obſerved.</p>
               <p>But conſider, who can oppoſe this peace with reaſon.

And afterwards when Sir <hi>Iohn Heynault</hi> Lord <hi>Braumont,</hi> undertooke to reſtore her, both the heart of <hi>Heynault</hi> and his cheife officers oppoſed it, as an enterprize of more courage then wiſedome, and although good ſucceſſe made it ſeeme good, yet it was not ſo of it ſelfe, but by accident, for the Queene having ſtrong partie in England, (as now the <hi>Palatine</hi> hath in <hi>Germany</hi>) the Barons ſent over the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to aſſure her of their aſſiſtance and beſides ſhe carried over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England with her <hi>ſolem orientem,</hi> Prince <hi>Edw.</hi> the Kings ſonne and heire.</p>
               <p>It was lately objected to me, that the famous blacke Prince aided <hi>Don Pedro</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> againſt his Subjects who rebelled, and wrongfully expelled him: and therefore King <hi>Charles</hi> ought to doe the like for the aide of his ſiſter.</p>
               <p>I denie that he ought, and I ſay alſo, that the conſequence is not good, for the Prince aided a lawfull King againſt rebels, you ſhall aide a uſurper againſt a lawful King and an Emperour, ſo in the cauſe there is odds. Beſides, have you a blacke Prince (the mirrour of all martiall Princes) to be imployed in this expedition? Or have you in <hi>Spaine</hi> or <hi>Ger.</hi> ſuch a Rendezevous to let in your Forces with facility, as he had in <hi>Aquitaine</hi>? And beſides, you ſhall break a treaty of peace ſolemnly ſworne, which the Princes did not; I adde alſo, that valiant <hi>Cand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now, if that argument were forcible to move him, then it is as ſtrong to move you not to aſſiſt the <hi>Palſgrave,</hi> either for his reſtoration or revenge, becauſe hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed K. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> without any juſt title or claime, and only upon quirks and cavills.</p>
               <p>Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſhewed more wiſedome, and taught them a wiſer leſſon, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have protected religion and the country, then to uſurp the crowne, and

though for the ſafety of her owne eſtate ſhe went too far) yet her colours were wel died, and had a good gloſſe, although in the end ſhe repented, and ſought for peace (<hi>Ann.</hi> 1588.) when it was too late.</p>
               <p>Lay this conſideration to your heart before you ſtrike up the drumme, and learne by other mens harmes to prevent your owne.</p>
               <p>When Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> began to aide the low-country-men, I know ſhe had 700 co. l. in her Exchequer, but before the 4. yeare of her raigne, ſhee was forced to ſell her land, her people were taxed with ſubſidies, tenths, and privy-ſeals, above two Millions and 800000. l. all which the realme loſt, and ſhe gained nothing, no not ſure and thankfull friends.</p>
               <p>I wil uſe no ominous predictions, nor tell you the Aſtrologicall prophecy of <hi>Litenbergius,</hi> who lived above 140. yeares before the battell of <hi>Prague.</hi>

               <p>I omit how that brave P. <hi>Sebastian</hi> King of <hi>Portugal</hi> ruined himſelfe, and loſt his K. by <hi>iuvenile concilium,</hi> by aſſiſting a weak competitor againſt a ſtrong adverſary.</p>
               <p>The world ſeeth that <hi>Man field</hi> and <hi>Alberstate</hi> are buried in oblivion, and without a tombe, and nothing proſpereth that is undertaken to a perverſe end, or without good ground of juſtice.</p>
               <p>The magnanimous King of <hi>Denmark</hi> (albeit <hi>Tyeko Brabe</hi> had long before given him faire warning, and a good caveat to looke to himſelfe) yet for his friends ſake he hath dangerouſly run upon a rocke, and hazarded his perſon, his eſtate, <hi>In land, Holſt,</hi> the lives of his Subjects, and his honour, by taking armes againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Firſt, by aſſiſting <hi>Halberſtat,</hi> and after revengeing the <hi>Palatine, I</hi> wonder that ſo great a Prince did not remember, that hee and his predeceſſours did hold <hi>Dith-Marſh</hi> in <hi>feodo</hi> of the Empire, ever ſince <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperour, and alſo the Dutchy of <hi>Holſten</hi> (for the which ſolemnly by an Embaſſador <hi>Pogge Wiſch,</hi> he did ſweare homage and fealty to the Emperour) and yet, which was no ſmall errour, with his owne hands he did in contempt, caſt into the conditions of peace offered unto him by the peaceable Emperour <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> for which hee may repent too late. But <hi>Paulus Nagel</hi> who promiſed him, mountains in his Kallender, hath deceived him as Doctor <hi>Fink</hi> did the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and ſurely he is <hi>felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.</hi> For it is a ſafe Councell that <hi>Polibius</hi> gave, <hi>non tantum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentia ſpectare, ſed et futura proſpicere, et quis exitus in de futurus ſit.</hi> And as <hi>Niceas</hi> adviſed <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Thucid, temeritas ſuperbiaque populorum injuſta bella ſuſcipientium, eos funditus perdit.</hi> But <hi>Claud l.</hi> 11. <hi>annal.
