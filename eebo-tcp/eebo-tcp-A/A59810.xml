            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Had heard very often, and very much of the Animadversions upon Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s <hi>Vindication of the Doctrine of the Trinity;</hi> but I had also heard such a Character of it, which both Friends and Foes agreed in, that I could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my self to read it; For a Satyrical Wit is no diversion to a Wise Man, except in a Play, and where it hurts no Body; and I could never think, that true Divine Wisdom rests on an ill-natured and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Spirit. But your late Letter awakened me; for I could not but think that Book, whatever other Faults it had, must be worth reading, which you could
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100659:3"/>
think worth answering, and seem so impatiently to expect, when the Dean, or some body for him, should Answer it. As for the Dean, he has given Testimony to the World, that he has not been Idle all this while, but much better employed: And, to speak my Mind freely, I don't see how he is obliged to Answer, unless you think a Man bound to Answer Ballads and Lampoons; for he is as little concerned in it as you are; that, had it not been for the Title Page, and some particular Expressions, which the Dean uses, and the Animadverter furiously opposes, without understanding them, I could never have guessed against whom he had Writ. I had, a little before, read over the <hi>Vindication,</hi> and the Notions lay fresh and easie in my Mind, but as soon as I dipt into the <hi>Animadversions</hi> they were all on a sudden confounded, and put into disorder. The Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter Disputes earnestly, subtilly, and triumphantly, opens his whole Armory of Metaphysicks, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are thin, airy Weapons, which do no great Execution, he points them with Wit and Satyr, to make them pierce the deeper.</p>
            <p>It was the Saying of a very Witty Man, that <hi>He who Writes lies down,</hi> but it is to be supposed, he forgot it when he made the Experiment himself: But I must say this for the Animadverter, That he is as fair an Adversary, upon this account as one would desire; as he spares not those who lie down before him, so he very civilly takes his turn, and lays him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as fairly open to Satyrical Wit, if the Dean, or any of his Friends, would condescend to exercise it upon him. When he ventures upon any thing like Wit, he always makes himself a Jest, and never so much insults and triumphs over an Enemy, as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100659:3"/>
where he is certainly himself in the Wrong: I will not entertain you with particular Remarks of this Nature; read over his Book again, if you have the Patience, and see if this be not true.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, as well as I love you, I'm resolved to humble you, for giving me the trouble of reading this Book, not by giving a particular Answer to the whole, which would be too unmerciful, but by convincing you, that it needed no Answer; and to let you see what a trifling Author you have either admired or feared, will prove some little Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you: But I shall do it in short, to save my self, as much as I can, the pains of Writing, and you of Reading, and therefore shall consider only the main Points of Dispute between the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter and the Dean, concerning <hi>Self-Consciousness, Mutual-Consciousness, and Three eternal and infinite Minds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He rages furiously against the Dean, according to his Custom, in a whole long Chapter, for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carding those good old Terms of <hi>Essence, Substance, Nature,</hi> &amp;c. for his own new-invented Terms of <hi>Self-consciousness,</hi> and <hi>Mutual-consciousness;</hi> that any one who reads it, would believe, That the Dean would not allow GOD to be a real Substantial Being, or to have any Nature or Essence; whereas he no where denies, That these are very good Words, and not only useful but necessary in some cases, but yet very apt to confound us with Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and Sensible Images, when we go about to form a Notion and Idea of GOD. We know not the naked Substance or Essence of any Thing, not of Matter, much less of Spirit, and much less of an infinite and eternal Spirit; and therefore, as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100659:4"/>
we can form no other Idea of Matter, but by its sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Qualities, so we can form no Idea of a Spirit, but by such Attributes and Powers as are proper and essential to a Spirit; which is so far from being a Novelty, that it is to think and speak with all the considering part of Mankind; but let this pass, which the Dean is no more concerned in, were his Words and Sence truly and candidly represented, than the best Christian Writers, both Ancient and Modern, as were easily shewn, did I not fear the Animadverter, should he know it, would rail at them all for his sake; for there is not a more Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Crime, than to speak any thing well of the Dean, or to say any thing that he says.</p>
            <p>That which the Dean is more immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in, is the Idea he has endeavour'd to give us of a <hi>Trinity in Unity;</hi> and all that he positively asserts of it is, That it is a possible and intelligible Notion, and no other in Sence and Substance, than what the ancient Fathers made use of to represent this great Mystery by, though expressed in other Terms.</p>
            <p>To prepare you to judge equally in this Cause, you must remember, That the Substance of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle is not concerned in it; here is no Dispute about a <hi>Trinity in Unity:</hi> This the Dean asserts in as full and ample words as the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed it self, which some <hi>Trinitarians</hi> themselves boggle at, but without reason as he thinks; for whoever will acknowledge Three Persons in the Godhead, each of which distinctly considered is GOD, and has all the Perfections of the Divine Nature, and yet are all Three but one GOD, must, as he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to prove, own the Terms and Explications of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100659:4"/>
that Creed. He has been careful to preserve a Real, not a meerly Nominal, distinction of Persons, and yet asserts the Unity of the Godhead in as high terms, as ever the Schools did, even a <hi>Natural Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Unity;</hi> and there is no reason to suspect he dissembles his Sence, for then he might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it too, having no other obligation to engage in this Cause, but a Zeal for this <hi>truly Ancient, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, and Apostolick Faith.</hi> Since then here is no Innovation made in the Faith, nor any alteration of the least term in it, what is the Fault? Truly no other than what the best Writers, both Ancient and Modern, have been equally guilty of, if it can be called a Fault.</p>
            <p>Those who are acquainted with this Controversie, know, that the great Objection against the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith of <hi>the Trinity in Unity,</hi> is not its contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to any plain and express Principle of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but the unconceiveabless of it: It is certain, that Three should be One, and One Three, upon different accounts, is no contradiction, and then what Principle of Reason does a <hi>Trinity in Unity</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict? But we must grant, that we have no perfect Example of any such Union in Nature, and therefore cannot frame a compleat and positive Notion and Idea of such an Union: and this some Men miscall <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting Reason;</hi> but if every thing, which we have no positive Idea of, must be allowed to contradict Reason, we shall find Contradictions enow; and which is worse, must be forced to believe Contradictions; for we must confess a great many things to be true, which we have no Idea of, and cannot conceive how they should be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100659:5"/>But yet since the unconceivableness of this Union is the great difficulty, and great Objection (though in truth it is no Objection at all to any one, who considers, how unconceivable and incomprehensible the Divine Nature is) the Ancient Fathers endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to help our conception and imagination of this by some sensible Images: Such as the Co-essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality and Union of the Sun, its Light and Splendor, of a Fountain and its Streams, a Tree and its Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as the Dean has observed, and as every one knows, whoever looked into the Fathers.</p>
            <p>But these are Material Images, and may serve for Allusions, and to render the Notion of a <hi>Trinity in Unity</hi> possible and credible; when we see some faint resemblances of it in the Material World; but they cannot help us to conceive, what kind of Union there is between the Divine Persons, the Union of Matter and Spirit differing as much as Matter and Spirit do, which have no likeness or resemblance to each other.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Dean was certainly so far in the right, to seek for some Image and resemblance of this Mysterious Union in the Unity of a Spirit: For a Mind and Spirit is the truest Image of God, that is in Nature; for God is a Spirit, and therefore it is more likely to find some Image of the Unity of the Godhead in a Spirit, than in Matter, and yet we know nothing of a Spirit, but what we feel in our Selves, and can Philosophize no farther about it; for as Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> has truly observed, we can form no Idea but either from external Impressions, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sensations; and therefore we can know no more of the Unity of a Spirit neither, than what we feel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:100659:5"/>Now whoever considers, how he knows himself to be a distinct and separate Person from all other Men, will be able to resolve it into nothing else but <hi>Internal Sensation,</hi> which the Dean, not improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; calls <hi>Self-consciousness.</hi> The Unity of Matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the Unity of its parts, and we can see, how far its Unity extends, and where it ends; for its Unity extends, as far as the continuity of its parts extends, and ends, where that ends: But we know of no extension or parts in a Spirit, and therefore the very Nature of a Spirit consisting in internal and vital Sensation, the Unity of a Spirit consists in the continuity (if I may so speak) of its Sensation: So far as a Man feels himself, or is <hi>Self-conscious,</hi> so far he is One entire Person; where this <hi>Self-conscious Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi> ends, he becomes a distinct and separate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: For it is a Self-evident Proposition, that in an intelligent <hi>Self-conscious</hi> Being, Self can reach no farther than he feels himself. And I would desire any thinking Man to tell me, how he knows himself to be a distinct and separate Person from all other Men, but only by this, that he feels his own Thoughts, Volitions and Passions, Pains and Pleasures, but feels nothing of all this in other Men.</p>
            <p>I have been forced to explain this more at large, to help the Animadverter to some conception of it, who I find understood not one word of it, as will appear presently. But to proceed. The Dean ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus observed, that the Unity of a single Mind or Spirit consists in such a <hi>Natural Self conscious Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,</hi> this led him on to that other Notion of a <hi>Mutual-consciousness,</hi> which may be between Three distinct Spirits, and make them naturally One, as much as Three can be One. For if a Natural <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conscious</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:100659:6"/>
               <hi>Sensation</hi> makes a Spirit One with it self, why should not a natural <hi>Mutual-conscious Sensation</hi> unite Three into One? For if natural Unity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends as far as <hi>Conscious Sensation,</hi> then if <hi>Conscious Sensation</hi> extends to Three, why should not these Three be acknowledged to be naturally One? That as a natural <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> makes One natural Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, so natural <hi>Mutual-consciousness</hi> should make a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Trinity in Unity? For my part, I believe it is much easier to cry down this representation as a Novelty, than to offer one word of Sence against it, or to make any other representation of this Mystery, with so fair and natural an appearance of Truth and Reason: For this <hi>Mutual-consciousness</hi> being <hi>a natural Sensation,</hi> is not a meer Moral, but a natural Union, not a Cabal of Gods, as a <hi>Socinian</hi> Writer Prophanely speaks, but one supream natural Deity.</p>
            <p>This indeed forced the Dean to speak of the Three infinite and eternal Persons in the Godhead, under the Character of <hi>Three infinite and eternal Minds,</hi> for this conscious Sensation, whether <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> or <hi>Mutual-consciousness,</hi> can belong only to Minds; and if every Person in the Trinity, considered as a distinct Person, be not a distinct, infinite, and eternal Mind, there is, I confess, an end of the Dean's Notion, but then, I doubt, there will be an end of a Trinity of Persons also, and we shall have nothing left but a Trinity of Modes and Postures, and Names, not in the Unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, but in the Unity of one Person who is the whole Deity and Godhead. But if every distinct Person in the Godhead considered as distinct, be an infinite and eternal Mind, as it must be, if every

distinct Person be GOD, unless any thing else than an infinite Mind can be GOD, though it be an usual way of speaking to call them <hi>Three eternal Minds,</hi> yet there is no Heresie in it, nor any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by it, as will appear before we part.</p>
            <p>Nor ought this to pass for meer Fancy and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; for as the Dean has shewn the Phrases and Expressions of Scripture, whereby the Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Father, Son, and Holy Ghost is described, do naturally represent this conscious Union, and cannot well be understood without it; for that the Father should be in the Son, and the Son in the Father, so as perfectly to comprehend and be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, with several like Expressions, is made very possible and intelligible by a mutual consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sensation, but nothing else will afford us any Conception of it.</p>
            <p>Now suppose, That after all these fair Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, a spiteful Wit could start some difficulties in this Notion, (as it is not to be expected, that in a matter of so high a Nature, we should have such a perfect comprehension of it, as to leave no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties unexplained) ought not the Dean to have met with as fair Quarter, as other Writers have done in the same cause? Has he not given us as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible a representation (and it is intended for no more) of a <hi>Trinity in Unity, as the Sun, its Light and Splendor, a Tree and its Branches, a Fountain and its Streams, or a Mathematical Cube?</hi> Are not all these Accounts, much more chargeable with Tritheism or Sabellianism? are not the Sun, its Light and Splendor, as much Three, but not so much One, as Three <hi>Conscious Minds?</hi> Can there be a <hi>Trinity in Unity,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100659:7"/>
there be a real and substantial Trinity? What work could our Animadverter have made with the Ancient Fathers, and some late Writers, had he thought fit to have treated them as he has done Dr. <hi>Sherlock?</hi> But it is in vain to expostulate, when the Man, not his Notions, is in Fault; and the only Comfort in such cases is, That Malice is as blind as Love, and so it has happened to the Animadverter, as I shall make appear.</p>
            <p>But before I particularly answer the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter's Arguments against <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> and <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual-consciousness,</hi> and <hi>Three eternal Minds,</hi> it will be necessary to Discourse something in general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a <hi>Trinity in Unity,</hi> and the words where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to express it. For a <hi>Trinity in Unity</hi> is such a distinction, and such an Union, as is peculiar to the Godhead; and though there are some faint resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances of it in Nature, yet Nature has nothing like it, and then it is impossible we should have any words that can adaequately express it. It may help to allay the heat and virulence of Disputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those who heartily believe a <hi>Trinity in Unity,</hi> (as I hope the Animadverter does) to discourse this matter plainly and briefly.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures, both of the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, every where assure us, That there is but One GOD; and not to take notice now of the more obscure intimations of a Trinity in the Old Testament, Christ in his Gospel, and his Apostles after him, have ascribed the Name and Character and incommunicable Attributes of GOD to <hi>Three, Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> we are by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Christ Baptized <hi>in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,</hi> and we are
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100659:7"/>
blessed in their Name, <hi>The Grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, and the Love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all Amen.</hi> Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himself to be the Son of GOD, and to be One with his Father; and St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us, That he is that <hi>Word, which was in the beginning, and was with God, and was God.</hi> That <hi>by him all things were made, and without him was not any thing made, that was made.</hi> And the like Divine Attributes are ascribed to the Holy Spirit; and therefore, though there be One GOD, we must acknowledge, if we believe the Gospel, that there are Three, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost in the Unity of the Godhead. This is the true simplicity of the Christian Faith, to believe Father, Son, and Holy Ghost to be One GOD; that the Father is not the Son, nor the Holy Ghost; that the Son is not the Father, nor the Holy Ghost; that the Holy Ghost is not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nor the Son; but that the Father is God, the Son God, and the Holy Ghost God; and all Three but One God.</p>
            <p>Now one would have thought, that the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Christ and his Apostles, had been a sufficient Foundation for this Faith, without any farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries; but the Devil very well knew, That the whole Oeconomy of our Salvation by Christ, and consequently the whole Christian Religion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on this Faith; and that the curiosity of Mankind, the weakness of their Understandings, and their vain presumption in measuring GOD himself by their narrow Conceits, might easily be managed to unsettle these Foundations; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here he made some of his earliest Attempts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:100659:8"/>The ancient Christians, before this was made a matter of Dispute, contented themselves with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing their Faith, in One God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; but when Heresies in several Ages of the Church were broached, and some, to secure the Unity of the Godhead, made Father, Son, and Holy Ghost no more than Three different Names, belonging to Three different Appearances and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestations of the same One God; others (if they were not misunderstood or misrepresented) did not only distinguish, but separate Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and made Three absolute independent Gods of them, and others denied the Divinity of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which preserved the Unity of the Godhead, by reducing the only begotten Son, and the Holy Spirit of God into the rank of Creatures: This forced the Orthodox Fathers into a Dispute, where they wanted Words adaequate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to express their Sence.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine, which they constantly affirmed and defended against Hereticks of all sorts, was this; That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, were Three, as really distinct from one another, as Three humane Persons are, and that each of them is true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God, and has all Divine Perfections in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and yet that all Three are essentially One, and the same eternal and infinite God. But when they came to say, what these Three are, and how they are One, by what Name to call this wonderful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction and Unity, here Words failed them, as of necessity they must, because there is no such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction and Unity in Nature, and therefore no Name for it. For the Names of distinction in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary use do not only distinguish, but divide and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100659:8"/>
separate their Subjects, and the Names of Unity signifie singularity also, which admits no number. And this has occasioned most of our cavilling Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, and raised all the noise and clamour about Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities and Contradictions in the Doctrine of the Trinity; and there is no help for this, if Men will ask such Questions, as the proper and natural sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of Words cannot reach the Mystery of, and not allow such a Theological use of Words, as a little alters their natural Signification, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate them to represent some divine and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Mysteries.</p>
            <p>Thus for Example: <hi>A Person</hi> signifies a reasonable understanding Being, which actually subsists, and is distinguished from all other Beings of the same kind; but then it signifies more than this, not only a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, but a separate Subsistence; for so all created Persons are, not only distinct, but separate Beings, who have a compleat, absolute, independant Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence of their own. But when we use this Word <hi>Person</hi> in a Theological Sense, as applied to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost in the ever-blessed Trinity, we only use it in the sense of distinction, not of separation, to signifie, that each of these Holy Three has all the Perfections of infinite Mind and Understanding, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly, as other Persons have, but not separately, as created Persons have. And since there are Three in the Unity of the Godhead thus really distinguished from each other without a separation, I know no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why we may not use this Word Person in this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Sence, to signifie Three, who are as really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from each other, but not separated, as other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are: For when it is known in what sence we use the Word, when applied to the Trinity, it is trifling
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100659:9"/>
to dispute against Three Persons in the Godhead, from the signification of the Word Person, when applied to Creatures; and yet this is the Sum total of all the Socinian Arguments against <hi>Three Persons, and One God,</hi> and of all the Contradictions they pretend to find in it. Three Divine Persons, they say, must be Three absolute, compleat, independent Gods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Three Humane Persons are Three compleat, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Men, who subsist independently on each other; and therefore it is as manifest a Contradiction, That Three Divine Persons should be but One God, as it is, that Three Humane Persons should be but One Man; which signifies nothing, if we do not use the Word <hi>Person</hi> in the same Sense (and all the World knows we do not) when applied to the Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as when applied to Men: For it is meer trifling to dispute against us from such a Sense of the Word, as we reject, and declare to all Men that we do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. The most that can be made of this is, that we use an improper Word, and ought not to call Father, Son, and Holy Ghost Three Persons, because that is to make Three Gods of them, as <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> are Three Men: But when the importunity of Hereticks forces us to find Names for that, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in created Nature can answer, if they will not give us leave, we must take leave to use the properest Names we can find, though not every way proper; and such the Name of <hi>Person</hi> is, when applied to the <hi>Persons of the Trinity:</hi> For all that this Word <hi>Person</hi> signifies, except <hi>a separate Subsistence,</hi> belongs to the Persons of the Holy Trinity. An intelligent Nature, and all personal Acts of Understanding, Volition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do as distinctly belong to each Person, as to any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Persons; and it is this makes a Person, not a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100659:9"/>
separate Subsistence, which belongs only to finite and created, not to infinite and eternal Persons: And therefore the Word Person is properly enough appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Three Divine Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, because all that is essential to the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Person, belongs to each of them, though they do not subsist separately, as Humane Persons do.</p>
            <p>But yet Men are very apt to judge of the Divine Persons, by what they see in Humane Persons, and to fancy these Three Persons in the Deity to be like Three Men, who have the same Humane Nature, but subsist and act separately, and are <hi>One</hi> only by a moral Consent and Unity: And therefore to prevent this Imagination, which betrays Men to down right Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism, others, without rejecting the Name Person, have thought fit more expresly to signifie what kind of Persons they are, by calling them <hi>Three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistences;</hi> that is, Three who have all the Perfections of the Godhead, and do really and distinctly subsist; for else they could not be <hi>Three Subsistences,</hi> but yet do not subsist as <hi>separate Persons,</hi> but are essentially One God: For <hi>Subsistence</hi> does not necessarily infer Separation, for Three may distinctly subsist, though essentially and inseparably united. And this is the difference between <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Subsistence,</hi> that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the most usual acceptation of the Word Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which it is hard to correct, (for that Idea which in common use belongs to a Word, is apt to stick close to it,) <hi>Three Persons,</hi> signifie Three who subsist apart, and as <hi>separately</hi> as Three Men do: But <hi>Three Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stences</hi> are Three Persons who subsist distinctly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Separation: For <hi>Subsistence</hi> necessarily signifies a distinct and real, but not a separate Subsistence; for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100659:10"/>
if Three really subsist without a Separation, they are <hi>Three real Subsistences;</hi> and therefore it is in vain for the Socinians to dispute against Three Persons, that they must be Three separate Persons, unless they can prove that they cannot really subsist without a Separation, which none of them ever yet undertook; and yet all their Talk of Contradictions and Three Gods, vanishes without it.</p>
            <p>What I have said of the Word <hi>Person,</hi> is with equal reason applicable to the Word <hi>Mind.</hi> The Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter objects against the Dean, That <hi>a Mind or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is an absolute Being, Nature, or Substance;</hi> and I grant it is so in the common use of the Word, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied to created Minds and Spirits; but so is <hi>Person</hi> also, as much as <hi>Mind;</hi> and if we allow of a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical use of the Word <hi>Person,</hi> why not of <hi>Mind</hi> too? to signifie an <hi>intelligent Subsistence,</hi> which is a <hi>Mind</hi> too, but not <hi>a separate Mind,</hi> and therefore not such an <hi>absolute Being, Nature, and Substance,</hi> as a created Mind is. And when the Dean speaks of <hi>Three distinct infinite Minds, which are essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially and inseparably One,</hi> he could mean nothing more than three distinct intelligent, but not separate Subsistences: And he needs ask no other Pardon, but for the use of a Word, which the Schools have not consecrated.</p>
            <p>But there is greater want of Words to express the Unity and Oneness of the Divine Nature and Essence, than the distinction of Persons. The <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers in their Controversie with <hi>Arius,</hi> of which, (if there be occasion more hereafter,) who denied the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Christ, and made him no more than a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though as perfect, and as like to God as a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could be, used the Word <hi>Homoousion,</hi> which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100659:10"/>
was not first invented by them to serve that turn, but was used either in Words or Sence by the <hi>Anti-Nicene</hi> Fathers, as the learned Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> has proved.</p>
            <p>But what is this <hi>Homoousion,</hi> or <hi>Sameness of Nature?</hi> This is the difficulty; for there is not any one Word to explain it by, which adequately answers the full Notion of the Divine Unity; and that is no great wonder, because there is no perfect Example in Nature of any such Unity.</p>
            <p>They very often explain this by Examples of a Specifick Unity: That the Father and Son have the same Nature, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> have; and therefore they call Men, who have the same Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Nature, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and so they do the Sun, its Light, and Splendor, the Tree and its Branches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this is in part a true representation of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moousiotes,</hi> or Sameness of Nature in the Persons of the Holy Trinity; for if there be not that which perfectly Answers, though it much out-does also a specifick Sameness and Unity, their Nature cannot be the same, and accordingly they prove against the <hi>Arians,</hi> that Christ cannot be the Son of God, if he be not <hi>Homoousios</hi> to his Father, because every Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther begets a Son in his own Nature.</p>
            <p>But yet we must not say, nor did they intend it so, That the Unity of Nature between Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit, is a meer specifick Sameness. For we must not make the Divine Nature a Species, which is common to more Individuals; for then the Unity of the Divine Nature is no more than a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Notion, which is the only Unity of a Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Nature; whereas God is essentially and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically one. The Three Divine Persons are not individuals of the same Nature; for then they must
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100659:11"/>
have Three individual subsisting Divine Natures, which would as much make Three Gods, as Three individual subsisting Humane Natures make Three Men: The Divine Nature would then be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by Multiplication, as Humane Nature is, which must multiply Gods as well as Men.</p>
            <p>Is this Sameness of Nature then one single or sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Nature, which has but one single Subsistence? This the Fathers utterly deny, as being the Heresie of <hi>Sabellius,</hi> and leaving no other Trinity of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the Godhead, but a Trinity of Names. The Divine Nature is <hi>One Individual</hi> Nature (as you shall hear presently) but not <hi>One Single</hi> Nature; for one Single Nature can be but One Person, whether in God or Man.</p>
            <p>I shall not dispute this at large now; I may find a properer place for it, but I shall only observe at present, That if there be but One only single Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in God, the whole Trinity must be Incarnate in the Incarnation of Christ, as <hi>Sabellius</hi> asserted: For the Divine Nature was Incarnate in Christ, he <hi>was perfect God, and perfect Man,</hi> and if there was but one single subsisting Nature in all Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, this one single Divine Nature was Incarnate; and therefore the Father and the Holy Ghost, who are this one single Divine Nature, as well as the Son, must be as much Incarnate as the Son was; for though it were possible to conceive Three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons in One single Divine Nature, yet it is absolutely impossible, that this One single Nature should be incarnate, and not the Divine Nature of all the Three Persons be incarnate, when it is but One single Nature in all: And it is absurd to say, that the One Divine Nature of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100659:11"/>
is incarnate, and yet none but the Son incarnate. This is what <hi>Victorinus Afer</hi> teaches: <hi>Non oportet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, nec fas est dicere, unam esse Substantiam, tres esse Personas; si enim ista ipsa Substantia &amp; egit omnia, &amp; passa est, patripassiani &amp; nos; absit.</hi> Bibl. Patr. Tom. 4. <hi>We ought not,</hi> says he, <hi>to say, nor is it lawful to say, that there is but One Substance,</hi> (that is, One sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle subsisting Nature,) <hi>and Three Persons; for if this same Substance did and suffered all, we also must be</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tripassians; <hi>which God forbid;</hi> That is, we must say, That the Father suffered as well as the Son, as <hi>Sabelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> taught. It is such Animadversions, and such unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible Notions, which make the Christian Faith ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculed by Atheists and Hereticks.</p>
            <p>But the great difficulty is, how to conceive One <hi>Individual</hi> Nature, which is <hi>numerically</hi> One, but is not One <hi>single</hi> Nature: And yet thus it must be, if there be a Trinity in Unity, Three real Hypostases and Subsistences in One Divine Nature; which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit <hi>Areopagite,</hi> but an ancient and learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>Monad</hi> or <hi>Unite,</hi> which thrice subsists, or has Three Subsistences; whereas it is demonstrable, That One single Nature can subsist but once, or have but One Subsistence: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ancient Fathers owned, that Father and Son is <hi>alius &amp; alius,</hi> and that God is <hi>solus,</hi> but <hi>non solitarius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I may be the better understood, and give you some imperfect Conception of this great and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Mystery, let us contemplate this individual Identity and Sameness of Nature, in a Man and his Image.</p>
            <p>A Man sees his own Image in a Glass, the exact Proportion of his Body, all the Lines and Features in his Face, all his own Motions, and Postures, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100659:12"/>
he smiles or cries, sits or stands. Now suppose this were a real, living Image, as exactly himself, both in Body and Mind, as the Image in the Glass represents his external Shape and Features: That this living I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage was coeval with himself, and did subsist as necessarily as he did, and yet as much depend upon him, as the Image in the Glass does on his Face and Presence: That this Living Image did understand and will in the same Act with himself, and repeat all his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Passions, and Sensations, as his Face in the Glass does: That this living Image knew himself to be but an Image, distinct from the Original, but the same with him; and that the Man whose Image it is, knew himself to be distinct from his Image, but yet the same; and that the Man and his living Image felt each other, and all that is in each other, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>Now I desire to know by what Name you would call such a living Image? You cannot deny him to be a Man, because he has Humane Nature in himself, and distinctly in himself, as compleatly and perfectly as the Man has, whose Image he is, or else he were not a compleat and perfect Image: And yet you cannot say that he is a distinct Man, or another Man, a Second Man, for he is but an Image, and the very same with the Original, and therefore they are both but One Man; naturally One, not as Two other Men are, who may be morally One, by a Consent and Agreement of Understanding and Will, but by an individual Unity and Sameness of Nature and Will: And yet you must confess them to be Two, though not Two Men, not Two Humane Natures; for the Man is not his Image, nor the Image the Man, whose Image he is: But if you will call the Man a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100659:12"/>
Person, as certainly every Man is a Person, then his Image, which is the same with himself, must be a Person too, and not the same Person: So that here are Two distinct Persons subsisting in One Individual Nature, not multiplied, but repeated in its Image. There is indeed no such living Image as this in created Nature; but yet this is the true Nature of any Image, and gives us an intelligible Conception of the Unity of Nature in a plurality of Persons.</p>
            <p>And this is the plain account of the essential Unity between God the Father, and God the Son. Christ is expresly called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Thus we say, the Lord Christ, the Image of the invisible God, is immediately and instantly affected together with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <hi>who is in the Father, knows the Father's Will,</hi> or rather, <hi>is the Father's Will.</hi> Whether this be not the Dean's <hi>mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Consciousness,</hi> which must of necessity be between a living Image and its Prototype, or that whereof it is the Image, and is the most natural and inseparable Union of all, let any Man judge.</p>
            <p>It were easie to fill the Margin with such Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as these, as you who are conversant in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, very well know; but I shall only farther ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve at present, that the Fathers made use of this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Son's being the living Image of God his Father, both in their Disputes against the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Sabellians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They proved from hence against the <hi>Arians,</hi> that the Son was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of the same Nature with his Father, which is a plain and necessary Consequence, and needs no proof; for if the Father and the Son be the same, as a Prototype and his Image, there can be no Diversity of Nature between them. Thus St. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary,</hi> St. <hi>Basil,</hi> St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> St. <hi>Athanasius, Greg. Nyssen,</hi> St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and all the Fathers who were concerned in the <hi>Arian</hi> Controversie, reason at large.</p>
            <p>And thus they proved against the <hi>Sabellians,</hi> That God was not One single Person, distinguished only by Three Names; because the Son is the living sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting Image of the Father, and the Image and the Prototype cannot be the same, but must be Two; no Man is his own Image, nor is an Image the Image of it self. This is so self-evident, and so frequently oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs in the ancient Writers, that I shall not detain you with particular Quotations at present.</p>
            <p>This real distinction of Three in the same indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual numerical Nature, the Ancients expressed by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100659:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: That the same One individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Nature subsists thrice, in Three real Subsistences, not by multiplying, but only by repeating it self. As a Man and his living Image would be Two real Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistences, but not Two Men, nor Two Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but the same Man and the same Nature subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twice in Two different manners, not like Two Men, but as the Prototype and the Image, which are really and distinctly Two, and yet but One Man. Thus Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are really Three, but have the same individual Nature, and are the same One God, and differ only in their manner of subsisting; That the same Divine Nature subsists ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally in the Father, and subsists again in the Son, as in a living Image of the Father, and subsists a third time in the Holy Ghost by an eternal Procession from Father and Son, in eternal, living substantial Love.</p>
            <p>In this Sence the Ancients understood the Word <hi>Subsistence,</hi> not in the Abstract, as some modern School-men do, and as the Animadverter seems to do, if I understand him, or he understands himself; but in the Concrete, for that which does really and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally subsist; which does <hi>éxstare,</hi> and is called by them <hi>Extantia</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: And this is very intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that there are Three real Subsistences, or Three that really subsist in the numerical and individual U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Divine Nature. But to talk of Three Subsistences in the abstract without Three that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, or of One single Nature, which has Three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistences, when it is impossible, that in Singularity there can be more than One Subsistence, is too fine and metaphysical for me, and I envy no Man that can understand it. <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>substantiam non differentem; That there is not One who subsists, but One Substance without any diversity;</hi> that is, in three different Subsistencies.</p>
            <p>There could not have been more proper Words thought on to represent a Trinity in Unity, than Three Subsistencies in One individual Nature, which differ in nothing from each other, but in their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner of Subsistence. For it is certain here are Three different kinds of Subsistence, which are not to be found in any One thing in the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. Nothing else has any more than one real Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence; for every Being in Nature besides is singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or has but One single Subsistence. Every Man and Angel is a single particular Creature, subsists singly and separately by it self, and is singly One; but if there be a Trinity in Unity, the same Divine Nature must subsist wholly, entirely, and substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Three, but in a different manner to make them Three. And it is as certain, that the Father and the Son, though they have the very same Nature, yet subsist in a very different manner, the Father as Original Mind, the Son as the perfect, living, substantial I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Father, which is as different as the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence of the Prototype and the Image; and every one will grant, that a Man and his Image, though it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100659:15"/>
were a living substantial Image, have a very different Subsistence; for the Image has its whole Subsistence in dependance on its Prototype; the Man subsists by himself, and gives Subsistence to his Image; and the same we must conceive of the Subsistence of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, though we have not so apt a Similitude to represent it by.</p>
            <p>And if we must call the Three in the Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by any other Name than Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Three Subsistences is liable to the least Cavil, and does most properly express their general Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter; for they are but One Divinity, or One Divine Nature subsisting wholly and entirely Three times, without multiplication, as a Man is not multiplied but repeated in his Image. All other Names in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and usual Sence, signifie an absolute, compleat, independent Being, such as <hi>Nature, Essence, Substance, God:</hi> And therefore though each Divine Person have a natural, essential, substantial Subsistence, and be true and real God; yet we must not say, that there are Three Divine Natures, Essences, Substances, or Three Gods; because though the whole Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Essence, subsists in Three, yet it is but one and the same in all; and tho' God be the most absolute, compleat, independant Being, and the Son be God, and the Holy Ghost God, yet neither the Son, nor the Holy Ghost can be said to be an absolute, compleat, independant God, because Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are but One God; neither of which subsist absolutely, compleatly, independently; that is, without each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which is all that is meant by an absolute, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, independent Subsistence, that they can subsist a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part without each other; but the Father can no more subsist without the Son, than the Son without the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100659:15"/>
Father; nor the Holy Spirit without Father and Son; nor Father and Son without the Holy Spirit; as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and necessary Image cannot subsist without its Prototype, nor the Prototype without its Image, which is essential to it; so that they are but One ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, compleat, independent Deity, though the Three Divine Subsistences in the Godhead subsist in a mutual respect, and a relative dependance on each other.</p>
            <p>And this, I suppose, is what the Schools mean, when they call the Three Divine Persons, Three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, or Three Relatives; for there must be Three real subsisting Relatives, if there be Three Relations; for One Subsistence cannot be the Subject of Three Relations, no more than one and the same Man can be related to himself as Father and Son. But then the Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit are such Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as there is no Example of in created Nature; for their Relation to each other is not a meer exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Respect and Denomination, such as absolute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant Beings have to each other, but their very Nature and Subsistence, as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is relative. Though the Father be eternal original Mind, yet it is essential to this eternal Mind to beget his own living substantial Image; and therefore this eternal Mind is naturally and essential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly related to his Image: And I need not tell you, that the very Nature and Subsistence of an Image is wholly relative; a natural and essential Image sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists as necessarily as the Prototype, but its Nature is wholly relative. Thus Father, Son, and Holy Ghost have the same common Nature; not common as a generical or specifick Nature, which is only a logical Notion, but as One individual Nature, really and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100659:16"/>
actually subsisting in each, without any other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence than their different manner of Subsistence, and their different Relations, as a Man and his living Image, have the same individual Nature common to both, and differ only in their manner of Subsistence and Relations; that is, as the Prototype and its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Image differ. And this I think gives us an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible account of a Trinity in Unity in the most Orthodox Language of Fathers and Schools.</p>
            <p>This shews us, that the Son, and Holy Spirit, are not Divine Emanations from the Father, as is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in the <hi>Platonick Triad:</hi> For though the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Generation and Procession be such Mysteries, as we cannot comprehend, nor frame any Idea or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of, yet we know that an Image is not an Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but a Reflextion; and therefore is wholly and entirely the same with the Prototype, which no Emanation can be; for the whole cannot be an Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: An Emanation indeed is of the same Substance, and is specifically the same; and in this Sence <hi>Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousios;</hi> but it multiplies Natures and Substances, and is not individually and identically the same as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totype and its Image; and therefore the Fathers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, That the eternal Generation of the Son is not by Abscission and Passion, but think the aptest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of it in Nature, (though that is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent) is by Splendor and Brightness, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>out-shining</hi> of the Deity; and when they call the Holy Spirit <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it is not in the Sence of Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but of the mysterious <hi>Procession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This also shews us, That this Holy Trinity is not Three Divine Attributes, such as Wisdom, Power, and Goodness; for they are all Three the very same with each other, the same Wisdom, Goodness, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100659:16"/>
Power, and therefore not Three Parts or Attributes of the same Deity, but each is the whole, as a Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type, and its living Image is.</p>
            <p>And this shews, That though the Son be true and perfect God, as the Father is, yet the Son can never be a Father, because his Nature and Subsistence as a Son is wholly relative; and a Son, whose Nature and Subsistence is relative, is necessarily and essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a Son, but can never be a Father, no more than the Image can beget its Prototype.</p>
            <p>And this gives a plain Account, why our Saviour calls God, not only <hi>his Father,</hi> but <hi>his God,</hi> and <hi>the only true God,</hi> and acknowledges, That <hi>he receives all from his Father,</hi> and, That <hi>his Father is greater than he is;</hi> though he have the very same Nature, and with respect to his Nature is equal in Power and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for this is the true difference between the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type and the Image, though their Nature be the same. Had a Man a living substantial Image, perfectly the same with himself, as God has, the Image must thus speak of his Prototype, as the Son of God speaks of his Father. He must acknowledge that the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type is <hi>his Man,</hi> for he is only the Image of the Man; and were there only One Man in the World, as there is but One God, he must acknowledge the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type to be the <hi>only true Man;</hi> for though the living Image would be a true Man also, yet he is not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally Man, but <hi>Man of Man,</hi> a Man only by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Participation with its Prototype; and therefore the Prototype is greater than its Image, and the Image receives all from the Prototype, depends on it, and subsists and lives in and by it, as the Son acknowledges, That <hi>he lives by the Father, Iohn</hi> 6. 57. This is manifestly the Language of Scripture and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100659:17"/>
concerning the Son of God, his living and substantial Image; and I hope you see, That this is proper and peculiar only to a living subsisting Image; and can be applied to nothing else, but is the only proper way that we can speak of such an Image, or that such an Image can speak of it self; this is intelligible, though the Mystery of this eternal living Image is inconceivable.</p>
            <p>This I suppose is what the Dean meant; when he said, That <hi>Some tolerable Account might be given of the Terms and Distinctions of the Schools;</hi> and I believe you begin to see, That this representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I have now made of this Venerable Mystery, will contribute very much to the better Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing both of the Fathers and of the Schools, as may appear more hereafter; but at present I shall only shew you, That this is the true representation of the Dean's Notion of a <hi>Trinity in Unity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dean does professedly Teach, That the Three Persons or Subsistences in the ever blessed Trinity, are Three real Substantial Subsistences, each of which has entirely all the Perfections of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature; Divine Wisdom, Power, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and therefore each of them is eternal, infinite Mind, as distinct from each other, as any other Three Persons; and this I believe he will no more Recant, than he will renounce a Trinity; for all the Wit of Man can't find a Medium between a Substantial Trinity, and a Trinity of Names, or a Trinity of meer Modes, Respects, and Relations in the same single Essence, which is no Trinity at all. And if the Son, as you heard, be the living Image of his Father's Nature, Essence and Perfections, the Divine Nature, though it be not multiplied, yet
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100659:17"/>
is repeated in the Son, and does as really and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly subsist in the Son, as it does in the Father; as had a Man a living Image, his Image would be as substantially and really Man, as the Prototype is, or as the Man himself, whose Image it is, though the Man and his Image, which are really and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially Two, are not Two Men, but One Man. And thus the Dean might very safely say, That there are Three in the Godhead, each of which is a distinct, infinite, eternal Mind; and though Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom has not made the form of Expression Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, yet there is no Heretical Sence in it, to call them Three infinite and eternal Minds, with respect to their Nature and real Subsistence, to distinguish them from meer Names, and Logical Notions, if at the same time it be declared, That they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividually and numerically One: As it would be no Mortal Crime against Logick and common Sence to say, That a Man and his Living Image are Two distinct Men, with respect to the real and actual Subsistence of Humane Nature distinctly in each of them, though the Image is not another Man, but the same with its Prototype.</p>
            <p>This is the distinction which the Dean makes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Three Divine Persons, which yet could not be Three, were they not Three Self-conscious Subsistencies; for there cannot be Three in a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and intelligent Nature, without knowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their distinction from each other; That the Father knows himself to be the Father, and not the Son, and the Son knows himself to be the Son, and not the Father. This every Man feels in himself to be a real and natural distinction of one Person from another, and the Scripture is express in it,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100659:18"/>
that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are thus distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished; and this the Dean thought, and as far as I can yet see, with great Reason, to be the most easie and sensible representation of a real and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Trinity.</p>
            <p>As for the Unity of these three Divine Persons, the Dean expresly Teaches, That they are essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and numerically One. And as the most sensible Representation of this, he places their Unity in <hi>Mutual consciousness,</hi> that they have as <hi>Conscious a Sensation</hi> of each other in themselves as they have of themselves: And he is certainly so far in the right, that this is essential to their Unity; That Three intelligent Subsistences cannot be One with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this <hi>Mutual consciousness,</hi> and that this <hi>Mutual consciousness</hi> cannot be in Three, which are not es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially and numerically One. The Scripture plainly enough Teaches this very Unity between Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, as he has proved at large; and if this either be, or prove, or necessarily supposes an essential Unity, as inseparable from it, and essential to it, here is an intelligible Notion of a natural Trinity in Unity, without any Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, Absurdity, or Confusion of Subsistences, which is all the Dean intended. But the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter and his <hi>Socinian</hi> Seconds, or rather Leaders, represent the Dean's Notion, as if he made the Three Divine Persons, as absolute, compleat, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Persons, as Three Men are, and that they are united only by <hi>Mutual consciousness,</hi> and then they can fansie nothing but an Unity of Knowledge, or a Moral Unity and consent of Wills: But this is either a mistake, or a wilful misrepresentation, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one may see with half an Eye, who considers the whole Notion together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:100659:18"/>The Dean indeed, the better to convey this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the natural Unity of <hi>Mutual consciousness</hi> to our Minds, supposes a Case, which he knew very well, never was, nor ever could be, which is very allowable in all Writers, within the compass of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, when we want some sensible Images to frame<note place="margin">Vindic. of Trin. <hi>p.</hi> 49.</note> our Conceptions by: And therefore says, <hi>That if there were Three created Spirits so united, as to be conscious to each others Thoughts and Passions, as they are to their own, he can see no Reason why we might not say, That Three such Persons are numerically One.</hi> Though he knew, That Three such particular, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Natures never could be thus united, but in them we might the better conceive, what kind of Union it was he meant. But from hence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That the Dean owns no other Unity in the Divine Nature, than what <hi>Mutual-consciousness</hi> would make between Three particular, absolute, compleat, separate Natures, is, I'm sure, false-reasoning, and looks like very foul Play. The Dean asserts, That these Three Divine Persons are thus <hi>Mutually Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious</hi> to each other, and that this <hi>Mutual-conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> is an essential Unity, and that those, who are thus <hi>Mutually Conscious</hi> are <hi>numerically One;</hi> but then he Teaches, that there are no other Three in the World that are thus <hi>Mutually Conscious,</hi> and that these Three are not, and cannot be for this very reason, Three particular, separate, subsisting Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but Three Subsistences in one individual, numerical Nature: An Unity of Nature, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual consciousness may be distinguished, but are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable: There can be no Unity of Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Three intelligent Subsistences without <hi>Mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consciousness;</hi> and there can be no <hi>Mutual-conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:100659:19"/>
but in the same individual Nature; but yet, if we must distinguish as far as we can apprehend these matters, <hi>Mutual-consciousness</hi> is much more es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential to the Unity of Three intelligent Subsistences than any other Notion of Unity: For I cannot see, but that if it were possible, That three created Spirits, who are not only Three distinct Subsistences, but have Three particular, separate Natures, should be thus united by <hi>Mutual-consciousness,</hi> it would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the individuation of their Natures, though the individuation of their Subsistences or Persons would be preserved by <hi>Self-consciousness:</hi> And, were it possible, the same individual Nature should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in its Image, without this <hi>Mutual-conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> it would divide this One Nature, and make the Man and his living Image, as much Two Men, as any Two Men in the World; But then the Image would cease to be an Image, how exact so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, upon other Accounts, the Likeness or Same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness were; for the Image does not only represent and resemble the Prototype, but moves and acts with it.</p>
            <p>And this is that very <hi>Mutual-consciousness</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Dean places the essential and numerical Unity of the Holy Trinity; such a <hi>Mutual-consciousness</hi> as must be between the Prototype and its living Image. I shall not trouble you with transcribing out of the <hi>Vindication,</hi> but referr you to some places to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult at your leisure.</p>
            <p>He always represents the Son, as the living Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Image of God the Father; and the eternal<note place="margin">Vindic. <hi>p.</hi> 130, 131, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> Generation by God's reflex Knowledge of himself; and in this places the numerical Identity and Same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Nature between Father and Son, as there is between the Prototype and its Image; and the Holy
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100659:19"/>
Spirit, whom the Fathers represent, as God's eternal Love of himself in his own Image, has all the same Divine Perfections repeated in eternal and substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial Love: That yet this numerical Identity and Unity of Nature cannot be understood without this <hi>Mutual-consciousness,</hi> which makes them One Energy and Power, and is their mutual In-being in each other.</p>
            <p>That this <hi>Mutual-consciousness</hi> proves the perfect<note place="margin">P. 122, 123, &amp;c.</note> equality of all Three Persons in the Unity of the<note place="margin">P. 81.</note> Godhead, as having the very same Perfections, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out destroying the Prerogative of the Father, or the Subordination of the Son, and the Holy Spirit: As a living Image is in Nature equal with the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type, but Subordinate.</p>
            <p>That this gives an Account of the <hi>Modi subsistendi,</hi> or of the real and actual Subsistence of the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, numerical Nature in Three, but in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner; had these things been duly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and compared, we should not have heard so<note place="margin">P. 83.</note> much noise and clamour about <hi>Mutual-consciousness,</hi> as if it made Three absolute, compleat, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Gods, when it is impossible to conceive a more close and intimate Union in Nature.</p>
            <p>But there is one formidable Objection against all this, or rather against the Dean for it, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends by this means to make the Notion of a <hi>Trinity in Unity</hi> as intelligible as the Notion of God: which is intolerable Vanity and Presumption to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to explain Mysteries. But does the Dean pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, That his Explication leaves nothing Mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity in Unity?</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which we cannot comprehend? That, as the Ancients used to speak, this is no longer <hi>a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful distinction, and a wonderful Union?</hi> This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100659:20"/>
had been very vain and presumptuous: But are there no Mysteries in the Divine Nature, because the Notion of One God is an intelligible Notion? If there be, there may be Mysteries, very incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible Mysteries in the Trinity still, how intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible soever the Notion be: The intelligibleness of any Notion, whether it be true or false, consists in the terms in which it is conceived; that they convey a distinct Idea to our Minds of something possible, not which we can fully comprehend, but which we can understand without confusion or contradiction; and this does great Service to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to deliver Mysteries from absurdity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, though they are very incomprehensible still.</p>
            <p>The Notion of Eternity (for Example) is very Intelligible, to be without any Cause, without Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and without End; there is no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in this, and it is demonstrable, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing must be Eternal; and yet nothing can be more incomprehensible than Eternity: Our Thoughts are presently lost, when we endeavour to conceive an eternal Being: And thus an eternal Image of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Being, begotten without Beginning, is as intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible, as an eternal Being is; for if it be necessary and essential to an eternal Being, to have a living, substantial Image, thought can't divide their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence; and it is as certain, if there be such an eternal living Image, that this eternal Being, and his eternal Image are Two, as the Prototype and the Image; and yet as essentially One, and as inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately conscious to each other, as you have heard, they must necessarily be; this is intelligible, but yet a very incomprehensible Mystery; for who can conceive an eternal Generation, which has no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning?
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100659:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Divine Nature repeated in its Image without multiplication? a Distinction without Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and an Unity without Singularity, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Confusion? If these be not Mysteries enow for the Animadverter, though the Dean's intelligible Notion were admitted, he is as much too fond of Mysteries, as other Men are too much afraid of them; for whether he knows it or no, there is a very great difference between a Mystery, and Contradiction or Nonsence.</p>
            <p>I believe by this time you are less Fond than you were, of an Answer to the Animadverter's Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which some Men, who have despised his Wit and Railery, have yet thought unanswerable; but I will be as good as my Word, especially since a short Answer will serve.</p>
            <p>In his third Chapter he Attacks the Dean's Notion<note place="margin">Animad. c. 3.</note> of <hi>Self-consciousness,</hi> but he stumbles at the Threshold, and runs on furiously as a Man does who runs head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and is never able to recover himself. He says, <hi>It is evident, the Dean assigns Self-consciousness as the formal reason of Personality, in all Persons uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally, whether Finite or Infinite, Create or uncreate;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 70.</note> and therefore he undertakes to prove, <hi>That Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consciousness is not the formal Reason of Personality, either in Finite or Infinite Persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dean says not one word about <hi>the formal Reason of Personality,</hi> nor is at all concern'd what it is. He only says, <hi>That the Unity of a Spirit with it self, and its distinct and separate Subsistence from all</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. <hi>p.</hi> 48.</note> 
               <hi>oher created Spirits, consists in Self-consciousness.</hi> So that if that be one distinct, separate Mind, which is conscious only to it self, which feels all that is in it self, and nothing else, and those be two distinct
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100659:21"/>
separate Minds, each of which is thus conscious to it self, but not to each other, the Dean has gained his Point, and the Animadverter has lost all his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Wit, whatever becomes of <hi>the formal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Personality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dean did not enquire what makes a Mind, or Spirit, or if you please a Person, but what makes a Mind or Spirit, or Person One, and either distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, or separates it from all other Minds, and Spirits, and Persons; and if this be what he means by the <hi>formal Reason of Personality,</hi> I do affirm, That Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consciousness is this formal Reason; and that for the very Reason he urges against it, That <hi>wheresoever the formal Reason of Personality is, there is Personality, and wheresoever Personality is, there is the formal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Personality:</hi> For wheresoever there is a Person, there is <hi>Self-consciousness;</hi> that is, every Person is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious to it self, and there can be no Person without it; and wheresoever there is <hi>Self-consciousness,</hi> there is by Nature a Person, unless its natural Personality be swallowed up in a Supernatural Union to a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Person, of which more presently.</p>
            <p>And yet to see what meer Mortals the nicest Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastick Wits are, who can spend Days and Years in picking Straws, and splitting Hairs, this great <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> the Witty, the Subtle, the Good-natur'd Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter, knows not the difference between the formal Reason and such a natural Property as the Logicians call <hi>proprium quarto modo,</hi> which belongs to the whole kind, only to the kind, and always to the kind; for such Properties do <hi>exist convertibly, and One mutually and essentially infers the other,</hi> which is his account of the <hi>formal Reason;</hi> and thus <hi>Risibility</hi> is the formal Reason of Humanity, which makes well for
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100659:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Animadverter to prove him to be a Man, though he is seldom in so good a Humour as to laugh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grinning, which belongs to another Species.</p>
            <p>But since he is pleased to let that pass for the formal Reason of Personality, which is convertible with it, I hope <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> may escape pretty well, and pass for <hi>the formal Reason of Personality.</hi> But let us hear his Arguments against it.</p>
            <p>1. The first is worth its weight in Gold, and yet<note place="margin">Page 71.</note> will not much enrich the Buyer, that <hi>according to the natural Order of things,</hi> Self-consciousness <hi>in Persons pre-supposes their Personality, and therefore is not, cannot be the reason of it.</hi> Now suppose a Man should rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thus: Actual Knowledge pre-supposes a Mind, and therefore Knowledge in its Principle is not, and cannot be the formal Reason of a Mind; would the Animadverter for this Reason deny, that the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Knowledge is the formal Reason of a Mind, that which makes and constitutes a Mind, because there can be no actual Knowledge before there is a Mind? and yet the Argument is the very same; for if Knowledge in its Principle, may be the Nature or formal Reason of a knowing Being, or of a Mind, though there can be no one act of Knowledge, till there is a Mind, then <hi>Self-knowledge,</hi> or <hi>Self-sensation,</hi> or <hi>Self-consciousness,</hi> may be the formal Reason of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonality, though there must be a Person, before there can be any <hi>actual Self-consciousness;</hi> that is to say, there must be a self (which in this Dispute is all that can be meant by Person) before this Self can feel it Self, and by this Self-feeling distinguish Himself from all other Selfs. I could not but smile to see how gravely this wise Animadverter proves, That <hi>there must be a Person, before there can be any Action pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:100659:22"/>
               <hi>from a Person,</hi> and summons the whole <hi>Posse</hi> of Metaphysicks to prove it: But I hope notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, that <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> in the <hi>Abstract</hi> (as the Dean uses it, and as every one but such an Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter would understand it) is as capable of being the formal Reason of a Person, as <hi>Rationality</hi> is of <hi>a reasonable Nature,</hi> though there must be a reasonable Creature before he can reason, as there must be <hi>a Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conscious Nature</hi> before there can be <hi>actual Self-consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I have something more to say to our Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter before I leave his <hi>Demonstration,</hi> as he calls it; For as Sophistical as his Argument is, the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it is false, and absurdly unphilosophical: He says, That <hi>Personality is the Ground and Principle of all Action, wheresoever it is. For where there is a</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum, <hi>whether it be Rational (which is another Word for Person) or not, still it is the whole</hi> Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, <hi>that Acts.</hi> That it is the Person that acts is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; but where did he learn, That <hi>Personality is the Principle of all Action?</hi> I was always taught other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, That <hi>Natura est principium motus &amp; quietis: Nature is the Principle of Motion and Rest,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of all Action: And is there no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Nature and Personality? Is there no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between being a reasonable Creature, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Iohn?</hi> or do <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Iohn</hi> perform the Actions of a reasonable Creature, by Vertue of their being such distinct and particular Persons, or by their being Men, by the Powers of Humane Nature, which are common to all? Men are not distinguished from each other, nor act and subsist separately by Humane Nature; and therefore neither Humane Nature, nor any of the Powers or Actions of Humane Nature
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100659:22"/>
distinguish Men into particular Persons, or are the Reason of Personality; but that which limits Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, makes it particular, and a particular subsisting rational Nature is a Person, is one with it self, and distinguished and separated from all others: So that we must not seek for any formal Constituent Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Personality (in a strict and proper Notion) as we do of Nature, but see in finite Beings, where Nature ends, and what are the utmost Bounds of it, and that distinguishes a common Nature into Persons. Now a rational Nature extends as far as Sensation and Consciousness, and where that ends, there are the Bounds of Nature, and that makes a particular Person, which feels all that is in himself, and nothing else; and this is the Dean's Self-consciousness, which sets Bounds to Nature, and by that makes a Person, which is one with it self, and separated from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and therefore in this Dispute is neither to be considered as a Power, nor as an Action of Nature, neither direct nor reflex, but as the Bounds of it, which makes a particular subsisting rational Nature, which we call a Person. For it is plain, that as far as Sensation and Consciousness extends, a Spirit is One, where that ends, common Nature divides, and subsists in Particulars.</p>
            <p>I cannot but think how this Animadverter must look, when he reads over this Argument again, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially his Triumphant Conclusion: <hi>This I look upon as a Demonstration of the Point; and I leave it to our Author (who is better a great deal at scorning the Schools, than at confuting them) to answer and overthrow it at his leisure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. His second Argument, I confess, looks like something solid and substantial, but proves a meer
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100659:23"/>
airy vanishing Spectrum, when you come near to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle it. It is this: <hi>The Humanity, or Humane Nature of Christ is perfectly conscious to its self of all the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Acts, whether of Knowledge, Volition, Passion, or Desire,</hi> (which is One of the Passions) <hi>that pass in it, or belong to it; and yet the Humanity, or Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Christ is not a Person, and consequently Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness is not the formal Reason of Personality; for as much as it may be in that, which is no Person.</hi> Now indeed had the Dean expresly taught. That <hi>Self-consciousness is the formal Reason of Personality,</hi> here had been One supernatural Exception against it, which does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Reason of natural Unions; and yet is no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Objection against Self-consoiousness, than against the most approved Definition of a Person: For if with <hi>Boethius,</hi> you define a Person to be <hi>substantia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividua naturae rationabilis;</hi> an individual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a rational Nature, the Humane Nature of Christ, which is an individual Substance of a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Nature, and yet no Person is an equal Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against it; and let the Animadverter try, how, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Definition, <hi>he can keep off the Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of</hi> Nestorius, <hi>that there are Two distinct Persons in Christ:</hi> And if <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> escape as well as any other formal Reason of Personality, I believe the Dean desires no more; and yet he needs not this, for he no where makes <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> the formal Reason of Personality, but only of the Unity and Distinction of a Mind or Spirit; and I hope he will grant the Humane Nature of Christ to be One, and to be distinct and separated by <hi>Self-consciousness,</hi> from all other particular Humane Natures, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:100659:23"/>The short Answer is this: That Self-consciousness makes a Mind or Spirit one with it self, and distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes or separates it from all other Minds or Spirits, and such a distinct and separate Self-conscious Mind is a natural Person, unless its own natural Personality be swallowed up in a Personal Union to a Superiour Mind. For this is the Account the Dean gives of a personal Union, when Two Natures are united into One Person, they must be so united, that the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Nature have the Government of the whole<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 268.</note> Person, which is necessary to make them One Agent, without which there cannot be One Person; and that there be One Consciousness in the whole: Of which more presently.</p>
            <p>3. His third Argument is draw out to a great length, but may be answered in a few Words, becuse it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds upon the same Mistake, and is nothing to the purpose. <hi>It is taken from the Soul of Man in a State</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anim. p. 73<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>of Separation from the Body; that the Soul in a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate State is conscious to it self of all its own internal Acts or Motions—and yet the Soul in such a State is not a Person. And therefore Self-consciousness is not the formal Reason of Personality.</hi> But whether the Soul be a Person or no Person, in the Body or out of the Body, is nothing at all to the present Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie: If the Soul and all other Spirits are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One with themselves, and separated from all other Souls and Spirits by Self-consciousness; this is all the Dean desires, and all that his Hypothesis needs. And the Animadverter may philosophize as he pleases a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Personalities. The Truth is, to do him right, he is a very notable Man, if he can draw you into a School-question, for he can make a shift to read and transcribe, but he hates a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100659:24"/>
at his Heart, which is none of his Talent, for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires thinking; put him out of his way, and he is undone, which makes him so angry at the Dean for not speaking the School-Language, nor confining himself to known Terms of Art, which he has a great deal to say of, whether he understands them or not: and because the Dean would not do this himself, he has done it for him, and put his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into School-Terms, and made <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> the <hi>formal Reason of Personality,</hi> and on my Word has disputed very notably against it, and it is pity Three such dead-doing Arguments should be lost for want of the <hi>formal Reason of Personality;</hi> and yet there is no help for it, he must begin all again, and try how he can prove, that the Unity of a Mind, and its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction from all other Minds, does not consist in Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consciousness; and if he can prove this, then the Dean is a lost Man for ever, and must be contented to follow his Triumphant Chariot.</p>
            <p>But yet, whether this Question of the Soul's being a Person, or no Person, serve the purpose of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Dispute or not, it abundantly serves the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter's charitable purpose (which is the only purpose of his writing this Book) to expose the Dean; and therefore though the Matter is not worth disputing, I shall make some short Reflections on it.</p>
            <p>The Dean has upon another occasion asserted, That <hi>a Soul without a vital Union to a Humane Body is a Person:</hi> In opposition to this the Animadverter as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, That <hi>the Soul of Man is not a Person, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anim. p. 74.</note> 
               <hi>in its Conjunction with the Body, nor its Separation from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:100659:24"/>The Foundation of his Arguments, such as they are, is a very unphilosophical and senceless Mistake, that because Man consists of Soul and Body (which he very undeniably proves from the <hi>Athanasian Creed</hi>) therefore the Personality too must be divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Soul and Body, that the Soul is but part of the Person, as it is part of the Man, and then the Soul neither in nor out of the Body, can be the Person, because a part can't be the whole, <hi>Quod erat demonstrandum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I readily grant, That <hi>the Person of a Man,</hi> as it is used in common Speech to signifie a Man, must include both Soul and Body, as the constituent Parts of a Humane Person; but when we enquire into the strict Notion of Personality, that must be a simple uncompounded thing, as indivisible as self is, which cannot consist of Parts, which may be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from each other, that one part of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may live and the other die; for though there are Two Natures, there is but One Person, and the same One Person cannot both live and die at the same time.</p>
            <p>This is a very pleasant Notion, if well consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of the two parts of Personality, as there are two Parts of a Man, Soul and Body; for unless there be two Personalities as well as two Natures, the two Natures cannot be two Parts of the one Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Personality, as they are the Parts of a Man: It is impossible to prove from Two Natures, that there are Two Parts of Personality, unless each Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has a Personality of its own, the Personality of the Body, and the Personality of the Soul, united into the One Personality of the Man; for nothing can be a part of Personality, which has nothing of Personality it self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:100659:25"/>Will the Animadverter then venture to attribute any Personality to the Body, as he must do, if he makes it part of the Personality? This will be a little worse than (what he so rares the Dean for) calling a <hi>Beast</hi> a <hi>Person,</hi> tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Dean gave notice of the impropriety of the Expression, and used it only by way of allusion and accommodation, the better to represent the Union of Two Natures into One Person, which are Two Persons, or something as like Two Persons as their Natures will permit, when they subsist apart. And I should have thought such a severe Censurer should have been more Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious than to have attributed any part of Personality to the Body in the same Chapter, wherein he so civilly Schools the Dean for seeming to attribute Personality to a Beast, when Personality belongs only to a reasonable Nature, and Beasts have no Reason; which is more than he knows, (for why may not Beasts have some Reason, as well as some Men have such brutish Passions) and more than as Wise Men as himself think to be true; for there are various degrees of Reason; and where ever there is a conscious Life, there must be some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of it, and that entitles them to as much share in Personality as they have in Reason; but no Man will pretend, that a Humane Body, though united to a reasonable Soul, has any Reason, or any Sence either, though, by its Vital Union to the Soul, the Soul feels all the Impressions made on the Body.</p>
            <p>And this brings us to a fair State, and an easie decision of this Question; for if Personality belongs only to a reasonable Nature, it is certain, that the Soul makes or constitutes the Person; or, if I may so speak, is the Center of Personality, whatever
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100659:25"/>
else be vitally united to it, and by such a vital Union is incorporated into the same Person. If there be but one principle of Reason, Sensation, and a conscious Life, that is the Person; for a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is <hi>the individual Substance of a Rational Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But is not a Humane Body part of the Person to whom it belongs? <hi>Answ.</hi> It is part of the Man, and in that Sence part of the Person, but no part of the Personality; that is, it does not make the Person, but is taken into the Person by a vital Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so becomes part of the Man, and part of the Person, as belonging to it.</p>
            <p>I am of opinion, notwithstanding the Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's <hi>Animus &amp; Anima,</hi> that there is but one Soul or Mind, or Spirit in Man, which performs all the Offices of a Rational and Animal Life, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands, reasons, wills, and feels all the Impressions of the Body, whether Pain or Pleasure, though with respect to such different Offices and Powers, it may be of some use, both in Philosophy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, to call it by different Names. Now, if all Life, Reason, Sensation, be only in the Soul, there must be the whole Personality, though the Soul, when united to a Body, is not the whole Person; for the Person reaches as far as the Self-conscious Life does by a Vital Union, but the Personality is whole and entire in the Principle of a Rational Life, and is neither more nor less a Person, though by vital Unions, or a dissolution of them, more or less may belong to the Person: We may find some resemblance of this in Works of Art: Whether you add or take away some Wheels from a Clock, it is the same Clock still, while there is the same Spring of Motion, though it communicates Motion to more
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100659:26"/>
or fewer Wheels. And thus the Body becomes One Person with the Soul, neither by <hi>an hypostatical Union,</hi> which is the swallowing up a natural Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonality in its Union with a superior Person, which can never be between two Beings, one of which by Nature is no Person, as the Body it self is not, and cannot be: Nor by <hi>the Body being joyned with the Soul, as one part, joyntly concurring with another, to the composition of the whole Person;</hi> which is the Animadverter's way, and a very absurd one, as you have already heard, to talk of a compounded Personality; but there is another way which he never thought of, and that is, by a vital Union, which makes the Body part of it self, without add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its own Personality, by making all bodily Sensations its own. And thus, though the Soul be an entire Person, a Man, when united to a Body<note place="margin">Animad. <hi>p.</hi> 75.</note> is not <hi>an imperfect, accidental Compound, which,</hi> he says, <hi>Philosophy calls unum per accidens, a thing made up of two such Beings as cannot perfectly coalesce and unite into One;</hi> for his own beloved Philosophy never called things vitally united, <hi>unum per acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> and I would desire him to inform us, how two things can more perfectly <hi>coalesce</hi> than in One Life.</p>
            <p>However, by the power of Metaphysicks he can prove, That if the Soul be an entire Person, a Man must be an imperfect accidental compound: <hi>For a compleat Being (as every Person essentially is) having received the utmost degree of Subsistence, which its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can give it, if it comes afterward to be compounded with another Being, whether compleat or incompleat, it must necessarily make such a loose unnatural Union and Composition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:100659:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>I do not wonder he is so fond of School-Terms, for they serve him very often instead of Sence; but before I particularly consider them, by his good leave, I must ask him a Question or two: Whether the Divine <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> or <hi>Word</hi> before the Incarnation were <hi>a compleat Being,</hi> as he must be, if he be the second Person in the Trinity, for <hi>every Person,</hi> he says, <hi>is essentially a compleat Being;</hi> and then, whether he will have the Humane Nature <hi>a compleat or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleat Being,</hi> the Question is, Whether the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Union of the Humane Nature to the Divine Word, <hi>be necessarily such a loose unnatural Union and Composition.</hi> To say, That this is not a natural Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to say, That the Divine and Humane Nature are not united into One Person in Christ; for I take a Union of Natures to be a natural Union, by what Power soever it be done; at least so far, that there is no natural repugnancy to such an Union, for then no Power could do it; and therefore, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this bold assertion, either the Hypostatical Union must be loose and unnatural, or if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Humane Nature be perfectly united into One Person, then the Union of two compleat Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings does not <hi>necessarily make such a loose unnatural Union and Composition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to quit these School-Terms, and to speak what we understand our selves, and what others may understand; the Soul may be a compleat and perfect Person, and not a perfect Man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, notwithstanding it is a compleat Being, may require a vital Union to a Humane Body, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect its Nature: That is a perfect Humane Person, which has entirely in it self all the Powers which are essential to a Humane Person, such as Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100659:27"/>
Will, and Sensation, which are as entire and perfect in the Soul without the Body, as with it, though some of them either cannot act at all, or at least not so perfectly, without a vital Union to the Body, which conveys external Impressions, and by them excites internal Sensations in the Soul.</p>
            <p>To represent this plainly, let us consider a Soul vitally united to a Body, but to such a Body whose Organs are so indisposed for Sensation, that the Man can neither See nor Hear, nor Taste, nor Smell; but only just lives and breathes, you will not say, this is a perfect Man; but the Animadverter himself will acknowledge him to be a perfect Person, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Body and Soul; but if a compleat Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may not be a compleat and perfect Man, then the formal Reason of Personality, and the natural Perfection of a Man are two things; and though the vital Union of Soul and Body make a perfect Man, yet the whole entire Personality must be in the Soul, if a Man be a perfect Person, who is united to a Body, which is worse than none: For where there is a perfect Humane Person, there must be the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Principle of all Humane Actions, which can be no where but in the Soul, when the Body is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for all the Actions of a Rational or Sensitive Life, which is a much more imperfect State than to be out of the Body, if we believe, that the Soul lives and acts when separated from the Body. Something in the Shape and Figure of a Man, without the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Powers of Reason and Sensation, would very improperly be called a Man, or a Humane Person; and therefore we must confess, that the Soul, which under all these natural Impediments of acting, has
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100659:27"/>
still these natural Powers to be the Person, or there can be none. The Soul is the Person, the Body only the Organ or Instrument, which, at least in this state of Union, is necessary to the exercise of our natural Powers, both of Reason and Sensation; but whatever change there be in the Body, the Person is the same still, which could not be, were the Body part of the Person, for then the change of the Body would be a partial Change of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son too; and yet our Bodies are in a perpetual Flux, and change every day; some Atoms fly away, and others are united to us; that we are no more the same for a Month or a Year, than a River is, whose Waters perpetually flow and change their place; and yet we feel our selves to be the same Persons still; and therefore certainly these fluid Atoms, of which our Bodies are composed, are no part of our Personality, though they belong to our Persons, while they are vitally united to our Souls. Suppose it were possible, that the Souls of <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> could change Bodies, that the Soul of <hi>Iohn</hi> should be vitally united to the Body of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Soul of <hi>Peter</hi> vitally united to the Body of <hi>Iohn,</hi> I would ask the Animadverter, whether he thinks, that such a change of Bodies would make any change in their Persons? Whether <hi>Iohn</hi> would not as much feel himself to be <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> to be <hi>Peter</hi> as ever they did? I believe, indeed, an innocent, good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured Soul would not be willing to venture a Change of Bodies with every Body, for fear of some Moral Infection, but the natural Person would be the same; for nothing makes any Body ours, but a vital Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and whose Body soever it was before, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes our own, when our Soul informs it, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100659:28"/>
feels the Impressions of it. Now, if the Soul be the Person, when united to the Body, it can't lose its Personality by going out of it; nay, if the Soul can subsist in separation from the Body, and live, and perform all the Actions of a Rational Nature, it must be a Person, if an individual subsisting Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Nature is a Person, and if it be not, I would know what to call it. But this Animadverter is a very Wagg, and Banters the poor Dean most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully, and demonstrates beyond all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that <hi>The Soul, in a State of Separation, can't be a Person, because it is neither the same Person, which the Man himself was while he was living, and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Animad. <hi>p.</hi> 76.</note> 
               <hi>in the Body, nor another Person;</hi> and therefore it can be no Person. The wording of this is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable, and worthy of the Wit and Subtilty of its Author: <hi>If the Soul in such a State</hi> (of Separation) <hi>be a Person, it is either the same Person which the Man himself was, while he was Living, and in the Body:</hi> Pray, what is this Person, which he calls the <hi>Man himself,</hi> which <hi>lives in the Body?</hi> I hope, it is not the <hi>Body</hi> that <hi>lives in the Body,</hi> and then I know no <hi>Man himself,</hi> nor <hi>Person,</hi> that <hi>lives in the Body,</hi> but only the Soul; and if it be the same Soul that lives out of the Body, that lives in it, it is the same Person, the same Man himself in a state of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which lived in the Body. And what does he mean by <hi>the same Person, which the Man himself was, while living?</hi> For does the Man and his Person die? Then the Man is not Immortal, and if the Man and his Person live, when the Body dies, then the Soul is the Man and the Person, and the very same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son out of the Body that it was in it. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> thought, when, speaking of himself, and his being
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100659:28"/>
taken up into the Third Heavens, he thus expresses it. <hi>I knew a Man in Christ fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell, or whether out of the body, I cannot tell, God knoweth) such an one caught up into the third Heavens,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2. but whether in the Body, or out of the Body, which he did not know, yet he knew himself to be the same Man, and the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that ever he was.</p>
            <p>But the Animadverter very learnedly proves, That the Soul out of the Body cannot be the same Person with the Man, because the Soul is not the Soul and Body too, as the Man is when the Soul and Body are united; which is well observed, That the Soul is not the Body, nor a part the whole: but yet if the Personality be not compounded of Soul and Body, the Soul may be the whole and same Person in the Body, and out of it.</p>
            <p>There is no need then to say, That the Soul in a State of Separation is another Person, than the Man himself is while Soul and Body are united; though this would serve the Dean's purpose as well, if the Soul be but a Person, and be a distinct Person by Self-consciousness: And should the Dean prove cross, and say this, the Animadverter could not help himself; for as for his <hi>absurd Consequence,</hi> viz. <hi>That it is One Person that lives well or ill in this World, to wit, the Man himself while he was perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the Body,</hi> which (by the way) is down-right Nonsence, if the Person of the Man be Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, though we confess the Body belongs to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, when united to his Soul, for <hi>the personal Presence of the Man in the Body,</hi> must distinguish the Person of the Man from the Body, in which he is <hi>personally</hi> present, and supposes, that the same Man at other
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100659:29"/>
times may not be <hi>personally</hi> present in the Body; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he thinks it a great Absurdity, That <hi>One Person should live well or ill in this World and another Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son pass out of the Body into Heaven or Hell, there to be rewarded or punished, (at least till the Resurrection)</hi> (and I suppose at longest too, unless it can be another Person when reunited to the Body, as well as when separated from it) <hi>for what that other Person had done well or ill upon Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, let this be as absurd as it will, the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter must say it, or say something as absurd, unless he will allow a Soul in a State of Separation to be the same Person that it was in the Body, or deny the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Rewards and Punishments of good and bad Men till the Resurrection. For if the Soul be a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and not the same, then one Person sins and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suffers. If a Man be a Person, and the Soul no Person, then the Person sins, and that which is no Person suffers: If a Man be a whole Person; and the Soul only part of the Person, then the whole Sins, and a part suffers for the whole. Let him choose which he thinks <hi>looks most agreeable to the Principles of Reason and Divinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But does this profound Philosopher indeed think, that the Body either sins or suffers? The Soul sins in and by the Body, and feels Pain or Pleasure from bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Impressions; and therefore as the Body may be made the Instrument of Vertue or Vice, so it may be the Instrument of Rewards and Punishments; but Vertue or Vice is seated only in the Soul, and it is the Soul only that can be happy or miserable, rewarded or punished, in or out of the Body, and therefore there is no danger, that one should sin, and another suffer, though the Soul sins in the Body, and suffers out of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:100659:29"/>But it is worth observing how notably he winds up his Argument. <hi>If it be intolerably absurd (as no doubt it is) That the Soul in the other World should not be responsible for what the Man himself in Person had done in this:</hi> What then? One would expect the Conclusion should be, then <hi>the Soul is the Man himself in Person.</hi> But this he durst not say, because it was to un-say all he had said; and he durst not say the contrary, for that is the Absurdity he is exposing, that One, who is not the <hi>Man himself, should suffer for what the Man himself did:</hi> and therefore he lets them both slip, and is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad to get rid of them, and concludes safely; <hi>Then it is altogether as absurd and intolerable, for any one to represent and speak of these things under such Terms and Notions, as must necessarily throw all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course and Reasoning about them into Paradox and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion;</hi> which is to bilk a Conclusion, and to pay a rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning by running out at the Back-door. He adds: <hi>And indeed to me the Soul's thus changing its State forwards and backwards from one manner of subsisting to another, looks very odd and unnatural.</hi> What does he mean by this? That it is <hi>odd and unnatural,</hi> that the Soul should live in the Body and out of the Body, and then return into the Body again? And is not this so? Does not the Soul first live in the Body, and after what we call Death, live out of the Body, and shall it not be reunited to the Body again at the Resurrection? And how does this change the Soul's <hi>manner of subsisting,</hi> any more than the Body changes its manner of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting, when it is naked and cloathed? To live in the Body and out of the Body, are Two different States of Life, but the Soul subsists still in the same manner, for it owes not its Subsistence to the Body, and can neither subsist more nor less in or out of the Body;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100659:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for I know no degrees of Subsistence in the Soul, though there are of Life and Action; what is, is, and what subsists continues to be.</p>
            <p>But that which is <hi>so odd and unnatural</hi> is, <hi>that from an incompleat State in the Body, it should pass to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal and compleat State out of the Body (which State is yet praeternatural to it) and then fall back into an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat State again by its re-union to the Body at the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection (which yet one would think, should rather improve our principal Parts, in all respects, not meerly relating to the Animal Life, as the bare Subsistence of them, I am sure, does not.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is hard to guess the meaning of such Gypsie-Cant, and therefore I hope you and he will pardon me if I mistake, for I will do my best. By the Soul's <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleat State in the Body,</hi> I suppose, he means, That the Soul in the Body is <hi>an incompleat Person,</hi> and by the <hi>personal compleat State out of the Body,</hi> that the Soul is <hi>a compleat Person out of the Body;</hi> this indeed sounds somewhat <hi>odd and unnatural;</hi> but does he know any Man who says, that the Soul is an <hi>incompleat Person in the Body,</hi> and a <hi>compleat Person out of the Body?</hi> or who calls this the <hi>incompleat</hi> and the <hi>compleat State of the Soul?</hi> Those who affirm the Soul to be the Person, say, That it is the same Person in the Body, and out of it, but that it lives in different States in the Body and out of it; and that its State in this mortal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is the most imperfect State a reasonable Soul can live in; That the State of the Soul in separation from the Body, is to good Men a more perfect and compleat, because a more happy State, and therefore not <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural,</hi> which can never be a more happy State; and that the re-union of the Soul to an immortal spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Body at the Resurrection, is the most compleat and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100659:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
perfect State of all: So that here is no such <hi>unnatural change</hi> as he dreams of, from an <hi>incompleat to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat praeternatural State</hi> (which is Nonsence) and then back again to an <hi>incompleat State at the Resurrection,</hi> which so turned his own Stomach, (though not very squeamish) that he was glad to qualifie it with a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis, which I defie any Man to make Sence of: But the natural progress of the Soul in this lapsed State is from a less perfect to a more perfect, and from that to the most perfect State of Life; which to me is proof enough that the Soul is the Person, and fitted by Nature to live in all these different States, or it is impossible to prove <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Iohn</hi> to be the same Men in these different States.</p>
            <p>At length the Animadverter grew sensible,<note place="margin">Animad. p. 48.</note> that it sounds very absurdly to say, That the Soul in a State of Separation is but <hi>part of the Person,</hi> when it subsists by it self, not <hi>in any Compound,</hi> and feels it self to be the same, and lives and acts in a more perfect and happy State, than when it lived in a mortal Body, and therefore he fences against these Two Objections (which are stronger, when they are put into one) as well as he can.</p>
            <p>He says, the Soul <hi>in a State of Separation</hi> is but part of the Person, the whole of which is a compound of Soul and Body, because of <hi>its essential relation to a Compound.</hi> But what is this <hi>Compound</hi> which the Soul is <hi>essentially related to?</hi> not the Body I hope, for the Body is no more the Compound, than the Soul: Is it then the Man? and where is this Man that the Soul is essentially related to? Does he then mean, that it is essential to the Soul to live in an earthly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? Then it cannot live in a State of Separation. If it be of the Essence of the Soul to live in the Body,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100659:31"/>
it is evident, That it can never live out of it; and if it be not essential, then the Soul may be a whole entire Person, when it subsists separate from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But the Soul <hi>by its original Designation</hi> is related to the Body; What? so that it cannot live without it, and never should live without it? if not, this <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Designation,</hi> does not prove an <hi>essential Relation:</hi> But <hi>it has a natural Aptitude to be an Ingredient in the Constitution of a Compound.</hi> What does he mean by the Soul's <hi>being an Ingredient in a Compound?</hi> Is the Soul and Body mixed and blended together to make a Man? Is it the same thing to be a part of the whole, and to be an <hi>Ingredient in a Compound?</hi> Well, but the Soul has <hi>a natural Aptitude</hi> to live in a Body; and so it has to live out of the Body; and what then? then the Soul, which is the same Person still, is naturally fitted to live in different States; and then its <hi>Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to an <hi>earthly Body</hi> is not essential to it, whatever <hi>strong Appetite and Inclination,</hi> as he says, <hi>it retains to return and be re-united to the Body;</hi> which, whoever says it, no Man can know; and if it be true of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Souls, who were wholly immersed in Sense, is demonstratively false of all holy and pure Spirits, who are in a great measure weaned from this Body, while they live in it, and rejoyce at their Deliverance when they escape safe out of it, who, with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> desire <hi>to be absent from the Body, and to be present with the Lord.</hi> Holy Souls indeed in a State of Separation do ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desire the Completion of their Happiness in the Resurrection of their Bodies, but not to be re-united to these vile, earthly, corruptible Bodies, but to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, immortal, incorruptible Bodies, when Christ shall at his Appearance <hi>change our vile Bodies, and make them like to his own most glorious Body;</hi> which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100659:31"/>
though they had every individual Atome, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to them before, are yet in their Nature and Constitution no more the same Bodies, than Earth and Heaven are the same. But <hi>the Spirits of just Men made perfect</hi> are in a more perfect State of Life and Happiness out of these Bodies than they enjoyed in them, and therefore are more perfect Persons too, are more perfectly themselves, and enjoy themselves more perfectly, and therefore are in a State more agreeable to the Perfection of their Natures (and that I take to be <hi>a natural State</hi>) than living in these Bodies.</p>
            <p>The Animadverter will not allow this to be <hi>a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but Supernatural Perfection, which relates only to the Consummation of their Graces, and not to the manner of their Subsistence.</hi> But is not <hi>the Perfection of our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> the Perfection of Humane Nature? And is not the Perfection of Nature, <hi>a natural Perfection?</hi> And if the Soul be more perfect in a State of Separation, is not this a <hi>more perfect manner of Subsistence?</hi> This might have shamed the Animadverter had he had a little more Consideration and less Confidence, to deny the Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality of the Soul, which can subsist and act, and be more perfect and happy out of the Body; which shews, that to be in the Body, or out of it, does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Personality, but the different States wherein the same Person lives.</p>
            <p>To proceed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Dean had upon another occasion said, That <hi>all the Sufferings and Actions of the Body are attributed to the Man, though the Soul is the Person, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the Superiour and Governing Power, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes the Person.</hi> This I should have thought very true and safe, but the Animadverter has made very tragical Work with it. He says, That this proves<note place="margin">Pag. 79.</note> the quite contrary, That <hi>the Man himself, to whom</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:100659:32"/>
               <hi>these personal Acts are ascribed, must indeed be the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and that for the same Reason also the Soul cannot be so.</hi> But does the Dean any where deny, That the Man, as consisting of Soul and Body, is a Humane Person? or, when united to a Body, affirm, that the Soul is the whole Person? He says indeed, That the Soul is the seat of Personality, the only Principle of Reason, Sensation, and a Conscious life, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently in a State of Separation is the Person, and when united to the Body constitutes the Person, and therefore may both be <hi>the Person, and constitute the Person.</hi> When a Body is vitally united to a Soul, Soul and Body are but One Person, because they are but One voluntary Agent, and have but One Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Life; but it is the Soul constitutes the Person, as being the Principle of all personal Acts, Sensations and Passions which the Body is only the Instrument of, but being a vital Instrument is united to the Person, and becomes One Person with the Soul; for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son reaches as far as the same Conscious Life does; but it is only this vital Union to the Soul, which receives the Body into the Unity of the same Person, not as part of the Person, but as an animated Instrument of Life and Action, which as it were, cements Soul and Body into One Person. A Soul vitally united to a Body, is an <hi>embodied</hi> Person, in a State of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration it is the same Person still, but without a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which makes a great change in its Sensations, and manner of acting, but no more changes the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, than the Man would be changed cloathed or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathed, were his Cloths as vitally united to his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as his Body is to his Soul. This is plain Sence; and if the Animadverter knows not how to reduce it to Terms of Art, I cannot help it. <hi>The Soul,</hi> I
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100659:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
grant, as he wisely observes, <hi>Cannot constitute the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 80.</note> 
               <hi>Person efficiently, by Creation or Generation,</hi> nor <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally</hi> as <hi>a constituent part,</hi> for the Soul is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly part of the Person, but the Soul constitutes an embodied Person, by living and acting in the Body, which unites Soul and Body into one Life, and that makes one embodied Person, or Soul and Body one Man. And now, as for those Questions, which, with so much Triumph and Scorn he asks the Dean, I leave to himself to Answer them, and to you to laugh at them. The rest of this Chapter is nothing but Ignorance and Raving, and has been answered already.</p>
            <p>If you will Pardon this long excursion about the Personality of the Soul, which is nothing at all to the present Controversie, having given you this one sufficient taste of the Wit and Philosophy of the Animadverter and his great exactness in speaking and reasoning, I promise you to let pass an hundred other Absurdities and Fooleries, and to make shorter Work with him, without letting slip any Argument, when I can find it.</p>
            <p>The Title of his Fourth Chapter is an Answer to<note place="margin">Anim. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 90.</note> it self, and proves, That it is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For he undertakes to prove, That <hi>Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness is not the formal Reason of Personality in the Three Persons of the blessed Trinity,</hi> nor does the Dean say it is. The Question is only this, whether Three <hi>Self-consciousnesses</hi> do not prove Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, each of which is thus Self-conscious to himself, to be really distinct from each other? Whether Three Persons who feel themselves to be themselves, and not to be each other, are not Three really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Persons? This mistake has been so fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100659:33"/>
already, that I need say no more of it; for the Mistake is the same, and the Answer is the same, when applied to finite or infinite Persons.</p>
            <p>To keep my Word with you, I shall take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice at present of his Nine Considerations, which are ushered in with a kind of Mathematical Pomp, as if we were to expect nothing less than demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration; when I see what end they serve, they shall be examined. But now for his Arguments, which will be answered in almost as few Lines, as they take up Pages in the Animadversions; for when the Question is mistaken, all Arguments are lost.</p>
            <p>Arg. 1. <hi>No Personal Act can be the formal Reason</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 94.</note> 
               <hi>of Personality in the Person whose Act it is</hi> (nor, I suppose, in the Person whose Act it is not) <hi>But Self-consciousness is a Personal Act, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the formal Reason,</hi> &amp;c. This Argument we have met with, and answered before; The Dean neither considered <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> as <hi>a personal Act,</hi> nor assigned it as the <hi>formal Reason of Personality;</hi> and yet if we consider <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> as a <hi>Personal Act,</hi> though it cannot make the Person, yet it distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes one Person from another; by this actual <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> every Person feels himself to be himself, and not to be another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Proceeds upon the same mistake, as to <hi>the formal reason of Personality,</hi> but has some peculiar Absurdities of its own; for he proves, That <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consciousness</hi> can't make a Person, because it can't make the Relations, which distinct Persons stand in to each other. That <hi>Self consciousness</hi> can't make a Father, because it can't beget a Son: For this is the Summ of his Argument, That the Three Persons in the Trinity are related to each other, as Father, Son,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100659:33"/>
and Holy Ghost; and therefore <hi>Self-consciousness,</hi> which is an absolute and <hi>irrelative thing</hi> cannot be the formal Reason of Personality, because it is not the formal Reason of these Relations: As if (let the formal Reason of Personality be what it will) the <hi>fundamentum relationis,</hi> or the foundation of the Relation between Persons, and the formal Reason of Personality were the same thing: Does that which makes <hi>Iohn</hi> a Person, make him a Father, or that which makes <hi>Peter</hi> a Person, make him a Son?</p>
            <p>This, I suppose, will be acknowledged very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd in Humane Persons, where every Person has <hi>a distinct absolute Nature</hi> to be the subject of these Relations, for then the Personality and the Relation must differ; but it is otherwise with the <hi>Persons of the Trinity,</hi> whose <hi>Personalities</hi> are meer <hi>Relations.</hi> But with the Animadverter's good leave, this makes no difference: In what Sence the Divine Persons are <hi>Relatives</hi> or <hi>Relations,</hi> I have already explained; That they subsist relatively to each other, as the whole Subsistence of the Image is relative to its Prototype; but the same Divine Nature which sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists distinctly in each of them, is a compleat, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Nature, and <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> may distinguish the same Nature into different Persons, though they subsist in relation to each other: For has the Person and his Relation the same Notion and formal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? Is the Father his Paternity, the Son his Filiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Holy Ghost his Procession? if not, then the formal Reason of Personality in the Father and Son, differs from the Foundation of the Relation between Father and Son; and <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> might be the formal Reason of the Personality, though not of the Relation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:100659:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>But, have each of these Three Persons, who, as he says, are <hi>purely Relative,</hi> a Self-consciousness of their own, that the Father knows himself to be the Father, and not the Son; and the Son knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be the Son, and not the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This distinguishes the Persons, and proves them to be really distinct, which is all the Dean desires.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. His next Argument is just as much to the<note place="margin">Pag. 101.</note> purpose as the former. <hi>If Self-consciousness be the formal Reason of Personality in the Three Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, then there is no repugnancy in the Nature and Reason of the thing it self, but that there might be Three Thousand Persons in the Deity, as well as Three.</hi> Now, had the Dean said, That <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> made the <hi>Trinity,</hi> this had been a notable Argument, but, I hope, <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> may distinguish the Three Persons in the Trinity, and prove them to be Three really distinct Persons, though there be but Three, and not Three Thousand Persons in the Godhead. Though it be not repugnant to the Nature of <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consciousness,</hi> it may be repugnant to the Nature of the Deity, that there should be more than Three Persons in the Godhead. Self-consciousness proves the distinction, though it does not limit the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Persons, which no Man ever dreamt of, and none but an ingenious Blunderer, whose subtilty is too great for his Understanding, could ever have thought of.</p>
            <p>And yet this Argument is as very a <hi>Non-sequitur</hi> as ever I met with; for suppose <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> were <hi>the formal Reason of Personality,</hi> how does it follow, that <hi>there may be Three Thousand Persons in the Deity;</hi> for does <hi>the formal Reason of Personality</hi> make or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the number of Persons? The Nature of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100659:34"/>
thing, and the Will of the Maker may, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the formal Reason of Personality, there can be no more Persons than Nature will admit; and if the eternal, uncreated Nature will admit but of Three Persons, it is impossible that <hi>Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness,</hi> tho' it were the formal Reason of Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality could make more; for there can be no more when the Divine Nature will admit but of Three Self-Conscious Persons, though a created Nature will admit of as many as God pleases to make. In short, that which naturally distinguishes Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons from each other, would distinguish Three Thousand, if there were so many; but does not prove, That there may be Three Thousand Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the Godhead; for though it is no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the distinction of Persons, by <hi>Self-conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> that there should be Three Thousand, yet it may be a contradiction to the Perfection of the Divine Nature, because every Divine Person is eternal, and whatever is eternal doth necessarily exist; and therefore if there be but Three Divine Persons, Father, Son and Holy Ghost, there never can be, nor ever could have been more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. His fourth and last Argument is a great Master-piece of profound Reason and Judgment. <hi>If Three distinct Self-consciousnesses formally constitute</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 104.</note> 
               <hi>Three distinct Personalities, then Three distinct Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complacencies will constitute Three distinct Personalities too.</hi> He might as well have added Self-Love, and Self-Displeasure, and Self-Condemnation, and as many <hi>Selfs</hi> as he could think of, only the Danger then was, That the Personality should alter with the Judgment or Passion, that the Person should not be the same, when he is pleased and displeased, when he applauds and acquits, or condemns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100659:35"/>
Had he added <hi>Self-conscious</hi> to all this; as a <hi>Self-conscious complacency</hi> (for then it is the same thing, whether <hi>Self</hi> or any other Being be the object of the complacency) a <hi>Self-conscious</hi> Love, or Fear, or Hatred, or Desire, every one of these Acts would prove a distinct Person, because they are the Acts of Self-consciousness, which distinguish one Person from another, as every Act of Reason proves a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Creature, because it is the exercise of Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onality; but yet no Man will say, that it is every Act, but the principle of Reason, which makes a reasonable Creature; and no more does any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Act, but the principle of Self-consciousness, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish between Self-conscious Persons, much less such Acts as may be separated from the Person, as, I doubt, <hi>Self-complacency</hi> is from Damned Spirits, or if he will not allow Souls to be Persons, as it will be from Damned Men. He has drawn this Argument out to such a length, and has so many pretty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, that I have much ado to keep my word with you, but let him go like a wrangling Wit as he is, and I'll go on.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> makes a Person one with it self, and distinguishes it from all other Persons, so the Dean apprehends, That a natural <hi>Mutual-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness</hi> makes Three Persons as naturally One, as it is possible for Three to be One; and that is the Unity of the Godhead, not the Unity of One Person, but the Unity of Three, or a <hi>Trinity in Unity:</hi> And this is his next Attempt, to prove, That the Unity of Three Divine Persons in the Godhead can't consist in <hi>Mutual-consciousness.</hi> He proceeds upon the same mistake, and therefore the same Answer will serve: By <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> he understood, as you have seen, the acts of <hi>Self-consciousness,</hi> and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100659:35"/>
then the act Supposing a Person could not be the formal Reason of Personality; and thus by <hi>Mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consciousness</hi> he understands the Acts of <hi>Mutual-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness,</hi> which supposes the Unity of Nature, and therefore cannot be the cause or reason of it; now, though I know not of what use that Dispute is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>the Priority of Being, and the first Modes and Affections of it to any Act of Knowledge,</hi> or any other Acts; especially when we speak of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which we know has no Modes and Affections, no Priority so much as in Conception, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive aright of him, between his Being, and a pure and simple Act; yet I will not put the Animadverter out of his way, when there is no need of it, an easie obvious distinction between the Principle and the Act answers all: A Self-conscious Principle, without which we can't conceive a Mind, makes a Mind one with it self, and distinguishes it from all other Minds, and by the Acts of <hi>Self-consciousness,</hi> which suppose the Principle, every Mind feels it self to be One, and distinguished from all others: And thus the natural Principle of <hi>Mutual-consciousness</hi> between Three Persons unites them inseparably in One Nature, and <hi>the Acts of Mutual-consciousness</hi> are the Acts of Unity, whereby they know and feel themselves to be essentially in each other, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be essentially One: Just as we consider <hi>Reason,</hi> either as the Principle or as the Act, the first constitutes a reasonable Nature, the second is the actual exercise of Reason; and thus all his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vanish like Smoak, rise in a dark Cloud, but immediately disperse and are seen no more, till they return, as such Vapours use to do, in Thunder and Lightning, or some threatning Storm.</p>
            <p>1. His first Argument is this. <hi>No Act of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 107.</note>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:100659:36"/>
               <hi>can be the formal Reason of an Unity of Nature in the Persons of the blessed Trinity: But an Act of Mutual-consciousness is an Act of Knowledge.</hi> Ergo. Nothing will satisfie the Animadverter but <hi>formal Reasons,</hi> whereas the Dean no where asserts, That <hi>Mutual-consciousness</hi> is the formal Reason of this U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but that Three Persons, who are thus <hi>Mutually<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conscious</hi> to each other, must be essentially One; nor does the Dean place this Unity in an <hi>Act of Mutual-consciousness,</hi> which signifies the Principle as well as the Act, and then <hi>Mutual-consciousness</hi> (if it were no more than Knowledge, of which presently) must not be considered as <hi>an Act of Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Arg. 2. <hi>If Unity of Nature in the Divine Persons be the Cause, Reason, or Principle of Mutual-conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the said Persons, then their Mutual-consciousness is not the Cause or Reason of the Unity of their Nature; but the former is true, and therefore the latter is so too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If by this he means, That these Divine Persons could not be thus <hi>Mutually conscious,</hi> except they were essentially One, it is true, but nothing to the purpose, for they may be thus essentially One by <hi>Mutual-consciousness,</hi> or <hi>Mutual-consciousness</hi> may be essential to this Unity, though they could not be thus actually conscious to each other, unless they were thus united, as to have and to feel each other in themselves. If by <hi>the Unity of Nature in the Divine Persons,</hi> he means the Sameness and <hi>Homoousiotes</hi> of Nature; this I grant is a necessary Foundation for Mutual-consciousness, without which they could not be One, nor mutually conscious to each other; but I deny that it is the <hi>immediate</hi> Cause, Reason, or Principle of Mutual-consciousness: The ancient Fathers were very sensible, That when the same Nature subsisted distinctly in Three distinct Persons,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100659:36"/>
the meer <hi>Sameness</hi> and <hi>Homoousiotes</hi> of Nature could not make this essential Unity; and therefore they added, their <hi>Perichoresis</hi> or the mutual <hi>In-being</hi> of these Divine Persons in each other, which the Dean calls <hi>Mutual-consciousness,</hi> which is the only natural Union and <hi>In-being</hi> of Minds.</p>
            <p>He proves, That <hi>Unity of Nature is the Cause and Principle of Mutual-consciousness, because Mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consciousness is an essential Property equally belonging to all the Three Persons,</hi> and therefore as <hi>all Properties and internal Attributes do,</hi> must <hi>issue and result from the Essence and Nature, and therefore can have no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent causal influx upon the same Nature, so as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute either the Being or the Unity of it.</hi> Now, I grant, That <hi>Mutual-consciousness</hi> does <hi>equally belong to all Three Persons,</hi> for they are all mutually-consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to each other, and I grant, that it is essential to the Divine Nature, as to subsist in Three distinct Persons, so in Three mutually-conscious Persons; but yet Mutual-consciousness belongs not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Nature but to Persons, and is that intimate U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Persons which consists in feeling each other in themselves.</p>
            <p>The Dean will leave the Animadverter to Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophize by himself concerning <hi>antecedent causal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxes on the Divine Nature, to constitute the Being or the Unity of it;</hi> He pretends to no such Knowledge of Created Nature, much less of an eternal, self-origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, simple, uncompounded Nature: It contents him to know what is essential, not absolutely to the Unity of the Divine Nature, but to the Unity in Trinity, and if <hi>Mutual-consciousness</hi> be essential to this Unity, that the Three Divine Persons are thus united, and cannot be One without it, he will contend no
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100659:37"/>
farther with any Man about it. And it is certain, This is essential to his Notion of an identical and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Unity of Nature in the Divine Persons, when the same individual Nature is repeated in its living Image, for it is essential to the Notion of a living I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, not only perfectly to represent the Nature, but to feel all the Motions of the Prototype, to live, and move, and act with it, as the Face in the Glass answers all the Features and Motions of the Face it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents.</p>
            <p>But the Animadverter mistakes the whole Matter, as is evident from what follows: <hi>The Divine Nature or Essence being one and the same in all the Three Persons, there is upon this account, one and the same Knowledge in them also; and they are not One in Nature, by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their Mutual-Consciousness; but are therefore mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually-conscious, because the perfect Unity and Identity of their Nature makes them so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If by <hi>one and the same Knowledge,</hi> he means know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same things, this I grant is owing to the <hi>Same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of Nature, but is not <hi>Mutual-consciousness;</hi> for Three Persons, who have the same Nature, may know the same things, without feeling each others Thoughts and Knowledge in themselves: If by <hi>one and the same Knowledge</hi> he means, That the Knowledge of the Divine Nature in Three Persons, is but One in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Act, as the Knowledge of One single Person is, this destroys the distinction of Persons, which cannot be distinct without distinct personal Acts, as Knowledge is, and destroys <hi>Mutual-consciousness;</hi> for there is no place for <hi>Mutual-consciousness,</hi> or Mutual-Knowledge, where there is but One single Act of Knowledge: If by <hi>one and the same Knowledge</hi> he means what <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> calls, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap>, without any distance of time, or propagating the Motion from one to t'other, but is distinctly in them all by one Sensation, like One Thought in One numerical Mind; this is that very <hi>Mutual-consciousness</hi> the Dean means, and is essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, not to the Unity of the Divine Nature absolutely considered, but as repeated in its Image: Three such distinct Subsistences of the same individual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are by Mutual-consciousness essentially One; and thus he may take his <hi>Risibility</hi> again; for he is undone if he parts with it.</p>
            <p>3. Arg. <hi>To affirm Mutual-consciousness to be the cause of the Union of the Three Divine Persons in the same Nature, is to confound the Union and Communion of the said Persons together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To affirm, That the Three Divine Persons are es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially One by Mutual-consciousness is not to affirm, that Mutual-consciousness is the Cause of the Union, but that Persons thus united, whatever makes this Union, are essentially One: The Union of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son in the same Nature, is by eternal Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or the Father's begetting a Son in his own Likeness, not <hi>without</hi> but <hi>within</hi> himself, and the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Holy Ghost, with Father and Son, is by his eternal Procession from Father and Son, without Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, or going out of either; but this In-being of these Divine Persons in each other is their <hi>Mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consciousness;</hi> for they are in one another, as Minds, not as Bodies, and we know no other natural Union or In being of Minds, but this natural intimate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness to each other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:100659:38"/>But his Argument consists <hi>in confounding the Union and Communion of these Divine Persons;</hi> for it seems their <hi>Communion</hi> consists in this <hi>Mutual-consciousness;</hi> and if their Union consists in it too, then their Union and Communion is the same: And what if it be? Can he tell of any Communion between Persons essentially One (excepting such personal Acts as are peculiarly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to each in the Oeconomy of our Salvation, which are not the Communion of <hi>Mutual-consciousness</hi>) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from their essential Unity. In separate Persons, who have no natural Union, Unity and Communion are Two things; for where there is no natural Union, Communion can only signifie a Moral or Political U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; but all Communion is Union; and where the Union is natural, Union and Communion must be the same: For Persons which are essentially One, which is the most perfect Union, can admit of no lower Degrees of Union, which are only Imitations of Nature, to supply the want of natural Unity. So that the Animadverter has unawares proved the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Union of the Divine Persons to consist in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual-consciousness; for if their Communion consists in it, as he grants, then their Union must.</p>
            <p>But he has made a very false Representation both of <hi>Mutual-consciousness,</hi> and of the <hi>Communion</hi> of the Divine Persons with each other. For to prove <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual-consciousness</hi> to be <hi>Communion,</hi> he says, <hi>That all Acts of several Persons upon one another (as all that are Mutual must be) are properly Acts of Communion, by which the said Persons have an Intercourse amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as acting interchangeably one upon the other;</hi> which may be true of <hi>separate</hi> Persons, and of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mutual Acts,</hi> excepting <hi>Mutual-consciousness:</hi> But Persons, though distinct, yet not separate, but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100659:38"/>
One by Mutual-consciousness, do not act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each other (which must signifie an external Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, which one Person makes upon the other, and that supposes them to be separate Persons) but see, and know, and feel each other in themselves, as every single individual Mind feels its own Thoughts and Passions. Had the Dean made such a Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the Divine Persons, as this loose Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Communion infers, what tragical Exclamations should we have heard?</p>
            <p>But this severe Censurer of other Men ought to have been more cautious than to have said, <hi>That all Acts of several Persons upon one another, are Acts of Communion,</hi> which makes Boys in a State of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with each other at Boxing; and a match at Scold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another State of Communion; that had the Dean but been pleased to have returned Mutual Acts, he and the Animadverter might long before this, have been in <hi>very strict Communion</hi> with each other.</p>
            <p>After all this huffing and swaggering, this notable Dispute issues in a meer Metaphysical Subtlety about the natural Order of our Conceptions of things. The Animadverter grants all that the Dean says, and all that he has need to say in order to form a Notion of a Trinity in Unity. In the Dispute about <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consciousness,</hi> he no where denies, but in all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments supposes, that every individual Person has a <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> of its own, and that every such <hi>Self-conscious</hi> Person is thereby one with it self, and distinguish'd from all other Persons; but he will not allow <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> to be the <hi>formal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Personality,</hi> which the Dean no where says it is; and as for <hi>Mutual-consciousness,</hi> he allows the Three Divine Persons, to be thus <hi>mutually-conscious;</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:100659:39"/>
and that this <hi>Mutual-Consciousness may suppose an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Nature</hi> (the Dean would have said <hi>Unity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> though an <hi>Union of Persons;</hi> for Unity is One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Union is a Conjunction of more than One; and therefore there can be no <hi>Union</hi> of Nature, unless there be a number of Natures united into One, but there is an Union of Persons in the Unity of Nature) and that <hi>Mutual-consciousness may result</hi> from this U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <hi>and upon the same account may infer and prove it, but it can never give or cause it; for their Essence and Personality</hi> (what but <hi>One Personality,</hi> as One Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in Three?) <hi>must still go before their Mutual-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness, since the Three Persons must be really One in Nature before they can know themselves to be so. To be so?</hi> How is that? To be One? That they must be One, before they can know themselves to be One? What is that to the purpose? Can they be One be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are Mutually-conscious, even in the order of conceiving it? Can they be One before they are in one another? Or is there any other mutual In-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Minds, but Mutual-consciousness?</p>
            <p>But what confounded work does this make with the pure, simple, uncompounded, eternal Nature of God to prove a Priority or Posteriority of Being, or Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality in the Divine Nature from the order of our Conceptions? When we certainly know, that the Divine Nature is eternal, and therefore has nothing before, nor after in it; that it has no Parts or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and therefore nothing in order of Nature before or after, nothing that can be conceived as a Cause or Effect, is it not demonstrable, that all such Conceptions, reduced into such exact Order and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, are false, because there is nothing in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, that answers to them? And though the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100659:39"/>
imperfection of our Knowledge makes it necessary to distinguish the Divine Nature into different Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, as far as we can know any thing of God, and can form distinct Notions, which we can view by Parts; Is this a Reason to frame Ideas of Priority and Posteriority, of Causes and Effects, of formal Reasons and essential Properties, when we know there is no such thing in God, and can form no distinct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of them? Is it not a wise Dispute, whether Essence, Subsistence, Personality, the distinction of Persons, or the Unity of Nature, Self-consciousness, and Mutual-consciousness, be first or last, which is the Cause, and which the Effect; when we know that the Divine Nature did eternally subsist in Three Self-conscious, and mutually-conscious Persons, and have no other Conception of their Distinction and Unity?</p>
            <p>But let those distinguish and methodize their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions into unconceivable Confusion, that please; if Self-consciousness necessarily results from, and infers and proves a distinction of Persons, and Mutual-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness <hi>supposes, results from, infers, and proves,</hi> the Union of the Divine Persons in the essential Unity of the Godhead, it will satisfie the Dean without dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the formal Reasons of Personality and Union: For this proves a Trinity in Unity, and gives us as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible a Notion of it, as we have of Three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Self-conscious Persons, which are mutually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious to each other, which either makes or proves an essential Distinction and Unity; and to dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Cause of Self-consciousness or Mutual-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness, is to dispute about the naked Essences, or essential Properties of things, which the Dean re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected<note place="margin">Vindic. <hi>p.</hi> 8.</note> from the beginning, as without the Compass of Humane Knowledge.</p>

            <p>But the Sum of all is, That <hi>nothing can be signified by these Words (Self-consciousness and Mutual conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) which is not fully, clearly, and abundantly signified by that one plain Word, and known Attribute, the Divine Omniscience.</hi> Now suppose this; Why may not that One Comprehensive Attribute of Omniscience very properly receive different Names, according to its different Objects, as the several Arts and Sciences do? If, as he says, <hi>by this Omniscience every Divine Person knows himself, and the same Person, by the very same Omniscience knows all that is known by the other Two Persons, and the other Two Persons by the same knows all that is known by him;</hi> yet to know himself and to know whatever others know, though it may belong to the same Omniscience is not the same Knowledge, because it has not the same Object; for <hi>Self</hi> and <hi>Others,</hi> are as distinct Objects as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are distinct Persons; and therefore this Knowledge may be distinguished by different Names, as it is by different Objects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:100659:40"/>And since, as he confesses, the general Notion of Omniscience does not distinguish Persons as Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consciousness does, nor Unite them into One, as Mutual-consciousness does, these Terms were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to express something, which Omniscience does not express, <hi>viz.</hi> wherein these Divine Persons are distinguished, and wherein they are One.</p>
            <p>But, after all, this is a Mistake; for though <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consciousness</hi> and <hi>Mutual consciousness</hi> may in some Sence be called Knowledge, yet they are of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Kind and Species from what we strictly call Knowledge, that is, they differ as Speculation and Sensation. <hi>Self-Knowledge</hi> properly signifies to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template our own Natures in their Idea, to draw our own Image and Picture as like the Original as we can, and to view our selves in it: But <hi>Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness</hi> is an <hi>intellectual Self-Sensation,</hi> when we feel our selves, and all the Thoughts, Knowledge, Volitions, Passions of our Minds, and know what is Self, and what belongs to Self by feeling it: He, who knows not the difference between intellectual Sence and Knowledge, is as unfit to meddle in this Controversie, as a Blind-Man is to dispute of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. Thus the <hi>Mutual-consciousness</hi> of Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons is not their mutual Knowledge of each other, though they know each other as perfectly as they know themselves, but their Mutual-Sensation and feeling each other in themselves, which makes them naturally One. An omniscient Being knows all things, but feels himself; and Omniscience, as the Animadverter observes, belongs to Nature, but Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual-consciousness to Persons, which might have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied him, That there is a great difference between <hi>Omniscience,</hi> and <hi>Self-consciousness,</hi> and <hi>Mutual-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness;</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:100659:41"/>
between knowing all things, whether the Object be Self, or any other Being, and feeling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and other Persons in himself.</p>
            <p>This is sufficient to justifie the Dean's Notion of <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> and <hi>Mutual-consciousness,</hi> and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more fully to explain it, which, it seems, he thought, that every one, who was acquainted with the workings of his own Mind, must have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood without a Comment: And, I hope, if the Animadverter think fit to try his skill again, we shall hear no more of his <hi>formal Reasons of Personality and Union,</hi> but that he will be pleased to speak to the true point, whether a Self-conscious Person be not one with himself, and distinguished from all other Persons, and whether he does not feel himself to be thus One, and thus distinguished by <hi>Self-consciousness;</hi> and whether Three Divine Persons, who are thus Mutually-conscious to each other, be not naturally and essentially United into One Supream Being, or One God. All other Disputes are beside the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; for if this hold true, then we have a natural Distinction, and a natural Unity between these Three Divine Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and that is a natural Trinity in Unity, without the least appearance of Absurdity or Contradiction, or impossibility in its Notion.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, though the Assault has been furious and insulting, we have met with no heavier Charge, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting some usual Complements) than Ignorance in Philosophy and Metaphysicks, and Scholastick Terms, and where that Charge falls, I will now leave you to judge; but this is but the beginning of Sorrow: <hi>Tritheism</hi> follows next, which is a terrible Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though I do heartily thank the Animadverter,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100659:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that he has been so civil to the Dean, as not to charge<note place="margin">Anim. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 118.</note> this upon him, as his Opinion, but as the consequence of his Principles, which I believe will prove no more than the Animadverter's Ignorance, not the Dean's Heresie.</p>
            <p>Before I Answer his Arguments, it will be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary briefly to state this Matter in Controversie; for the Sting of all his Arguments consists in forcing such a Sence on the Dean's Words, as he never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>The only thing that needs any Excuse or Apology is the Phrase of <hi>Three eternal and infinite Minds;</hi> the Fault of which is, That it is an unusual way of Speaking, and gives advantage to an ignorant or cavilling Adversary to affix some uncouth and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Sence on it. What led the Dean to this, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served before, <hi>viz.</hi> His explication of the distinction of the Three Divine Persons by <hi>Self-consciousness,</hi> and of their essential Unity by <hi>Mutual-consciousness;</hi> now since <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> and <hi>Mutual-consciousness</hi> can be in nothing but Minds, he thought the fairest and easiest representation of this Matter, was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider them under the Notion and Character of Minds; for every Man can feel in himself, that a Mind is distinguished from all other Minds by <hi>Self-conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and if there may be, and is, such a <hi>Mutual-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness</hi> between Three, as the Dean describes, they must be as naturally and essentially One, as Three can be One, and we must seek for no other <hi>Unity in Trinity,</hi> than what is reconcilable with a real Trinity, or a real distinction between Three.</p>
            <p>But had the Dean been aware, what kind of Men he should have had to do with, such as have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the plain and manifest Sence of an Author,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100659:42"/>
if they can but pick a Quarrel with his words, he might easily have prevented all this, without having injured his main Argument: If instead of <hi>Three eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and infinite Minds,</hi> he had but said, <hi>Three eternal, infinite, knowing, intelligent Persons,</hi> he had kept the Orthodox Language, and yet expressed all that he intended by <hi>Three Minds;</hi> for a knowing intelligent Person is a Mind, if Knowledge can be only in a Mind; and then Three such intelligent Persons may be distinguished from each other by <hi>Self-consciousness,</hi> and united in One Godhead by <hi>Mutual-consciousness.</hi> This is the Account the Dean himself gives, what he means by a Mind, <hi>That a Mind is an intelligent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 66.</note> 
               <hi>and that every intelligent Person is a Mind,</hi> and therefore thought it as innocent in this Sence, to say, That there are Three eternal and infinite Minds, as to say, That there are Three eternal and infinite Persons; and I believe it will appear, That excepting the unusualness of the Expression, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of <hi>Tritheism</hi> will equally lie against both, with this difference, That it is more easily Answered by considering the Powers and Properties of a Mind. And in this Sence only he affirms, That <hi>to say, they are Three Persons, and not Three distinct infinite Minds,</hi> that is, not Three distinct intelligent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, <hi>is both Heresie and Nonsence;</hi> it is Nonsence to Talk of a <hi>Person,</hi> who is not an <hi>intelligent Person,</hi> that is, as he explains it, a <hi>Mind,</hi> which contradicts the Notion both of a Person and Mind; and to say, That there are Three Persons, but not Three intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Persons, is Heresie, even the Heresie of <hi>Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius;</hi> for there is no Medium between a Trinity of intelligent Persons, and a Trinity of Names; for Powers and Faculties, and Modes, will prove no
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100659:42"/>
more, when distinguished from <hi>intelligent Persons:</hi> And it is evident, That this is all he intended by it, by the opposition he makes between Three Minds and Three intelligent Persons, and <hi>Three Powers and Faculties of the same Being; for Faculties are not Persons, no more than Memory, Will, and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are Three Persons in One Man:</hi> And he proves, That the received Catholick <hi>Notion of a Person is such a Being as has Understanding, and Will, and Power of Action,</hi> from the Arguments universally urged against the <hi>Socinians,</hi> to prove the Holy Ghost to be a Person, and not meerly <hi>a Divine Power, because all the Properties of a Person belong to him, such as Understanding, Will, Affections and Actions.</hi> So that the Dean does not charge those with <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and Nonsence,</hi> who barely refuse to use these Terms of <hi>Three eternal and infinite Minds,</hi> which, it may be, no body ever so expresly used before him, and which he will not contend about; but the <hi>Heresie and Nonsence</hi> is to assert Three distinct Divine Persons, who are not <hi>Three distinct, eternal, infinite, intelligent Persons,</hi> and he has Authority and Reason enough to call this both <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Nonsence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a sufficient Answer to that Charge the Animadverter draws up against the Dean, That he calls the Three Divine Persons <hi>Three eternal and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Minds,</hi> by which he understands no more than Three <hi>intelligent Persons;</hi> and if He thinks an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Person</hi> to be a <hi>Mind,</hi> let the Animadverter confute him, if he can; and if he means no more by <hi>Three Minds</hi> than <hi>Three intelligent Persons,</hi> (as it is evident he could mean no more) how inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient soever this expression may be thought, let the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100659:43"/>
Animadverter try his Skill to make <hi>Tritheism</hi> of <hi>Three Minds,</hi> and excuse <hi>Three intelligent Persons</hi> from the same Charge. And now let us consider his Arguments, which he shews with great Pomp in Mode and Figure.</p>
            <p>Arg. 1. <hi>Three distinct infinite Minds or Spirits,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 119.</note> 
               <hi>are Three distinct Gods. But the Three Persons of the Blessed Trinity are not Three distinct Gods. And therefore the Three Persons of the Blessed Trinity, are not Three distinct infinite Minds or Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let us but change the Term of <hi>Minds</hi> into <hi>Intelligent Persons,</hi> and it is the very Argument the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> urge to confute the Doctrine of Three Divine Persons, or to charge it with <hi>Tritheism,</hi> and runs thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Three distinct, infinite, intelligent Persons, are Three distinct Gods. But there are not Three distinct Gods. And therefore there are not Three distinct, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, intelligent Persons in the Godhead;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently to assert Three such distinct Persons is to assert Three Gods.</p>
            <p>His proof of the Major Proposition will serve as well for an eternal, infinite, intelligent Person, as for an eternal infinite Mind. <hi>For God and eternal, infinite, intelligent Person, are Terms as equipollent and convertible, as God and infinite Mind or Spirit. God being as truly and properly</hi> an infinite, intelligent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as <hi>an infinite Mind or Spirit,</hi> and an infinite, intelligent Person being as <hi>truly and properly God,</hi> as <hi>an infinite Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Animadverter think fit to Answer, That <hi>One</hi> God, and <hi>One</hi> infinite Mind are <hi>convertible Terms,</hi> but <hi>One</hi> God, and <hi>One</hi> infinite, intelligent Person are not <hi>convertible Terms,</hi> because there are Three such infinite Persons in the Godhead, and but One infinite Mind;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100659:43"/>
the reply is easie, That the bare <hi>Terms,</hi> from which he argues, do not prove this distinction; For though in the Doctrine of the Trinity, custom has more reconciled us to the Term <hi>Person</hi> than <hi>Mind;</hi> yet, setting aside this Dispute, all Mankind understand the same thing by an <hi>infinite Mind,</hi> and an <hi>infinite intelligent Person;</hi> it is plain the <hi>Socinians</hi> do, and hence conclude, That there is but <hi>One Person</hi> in the Godhead, because God is but One <hi>infinite Mind.</hi> Whether there be One or Three infinite Minds, or infinite intelligent Persons in the Unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, is a Dispute of a higher Nature, and can't be determined by <hi>Convertible Terms;</hi> for though the ancient Philosophers and Poets (as he Learnedly proves, what every School-Boy knows) did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knolwedge God to be a <hi>Mind</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> that is, an understanding, intelligent, immaterial Being, yet most of them by Mind understood no more than One single Mind, or One single Intelligent Person, and he might have known, that <hi>Plato,</hi> to whom he appeals, though he acknowledged God to be a Mind, yet he owned Three such Minds in the Unity of the Godhead. And therefore could not think, That <hi>One God,</hi> and <hi>One infinite Mind,</hi> were equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollent and convertible Terms; because he asserted Three infinite Minds to be but One God.</p>
            <p>But since the Animadverter has only made <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>infinite Mind or Spirit, equipollent and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Terms,</hi> we may allow him this, and still deny his Major Proposition, that therefore <hi>Three distinct infinite Minds or Spirits, are Three distinct Gods;</hi> for though God is an infinite Mind, and an infinite Mind is God, it does not follow that <hi>Three infinite Minds are Three distinct Gods,</hi> no more than Three
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100659:44"/>
infinite intelligent Persons are Three distinct Gods; but only as it is expressed in the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed, That <hi>we are compelled by the Christian Verity to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge every Person by himself</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, singly, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly) <hi>to be God and Lord, and yet are forbidden by the Catholick Religion to say, there be Three Gods or Three Lords.</hi> If God be an infinite Mind, and there be Three infinite Minds, it must follow, That each of these Three infinite Minds, <hi>distinctly,</hi> and <hi>by himself</hi> considered, is God, not that these Three are Three distinct Gods, but One God.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Animadverter's Argument from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertibility and Commensuration, that whatsoever may be affirmed or denied of the One, may with equal Truth and Propriety be affirmed and denied of the other,</hi> proves all that the Dean would desire, <hi>viz.</hi> that every distinct Person in the Godhead is distinctly <hi>by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi> an infinite Mind, because he is distinctly <hi>by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi> God, and God is <hi>infinite Mind,</hi> and therefore every Person, who is God, is infinite Mind; for no Person can, <hi>by himself</hi> be God, who has not <hi>by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi> all the Perfections that belong to the Idea of God: So that here are Three Persons in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, each of which <hi>by himself</hi> is <hi>infinite Mind.</hi> And therefore, though it may be improper, in an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Sence to say, there are Three eternal and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Minds, when we acknowledge this <hi>infinite Mind</hi> is, and eternally was essentially and insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>One;</hi> yet we must say, that this One infinite Mind is essentially distinguished into Three infinite intelligent Persons, whom, in any other case, we should call Three Minds, and are as much Three as is consistent with the essential Unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; and this is reason enough to consider the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100659:44"/>
of Persons, and the Unity of the Godhead, as we would the Distinction and Unity of Three Minds; and then this One eternal infinite Mind, may be distinguished into Three intelligent Persons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by Three Self consciousnesses, and be essentially One by a natural Mutual-consciousness, which is all the Dean intended, or had occasion to assert. And if this be all he means by the <hi>Godhead,</hi> and <hi>infinite Mind,</hi> which is common to all Three Persons, the Dean rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily agrees with him, and in this Sence will no more say, that there are <hi>Three infinite Minds,</hi> than that there are <hi>Three Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Animadverter was aware of this, That the same Objection <hi>of Three Gods,</hi> would as well lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Three Persons as against Three Minds; and let us consider how he avoids the blow. The difference he makes between them is this, That <hi>Three infinite Minds or Spirits are Three absolute, simple Beings, or Essences, and so stand distinguished from one another by their whole Beings or Natures.</hi> The Sum of which is no more but this, That Three distinct Minds are Three distinct Gods, because they <hi>are distinguished;</hi> but if notwithstanding their distinction, they are essentially and inseparably One, they are not Three distinct Gods, but a real Trinity of Divine Persons in the Unity of the Godhead, which all Men must own, who believe a Trinity in Unity. But are not <hi>Three infinite intelligent Persons,</hi> as much <hi>Three absolute, simple Beings and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences,</hi> as Three Minds? No! by no means! <hi>The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons are Three Relatives, (or One simple Being or Essence under Three distinct Relations) and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently differ from one another, not wholly, and by all that is in them, but only by some Mode or Respect pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to each, and upon that account causing their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction.</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:100659:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
This is perfect Gibberish, which I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he understands not one Word of himself; But let us examine it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Divine Persons,</hi> he says, <hi>are Three Relatives;</hi> very right; for <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> are Three, and are related to each other. But what are <hi>Three Relatives?</hi> that comes in by way of Parenthesis, <hi>One simple Being, or Essence under Three distinct Relations.</hi> That these Three Persons, thus related to each other, are <hi>One simple Being, or Essence</hi> we readily grant, for they were from eternity inseparably united in One infinite Essence, or One Supream God; but the Question still remains, what these Three Persons are, into which this One Being, or Essence, is distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by these Three distinct Relations? <hi>Three Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> are not Three Relations, but Three things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to each other; What then, are these Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the Unity of the Divine Essence? <hi>Three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Three Modes, Three Respects,</hi> without some Being, which tho' essentially One, is really and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially Three, is Nonsence in Logick; for there must be as many real, substantial Relatives and Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, as there are Relations, unless the Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Father and Son can subsist without a real Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son. The Person then of the Father, the Person of the Son, and the Person of the Holy Ghost, are not the Relations between Father, Son, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, but real, substantial Persons, thus related to each other: And if these are Three intelligent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, let him make, if he can, Three Gods of Three Minds, and excuse <hi>Three real intelligent Persons</hi> from the same Charge. But the Truth is, to prevent the Charge of making Three Gods, he distinguishes the Three Divine Persons, into Three Logical Relations,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100659:45"/>
or Modes of Subsistence; and if we will be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Trinity of Modes, he is for us; but this looks very like renouncing a Trinity of Persons, to secure the Unity of the Godhead; and I fear will prove no better when thoroughly examined.</p>
            <p>In what Sence the Three Divine Persons are <hi>Three Relatives,</hi> or <hi>Three Relations,</hi> I have explained above; their Nature is compleat and absolute, if the Divine Nature be so, but their Subsistence is Relative, as it must of Necessity be, when the same individual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is repeated, and subsists distinctly in Three, If it be essential to the Father to be a Father, he subsists with a necessary Relation to his Son; if it be essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the Son to be a Son, the perfect living Image of the Father, his Subsistence is wholly Relative, as the Subsistence of an Image is, which depends upon the Prototype. And therefore though each Divine Person be eternal and infinite Mind, and with respect to their Three real Subsistences, may be called Three infinite eternal Minds, (as the Dean ventured to call them) yet these Three are not <hi>Three absolute simple Beings or Essences, which stand distinguished from one another by their whole Beings or Natures,</hi> but One ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute eternal Mind repeated in Three Relative Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stences without multiplication: As a Man and his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Image, though each of them have distinctly Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, and upon that account might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Two Men, yet they have but One compleat, absolute Humane Nature, though it be repeated in the Image, and are but One Man in Two Persons, or Two Humane Subsistences.</p>
            <p>Had the Dean indeed made Three compleat, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, eternal Minds, he had been justly chargeable with making Three Gods, but the same eternal and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100659:46"/>
infinite Mind repeated in Three Subsistences, necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and essentially related to each other, are but One eternal God.</p>
            <p>2. His second Argument is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Three distinct Minds or Spirits, are Three distinct Substances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Three Persons in the Blessed Trinity, are not Three distinct Substances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore they are not Three distinct Minds or Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dean does not pretend to know any thing of the Substance of a Mind, much less of God, who is an infinite Mind: He is contented to know, That a Mind is a thinking and understanding Being; and though Understanding, and Being, and Nature, or Substance, may be distinguished in finite, created Minds, yet St. <hi>Austin</hi> has taught him, that in God, <note n="*" place="margin">

His Major, That <hi>Three distinct Minds are Three distinct Substances,</hi> he proves from <hi>the Definition of a Mind or Spirit, that it is</hi> Substantia incorporea intelligens; <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent, incorporeal (or immaterial) Substance;</hi> and therefore <hi>Three distinct Minds or Spirits must be Three such distinct Substances.</hi> Now if a Man should deny his Definition, and say, That a Mind is <hi>res cogitans,</hi> a thinking Being, he would be undone for want of his <hi>Substances;</hi> but I shall only cap Definitions with him at present, That a Person is <hi>Substantia individua naturae rationabilis, the individual Substance of a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Nature:</hi> And therefore if there be Three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Persons, there are Three such distinct Substances in the Godhead, and let us see how he will bring off Three Persons from being Three distinct Substances, and I will undertake the Dean shall do as much, and do it as well, for Three Minds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But if a Mind were not a Substance, what could it be else?</hi> Let us know first, what Substance is, and then we'll tell him. Not <hi>quod substat accidentibus</hi> I hope, for then he immediately proves, That God is no Substance, because <hi>no accident can be in God,</hi> nor need he fear, that the Dean will make a <hi>Mind</hi> a <hi>Mode of Subsistence</hi> in his Sence of it, but a true and real Mind, which does really and actually subsist, though these Three eternal Minds are but Three eternal Subsistences of the same One individual eternal Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for the Minor,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Three Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the blessed Trinity are not Three distinct Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi> he proves first <hi>from Authority;</hi> and he is as dangerous a Man at Authorities, as ever I met with.</p>
            <p>He cites <hi>Tertullian,</hi> St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and some<note place="margin">Pag. 123.</note> others, and he might have produced the Authority of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100659:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all the ancient Fathers, to prove, that there is but <hi>One Substance in God;</hi> but this is nothing to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, for by <hi>One Substance</hi> they plainly meant the <hi>Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousion,</hi> that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, were of the same Nature, and by denying <hi>Three Substances,</hi> they principally rejected Three divers Natures, of different Kinds and Species, in opposition to Arianism, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Son to be of the same Nature with his Father; this he might have learnt from what he cites from his Orthodox Father, <hi>Bellarmine, That to assert, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son differ in Substance is Arianism;</hi> for the difference the Arians made, and the Catholicks oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, was not in the real distinction of their Persons, but in the diversity of their Natures; and the Reason he adds, will not help it out: <hi>And yet</hi> (he adds) <hi>if they were Two distinct Substances, for them not to differ in Substance would be impossible;</hi> as if to be distinct, and to differ in Substance were the same thing: As if Two Men were not <hi>unius Substantiae,</hi> of one and the same Substance, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> and all the Fathers assert, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are Two distinct Men, and each of them has a distinct Nature of his own? Or if he will call this a Difference, as if to differ in number and in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance or Nature were the same thing? or as if to differ in number proved a diversity of Nature too. It is a tedious thing to dispute with Men, who must be taught to construe the Fathers, and to understand common Sence.</p>
            <p>But if Authority will not do this, he is resolved Reason shall, and he has as peculiar a Talent at Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as he has at Authorities. He proves, That the <hi>Three Persons</hi> can't be Three distinct Minds, because they are not <hi>Three distinct Substances.</hi> Now the Dean may very safely deny this Consequence, and try how
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100659:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Animadverter will prove it; That if Three Minds are Three intelligent Persons, and a Mind is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, therefore <hi>Three distinct Minds, or Persons,</hi> are <hi>Three distinct Substances;</hi> for Three distinct Minds may subsist distinctly, and yet inseparably in One E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and infinite Substance, as Three intelligent Persons do. Though the true and short Answer is, That the same Substance repeated in Three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Subsistences, is not Three Substances, but One, as I have often observed in the Case of the Man and his Image.</p>
            <p>But suppose <hi>Three Persons were Three distinct Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi> inseparably united in One: What then? What then? It is a Terrible then: <hi>For then Two Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances will concur in, and belong to each Person; to wit that Substance, which is the Divine Essence, and so is communicable or common to all the Persons, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which constitutes each Person, and thereby is so peculiar to him, as to distinguish him from the other, and consequently to be incommunicable to any besides him, to whom it belongs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am heartily ashamed and sorry to see such Stuff, as must necessarily expose our Holy Faith to the scorn of Atheists and Infidels, and that I may not contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to it, all this Nonsence shall escape the lash of my Pen. In short, the Dean knows no Divine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance or Essence distinct from the Three Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, nor knows any distinction between the Divine Essence, and a Divine Person, but that the Essence makes the Person. That the whole Divine Essence or Nature is originally in God the Father, that this same whole Divine Nature and Essence was by eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Generation, communicated by the Father to the Son, and subsists distinctly in him; That this same
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100659:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whole Divine Nature by eternal Procession, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by the Father and the Son, to the Holy Ghost, and subsists distinctly in him; and these Three Divine Persons by an inseparable Union, dwelling in each other, is that Supream and Sovereign Being, who is the One God, or a Trinity in Unity.</p>
            <p>It is amazing to think what strange Conceits this Man must have of a Trinity of Persons, and Unity of Essence or Substance: For I am sure no Man has any Idea of an intelligent Nature and Essence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from a Person, or of Persons distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a rational Nature; of a Divine Essence and Substance, which is no Person; and of Divine Persons, which are no Substances, as it seems, they cannot be in the Animadverter's way, unless he also will compound every Person of Two Substances. What is the Divine Essence and Substance, but an infinite and eternal Mind? And is not an infinite and eternal Mind a Person? The Divine Essence then must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be a Person, and to be a substantial Person, or the Divine Substance; so that there is a Person, that is a Substance, and if there be but One such single and solitary Divine Essence, there can be but One such single and solitary Person: Will he then make four Persons in the Godhead; the Divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, which is a substantial Person, and Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which are no Substances? Or will he own God to be, what <hi>Pascentius</hi> objected to St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and he rejected with Scorn; <hi>Triformis Persona,</hi> One Divine<note place="margin">Ep. 176, 177.</note> Person under Three Forms: this or something more Senceless is the Truth of the Case, as may appear more hereafter: but I will now proceed.</p>
            <p>3. His third Argument is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it be truly said, that one and the same infinite</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:100659:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Mind or Spirit is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost (I mean all Three taken together) and it cannot be truly said, that one and the same infinite Mind or Spirit is Three distinct infinite Minds or Spirits, then it follows, that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are not Three distinct infinite Minds or Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Logick is a very troublesome thing, when Men want Sence. The whole of this Argument is this, That One infinite Mind can't be Three infinite Minds, nor Three infinite Minds One infinite Mind, and that Three Persons, who are One infinite Mind, can't be Three infinite Minds; that is, That Three can't be One, nor One Three; which if it be universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, there is an end of a Trinity in Unity; if it be not universally true, that is, if Three may be One, and One Three, the meer opposition between Three and One, which is the whole force of his Argument, is childish Sophistry: For if they be Three and One in different Respects, this is no Contradiction. Every Divine Person is an infinite Mind, and as distinctly so, as he is a distinct Person, and yet by their essential and inseparable Union to each other, all Three are but One eternal infinite Mind, as they are but One God. But when these Three Divine Persons, are said to be Three, and to be One eternal and infinite Mind, they are Three and One Mind upon different Respects; every Person by himself, as a distinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is an eternal infinite Mind, that is, is a knowing intelligent Being, and has all the Perfections of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Understanding, distinguished from the other Persons by <hi>Self-consciousness;</hi> and all Three Persons by their inseparable Union to each other, are but One eternal infinite Mind, as having each other in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by <hi>Mutual-consciousness;</hi> and let the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100659:49"/>
shew where the Contradiction is, That there should be <hi>Three Self-conscious infinite Minds,</hi> as there are Three infinite Persons, united into One mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conscious Mind, as Three distinct Persons are united in the Unity of the Godhead: especially when this One eternal Mind is entirely and perfectly repeated without the least change in Three eternal intelligent Subsistences; each of which is distinctly an eternal Mind, but the same One individual eternal Mind.</p>
            <p>4. His fourth and last Argument is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whatsoever Attribute may be truly predicated of all and each of the Divine Persons in the</hi> Athanasian <hi>Form, so belongs to them all in common, that it can belong to none of them under any Term of distinction from the rest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the attribute (infinite Mind or Spirit) may be truly predicated of all and each of the Divine Persons in and according to the</hi> Athanasian <hi>Form.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore it can belong to none of them under any Term of distinction from the rest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a wonderful Argument, if it be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. For,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Infinite Mind or Spirit</hi> is no <hi>Attribute,</hi> but the Divine Nature and Essence it self, and our Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical Animadverter uses to distinguish between Essence and Attributes in God; and disputes ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly without an opponent, that infinite Mind is God; and therefore, That there is but One infinite Mind, as there is but One God; Is God himself then an Attribute? What will he make of God at last, when the Divine Essence is an Attribute, and a Divine Person a meer Mode?</p>
            <p>2. But let <hi>infinite Mind or Spirit</hi> be an Attribute or the Divine Essence, since <hi>it may be truly predicated</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:100659:49"/>
               <hi>of all and each of the Divine Persons, it must so belong to them all in common, that it can belong to none of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any Term of distinction from the rest.</hi> If by this <hi>Term of distinction from the rest,</hi> he means it cannot belong to each of them considered <hi>distinctly</hi> as such <hi>distinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> then it cannot <hi>be predicated distinctly of them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> for nothing can, without manifest absurdity, be distinctly predicated of Three distinct Persons, if it do not distinctly belong to each of them: If the Father, considered as the Father, and as a distinct Person from the Son, and from the Holy Ghost, be not an infinite Mind, it cannot be truly said, That the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is an infinite Mind; and if the Son, as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Person from the Father and the Holy Ghost is not an infinite Mind, it cannot be truly affirmed distinctly of the Son, that he is an infinite Mind. Predication, if it be true, must follow Nature, and therefore nothing can be particularly and distinctly predicated of any Person, which does not distinctly belong to him. What is common to Three, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be so peculiarly appropriated to any One, as to exclude either of the other Two; for it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, if it be not common to all; and no more is it common, if each of them have it not as distinctly as they subsist: For distinct Persons, that subsist distinctly, must distinctly have what they have, or they cannot have it at all; though Humane Nature is common to all Mankind, yet every distinct Man, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly enjoys Humane Nature; for there is no other way of distinction of Persons in a common Nature: There is indeed a great difference between the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of Humane Persons, and of the Divine Persons in the Sacred Trinity, and between the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, being common to all Three Divine
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100659:50"/>
Persons, and Humane Nature, being common to all Mankind, as I have often observed; but there is so much likeness and Analogy between them, as to make it very absurd to say, That what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Three distinct Persons, does not belong distinctly to each.</p>
            <p>3. Nor does <hi>the form of the</hi> Athanasian <hi>Creed</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid us distinctly to attribute to each distinct Person of the Trinity, what is common to all Three; for the Creed it self does this expresly in every point; <hi>The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate, the Holy Ghost uncreate. The Father Incomprehensible, Eternal, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, God and Lord; and the Son Incomprehensible, Eternal, Almighty, God and Lord; and the Holy Ghost Incomprehensible, Eternal, Almighty, God and Lord.</hi> And that <hi>the Christian Verity compels us to acknowledge every Person by himself</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which, I think, is <hi>distinctly</hi>) <hi>God and Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well! but the <hi>Creed</hi> expresly denies, That therefore there are <hi>Three Uncreate,</hi> or <hi>Three Incomprehensibles,</hi> or <hi>Three Eternals,</hi> or <hi>Three Almighties,</hi> or <hi>Three Gods,</hi> or <hi>Three Lords:</hi> I grant it, but not for the Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Reason, because what is common to all Three, does not distinctly belong to each, or to all of them, for the Creed expresly affirms, that it does; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these Three Divine Persons, each of which have <hi>distinctly</hi> all these Perfections of the Divine Nature, and the whole Divine Nature in them are so inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably united, as to be essentially One: And therefore, though there are Three Eternal, Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible, Almighty Persons, each of which is God and Lord, yet there is but One Eternal, Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible, Almighty God and Lord; and thus it must be, if we will maintain with the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100659:50"/>
the real distinction of Persons, and the Unity of the Godhead: If there be <hi>Three Persons,</hi> each of which is <hi>by himself, Uncreate, Eternal, Incomprehensible, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,</hi> I will venture any Man, who can understand plain Sence, and dares own it, to deny, if he can, That there are <hi>Three</hi> Uncreate, Eternal, Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible, Almighty <hi>Persons.</hi> And in this Sence the Dean has not transgressed the Form of the <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> Creed, by <hi>Three infinite Minds,</hi> if we understand them of Three infinite, intelligent, Persons; and it is certain he could understand nothing else by them, when he unites these Three infinite Minds into One infinite Mind, which can signifie nothing else but <hi>Three Persons and One God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is enough in Answer to the Animadverter's Arguments, and I belive you are sensible by this time, what a profound Reasoner he is; in the next place we should consider his Authorities, but I am very weary of this work, and I guess, you think it a pretty long Letter already, but if you desire it, and will have a little Patience, neither you nor the Animadverter shall long complain for want of an Answer, though I can't but think it a needless un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; for no Man, who ever lookt into the Fathers, can want an Answer, and those who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not consult the Fathers themselves, will believe as their Inclinations and Affections lead them. I will undertake, the Fathers shall absolve the Dean from the Imputation of Tritheism, let the Animadverter fence as well as he can against <hi>Sabellianism.</hi> His <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> Friends and Admirers declare, they will not dispute with him about a Trinity of meer Modes and Postures in the Singularity of the Divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; for though they have too much Sence to own
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100659:51"/>
and profess such a Trinity, yet they think it not worth disputing: It is a real, substantial, subsisting Trinity they are afraid of, and dispute against; such a Trinity the Dean asserts, and has vindicated from Absurdity and Contradiction, and this is the Trinity, which both the Scripture Teaches, and the ancient Catholick Church always taught; and this I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to prove.</p>
            <p>There is indeed a third part of the Animadversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if that may be called a part, which runs through and inspires the whole, in which the Animadverter is by much an Over-match for any Man who is a Christian; I mean his scolding part, for it would Prophane the Name of Wit to give it that Title. This I don't pretend to Answer, and you your self confess it should be despised, not Answered: Let him then here securely Triumph, and receive the Reward of such Heroical Actions; <hi>Ut pueris placeas, &amp; declamatio sias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore I shall only add, That if you want an Answer to the Preface, you should read the Dean's <hi>Defence of the Knowledge of Iesus Christ and our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Communion with him,</hi> which was published many Years since, and silenced all his Adversaries then, that he heard no more of that till the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter revived the Quarrel, who could have given you the Dean's Answers to his own Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if he had so pleased; for they are not new, but borrowed from such Wits as Mr. <hi>Alsop,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any new strength given to them.</p>
            <p>Where the Animadverter charges the Dean with Absurdities and Contradictions, turn to the place, and read it with its context, and tell me what you can't Answer, and I will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:100659:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>But if you, or any body else, can be perswaded by the Animadverter, That the Dean understands neither <hi>English, Latin,</hi> nor <hi>Greek;</hi> neither <hi>Logicks, Metaphysicks,</hi> or <hi>Common Sence;</hi> I need wish you no other Punishment, than when ever you Write to fall into the hands of such an Adversary; for, I believe, there are very few Writers, but might be exposed in the same manner by a spiteful Critick, not the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter himself excepted, who begins his Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions with a notorious Blunder in deriving <hi>a Mystery</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; whereas <hi>a Mystery</hi> does not signifie in <hi>English</hi> the word <hi>Mystery,</hi> but the thing signified by that word; and therefore, though <hi>the word Mystery</hi> may be derived, <hi>a Mystery</hi> is derived from no Word; and to Talk of deriving <hi>a Mystery</hi> is neither <hi>English</hi> nor Sence.</p>
            <p>But though it were Justice to return some of his Complements to the Dean upon himself, yet his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is too scandalous to be imitated, and there is no need to expose him, more than his own Pen has done. I am,</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce my writing this Letter, I have met with a Book, Entituled, <hi>A Calm and Sober Enquiry concerning the possibility of a Trinity in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> Written, as is said, by a Man of great Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation among the Dissenters: I do not intend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Book, nor to approve, or disapprove it, though there seem to be very obnoxious Passages in it, should he fall into such hands as our Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter: He has taken great care, That no Man should suspect that he favours the Dean in his Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and I believe, the Dean will thank him for that, for if I understand him, he would never have said, and would be as unwilling that any Man should think he has said, what the Enquirer has.</p>
            <p>But all I design by this <hi>Post-script,</hi> is only this, to let you see, that though the Enquirer does not in every particular say what the Dean says, yet he says what will justifie the Dean against the heaviest Charge the Animadverter himself could frame against his Hypothesis, and that is <hi>Tritheism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:100659:52"/>The pretence of this is, what the Dean says con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Three <hi>distinct, eternal, infinite Minds,</hi> and the Objections and Answers you have already heard; and if I can understand the Enquirer, he says this as plainly, and in more obnoxious Terms than the Dean has done.</p>
            <p>To prove the possibility of <hi>a Trinity in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> he argues from the possibility of God's uniting <hi>two Spirits</hi> by as close an Union, as he has united <hi>Spirit and Body,</hi> which make One Man; <hi>and if it were possible to him</hi> (God) <hi>to unite Two, would it not be as possible to unite Three:</hi> So that he represents<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Calm Discourse</hi> p. 19, 20, 21.</note> the Trinity in Unity, by the Union of Three Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; <hi>which are distinguished by their own individual Essences,</hi> and <hi>remain distinct by their singular Essences; so as to be everlastingly united, but not Identified, and by Vertue of that Union be some one thing, as much, and as truly as our Soul and Body united do constitute One Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now from the possibility of <hi>such an Union with such a distinction</hi> in created Spirits, he concludes the possibility of such <hi>an Union unmade; or that is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> 
               <hi>and eternal, in an unmade or uncreated Being;</hi> that is, That Three eternal, unmade, uncreated Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits may be thus united in One Godhead; that is, That there are, or may be (for whatever he thinks, which may be easily guessed at, he will not positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assert it) <hi>Three eternal, uncreated Minds</hi> in the Unity of the Godhead.</p>
            <p>This he proves from <hi>the Incarnation, That the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Two Natures, the Humane (made up of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 25.</note> 
               <hi>an Humane Body and Humane Soul, which are Two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly different Natures) with the Divine (which is a Third, and infinitely more different from both the</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:100659:53"/>

            </p>
            <p>And that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost have their distinct Essences, he proves also from the Doctrine of the Incarnation, since <hi>the Man Christ is confessed to be in Hypostatical Union with the uncreated Spiritual Being of God, not as that Being is in the Person of the Father, nor as in the Person of the Holy Ghost; for then they should have become Man too; but as it was in the Person of the Son only, why should it be thought less possible, That Three uncreated Spiritual Beings</hi> (which the Animadverter will no more allow of them of <hi>Three eternal Minds) may be in so near an Union with each other, as to be One God, as that a created Spirit (and Body too) should be in so near an Union with One of the Persons in the Godhead only, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be One Person? Will it not hereby be much more apprehensible, how One of the Persons (as the common way of speaking is) should be Incarnate, and not the other Two? Will not the Notion of Person it self be much more unexceptionable, when it shall be supposed to have its own individual Nature?—Will it be Tritheism and inconsistent with the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged invioluble Unity of the Godhead?</hi>

            <p>A great deal more to this purpose you may find in his first Letter to Dr. <hi>Wallis, p.</hi> 100, &amp;c. and whether this be <hi>Tritheism</hi> or not, he had best ask the Animadverter, who charged the Dean's Hypothesis with <hi>Tritheism,</hi> with much less Reason: And, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, I am amazed, that after all this he should so industriously Vindicate himself from Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s

Notion of <hi>Three infinite Minds or Spirits,</hi> for <hi>Three</hi>

               <hi>distinct Substances</hi> the Dean does not assert; and if the Enquirer has not all this while been proving, <hi>Three Spirits, Three distinct Essences, Three individual Natures</hi> in the Godhead, no Man living can guess what he means; for my part, I cannot tell where the difference is, unless it be in the Term of <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite;</hi> for his <hi>Three Spirits,</hi> and <hi>Essences,</hi> and <hi>individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Natures,</hi> which make up his Unity of the Godhead, as he has represented it, do not seem to be infinite.</p>
            <p>But he shelters himself from the Animadverter, whom he seems to be terribly afraid of, in Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick uncertainty, and thinks he may safely dispute as he pleases, and all on one side, so long as he <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts</hi> nothing; though I cannot see how the Dean was more dogmatical than the Enquirer, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed his Hypothesis only as a possible and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Notion; every Body indeed might guess, what the Dean's private Opinion was, and so they may, what the Enquirer conceives about it, but he was far enough from imposing upon other Men, by asserting, That thus it must be, and it cannot be otherwise: He was only concerned to represent a possible and intelligible Notion; and that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer pretends to as much as he, and therefore falls under the same Condemnation: Nay, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer is much more exposed to the Charge of <hi>Tritheism,</hi> by asserting, <hi>Three distinct Essences, Three individual Natures,</hi> and <hi>Three spiritual Beings,</hi> than the Dean was, who never said any such thing, and the Animadverter charges him with it only by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, That Three Minds are Three distinct Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and Essences, which he may deny, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for him; but the Enquirer says it in express
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100659:54"/>
words. The Dean allows but One Divine Essence, and One individual Nature in the Godhead, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in Three Persons, but without multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as I have already explained it; and how to own Three Essences, and Three individual Divine Natures in the Godhead, without making Three Gods, seems to have some difficulty in it. For Three individual Natures in the Deity, seem to sound very like Three individual Natures in Humanity, which make Three Men.</p>
            <p>But though the Enquirer has distinguished Father, Son, and Holy Ghost by <hi>their singular Essences,</hi> much more than the Dean has, yet he thinks he has also made a more close Union between them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not so liable to the Charge of <hi>Tritheism.</hi> For as he says, reflecting upon the Dean's Notion,<note place="margin">Pag. 45.</note> 
               <hi>An Hypothesis in this Affair, which leaves out the very Nexus, the natural and eternal Union, or leaves it out of its proper place, and insists upon Mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consciousness, which, at the most, is but a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof, wants the principal thing requisite to the salving the Unity of the Godhead. If Two or Three created Spirits had never so perfect a mutual Perspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one another, that would not constitute them One thing, tho' it probably argue them to be so, and but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably.</hi> This is all a mistake of the Dean's Notion of <hi>Mutual-consciousness,</hi> as I have sufficiently shown, which is not a <hi>Mutual-perspection,</hi> or <hi>Mutual-insight into one another,</hi> but a feeling each other in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and if such an <hi>internal vital Sensation</hi> be not an essential Union, I believe no Man can tell me what it is. It is certain, the Dean took it to be so; and therefore he did not <hi>leave out a natural, eternal Union.</hi> Whatever the <hi>Nexus,</hi> as he calls it, be, if
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100659:54"/>
they are united into a Mutual-conscious Life, they are essentially One, and I am sure he can never form any Notion of the <hi>Union of Spiritual Essences</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
            <p>But I have said enough of this already, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall now briefly consider, how the Enquirer unites these <hi>Three distinct Essences, Three spiritual Beings, Three individual Natures</hi> in the Unity of the Godhead. And I believe the Dean will like his Unity of the Godhead, as little as his distinction.</p>
            <p>He represents this by the Union of Soul and Body, which makes One Man; and by the Union of the Divine and Humane Nature, which makes One Christ, as you see by what I have already cited: But these are Personal Unions, and therefore cannot be the Unity of the Godhead, in which is a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of distinct Persons. And yet, as far as I can possibly understand him (and if I mistake him, I shall be glad for many Reasons to be better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) no other Unity will satisfie him, but such an Union of Three Spiritual Beings, and individual Natures, as by their composition constitute the Godhead, as the composition of Soul and Body make the Man.</p>
            <p>For this reason he disputes earnestly against the <hi>universal, absolute, omnimodous simplicity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Nature,</hi> and will not allow, that Wisdom, Power, and Goodness, are the same thing in God, and distinguished into different Conceptions by us, only through the Weakness of our Understandings, which cannot comprehend an infinite Being in one Thought, and therefore must as well as we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template him by Parts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:100659:55"/>This prepared his way to make <hi>Three spiritual</hi>

               <hi>necessary Beings</hi> of these Three Divine Attributes, <hi>Goodness, Wisdom, and Power,</hi> the natural Union of which make One God, and a natural Trinity in Unity.</p>
            <p>If you object, <hi>That this gives us the Notion of a compounded Deity, or of a composition in it;</hi> he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers this difficulty, by giving us a new Notion of<note place="margin">Pag. 34.</note> a <hi>Compositum;</hi> which, he says, <hi>seems to imply a prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existing component, that brings such things together, and supposes such and such more simple things to have prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existed apart, or separate, and to be brought afterwards together into an united State:</hi> that is to say, That how many Parts soever any thing consists of, you must not say it is a compound Being, unless its Parts were once asunder, and put together by some other Being: That if a Man suppose, who consists of Body and Soul, had been from Eternity without a Maker, and his Soul and Body had never subsisted apart, he could not have been said to have been a compound Creature, though he would have had the same Parts then that he has now, that is, Soul and Body; and therefore, though God does consist of Parts, of those <hi>Three spiritual Beings,</hi> and <hi>individual Natures,</hi> the Union of which makes the Godhead, yet he is not <hi>a Compounded Deity,</hi> because he eternally and necessarily is, what he is, without a Maker; and these <hi>Three spiritual Beings,</hi> never did praeexist a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, but were eternally united to each other: The Summ of which is no more but this, That God is not a made Compound, but an eternal unmade Compound; but a Compound he is, as a Compound signifies a Being, which consists of distinct Parts, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to each other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:100659:55"/>But I always thought, That the whole Christian World, who have always denied any Parts or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position in God, did not by this mean, that he was not made, but that he had no Parts; and one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Argument against all Parts and Composition in God, is, That he is eternal and unmade, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has Parts must have a Maker.</p>
            <p>There can be but One eternal Nature, and yet if there be Three eternal Parts of the Deity, there must be Three eternal Natures, not only distinct, but different Natures, or else they could not be Parts in the Composition, for they would be the same: Three Spiritual Beings, One of which is Goodness, another Wisdom, and a third Power, are Three different eternal Natures, how closely soever they are united; for, as he argues, Goodness is not Wisdom, nor Wisdom Power, nor Power Wisdom or Goodness, and Three different eternal Natures is a new No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among Christians.</p>
            <p>And though we have a natural Notion of an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Being, we have no Notion of an eternal Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of eternal Parts, or of Three eternal Parts in the Deity, which necessarily coexist in an eternal Union.</p>
            <p>Once more, We have no Notion of an eternal and necessary Existence, but in an absolutely perfect and infinite Nature; but if there be Three Parts in the Deity, Three Spiritual Beings of distinst and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Natures, neither of them can be absolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and infinite, (though we could suppose their Union to make such a perfect Being) because they are not the same, and neither of them is the whole; and therefore they cannot necessarily Exist, and yet a Deity, which consists of Parts, cannot necessarily
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100659:56"/>
Exist, unless its Parts necessarily Exist; for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Being can Exist no otherwise than its Parts Exist.</p>
            <p>But there is something in this, which seems to have a very ill Aspect upon the Trinity it self, as well as on the Unity and Simplicity of the Divine Nature. He <hi>Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 37.</note> indeed, <hi>not to Iudge, that we are under the precise Notions of Power, Wisdom, and Goodness, to conceive of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;</hi> though he has been for several Pages together Vindicating such a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of the Trinity, and teaching us thus to conceive of <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> and thinks That <hi>this gives ease to our Minds, by their being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entangled from any apprehended necessity of thinking these</hi> (Power, Wisdom, and Goodness) <hi>to be the very same things,</hi> and if they be not the same thing, but Three really distinct Spiritual Beings, we must thus conceive of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and then the difficulty is in a <hi>Compounded Deity,</hi> by what name to call the Three Parts of the Composition, <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> whether, as we are taught in the <hi>Athanasian Creed,</hi> we must own each of them <hi>by himself, to be God and Lord?</hi> For if all Three, by this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position are but One God, neither of them by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is true and perfect God; no more than a Part can be the Whole: This might be thought a very invidious consequence, had not he himself expresly owned it. <hi>The Father, Son, and Spirit, being supposed</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 47.</note> 
               <hi>necessarily existent in this united State, they cannot but be God, and the Godhead by reason of this necessary Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot but be One.</hi> Yet so, <hi>As that when you predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Godhead, or the name of God, of any one of them, you herein express a true, but inadaequate conception of God,</hi> i. e. <hi>The Father is God, not excluding the Son</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:100659:56"/>
               <hi>and Holy Ghost; the Son is God, not excluding the Father and the Holy Ghost; the Holy Ghost is God, not excluding the Father and the Son. As our Body is the Man, not excluding the Soul, our Soul is the Man, not excluding the Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Comparison of the Soul and Body, which are the Parts of a Man, and whose Union makes a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect Man, explains what he means by the <hi>inadaequate Conception of God,</hi> when we apply the Name <hi>God</hi> distinctly to Father Son and Holy Ghost, and in what Sence he says, <hi>the Father is God, but not so as to exclude the Son,</hi> &amp;c. All Orthodox Christians own, That the Father is God, not excluding the Son, and the Holy Ghost; and that the Son is God, not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Father, and the Holy Ghost, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but then by this they mean, That the Father is true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God, has the whole entire Divinity in himself, but yet the same whole entire Divinity distinctly and inseparably subsists in the Person of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, that the same whole undivided Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature subsists entirely in Three distinct Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and therefore each of them by himself in the most proper and adaequate Conception is true and perfect God, tho' all Three are but one and the same God. But the Inquirers Notion of God, as applied to each Person, is a very <hi>inadaequate</hi> Notion, for it signifies only a part of the Deity, That the Father is God, because he is a part of the Godhead, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, God, as parts also of the same One Godhead; as the Soul is the Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause part of the Man; and the Body also the Man, as part of the Man; and therefore Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are each of them God, but so as not to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100659:57"/>
exclude each other, as no One essential Part can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the rest.</p>
            <p>This is such a Notion of the Unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, as neither the Scriptures, nor the ancient Church knew any thing of; and I think there is little need to confute it. In short, as it makes a compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Deity, so it makes but One compounded Person; for if the Godhead be but One by Composition, as the Man is by the Union of Soul and Body, if God be a Person he can be but One: For if you call the Three Parts of the Godhead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Three Persons, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them is God, but in a very improper and figurative Sence, as a Part is called by the Name of the whole; so that either there is no Person in the Godhead, who is true and perfect God, or there must be but One compounded Person, as there is One compounded Godhead, and there is an end of the Christian Trinity. Some late Socinian Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have been willing to compound this Dispute of a Tinity of Divine Persons, for the Three Attributes of Power, Wisdom, and Goodness; and if you have a mind to call these <hi>Three Spiritual Beings,</hi> I believe, they will not contend much about it; for they are not so much afraid of Three Parts of a Deity, as of Three Divine Persons, each of which is true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God.</p>
            <p>This also necessarily destroys the <hi>Homoousion,</hi> or Sameness of Nature, which the ancient Church assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Persons of the Holy Trinity; for <hi>Three Spiritual Beings,</hi> which are the Parts of this <hi>compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Deity,</hi> cannot be the same, no more than Soul and Body are; for the Parts of a compound, how closely soever they are united, cannot be the same;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100659:57"/>
for Three Sames, are not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Three Parts, but Three Wholes. As to take his own Representation of it: If Power, Wisdom, and Goodness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Son, and Holy Ghost, it is certain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he ow<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, that Power is not the same with Wisdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; nor Wisdom the same with Power and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and therefore the Son is not of the same Nature with his Father.</p>
            <p>Which is another thing to be considered in the Enquirer's Notion, that it destroys the Relations of the Ever-blessed Trinity; for if Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, be Three Parts of a compounded Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though we should grant, that their Union might make One God, yet these Parts could neither beget, nor be begotten, nor proceed from each other, and therefore could not be related to each other, as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Son, and Spirit, but only as Three parts of the same <hi>Compositum.</hi> If Power be the Father, and Wisdom the Son, how comes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wisdom to be the Son of Power, and not to be Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Father is, since a Father begets his own Likeness? This destroys the natural Order and Subordination of the Persons in the Trinity; if Power, Wisdom and Goodness be Three real distinct things, and Three Spiritual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which compleatly constitute the Godhead, let any Man tell me, which of these Three in order of Nature is the first, second, or third; why one is the Father, the other the Son, and the third the Holy Ghost. This makes me wonder to hear him talk of <hi>Promanations;</hi> for an Emanative Cause never produces any thing but of its own Nature, as Light naturally flows from the Sun.</p>
