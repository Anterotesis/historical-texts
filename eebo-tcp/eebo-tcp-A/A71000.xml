         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ccording to my laſt unto you, I ſet ſaile on the third
of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1643. out of Kinſayle to ply to the Eaſtward,
and between the Saul-tiers and the Smales, I made a
Sayle ſome two leagues to the Eaſtward, on the fifth
of the ſame moneth, in the Morning, and at Even fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her up, ſhe proved to be a veſsell belonging to
North Yarmouth, and come from Strangford in Ireland, laden with
wood, and bound for Milford in Wales, to deliver there: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
what newes, the Maſter told mee that hee met with Captaine
<hi>Iordan,</hi> in the Expedition, who had taken a Hamburger, burthen
about three hundred Tuns, of force, ſixteene Gunnes, being laden with
Salt and other proviſions, ſhe came from Rochell in France, and was
bound for the reliefe of the Rebells, and was taken before St. Davids
head on the Coaſt of Wales, the Maſter further informed me, that he did
beleeve Captain <hi>Iordan</hi> was gon for Milford, and I having a great deſire to
meet with Captain <hi>Iordan,</hi> I bore in for that Harbour, not knowing how
he might be engaged, and in caſe I found him not there, then to deſire the
Gentlemen of that County to ſend Heu and Cry to apprehend divers paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Captain <hi>Iordan</hi> had forced on Sheare before he got poſſeſſion
of the prize, and when I came before the Harbours mouth, a Fiſherman
came on board of me, who told me that in Milford there were two ſhips,
men of War, the one was the fellowſhip of Briſtoll, burthen about foure
hundred Tunnes, of force, 24 Gunnes, having in her Foure Captains, <hi>viz.</hi>
Captain <hi>Barnaby Burley,</hi> Captain <hi>Brooks,</hi> Captain <hi>William Hayle,</hi> and
Captain <hi>Baniſter,</hi> the other was the Hart Friggot, wherein commanded
Captain <hi>Richard Neſſon,</hi> the ſaid Captains had ſummoned aboard the
Fellowſhip all the Gentry in thoſe parts, and certified that the King had
raſten Briſtoll, and that all the Kingdom did now repaire unto his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie
to ſeek for his gracious pardon, and that the Parliaments forces were
all overthrown, and that His Maieſtie would ſuddenly march for London,
all Kent being now in armes to aſſiſt the King, Chattom and Rochell were
alſo taken, therefore they would adviſe that County preſently to preſent a
Petition to His Maieſtie, in tender of their ſervice unto him, and alſo to
raiſe ſuch a conſiderable ſum of money, as they in their wiſdom ſhould
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50898:2"/>
conceive meet to comply with His Maieſties occaſions, and ſo come aboard
them, and they would preſent them to His Majeſtie, but in caſe they ſhould
not doe this, then they and their poſterity were ruined for ever, for Prince
<hi>Rupert</hi> would immediately come down and Plunder their Countrey: And
his Majeſtie had ſent them out to command all his Maieſties ſhips, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhips that were on that, or the Iriſh coaſt, that on their Allegiance
they ſhould repaire to <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and the Commanders &amp; Marriners ſhould
have his Majeſties gracious pardon, and the Commanders ſhould receive
from his Majeſtie both imployment, honour, and great reward, and the
Marriners ſhould have a large gratuitie, Vpon this intelligence, I called to
me all the Officers of the Swallow, and then the ſhips company, informed
them, what I had heard, and that the ſhip was rich, having aboard her, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
goods belonging to the Marchants of Briſtoll to preſerve from plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
all which the owners of the ſhip had trayterouſly delivered with
their ſhip into the hands of the Cavaleirs, And that if they would fight for
it, their love and zeal to Gods cauſe would be made viſible to all men, and
it would very much daunt the enemie, and be a good example for others
to traſe them in the ſteps of vallour and vertue, Alſo it would manifeſt their
thankfulneſse to the Parliament, who had conferred ſuch favours, as firſt
a gratuitie, then the increaſe of their wages, all which muſt needs bring a
bleſſing on them, and I doe not doubt, but that it ſhould pleaſe God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
the Ships into our hands, but that the Parliament would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
their conſtancy in gratifying their fidelity according to the value of
the prize, and then demanding their reſolutions, they cryed all as one man,
God bleſſe the King and Parliament, and that they would ſtand by mee,
to the laſt man, and then I bore in for the Harbour, it being monday the
Seventh of Auguſt 1643. where I found the ſaid Ship at Anchor, but the
Commanders had made us from the top of a hill, before we came in, and
had fitted their ſhips, and put aboard their Wayſtcloathes, and when I
came within ſhot, there came off a Boat from the fellowſhip, towards the
Swallow, and in it one Captain <hi>Iohn Brooks,</hi> holding forth a white flag,
who deſired a parley upon condition I would let him return aboard the
Fellowſhip if we could not accord, to which I conſented, then he came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
and leaping down into the Wayſt, he cryed, God bleſſe King
<hi>Charles,</hi> to which we all ſaid, Amen. The which being done, the ſaid
Captain deſired to have ſome private conference with me, but I refuſed
it, ſaying, I deſire to hear nothing from him, but what the whole ſhips com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
might hear, but he preſſed it the ſecond time, and being denied the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50898:3"/>
ſaid Captain turned himſelf to the ſhips company, relating unto them the
words formerly ſpecified in demonſtrating the Kings grace and mercy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
towards us, in caſe we would comply and carry the ſhip to Briſtoll,
but then I commanded him to ſilence, ſaying, it did ſeem ſtrange unto me,
that he ſhould dare to take the Kings name in his mouth, in regard that
both he and his confederates appeared unto me to be Pyrats, and Sea-Rovers,
in that they had taken and rifled a double Shallop that belonged
to his Majeſties Fleet, now on the coaſt of Ireland, having five ſmall Guns
in her, but the ſaid Captain replyed, They had a Commiſſion for what they
had done, under the hand of Sir <hi>Iohn Pennington,</hi> and that Captain <hi>Hayle</hi>
had another under the hand of Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and that Sir <hi>Iohn Penning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
was High Admirall by Patent under the great Seal of England; I told
him I had no ſuch intelligence of any ſuch Patent, either from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or from the Honourable the Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> or any Order to obey
it, and for that of Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> he being a ſtranger, I could not perceive
by what vertue or power his Highneſſe could give Commiſſion to any to
rob, or take his Majeſties ſhips, or other ſhips belonging to any of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Loyall Subjects. And therefore untill I could be better ſatiſfied; I
would uſe my beſt indeavour to ſeize on their perſons, and ſhips, as Pirats,
or ſinck by their ſide.</p>
            <p>And in the interim of this diſcourſe, the Swallow was come to Anchor
on her broad ſide, and then Captain <hi>Brooks</hi> deſired me to certifie ſo much
in writing to Captain <hi>Burley;</hi> and while I went into the Cabine to write,
the Fellowſhip had cut her Cable, and was under ſaile, intending to run
a ſhoare; and being informed thereof by the Maſter, we came out, and I
commanded the Gunner to give fire to a peece of Ordnance, the which
was done; but within a Cable length the Fellowſhip came aground, and
in purſuit of her, we cut and alſo came aground a little ahead of her, and
then I gave her two peeces of Ordnance; whereupon Captain <hi>Burley</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
on the Poope, and cried, Captain hold, hold; then I commanded
him a board, who when he came told me he would deliver up the ſhip,
if I would promiſe on the faith of a Gentleman to ſet the Commanders
and ſhips company on ſhoare, or give them a double ſhallop to carry
them to <hi>Briſtol</hi> the which if I refuſed to doe, he had left thoſe on board
would ſet the ſhip on fire; then I replied unto him, that burne ſhe ſhould,
for I was reſolved not to part with any one man of them, for I valued them
more then I did the ſhip: but in the meane time I had ſent a letter to the
Maſter &amp; ſhips company, that if they would deliver up the other two Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50898:3"/>
with their ſhip, I did promiſe them all a free entertainment, and
that they ſhould have their wages paid, and all ſuch goods as they could
make appeare juſtly to belong to any of them: upon the receipt of which
letter, the Maſter and Marriners did deliver up the ſhip without the loſſe
or hurt of any one man (God be praiſed) only when the Hart Frigot par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from us, to run a ſhoare, we gave her an unhappy ſhot, and killed two
men, and hurt one; but Captain <hi>Neſſon</hi> who commanded in her, carried
her eight miles up the River, and ran her a ſhoare in a Creek; but ſhe was
purſued by Captain <hi>Rew Williams,</hi> and there was exchanged divers ſhot
between them, but <hi>Neſſon</hi> ran away with moſt of his men, and left her, and
the next day Captain <hi>Williams</hi> brought her off, in which ſervice, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
doth crave his Lordſhips Protection: Having perfected this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
the next day, I ſet ſayle in purſuit of my Admirall, to acquaint him
with our proceedings, and alſo that Briſtoll was loſt, and the fleet is now
repairing there to command out fleet, wherein Sir <hi>Iohn Pennington</hi> is to
come out Admirall, that ſo we might uſe our beſt endeavours to nip theſe
proceedings in the bud, and having acquainted my Admirall herewith, it
is agreed on, that forthwith we repaire to <hi>Milford</hi> to endeavour to get
our ſhips want of victualls ſupplyed, the which if we ſhall doe I hope God
will enable us to perform ſome good ſervice in the preventing of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
out of that fleet, either by inviting them to comply with us, or elſe
to deſtroy them in the Harbour, And this is my Admiralls, and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
reſolution, if it ſhall pleaſe God to enable us with victualls to ſubſiſt
on this Coaſt, to which I doubt not, but our God will give a bleſſing in
that he hath been pleaſed to give ſuch good ſucceſſe in the ſurpriſing of one
of their beſt ſhips, as alſo the Friggot, the which is a great encouragement to
us, and doubtleſſe as great a diſheartning unto them who ſeek their King
and Countreys ruine, endeavouring to upheld that Antichriſtian beaſt,
whom God hath ſaid, Muſt down, to whoſe protection I commit you, and
take my leave, and reſt.</p>

Gentleman, who is as I am, that <hi>Hayle</hi> your now priſoner hath
divulged in the preſenee of ſome Gentlemen of quality of this County, that
the inhabitants of this County ſhould not reape their Corne, in caſe they
did, they ſhould not enjoy it, my deſire is, that you would be pleaſed to
vouchſafe this courteous favour, to examine and fiſh out the cauſe and
ground of this report, and withall, if you find this to be true which cannot
but prove prejudiciall the publike good, that you would write a letter, and
direct it in generall to the Gentry of this County (omitting particulars)
which I verily beleeve will turne the hearts of ſuch who are now in the
way of colapſing, ſince the taking of unconſtant Briſtoll, and unite their
hearts with ours, who are conſtant to the Cauſe, I deſire if your reſolution
comply with me (which I doubt not of) to haſten your Letter with all
ſpeed, which I know will be very thankfully received, and for my owne
particular I ſhall and will remain your very loving friend to ſerve you,</p>

            <p>TO ſatiſfie you, and the Gentlemen of this County, in the contents of
your laſt unto me concerning the menacing ſpeeches thundered out
by <hi>Hayle</hi> and his Confederates, that the Corn now on the ground ſhould
never be reaped by the Gentlemen and Commons of this County, or if it
were, you ſhould never enjoy it, are I aſſure you only the Bravadoes of a
proud inſulting Enemy, and grounded neither on judgement, or religion;
for who but our only wiſe God can tell what ſhall be hereafter, or what
2 day may produced; and I am confident the Gentry of this County are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50898:5"/>
not ignorant of the power of the Almighty, that he is able to deliver as
well by few as many, as is manifeſted unto you by multitudes of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in his revealed word: wherefore to remove your feares, the only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
I can give you is this, That in your Makers cauſe you would behave
your ſelves as becometh good Chriſtians, and valiant Souldiers of Chriſt
Ieſus, that you would gird on your ſwords, muſter your Forces, put your
ſelves in battell array, and quit your ſelves like men, putting your ſelves
under Gods protection, doubt not but his Divine Majeſty is both able and
alſo will deliver all thoſe that put their confidence in him; but without
faith our Saviour would doe no miracles while he was here on the earth:
wherefore in confidence of his aſſiſtance, there can be no greater mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
of our faith then to engage our lives and eſtates in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of his cauſe, which is the only meanes to preſerve both. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
that the Gentry of this County very well underſtand the condition
of this warre, and that it is no other then between Chriſt and Antichriſt,
and that one day his Majeſty will have great cauſe to acknowledge the
fidelity of all ſuch his loyall and obedient Subjects as have or do adhere
unto his Majeſty and his great Councell the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> in
the ſuppreſſing of that Antichriſtian Rout who have now taken up armes
to deſtroy the Proteſtant Religion, the Kings honour, and dignities, the
priviledges of Parliament, and the liberties of the Subject; in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
whereof the Parliament have been forced to take up Armes, in
which as I ſtand engaged, I ſhall be ever ready to aſſiſt and comply with
all ſuch his Majeſties loyall and faithfull Subjects, ſo farre as God ſhall
enable me, and my abilities give me leave; and in tender of my ſervice
herein to all the well-affected Gentlemen of this County, I take my
leave and reſt.</p>
