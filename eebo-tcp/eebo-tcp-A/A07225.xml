         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST Reuerend and Right Honorable zealous Lords,
your daily and faithfull Orator, being a professed Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
vnder Christs Banner, in the behalfe of his spouse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Antichrist: I could busie my selfe in no office so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
for the Church, and hurtfull vnto Antichrist, as
to gather together the bullets which haue been shot at him by Christs Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
in times past, that now his children may shoote them at him againe,
with great facilitie. And whereas venerable M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Fox,</hi> of worthy memory,
hath gathered into one Booke the Acts and Monuments of the Church vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his time; one of the most profitablest Bookes that is for Gods Children,
except the Bible; a Club able to beate downe the Popish Tower of Babell:
Yet what with the labour of reading so large a volume, together
with the deareness of the price thereof, few that haue the Booke reade
it ouer, and the most part of men are not able to buy it, whereby very
little profit ariseth thereof vnto the Church. I haue, according to my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
pared off the barke of this Club, and made it tractable for all sorts
of people; they may buy it with little charge, and peruse it with small
paines; and I dare promise them that they shall reape as much profit by
reading this abridgement, as by reading of the Booke at large. I haue
willingly omitted no matter of substance: Here the Reader may see the
cruelty of the Emperors vnto the Primitiue Church, and whom they put
<pb facs="tcp:14787:3"/>
to death, and the manner of their deathes during the first ten Persecutions;
and how, and when Christianitie began in this Realme: And what successe
it hath had at all times; and when, by what occasion, and by whom most of
the Monasteries, and Cathedrall Churches of this Realme were builded, and
how, when, and by whom, all points of Popery came into the Church; and
how the Pope hath exalted himself against Emperors &amp; Kings; what iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
he hath done to them: With the Treasons, &amp; Conspiracies that Papists
haue practised, against those that the Lord hath annointed, vnto this day:
The Reader may also heere see the innumerable multitude of the Saints of
God, that the Papists haue from time to time murdered in all Countries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
the testimonie of the Truth: With all the points of Religion that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
did defend vnto death; and all the reasons that the Papists vsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Arguments, and how cruelly they handled them; with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
most profitable things. After I had done this Booke, I was discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from putting of it to Print, by reason I found another had abridged the
Booke of Martyrs before me; but when I perceiued it was done but super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially,
for all the points of Religion that the Martyrs defended, or Papists
obiected were omitted; (which disputations I chiefly labour to set forth)
therevpon I was resolued to goe forward. When I had begun to quote all the
Authors, from whence <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Fox</hi> had his proofes for them that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
put to death, the Quotations were almost as large as the Story, and
made it very vnpleasant: wherefore in most places, for breuitie, I haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
them, leauing them that would see the proofes to the Book at large.
I haue herein abridged many bookes, but especially the Booke of Martyrs;
as the Papists cannot abide the booke of Martyrs of all bookes: so much
more will they hate my booke, which hath so truely and briefely discouered
all their shame, not onely out of that booke, but out of diuers other bookes.
Wherefore most Reuerend, and Right Honorable Lords, your manifest
dislike that you beare against the wickednes and falshood of Antichrist;
hath imboldned me to be an humble sutor vnto your Lordships, to bee the
Patrons of this my Booke, and that you would vouchsafe to defend and
further it, by your Spirituall and Temporall Powers, to the honour of
Christ, the great dishonour of Antichrist, and the vnspeakeable benefit of
Gods Children. So with my hartie prayers, I commit both your Honors,
your soules, bodies, and all that you haue, vnto the safe preseruation of
Christ Iesus and his holy Angels.</p>

fulfilling of those prophecies in all points:
all the Martyrs died in this faith, that the
Pope is Antichrist. I could bethink my selfe
of no instruction so profitable for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of this Booke, as to giue thee a few rules to manifest vnto
thee that the Popedome is that Antichrist; which I will endeuor
to declare vnto thee by these rules following: first, by his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
place of abode; secondly, by his inward and spirituall
throne; thirdly, by his doctrine; fourthly, by his conditions;
fiftly, by the height, breadth, length and ruine of his Kingdome.
I will but open the way vnto thee, this Booke shall proue by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
my sayings to be true.</p>
            <p>Touching his outward seate, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 17. 18. it is the Citie that
then did raigne ouer the Kings of the earth, which was Rome:
the place is also described in the ninth verse, to be compassed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with seuen mountaines. This Booke shall proue that Rome
hath seuen mountaines about it. In the same verse, this Citie
hath had fiue kings that were then falne, another King did raign,
which was the Emperour, when the Reuelation was made, and
another was to come afterward. This book shall teach thee, that
the seuen Kings signifie seuen maner of Gouernments in Rome,
of which fiue was falne, the Emperour then raigned, and after
the Pope should raigne there: so the Holy Ghost hath pointed
out Rome, as plainly as can be, the place of Antichrists King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14787:4"/>
Touching his inward or spirituall seat, S. <hi>Paule 2. Thess.</hi> 2. 24.
saith, <hi>He sitteth as God in the Temple of God:</hi> Antichrist signifieth
an aduersary of Christ; and if it had bin meant of the Turke, or
any other aduersary that did not professe Christianitie, he might
easily be seene without so many reuelations: but hee is, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the description of a false Prophet, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 15. a most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
Wolfe to Christs Lambs, and yet so couered with a sheeps
skin, that it is impossible to know him without the spirit of God.
Outwardly he seemeth to be a good tree, but his fruit is nothing
but thornes and thistles to destroy Gods children. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 24.
Christ calleth them false Christs and false Prophets, prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they shall do such wonders, that if it were possible they
should deceiue the elect; so thou seest the Antichrist which is
prophecied of must be a professor of Christ, as the Pope is, which
calleth himselfe the Catholique Church, but he is the onely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary
thereof, as this book will teach thee by experience.</p>
            <p>Touching the third point, to know him by his doctrines, 1.
<hi>Tim. 4. 1: They shall depart from the faith, and follow doctrines of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels,
and speake lies through hypocrisie: they shall haue their consciences
seared with an hote iron forbidding to marrie and commaunding to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from meats:</hi> and they teach the same superstitious doctrins
that <hi>S. Paule</hi> warneth vs from <hi>Coloss. 2. 16. Let no man condemne
you in meat and drinke, or in respect of an holy-day, or a new Moone, nor
Sabboths, nor make you forsake Christ the head in worshipping Angels,
neither let them burden you with traditions, as touch not, tast not, handle
not,</hi> which things haue a shew of wisedome, in that the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
be voluntary religious, and humble their mindes, and spare
not their bodies, nor haue their bodies in any estimation, but all
is nothing but to fulfill a fleshly religion: and <hi>Iude</hi> in his twelfth
verse compareth them to clouds which in a drieth seem to bring
raine but doe not: for, though they make great promises of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of soules, yet there is no true hope of remission of sins, nor
assurance of eternall happinesse in their doctrines. And in 2. <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 17. he calleth them Wells, not with a little water, but quite
without water: for although by name they professe the Trinity,
yet their doctrins of euery person of the Trinitie, and of al other
points of religion, are contrary to wholsome doctrine, they
maintaine their doctrines, though falsely, vnder the names of
<pb facs="tcp:14787:4"/>
the Scriptures, the Catholique Church, and the auncient fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
this is the golden cup that the Church of Antichrist holdeth in her
hand, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 17. 4. but it is full of abominations and filthines of her
fornications: so if thou marke this booke, it is easie to know Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
by the falsenesse and wickednesse of all his doctrines, yet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
ouer with glorious shewes of truth and wholsomnesse, yea,
although thou haddest no other meanes to discerne him by.</p>
            <p>Touching the fourth point of the conditions of Antichrist, <hi>Iude</hi>
in the eleuenth verse, saith, They follow the way of <hi>Caine:</hi> all the
persecutions of Gods children before times were but types and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
of the Papists in killing their brethren, as <hi>Caine</hi> did, because
they please God better then they. The abominable desolations of
<hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> and of <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Vespasian</hi> of the materiall Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
were but prophecies of the Papists abominable desolations of
Gods Saints. For this cause Antichrist is called in the Reuelation
a great redde Dragon, a Serpent, and a cruell Beast. S. <hi>Iohn Reuel.</hi> 17.
6. foresaw the Church of Antichrist, drunken with the bloud of the
Saints and Martyrs of Iesus Christ. And although he had seen all
the persecutions that were before or in his time, yet he wondred at

               <hi>Iude</hi> in his 12. verse saith, <hi>They are cast away in the deceit of Baa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lams
wages:</hi> for as <hi>Baalam,</hi> though he knew the Israelites to bee the
blessed of God, yet he would haue cursed them for lucre sake if God
would haue suffered him, so the Papists maintaine doctrines which
they know to be false, and commit all their murders of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
only to maintaine their Kitchin pleasures, honour, glorie, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and other worldly respects, as it shall plainly appear vnto thee
in this Booke.</p>
            <p>In 2. <hi>Pet. 2. 14. Their eyes are full of adultery, and they cannot cease to
sinne, beguiling vnstable soules.</hi> This Booke will shew thee how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeably
wicked they are, according to this prophecie: they are
spiritually called Sodom, because in that case they exceede in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
the Sodomites. These and many other wicked conditions
of theirs, are plentifully prophecied of in the Scriptures; and thou
shalt see the true performances of the prophecies in this book, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
wicked conditions shall plainly shew the Pope to be Antichrist.</p>
            <p>Touching the height of Antichrists Kingdome, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 17. 3. the
Church of Antichrist is said to sit vpon a skarlet coloured beast, ful
<pb facs="tcp:14787:5"/>
of names of blasphemy, which is the Pope, who is a bloudy beast to
Gods children, &amp; takes all Gods names blasphemously to himself:
and <hi>vers.</hi> 4. he &amp; his Church are arrayed with purple &amp; skarlet, and
deckt with gold, precious stones &amp; pearls; and how gloriously the
Pope and his Church hath bin set forth, &amp; how rich they haue bin,
according to this prophecy, this book wil shew thee. In 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 14
<hi>He sitteth as God in the Temple of God, and exalteth himself aboue all that
is called God. C. Caesar Caligula</hi> the Emperor, which vsed to sit in the
Temples of the Idols, to be honored as God, &amp; caused his picture to
be set vp to be worshipt in all Temples, and in the Temple of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
yet was he not such an abominable Idol as the Pope maketh
himselfe to be: he is the Gaoler of Purgatory, and thither comes (as
he saith) all the soules of Christians, except som few, to whom for
building some religious houses, and for being otherwise a speciall
maintainer of his kingdome: hee giueth a speciall prerogatiue, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
to go to heauen: these soules his prisoners hee punisheth
how, and as long as he list, and at his pleasure he throweth any of
them into hell, or sendeth any of them into heauen. Of the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of this Gaole hath all the Popes riches, honour, &amp; superioritie
aboue Emperors, and Kings proceeded: he hath taken from Christ
the honor of pardoning sins to himselfe: God made man of clay,
but the Pope and all his shauelings can daily make God of a piece
of bread. In these, and many other respects (as this booke will teach
thee) doth the Pope exalt himself as God, according to this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie;
and he exalts himselfe aboue all kings, which are called Gods,
and at his pleasure with excommunications can cast them out of
heauen and out of their kingdoms, as himselfe saith: he hath trode
vpon Emperours, &amp; made them kisse his feet, hold his stirrups, and
leade his horse. He made the Emperor <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. his wife and his child
to wait three daies and three nights bare-foot in winter at his gates,
to sue to him for his fauor, and gaue away his Empire in the meane
time. This prophecie of Antichrists exaltation aboue Princes, is
verified in none but the Pope.</p>
            <p>Touching the breadth of his kingdom, it is not said he shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
himselfe aboue one or two, but aboue all that are called God, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
are all Christian rulers, spiritual &amp; temporal, to whom God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safeth
this name, because hee ruleth and instructeth by them, and
dwelleth in them, if they be good: this declareth the large limits of
his kingdome. And as he is said heere to exalt himselfe aboue all
<pb facs="tcp:14787:5"/>
Kings, so <hi>Reu.</hi> 17. 3. he is said to haue ten horns; and in <hi>ver.</hi> 12. they
are interpreted to be ten Kings, which shal giue their power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
vnto the beast, that is to say, the beastly Pope, and fight with
the Lambe, that is, they shal be the Popes Butchers to destroy Gods
children; and as the prophecies foretell such an Antichrist as shall
raigne ouer all Christian Princes, so this storie shall shew thee the
true fulfilling of this prophesie in the Pope.</p>
            <p>Touching the length of his Kingdome, it is prophecied Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
shall raigne three yeares and a halfe; and in <hi>Reuel.</hi> 12. three
times and a halfe: these times and these yeares are all one; so is the
fortie two moneths, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 13. 5. for there be so many moneths in
three years and a halfe: the same likewise is the 1260. dayes in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel.</hi>
12. 6. for there be iust so many daies in three yeares &amp; a halfe, at
360. daies to the yeare, which was the number of the dayes of the
Iewes yeare. And it is common with the prophets to set downe a
day for a year; so by these prophecies Antichrist must raign 1260.
yeares, which is iust so many yeares as Christ preached daies: and
<hi>Gregory</hi> the first sheweth that Antichrist began when one Bishop
exalted himselfe aboue all others. And though there were manie
Popes before him which did exalt themselues aboue all other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
yet he would not but haue himself called, <hi>Seruus seruoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dei.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>Sabinianus</hi> which succeeded him in the popedom,
was a malitious detractor of his works, as thou maist see in this
book. Antichrist was not at his height vntill <hi>Hildebrand</hi> had gotten
aboue the Emperor, for then he was aboue all that was called God;
yet Antichrist began when the Bishop of Rome, being the least of
all the foure Patriarchs, exalted himselfe aboue all other Bishops,
which was about the yeare of Christ 400. for then began pride and
superstition to creep into the Church, and <hi>Anno</hi> 666. according to
the number of the name of the beast in <hi>Reu.</hi> 13. 18. Latin seruice was
set vp in England and all other places, and mass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and other Romish ware, which was long before <hi>Hildebrands</hi>
time. And if we account the aforesaid 1260. yeares of Antichrists
raigne from thence, there remaineth but about 46. yeares to come,
vntil God shal call together the kings of the earth to destroy Rome.</p>
            <p>Touching the fall of his kingdom, <hi>Mat. 24. 22. If God should not
shorten his kingdom, none of Gods children could be saued from his cruelty:</hi>
but for the elects sake, <hi>Reu.</hi> 11. 13. God first destroyed the tenth part

the Lord God which will condemne her. The meanes of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction

God doth put into their hearts to fulfill his will. The manner of
the destruction of Rome and the Popedome, is declared <hi>Reu.</hi> 19. 17.
as fowles gather together to a dead carkasse, so God shall gather all
Nations together to warre against Rome, and shall take her and the
Pope, the false Prophet that worketh miracles, wherby he deceiued
all that receiued his marke, and worshipped his Image: and they

this book, that they may plainly see the pope to be Antichrist,

persecute him. The Kingdome of Christ, are the beléeuers in Christ, and take his

so betwéene these two parts of the Uisible Church oft groweth mortall persecution,
so that the true Church hath no greater enemies then her owne Professors, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened

of <hi>Origen,</hi> who but 17. yeares old desired to haue suffred with his father, but that his
mother in the night stole away his garments, and his shirt, yet he wrote to his father:

                  <hi>Beniamin,</hi> for preaching Christ, was thrust vnder the nailes with twenty sharpe

was burned, <hi>Domitius</hi> was slaine in his Caue: <hi>Theodorus</hi> singing a Psalme, was
tormented from morning to night, hardly escaped with life, and being asked how hee
could abide the torments, said, at first I felt some paine, but after there stood a young

               <p>The <hi>Arethusians</hi> of Syria, tooke a company of Uirgines, Christians, whom first
they set sorth naked to bee scorned of the multitude, then shaued them, then couered
them with draffe, and caused them to bee deuoured of Swine, their cruelty was the
greater, because <hi>Constantine</hi> restrained them, from defiling Uirgines, and destroyed
the Temple of <hi>Venus.</hi>

                  <hi>Marcus Arethusius,</hi> because, at the commaundement of <hi>Constantine,</hi> he pulled down
a Temple of Idols, and builded a Church for Christians in the place, they stripped
him naked, and beat him gréeuously, then put him in a filthy sincke, then they caused
Boyes to thrust him in with sharpe stickes, then they annointed him with Hony and
Broath, and hung him in the Sunne as meat for Waspes and Flyes, then they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
somewhat towards the building of the Temple againe: he answered, it were

Christians, he set peace amongst the Byshops at dissention; hee made prouision for
Preachers, and caused all to bee restored vnto the Christians that was taken from
them by Persecutors. He wrote to his chéefe Captaine, that Ministers should be fréed
from all publique duties and burthens: He wrote to <hi>Eusebius</hi> for the edifying of new
Churches, and after he had gathered the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel, for the vnity of the Church,

He graunted great immunities vnto the Ministers that they might appeale from

               <p>He prouided maintenance for liberall Sciences and Arts, for the Prosessors, there
Wiues and Children, and gaue them great immunities. He wrote to <hi>Eusebius</hi> By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Nicomedia, to procure fifty Uolumes of Parchment well bound, and cause
to bee written out of the Scripture therein in a leageable hand, such things as were

            <p>The Papists doe earnestly contend, that the Faith of Christ was first brought and
receiued into England from Rome, both in the time of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> their Byshop, in
the yeare 180. and also in the time of <hi>Augustine,</hi> whom <hi>Gregory</hi> sent hither in the

after the manner of the East Church, on the fouretéenth day after the full Moone,
what day soeuer it was, and not on sunday as we doe, whereby is gathered, the first
Preacher came from the East, rather then from Rome.</p>

vnder their Legate in the time of <hi>Gregory,</hi> nor would admit any primasie of the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

            <p>7 By the Epistle of <hi>Elutherius</hi> to <hi>Lucius,</hi> it appeareth that <hi>Lucius</hi> had receiued the
Faith before he wrote to <hi>Elutherius,</hi> for the Romaine Lawes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elutherius</hi> might help some-thing to conuert the King, and to increase the Faith,
but was not the first that planted it, but if it were so, it maketh nothing for them,
for he challenged no such Supremacy as they doe, and was farre from their errours
and superstitions.</p>
            <p>The Chroniles write, that about the yeare 180.<note place="margin">180</note> King <hi>Lucius,</hi> Sonne of <hi>Coylus,</hi>
which builded Colchester, hearing of the myracles of Christians in his time, writ to
<hi>Elutherius</hi> Bishop of Rome to receiue the Faith; the good Bishop sent him certaine
Preachers, which conuerted the King of the Brittaines, and baptized them, there
were the twenty eight Priests called Flamines, which they turned to twentie eight
Bishoppes, and thrée Arch-Flamins, to thrée Arch-bishops, to wit; London, Yorke,
and Glamargan by Wales. Thus all the Realme setled in good order, <hi>Lucius</hi> sent
againe to <hi>Elutherius</hi> for the Romaine Lawes, thereby likewise to gouerne the
Realme.</p>
            <p>Unto whom <hi>Elutherius</hi> wrote againe: we may reprooue the Law of the Romaines,
but the Law of GOD wee cannot reprooue: you haue with you both partes of the
Scriptures, out of them, by Gods grace, with the councell of your Realme, take
yea Law and rule your kingdome of Brittaine, for you are Gods Uicar in your king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>The Faith thus receiued of the Brittaines, continued and flourished 216 yeares,
vntill the comming of the Saxons, who then were Pagans: whilst Brittaine had thus
receiued the Faith, the Emperors of Rome were Infidels, wherefore much trouble
wos sought against them, as it was against all parts of Christendome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucius,</hi> after he had raigned about 77. yeares, died without issue: whereupon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
great misery and ruine to the Realme, for sometime the idolatrous Romaines,
and sometimes the Brittaines raigned, as violence and victory would serue; one
King murdering another, vntill at length the Saxons depriued them both.</p>
            <p>Some write<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but falsely, that King <hi>Lucius,</hi> after he was baptized, forsooke his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Honor and the Land, and became a Preacher in France and Germany, and other
places, and was made Doctor and Rector of the Church of Cureac, where hee was
martyred, but this fansie is contrary to all our English Stories, which doe agrée that
he hauing founded many Churches, and giuen great liberalities to the same, deceased
in great tranquility in his owne Land, and was buried at Glocester.</p>
            <p>Betwéene the time of King <hi>Lucius,</hi> and the entring of the Saxons, there raigned
after <hi>Lucius Seuerus</hi> a Romaine: after him <hi>Bassianus,</hi> a Romaine; after him <hi>Cerausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
a Brittaine; after him <hi>Alectus,</hi> a Romaine; after him <hi>Asclepiodotus,</hi> a Brittaine;
after him <hi>Coilus,</hi> a Brittaine; after him <hi>Constantius,</hi> a Romain; after him <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi>
a Brittain, by <hi>Helena</hi> his Mother, the Daughter of King <hi>Coilus,</hi> and Wife of
<hi>Constantius. Constantine</hi> first made the wals of London and Colchester: when the
Romaines ruled it, it was ruled by Infidels, and when the Brittains ruled, by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
yet no persecution was raised in it, vntill the tenth persecution, which was
so cruell, that all our English Chronicles report, that all Christianity almost in the
whole land was destroyed, Churches subuerted, and the Scriptures burned, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is shewed.</p>
            <p>It is worthy to be noted, that <hi>Constantine,</hi> that worthy Emperor, was not onely
a Brittaine borne, but his Mother <hi>Helena,</hi> Daughter of King <hi>Coilus</hi> a Brittaine,
but also by the helpe of the Brittaines Army, which <hi>Constantine</hi> tooke with him, with
great victories he obtained the peace of the Uniuersall Church, hauing thrée legions
with him out of this Realme, of chosen Souldiers.</p>
            <p>After, <hi>Maximinian</hi> tooke all the power that was left of fighting Men, to subdue
France, and after sent for 100000. Souldiours more at once, at which time <hi>Cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14787:16"/>
and spoyled by the way by Infidels, because they would not pollute themselues

            <p>The sinnes of the Brittaines was the cause of the iust iudgement of God
against them, as out of an old Authour, and partly out of <hi>Gildas</hi> doth appeare:
These bee the words of the Authour: There following <hi>Constantinus,</hi> and others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
named, out of the Realme all the Nobility, when the rascall sort had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
their places, and through aboundance of riches were surprised with pride, they

that mans Nature is inclined vnto; hating the truth, louing lyes, regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
euill in stead of goodnesse, receiuing the Deuill in stead of an Angell of light,
choose such for their Kings as were most cruell, and if any seemed to bee humble
and fauour the truth, they hated and backbited him as a destroyer of Brittaine, and
not onely the seculer men did thus, but also the Byshoppes and Teachers, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was no maruell that such a people should loose their Country which they had
so defiled.</p>
            <p>As there were many wicked Kinges among the Saxons, so there were some very
good, but none almost fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the first to the last, which was not either slain in war or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

their myracles, and their godly conuersation, he heard them gladly, and was conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the thirty sixe yeare of his raigne, <hi>Anno</hi> 586. After him innumerable daily
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14787:17"/>
were adioyned vnto the Church, whom the King did specially imbrase, but compelled
none, then the King gaue <hi>Austen</hi> a place for his Byshops Sea, at Christs Church in
Canterbury, and builded the Abbey there, where after <hi>Austen</hi> and all the Kings of
Kent were buried, which now is called S. <hi>Austine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Austen</hi> by the commandement of <hi>Gregory,</hi> went into France to the Bishop
of Arelatensis, to be consecrated Arch-byshop, and so was then <hi>Austen</hi> sent to <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
so declare how they had sped, and to be resolued of diuers questions, how Bishops
should behaue themselues towards their Clarke, of offerings and Ceremonies, and
what punishment for stealing Church goods, and such like, to no great purpose; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if thou béest disposed to sée them, I referre thee to the Booke at large.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregory,</hi> after he had sent resolutions to these questions, sendeth moreouer more
Coadiutors, as <hi>Melitus, Iustus, Paulinus,</hi> and <hi>Ruffianus,</hi> with Books and implements
necessary for the English Church, and in reward of <hi>Austines</hi> paines, he sent him a Pal
onely to be vsed at the solemnity of the Masse, and granteth two Metropolitane Seas,
London and Yorke, but granted to <hi>Austen</hi> during his life, to be cheefe Arch-bishop of
all the Land, and that they should not destroy the idolatrous Temples, but conuert
them to Christian vses, and that <hi>Austine</hi> should not be proud of the myracles that God
wrought by him, &amp; that he should remember they were not done for him, but for their
conuersion, whose saluation God sought thereby.</p>
            <p>Then he wrote to King <hi>Ethelbert<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> first hee praysed GOD, then the King, by
whom it pleased God to worke such goodnesse of the people, then exhorted him to
perseuer in his profession, and to be zealous therein, to conuert the multitude, and
destroy Idolatry, and to gouerne them in holinesse of conuersation, according to the
Emperor <hi>Constantinus</hi> the Great, comforting him with the promises of life, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Austine</hi> receiuing his Pall, as aboue said, and of a Monke being made an Arch-Byshop,
hee made two Metropolitanes, as <hi>Gregorie</hi> commaunded; then <hi>Austine</hi>
assembled the Byshops and Doctors of Brittaine, in this assembly, hee charged
the Byshoppes that they should preach the Word of GOD with him: also, that
they should reforme certaine rites and vsages in the Church, especially for keeping of
Easter, and baptizing after the manner of Rome, the Scots and Brittaines would
not agree thereto, refusing to leaue the custome which they so long time had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued.
<hi>Beda, Fabianus,</hi> &amp; others, write of a myracle wrought vpon a Blinde English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
when the Brittaines could not helpe him. <hi>Austine</hi> kneeling downe and
praying, restored him to sight before them all, for a confirmation (as these Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
say) of keeping of Easter, I leaue the credite of the myracle to the Authors
of whom I had it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Austine</hi> gathered another Sinode, to the which seauen Byshoppes, and the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
Men of the famous Cittie of Bangor came, they tooke councell of a holy man
whether they should be obedient to <hi>Austine,</hi> he had them agree to him if hee bee
the Seruant of GOD, and you shall know it by his humblenesse and meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
you are the greater number, if he at your comming into the Sinode arise vp
and courteously receiue you, perceiue him to be an humble and meeke man: but if
he shall contemne and despise you, despise you him againe; thus the Brittaine By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes
entring into the Councell, <hi>Austine</hi> after the Romish manner keeping
his Chaire, would not remooue, wherefore they being very much offended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,
after some heate of words, departed in great displeasure, to whom <hi>Austine</hi> said:
If they would not receiue peace with their Brethren, they should receiue war with
their Enemies.</p>
            <p>There was in Bangor in Wales an exceeding great Monastery, wherein was
two thousand and one hundred Monkes, the Monkes came out of this Monasterie
to Chester, to pray for <hi>Brocmayle,</hi> fighting for them against the Saxons, <hi>Ethelbert</hi>
King of Northumberland seeing them intenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was to pray for their Consull; he said, although they beare no Weapon, yet with
their praiers and preaching they persecute vs, he commaunded his men to kill them,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14787:18"/>
who killed, or rather martyred 1100. of them. The Authors that wrote this, say that
the forespeaking of <hi>Austine</hi> was verified on them, but <hi>Galfridus Monumetensis,</hi> saith,
that <hi>Ethelbert</hi> the King of Kent being conuerted by <hi>Austine</hi> to Christs Faith, seeing
the Brittaines deny their subiection to <hi>Austine,</hi> therefore stirred vp the said <hi>Ethelfrid</hi>
to warre against the Brittaines.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Austine</hi> had baptized 10000. in a Riuer called Swale by Yorke, on a Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas

his Baptizing in Riuers it followeth there was then no vse of Fonts, and the Rites
of baptizing in Rome was not then so ceremoniall, nor had so many trinkets as it

               <hi>Ranulphus Cestrensis</hi> writeth,<note place="margin">Poli: li. 5. ca. 10.</note> that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Patriarch of Alexandria, as he was

            <p>
               <hi>Gregory</hi> withstood the pride of <hi>Iohn,</hi> Patriarke of Constantinople, which would

            <p>After <hi>Phocas</hi> had murdered his owne Maister <hi>Mauricius</hi> the Emperor and his

they haue maintained the same with all force and pollicy, by the word of <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
Boniface</hi> may well be called the fore-runner of Antichrist, as <hi>Gregory</hi> brought

&amp; tyranny, when a man is compelled by your Decrees, to doe that which is against
the Institution of the Gospell, and the old Law, as appeareth by many examples; there
be many vnder a false pretence of Continencie, going about to please men more then
God, some lye with their fathers wiues, some are Sodomits, and play the beasts with

then 6000. Infants heads, which were taken out of the same Mote, then he confessed
his Decrée to be the cause of that so lamentable a murder, so he altered his Decrée, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
the counsell of the Apostle, which saith; <hi>It is better to marry then to burne,</hi>

had nothing to liue by, but what he got by hunting, and fishing; there was a Cottage
of a poore Swineheard, called <hi>Dunwolfus,</hi> by whom the King was cheered with such
poore fare as he and his wife could make him, for which, the king after set the Swine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard

            <p>Notwithstanding, the king, in time, was comforted by the prouidence of God: First,
1300. Danes were slaine, as they landed, by an ambushment of King <hi>Alfrids</hi> men, who
lay in Garison for their owne safetie, then the King shewed himselfe more at large, and
men out of Wiltshire, Somersetshire, and Hampshire came to him, vntill hee had a
strong company</p>
            <p>Then the king apparelled himselfe in the habit of a Minstrell, as he was very skilfull
in Musicke, and entred into the Tents of the Danes, lying at Eddingdon, and there es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
their Idlenesse, and heard much of their Counsell, and sodainly, in the nigh, he fell
vpon the Danes, and slew a great multitude of them; his Subiects bearing of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Uictories, drew to him daily, so he wonne Winchester from the Danes, and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
townes, and forced them to sêeke peace, the which was concluded, vpon condition
that <hi>Gutrum</hi> their King should be Christned, and that such as would not be Christned
should depart the Country.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Alfride,</hi> was king <hi>Gutrums</hi> Godfather at his Baptisme, and named him <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan,</hi>
then he gaue Norfolke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Suffolke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and part of Cambridgeshire, and Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land

the Realme, they did diuerse times returne againe, and did much spoile in many
parts of the Realme, but King <hi>Alfride</hi> ouercame them euer. During the whole time of
the Danes, the Land was plagued with warres, pestilence, and murren of beasts: the
King alwaies thanked God, what troubles soeuer hapned vnto him, and after hee had
raigned 29. yeares and sixe moneths, he died, and is buried at Winchester. He euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
eight houres in the day in studie,<note place="margin">899.</note> there was none in England more quicke in
vnderstanding, nor more elegant in interpreting then he was. He sent for many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men out of other Countries, to instruct his people. He was the first that ordained
certaine Schooles of diuerse Arts, at Oxford, and Franchised them with great Liberties:
he translated many bookes into the Saxon tongue; all that he could, by faire meanes and
threats, he endeuoured to stirre vp his subiects to learning: he preferred none to any
great place, except he were learned; since his time, learning was neuer extinguished in
this Realme, <hi>Edward</hi> his sonne succeeded him in his kingdoms.</p>

controuersie: some held, because of his degradation and Oath, he could not be Pope; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
held the contrary, because he was absolued by Pope <hi>Martin</hi> from that his periury

            <p>This <hi>Sergius</hi> was rude, vnlearned, proud, and cruell; he before was put backe from

was because he was by his mother of a base bloud, and begotten before wedlocke: for
King <hi>Edward,</hi> his Father, comming into his Nurses house, was rauished with the
beautie of one <hi>Edwina</hi> a beautifull maide, begat that night of her King <hi>Adelstone,</hi> and

and he builded two Monasteries of Middleton and Michlenes, for his brothers
Soule. Whereby it appeareth what was the speciall cause of building of Monasteries,

to the grace and veritie of Christs Gospell.</p>

King set his minde to building of Monasteries, and furnishing of Churches with pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions:
in his time Monks were dispersed out of the Monastery of Esham, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons

meanes also <hi>Ethelwaldus,</hi> Abbot of Abendon, was made Bishoppe of Winchester.
By the meanes of these thrée Bishoppes the multitnde of Monkes began first to
swarme in this Realme of England. By the meanes of them King <hi>Edgar,</hi> builded 40.
Monasteries, and by the instigation of them King <hi>Edgar,</hi> in diuerse great houses, and
Cathedrall Churches, where Prebends and Priests were before, displaced them, and
set in Monkes, and many seculer Priests, being put to their choyce whether they
would change their habit or leaue their roomes, departed out of their houses. After, <hi>Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waldus</hi>
was made Archbishop of Yorke, and then they had their minde; and when he
by no perswasion could make the Priests and Canons of the Cathedrall Church of
Yorke become Monkes, within the Churchyard he erected another Church of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,

whereby the other Church was desolate, and all the people gathered where the Bishop

Monkes.</p>
            <p>The Monkes of the primitiue time did differ from the Monkes of the middle time,
and from our Monkes of the latter age. The name and order of Monkes began 300.
yeares after Christ; <hi>Basilius Magnus</hi> was one of the first institutors and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of that Superstition. <hi>Cassianus</hi> maketh mention of a certaine Monastery in The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
wherein were 5000. Monkes, vnder the gouernment of one Abbot; and héere also
in England, mention is made before of <hi>Bangor,</hi> wherein were 2200. Monkes, vnder
one mans ruling, in the yeare 596. but these were such as either by tyranny of persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tion, ioyned with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
for the loue they had to Spirituall contemplation, and hatred of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
world withdrew themselues from all company, hauing all things common; these
were Lay-men leading a stricter kinde of life then others, as Saint <hi>Augustine, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi>
and others testifie, one thing pertaineth to the Monkes, and another thing to the
Clergie; the Clergie fed the flocke, and the monkes are fed. It appeareth also by the
forth Canon of the Councell of Calcedon, that Monkes should not meddle with
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14787:24"/>
matters of the Church. And <hi>Leo</hi> in his 62. Epistle, doth forbid Monkes and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to bée admitted to preach. They differed from the Monkes of the middle age
in thrée points; First, they were bound to no strict apparell, or dyet, or any thing else.
Secondly, they were but Lay-men, onely being of a stricter life then the rest, and had
nothing to doe in Ecclesiasticall matters, vntill Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the 4. gaue them au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.
Thirdly, though many of the Monkes of the first age liued single from wiues,
yet some of them were maried, and none of them were forbidden from mariage. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi>
in his Epistle <hi>ad Pracontium,</hi> saith, hee knew Monkes and Bishops maried
men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fathers of children.</p>
            <p>Yet though the former Monkes were better then the latter, yet amongst them
superstition beganne to créepe into the Church, by the subtiltie of Satan, and all
for the ignorance of frée iustification by Faith in Christ, as for example; One Abbot
<hi>Moses</hi> testifieth of himselfe, that hee so afflicted himselfe with fasting, and watching,
that hee felt no appetite to meate, and could not sleepe, that hee prayed to God to
giue him a little sléepe some péece of the night. This <hi>Cassianus</hi> doth testifie,
<hi>Cap. 7. Cola.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Hée saith also of an olde Hermite that made a vowe hée would
neuer eate without some guest, sometimes fasted thrée or foure dayes for lacke of
guestes.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Mucius,</hi> to declare his obedience to the Abbot, did not sticke at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of the Abbot, to cast his sonne into the water, not knowing whether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any
were there to saue him from drowning, preferring the Abbots commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before the commaundement of God. And <hi>Basilius Magnus,</hi> and <hi>Nazean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenus,</hi>
with immoderate austeritie, did so plucke downe themselues, that when
they were called to bee Bishoppes, they were not able to sustaine the laboure
thereof.</p>
            <p>After these Monks, followed Monkes of the middle Age, who increased both in
number and Superstition, from their dennes in Wildernesses, the approched to
great townes, where they had solemn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Church, for before he wrought his feats, setting vp and displacing what Bishops he

and were defended by them.</p>
            <p>He first, contemning the authoritie of the Emperor, thrust in himselfe to be Pope,
vanting himselfe to haue both the Ecclesiasticall, and the Temporall sword, committed
to him of Christ, and full power to binde and loose what he lifted, he challenged all the
Dominion both of the East and West Church; he set at light Kings and Emperours,
who raigned but at his godamercie; Bishops and Prelates as his vnderlings he kept in
awe, suspending, cursing, and chopping off their heads. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>irred vp warres, releasing
Othes, Fidelitie, and due allegiance of Subiects to their Princes. To this scope tended
chiefly all his practises, to abolish the mariage of Priests, and to translate the authoritie
Emperiall vnto the Clergy, as appeared before in the Councell of Later<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n; for though
he was not then Pope in name, yet was he Pope indéed, and ruled the Pope as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted.
In a Councell which he held at Rome, he enacted that no Priest hereafter should
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14787:29"/>
mary, that those that were maried should be Diuorced, and that none hereafter should
be admitted Priest, but should sweare perpetuall Chastitie.</p>
            <p>The Clergie of France resisted this Decree, and said it was repugnant to the word of
God, that the Pope should take from Priests that which God and Nature had giuen
them; and against the Doctrine of Saint <hi>Paul; I haue no commaundement of God
touching Virginitie, and he that cannot liue continent, let him mary.</hi> And that it was
against the Canons of the Apostles, and the Nicen Councell: and that thereby would
be opened a pernicious window to vncleanesse, and fornication, and conclud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, they had
rather giue vp their benefices then forsake their lawful wiues against the word of Christ.
Likewise, the Priests of Germany were as stout against the Pope: but at last, this
gréedinesse of Liuings, in weake Priests, made them to yéeld vp their godly libertie to
wicked tyranny.</p>
            <p>He preached, in a great assembly, that the Emperour should die before Saint <hi>Peters</hi>
day next, and should be so deiected, that he should not be able to gather together aboue
sixe knights, and that if this prophesie were not fulfilled, they should plucke him from
the Altar, and he would be no more Pope. And when he had gone about diuerse waies
to murder the Emperour, and yet God preserued him beyond the appointed time, them
subtily he turned his tale, and said, he ment of the soule of the King.</p>
            <p>About the time <hi>Hildebrand</hi> was made Pope, there was great warres betwixt <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho</hi>
Duke of Saxony and the Emperour, which was a fit occasion for the Pope to
worke his seats. First, he excommunicated all that receiued Spirituall liuings of Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and all the giuers thereof, which he called symony, whereupon he sent Legats to
the emperour, to appeare before him at the Councell of Lateran. The Emperour appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not: whereupon hee threatned him excommunication, and to depriue him of his
Crowne, If he would not renounce the heresie of Symony, which was, giuing of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Liuings. Wherefore <hi>Centius,</hi> a Romaine Captaine, caught the Pope, and shut
him vp into a Tower; the next day the citizens plucked downe the Tower, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Pope, and cut off the noses of the men of <hi>Centius,</hi> but he escaped to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
The emperour, being moued with this arrogancie, called a Councell at Wormes,
where all the Bishops of Germany deposed <hi>Hildebrand.</hi> The Pope, in his Councell
of Lateran, excommunicated and depriued as many as tooke the Emperours part, and
excommunicated the emperour, depriued him of his empire, and all his subiects of their
Oath of alleagiance. As soone as he rose out of his papal seat, to excommunicate the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
the seat being but new, and of strong tymber, suddenly shiuered and rent vs
pieces. The princes of Almany all concluded to forsake <hi>Henry,</hi> and choose another em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
except he would submit himselfe, and obtaine the Popes pardon. The Emperour,
with his wife and young sonne, all hauing forsaken him, laying apart his regall orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
in sharpe winter, came bare foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

morning to night, humbly he desired to be absolued, and to come in and speake with the
Pope, Thus he continued and could not be let in, in thrée daies: the fourth day, being
brought to the Pope, he surrendred his Crowne and princely ornaments vnto him, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
he might be forgiuen, and he would neuer doe against him againe. He told him, he
would not absolue him, but vpon condition he should doe such penance as hee should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne
him, and appeare at the Councell when he should send for him, and answere there
all obiections laid against him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and stand to his pleasure whether hee should haue his
Kingdome restored, or loose it; and should doe nothing as a King, vntill the cause were
tryed: and, vpon his Oath, for performance hereof, he was absolued. For all this the
Pope sent to France, for their consents, that <hi>Rodulphus</hi> should be Emperor. Then there
was sent to <hi>Rodulphus</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

locally, with the full proportion and quantitie of the same body wherewith hee ascended,

Arch-bishop of Canterbury.</head>
               <p>KIng <hi>Henry</hi> the second K. of England conuenting his Nobles &amp; Clarks required
to haue punishment of certain misorders of the clergy, but the Archbishop <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Becket</hi> would not agrée therevnto: the King came to this point to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he &amp; the rest of the Clergy would consent to the customes set forth in <hi>Henry</hi> the
fift his time, he with the rest of the Bishops, vpon consultation held, they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with this exception, <hi>Saluo ordine suo,</hi> so all other Bishops being particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
except <hi>Christopher,</hi> who séeing the King angry, said, for <hi>Saluo ordine suo,</hi> he
would <hi>bona fide,</hi> the King told them hee was not well content with that exception
which was captious and deceitfull, hauing some venome lurking vnder, therefore
required an absolute grant: they answered, they would not binde themselues in no
other manner, at which the King and all the Nobilitie were not a little mooued: the
King, when he could get no other answer, departed with gret anger, not saluting the
Bishops: <hi>Chester</hi> was greatly rebuked of his fellowes for changing the exception;
the next day the King took from the Archbishop all such Mannors and Honors as he
had giuen him before being Lord Chancellor; not long after vnknowne to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
he sayled into Normandie; not long after the Bishop of London followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him to craue his fauour, and gaue him counsell to ioyne some of the Bishops
with him, least if all were against him, hee might the sooner be ouerthrowne: thus
by his meanes the greatest number of the Bishops were reconciled vnto the King,
onely the Archbishop with a few other remained in their stoutnes: when the King
saw no feare or threats could turne him, he assaid him with gentlenesse but it would
not serue, though many Nobles laboured to exhort him to relent vnto the King:
Likewise the Arch-bishop of Yorke, with diuers other Clergie men, Bishoppes
and Abbots, especially Chester did the same: besides his owne house dayly called
vpon him, no man could perswade him; at length vnderstanding what danger
might happen by the Kings displeasure, not onely to himselfe but to all the Clergy,
and considering the old kindnesse and loue of the King towards him in times
past, was content to giue ouer vnto the Kings request, came to the King at
Oxford, and reconciled himselfe: wherevpon the King receiued him with a more

sight of his Bishops, and all his Nobles; after this the King beeing at Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem
Doune, called all his Peeres and Prelates before him, requiring to haue that
performed which hee had promised in consenting to the obseruing his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ordinances and proceedings; the Archbishop drew back, and would not that
hee would before, yet with great teares, intreaties, and perswasions of Bishops
and of two Templers, that desired him on their knees, with teares, and with
threatenings of Imprisonment, and other dangers hee did agree onely, with a
clause of exception, <hi>bona fide,</hi> and he and all the Bishops set too their hands and
seales.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alanus</hi> recordeth that the Archbishop in his voyage to Winchester greatly repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that he had done, so that he kept himself from al company, lamenting with teares
and fasting, and afflicting himselfe, did suspend himselfe from all diuine seruice, and
would not be comforted before he had sent to the Pope, and were assoiled of him, the
Pope in his Letters not only assoiled him from his trespas, but with words of great
consolation, incouraged him to be stout in the quarrell he tooke in hand. Upon this,
<hi>Becket</hi> took no small heart &amp; consolation: The King hearing of him, &amp; how he denied
to set his seal to those sanctions, which he condiscended too before, took no little disple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
against him, threatned him of banishment &amp; death, called him to reckoning, and
burdned him with paiments: the Archb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thought to make an escape out of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> realme,

This was one, that none of the Prelasie or Nobility without the Kings li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,

to fly to Rome, but the weather serued not, which being known and noysed abroad,
the Kings Officers came to seaze vpon his goods to the Kings behalfe, but finding
<hi>Becket</hi> at home and returned, they did not procéede on their purpose, <hi>Becket</hi> séeing
this, went to the Court, the King taunted him gestingly, as though one realm could
not hold them both, but shewed him no great fauour. The Arch-bishop of York did
labour to renew peace and loue betwixt the King and him, but the King would not
be reconciled, except the other would subscribe vnto his lawes, which <hi>Becket</hi> would
not graunt to, but by vertue of his Apostolike authority, gaue censure vpon these
Lawes of the King, condemning some, and approuing some as catholike. The Pope
sent the Arch-bishop of Rotomage to the King, to ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e peace betwixt the King and
Canterbury: the King was content, so the Pope would ratifie his Ordinances,
which could not be obtained at the Popes hands. The King sent to the Pope to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of him, that the same authority of the Apostolike Legacie might be conferred
vnto another after his appointment, which was the Arch-bishop of Yorke, but the
Pope denied; but he was content, so the King would be Legate himselfe, at which
the King was angry, and sent to the Pope againe, according to the old practice of
popish Prelacy to play on both sides: priuily he conspireth with one, and openly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth
with the other, He granteth the Legate should be remoued, and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of York placed in the office, and writ to <hi>Becket</hi> that he should take no harm
thereby, for the Kings Ambassadors had promised him, and did offer to sweare vnto
him, that the Letters which they obtained, should not be deliuered vnto the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of Yorke, without the Popes consent therein: assure your selfe it is not, nor
neuer shall be our will nor purpose to subdue you or your Church vnto any, saue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Bishop of Rome; therefore if you sée the King will deliuer the said Letters,
giue vs knowledg, &amp; we will cléerely exempt by our authority Apostolical, both your
person, your Church, and your Citty committed vnto you from all iurisdiction of
any legacy. Upon these letters and such other, <hi>Becket</hi> took all his stoutnesse against
the King. The King after he had receiued his letters from the Pope, was more
strong in his purposed procéedings against the Archbishop, and procéeded to punish
the offences of Cleargy men, and there was aboue 100. found that had committed
homicide and murder, beside other offenders: he adiudged them first to be depriued,
and then committed to the seculer power. This séemed to <hi>Becket</hi> to derogate from
liberty of holy Church, that seculer power should giue iudgement vpon the crimes of
Ecclesiasticall persons, they picke this law out of <hi>Anacletus</hi> and <hi>Euaristus,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
this constitution from the Apostles, that all Ecclesiasticall persons, shall bee
frée from seculer iurisdiction. The King daily incensed more &amp; more against <hi>Becket,</hi>
cited him to appeare at a certaine day and place, where at the time all the Péeres,
Nobles, with the Clergy were assembled by the Kings proclamation, where great
fault was found with <hi>Becket</hi> because he did not appear but by Deputy. Whervpon
by the publike sentence both of the Nobles and Bishops, all his moueables were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged
to be confiscate to the King: the stuborne Archbishop answered, he was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
&amp; spirituall Father, not onely of all other in the Realme, but of the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and that it was not conuenient the Children should iudge the Father, and the
the flock the Pastor: but especially complaineth of his fellow Bishops which should
haue tooke their Metropolitans part; the next day the King laide an action against
him for the iniury done to his Marshall, and required the Archbishop to repay him
500. markes which he lent him when he was Chancellor: he answered it was giuen
him, but could bring no probation therof: whervpon the King required him to put in
an assurance for the paiment: wherevpon 5. persons of their own accord st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pped in
and were bound for it, else the Archbishop had béen in a great strait: the third day he
was charged with other monies due vnto the King, by reason of many Bishopricks,
&amp; Abbaricks which he had kept long vacant in his hands, &amp; he &amp; al the Bishops being
shut into a roome together by the Kings appointment, they did all take counsell
what was best for the Archb. to doe in this case, they all aduised him to yeeld to the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:14787:36"/>
Kings Lawes, or else he would be in danger and the rest of the Clergy, or else to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
his Arch-byshoppricke, and then no doubt the King would haue compassion on
him, if not, they saw no other way but he would loose his life, and then what good
would his Byshoppricke doe him: to this effect was their consultation. <hi>Becket</hi>
checked them with rebukefull words, you goe about to cherish your owne cowardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
with a shaddow of sufferance, and with dissembling softnesse to choke the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Church: who hath thus bewitched you O vnsatiable Bishops! is not
God able to help the state of the Church without the sinfull dissimulation of the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
thereof? when should the Gouernors thereof put themselues in danger for
the Church, but in the distresse thereof, I thinke it no greater merit for the ancient
Byshops to found the Church with their blood, then for vs to effude our blood for the
liberties of the same, and I thinke it not safe for you to swarue from the example
which you haue receiued from your holy Elders. Then the Arch-bishop sent for two
Earles, to whom the Archbishop said: touching the matters betwixt the King &amp; vs,
we haue conferred, we would craue respite vntill the morrow, then we will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to giue our answere vnto the King: two Bishops were sent to the King with
this message, which the King granted, the conuocation beeing dissolued, the most
part of the Bishops separated themselues from the Arch-bishop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for feare of the
Kings displeasure: he being thus forsaken, sent for the poore, lame, and halt, to
furnish his house, saying by them he might sooner obtaine his victory, then by them
which had slipt from him; the said day appointed was Sunday, therefore nothing
done, the next day he was sicke of the Gout, he could not come, it was thought hee
fained, the Earle of Deuon: and the Earle of Leicester were sent to him, to try
the truth of the matter, and to cite him to appeare at the Court, the Bishops came
to perswade him to submission to the will of the King, of all his goods and Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppricke,
if peraduenture his indignation might swage by that meanes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> else per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury
would be laid to his charge for breaking his oath made to obserue the Kings
Ordinance, he answered it was dolorous that the world was against him, yet it
gréeueth me most, that Sons of mine owne Mother be pricks and thornes against
me, but I charge you bee not present personally in iudgement against me, and that
you shall not so doe I appeale to the Church of Rome, the refuge of all such as bée
oppressed, and if any seculer men lay hand on me, as it is rumord they will, I strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
charge you, that you exercise your Ecclesiasticall censure vpon them, as it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
for your Father and Arch-bishop, &amp; whatsoeuer happen, I will neuer coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shrinke, nor vily forsake my flocke: then he addressed himselfe to his Masse of S.

The Bishop of London accused him that it was done by art Magick, and in
contempt of the king, then the Archbishop went to the Court, and to make him more
sure, he priuily taketh the Sacrament within: as hee was entring into the doore
of the Kings Chamber, he taketh the Crosse with the Crosse-staffe from the Crosse-bearer,
and carried it himselfe: one of the other Bishoppes would haue borne the
Crosse, saying it was not comly for him, the Bishop of London told him, if the king
met him so, he would draw his sword at him; he answered, the Kings sword strikes
carnally, but mine spiritually striketh himselfe downe to hell. The King complained
to the Nobles and Bishops, that he shewed himselfe as a traytor, all gaue witnesse
thereto, affirming him alwaies, to be a vain and proud man, so altogether with one
cry, called him Traytor, and being he had receiued such great benefits, preferments
and honours of the King, and thus requite it, was well worthy to be handled as a
periured Traytor: The Bishop of Excester desired him to haue compassion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and of them, else they were all like to perish, for there commeth a precept from
the King for your apprehending and suffering as an open Rebell, and whosoeuer
shall take your part, and the Bishoppes of Salisbury and Norwich are to bee
had to the place of execution, for their resisting, and making intercession for
you. Hee answered, Auoyd hence from mee, for thou sauorest not the thinges
of GOD. Upon great consultation, the Bishoppes agreed, that they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14787:36"/>
would appeale the Arch-bishop to the Sea of Rome vpon periury, and that they
would oblige themselues to the King, with a sure promise to doe their dil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

deposing of him, so the King would promise their safety; it being so finished, two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
were sent to him in stead of them all, which said, once you were our Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
and we bound to your obedience; but now, being you once sware fidelitie to the

answered he heard him well enough, and sendeth to Rome in all hast, signifying to
the Pope the whole matter, to whom the Pope writeth againe: wee are not a little

your constancie, our diligence shall bee to preserue the right and preheminence of

I thought good especially to premonish you, neither for aduersitie nor what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer

               <p>The Archbishop sitting with his Crosse in his hand as before was not abashed
at al that was: the King sent for him presently to render account for thirty thousand
markes, and fruits and reuenewes of the Realme in the time when he was Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor;
he answered, the King knew how often hee had made reckonings of those
things, and that <hi>Henry</hi> his Sonne and heyre, with all the Barrons, and the Lord
chiefe Iustice of England told him was frée and quit to god and holy Church from
all receipts, computations on the Kings behalfe, and so taking his discharge en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into his office, for other accounts he would make none: when his answere was
brought to the King, he required the Barons to doe their office, who adiudged him
to be apprehended and laid in prison: the King sent the Earl of Cornwall and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uonshire,
and the Earle of Leicester to shew him his Iudgement; to whom he said,
heare my Sonne and good Earle, how much the soule is more precious then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
so much ought you to obey me rather then your terrene King, no Law doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the child to condemne their Father: wherefore to auoide all your iudgements
before you all I appeale to the Sea Apostolicke, and as for you my fellow Bishops,
which rather obey man then God, you also I call and claime to the Iudgement of
the Pope, and I doe depart from you as from the enemies of the Catholick Church,
and of the authoritie of the Apostolicke Sea: whilst they returned this answere to
the King, the Archbishop passed through the throng and tooke horse, holding the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
in one hand, and his Crosse in the other; the Courtiers followed, saying, tarrie
Traytor and héere thy Iudgement; the vtmost gate being locked, one of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
found a bunch of Keyes &amp; trying them found the right and opened the gate, he
went to the house of the Cannons where hee did lie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and calling to him the poore
where they could be found, after supper he caused a bed to be made him betwixt two
Altars; but whilst the King was at supper, he changed his garments, and named
himselfe <hi>Derman,</hi> and made an escape to the Sea, and taking ship sayled into Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and thence iournied vnto France; the King sent the Bishop of London, and
the Earle of <hi>Arundell</hi> vnto the King of France, to require him not to receiue the
Archbishop, nor retaine him in his Dominion, and that he would be a meanes to the
Pope not to shew any familiaritie vnto him, but the French King, contrarie to the
Kings Letters and request, not only harboured and cherished him, but writ to the
Pope, intreating him vpon all loues, as euer he would haue his fauour to tender the
cause of the Archbishop <hi>Becket.</hi> The King sent another ambassage to Pope <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:14787:37"/>
by the Archbishop of York, the Bishops of London, Winchester, Chichester,
Exeter, with other Doctors and Clarkes: with the Earle of Arundel, with certaine
moe Lords and Barrons, they were friendly accepted at the Popes Court, the next
day following the Pope sitting in the Consistorie with his Cardinals, when the
Ambassadours were called for the hearing of <hi>Beckets</hi> matter, and the Bishops
euery one in order had made his Oration, the Pope did not accept some of their
spéeches, and disdained some: wherefore the Earle of Arundell disdained in this
manner, spake:</p>
               <p>Though I am vnlettered, and cannot vnderstand what these Bishops haue said,
neither can vtter my minde in that tongue which they haue done, yet I must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the cause of my sending as well as I may, which was not to contend with or
iniury any man, especially in presence of such a one at whose beck all the world
doth stoope, but our Legacie is to present, in the presence of the whole Church of
Rome, the deuotion and loue of our King, which hee euer had and still hath to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you, and that it might the better appeare to your excellencie, hee hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the furniture of this Legacy his greatest and cheefest subiects of such
worthines and parentage, that if hee could haue found greater in his Realme hee
would haue sent them, for the reuerence of your person and holy Church of Rome:
I might adde more, which your Sainctitude hath already proued, the harty fidelity
of our King towards you, who at the entrance to his Kingdome, submitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and all his, wholly to your will and pleasure, and wee beleeue there is none
more faithfull in Christ then he, nor more deuout to God, nor more moderate in
kéeping the vnity of peace: neither doe I deny touching the Archbishop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
a man not vnfurnished with gifts in his calling, being both sage and discréete,
sauing that hee seemeth to some more quick and sharpe then needeth, if this blot
had not beene, the King and he had not discented: then both the temporaltie and
spiritualty might haue flourished one with the other in much peace, vnder so
worthy a Prince, and so vertuous a pastor, therefore our message and supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to your vigilant prudence, is that through your fauour and wisedome the neck of
this discention may be broken, and reformation of vnitie and loue by some good
meanes may be sought.</p>
               <p>But the Pope would not condiscend to their sute, which was to haue two Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
sent from his popish side into England, to examine and take vp the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie
betweene the King, and the Archbishop, but because <hi>Becket</hi> was absent
hee willed them to tarry his comming vp: for hee being absent hee would in no
case procéede against him, but they alledged there time appointed to be ended, and
hauing other lets they could not waite for the comming of <hi>Becket,</hi> and so returned
back, there cause frustrated, without the Popes blessing to the King.</p>
               <p>Within foure dayes after, <hi>Becket</hi> commeth to the Popes Court, offered the pope
a scroule of the custome and ordinances of the King: the Pope condemned and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the most part of them, and blamed <hi>Becket</hi> for so much yeelding to them at the
beginning: yet because he was repentant, hee was content to assoile him for the
same, and the rather because he had suffered so great troubles for the liberties of the
Church: The next day, the Pope and his Cardinals beeing assembled in his secret
chamber, <hi>Becket</hi> made an Oration to them to this effect: he confessed with griefe
the cause of these perturbations was because hee entred into the sould of Christ,
not by the doore of Christ, because the King made him Bishop, not the Pope, and
if I had resigned it to the King againe at his commandement, I had left a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
example vnto the Catholique Church: therfore now recognising my ingresse
not to be Canonicall, and my abilitie not sufficient for such a charge: therfore I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
into your fatherly hands the Archbishoprick heere of Canturbury, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Ring from his finger offered it to the Pope, and desired a Bishop to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
for the Church of Canturbury, and so with teares ended.</p>
               <p>This done hee was bid stand a part, after consultation they concluded, being
he had ventred his goods, dignity, and authoritie, and his life, for the liberties of the
Church, if he should now be depriued at the Kings pleasure it would be an exampl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The King beeing certified by his Ambassadors that the Pope inclined more

               <p>Moreouer, the King writ to the Abbot of Pontiuiack, where he lay, not to

Chaplains with Letters to him, appointing him the time and place, where safely

to doe: he said he had a commandement from you not to answere before he and all
his were restored to all their possessions, then he would proceed in the matter as hee
should receiue commandement from the Sea Apostolick, whereof wee made rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

which when the King and Nobles vnderstood, the King said he was so much
the more cleere, for that the Archbishop would not stand to Iudgement: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
much heauinesse and lamentation of the King, Bishops, and Abbots, they
required of vs whether wee had any power to proceed against him, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

King and the Arch-bishop, both were content to stand to his arbiterment. The
Archbishop prostrating himselfe at the féete of the King of England, said he would
commit the whole matter to his owne arbiterment, <hi>Saluo honore Dei,</hi> the King
was highly there-with displeased, rebuking him of pride and stubbornenesse, and
charged him with sundry and great benefits bestowed on him, and hee a person vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind

               <p>
                  <hi>Becket</hi> sent to the Pope, complaining of foure Bishops, especially the Archbishop

being a matter peculiar to his Iurisdiction, at whose instance the Pope excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated

they should resort to him; séeing you thus stand against the Coronation of our new

cursed all that kept, or medled with Church-goods, against the wils of the owners. Then

               <p>This agreement was concluded, and ingrossed in a payre of Indentures, the saide

he liked well, but he would not make restitution of the Church-goods. The foure Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

him before him: and that they should take into their hands, vnto his vse all the Church
Lands, that were giuen by the Archbishop <hi>Steuen,</hi> or the Priors of Canterbury, from

               <p>Thou the Pope sent ouer two Legats, which resorted to the King at Northampton,

make full restitution of the goods that you haue rauished of holy Church, and of the land,
and that you receiue <hi>Stephen</hi> Archbishop, into his dignity, and the Prior of Canterbury,

we giue power to the Bishops of Winchester and Norwich; and the same power ouer
Scotland, we giue vnto the Bishops of Rochester and Salisbury; and in Wales, wee

               <p>Then all that had their hearts wounded for obeying their liege King, came and were
absolued of their owne Bishops, but the Spirituall men were compelled to séeke their
absolution of the Pope. Some of the Clergie were not pleased that the King should be

               <p>The Cardinall, sitting like a God in the middest betwixt them, made his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
vpon these words; <hi>In the middest of the Seate, and round about, were foure
Beasts, full of eyes behind and before.</hi> He compared them about him to the foure
Beasts, declaring how they ought to haue eyes before and behind; that is, they
must be carefull and prouident, as well in disposing secular thinges, as wise and
circumspect in spirituall matters, contriuing, and ioyning wiselie thinges
past with thinges to come. And this was the greatest effect of his Clearkely
Sermon.</p>
               <p>Then he gaue forth sundry Constitutions and Statutes, for ordering of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
dedicating Temples, for seauen Sacraments, for giuing Orders, farming
Benefices, Collations, and resignations, Priests apparell, and single life, for ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

King dreading the Commons, willed him to repaire home to Rome, but he could
not so be rid of him, but hee renued his commission, and still applyed himselfe to
his Haruest, gleaning and raking what hee could, writing his Letters to euery
Byshop or Arch-Deacon, for procurations to beare his charges, and withall, to be
spéedily collected and sent to him. Prouided, that the summe collected, should
not excéede aboue foure Markes of a Liuing, and where small Liuings were

and signed with the crosse, then they send their Bulles to release them for money,
and the Bishops and Arch-deacons to proclaime it.</p>
               <p>The Pope was not ashamed to require the fift part of euery Ecclesiasticall

of France, called by Pope <hi>Innocentius:</hi> in the which Councell the English Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did exhibite sundry Articles of all their greeuances, and that the Italians
did succeed one another in the benefices, whose language they could not vnderstand,
and that there was no preaching in their Churches, nor no almes giuen to the poore,
and that there came fresh Letters from the Pope, commanding the Prelates to
finde at their proper costs and charge for a whole yeare, some ten armed souldiers,
some more, some lesse, to be ready at the Popes commandement, when, or where
be should appoint.</p>
               <p>After these terrible greeuances and enormities, the States of England
consulting together, directed their Letters to the Pope for Reformation:
First the Abbots and Priors, then the Bishoppes and Suffragans, after
the Nobles and Barons, and last of all the King, but all was neuer the
better.</p>
               <p>Not long after the Pope sent for new tallage and exactions, which when it
came to the Kings eare hee vehemently disturbed writ seuerally to euery Bishop,
in manner following.</p>

our Priuy Seale, and our Letters Patents, that you should leuy for the pope
no exactions, either vpon the Clergy, or Laitie, yet you vilepending our comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
and contrarie to our prouision made in our last Councell at London,
haue proceeded in collecting the said your taxes and tallages wherevpon wee

and that you make this our inhibition common to your Arch-Deacons and

               <p>At length the Ambassadors came home, bringing word that the Pope was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
displeased with the Realme, saying; <hi>Rex Anglorum qui iam recalcitrat &amp; frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riscat

they were halfe counted Schismatickes, for speaking in the Kinges behalfe, and

conuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himselfe by night vnto the King, and the King sent to Oxford a garison of armed
men to deliuer the Romaines which were hid, for feare of the Schollers. One <hi>Odo</hi>
a Lawyer, and thirty of the Schollers were apprehended and carried to Walling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
Castle, and thence in Charts to London, and by much intreaty of the Bishops,
were brought bare-footed to the Legats doore, where they pardoned, and the
Uniuersity released of interdiction.</p>
               <p>The State of Germany, and of the Emperour <hi>Friderick</hi> the second,
was then as
much or more pittifull then that of England, who were so persecuted by Pope <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentius,
Honorius, Gregorius, Celestinus, Innocentius</hi> the fourth, infamed with
excommunications, and did commonly warre against them in open fielde, and all
with English mens Money: first they made him Emperour against <hi>Otho,</hi> whom
they depriued, then for clayming his right in Apulia and Sicilia they accursed him,
when they had warred against him, they sent him to fight against the Turkes, who
recouered Ierusalem, Nazareth, and Ioppe, from the Souldane. Whilst hee was
occupied in these Warres, these vnholy Fathers inuaded his Lands and possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
at home, subduing Apulia vnder his owne possession, and inhibiting his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours
to goe ouer to him, and when the Emperour sent to the Pope and other
Christian Princes his Letters gratulatory, declaring what God wrought by him
against the Turkes, the Pope stayd the Messengers, kept the Letters close,
and caused it to be noysed abroad that the Emperour was dead, and the said Pope
<hi>Gregorie</hi> the ninth wrote to the Souldane, that he should not render
the holy Land
into the Emperours handes. The Emperour hearing this stirre of the Pope,
tooke truce with the Souldane for tenne yeares, and repayreth home, and driueth
the Popes Army out of Apulia, and recouered all the Pope had gotten from him
before: The Pope laid his cursse vpon the Emperour, for making truce with the
Souldane, and conspired with the Tuscanes and Lombards against him: the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14787:48"/>
at the instigations of the Princes, glad to compose with the Tyrant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was
faine to ransome the absolution of the Pope for ten hundred thousand ounces of gold,
and yet hee sent to the Princes of Germany, charging them to admit none of the
Emperors stocke to be King of the Romaines, and stirred vp the Citties of Italy
against him. The Emperor vnderstanding his politick and subtile traynes, marched
into Italy, where he put downe the Rebels, and recouered againe the Citties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Empire. Wherefore a new excommunication was laid vpon him,
and all his Subiects released of obedience and loyalty, and much indulgences and
eternall life promised to them that would fight against him. After <hi>Gregorie,</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded
<hi>Celestinus</hi> the fourth, who raigned not long. After him, succéeded <hi>Innocenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
the fourth, who following the steps of his predecessors, called a generall Councell
at Lyons, as is before mentioned, where standing vp, he cited the Emperour:
his Legate required lawfull time for him to come, which hee would not graunt,
but in his fury denounced him accursed, and depriued him of his Imperiall Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
charging him with periury and sacriledge, writing Libels of defamation to all
Kings.</p>
               <p>The Emperour made purgation of these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>landers, charging the Pope, not with
fained, but true and most hainous crimes, of slander, falshood, perdition, periury,
rebellion, hypocrisie, and prooueth him by his Letters, to be very Antichrist. Hee
wrote to the French King, that hee much marueiled that the prudence and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the French-men, did not more quicke then others sée the Popes subtilty
and couetousnesse,<note place="margin">1250.</note> purposing to subdue all Realmes as he hath done England, and
doth presumptuously achieue to subdue the Maiesty of the Imperiall Crowne. This
Emperor departed to Apulia, and there dyed, being poysoned, as some thinke, by
meanes of the Pope.</p>
               <p>In the time of this <hi>Innocent,</hi> dyed one <hi>Robert Grosted,</hi> Byshop of Lincolne, a
famous learned man, as that time serued, whose Sermons to this day are extant,
in the Quéenes Library at Westminster. There is one speciall Sermon written
to <hi>Innocent. Cestrensis</hi> writeth, that he was greeued for the exactions of the Pope
in England, and would not admit of the Popes Nephew to be Canon of his
Church. Writing to the Pope, that hee could not admit such into his Church,
which did neither know themselues, nor their charges: hee was therefore called to
Rome and excommunicated, who appealing from the Pope to Iesus Christ, short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after departed. Two yeares after the said Pope being asleepe, one apparelled
Bishoplike, appeared vnto him, and striking him with his Staffe, saide; <hi>Surge

this foresaid <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> by Gods prouidence, sprang vp, throgh whom the Lord
would first waken, and raise vp againe the world, which was ouermuch drowned, in

in Oxford, and perceiuing the true doctrine of Christs Gospel to bee adulterate
with so many filthy inuentions of Bishops, sects of Monkes, and dark errors: first,
he began to touch the Sacrament of the body and bloud of Christ, in which he tooke
much paines, protesting in open schoole that it was his purpose to call back the
Church from her Idolatry in this point, but this sore could not bee touched, without
the great griefe of the whole world: first the whole glut of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nkes and Fryers
were mad with him, fighting for their altars, panches and bellies: after them the
Priests; after them the Bishops took the matter in hand; at last when there power

<hi>Wickliffe</hi> happely maintained the cause of the Sacrament, prouing it by Scriptures,
and the ancient Doetors: hee refused the Doctors since the thousand yeares after
Christ, saying, that after these yeares Satan was loosed, and the life of man hath
been most subiect to errors, and that the simple and plaine truth doth appeare and
consist in the Scriptures, when all humane traditions must be referred: he proued
most stoutly, in the Sacrament, the substance with bread, the accident not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
As long as King <hi>Edward</hi> the third liued, he was well enough defended by him
against all there woluish cruelty, yet in the last yeare of his raigne, hee was taken
by the Bishop of Canterbury, at the instigation of the Pope, and put to silence in
presence of the Duke of Lancaster, and the Lord <hi>Henry Piercy,</hi> yet after by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour

               <head>The first conclusion of IOHN WICKLIFFE,
exhibited in the Conuocation of certaine Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

               <p>1 THat none but Christ was ordained, and not <hi>Peter</hi> and all his off-spring poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquely
to rule ouer the world for euer; for in the 1 <hi>Cor. 15. Then shall the
end come when he shall deliuer vp his kingdome to God his Father, when hee shall
haue made voide all princely dominion:</hi> it seemeth probable that they defraud her of
her reward, and vniustly defer to take vengeance vpon the body of the diuell which
he hath deserued.</p>
               <p>2 The substance of the second was that by no power any writing was to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized,
contemning the Scripture, this was spoke to one that commended mans
writing, and contemned the Scripture.</p>
               <p>3 That euery man in grace iustifying, hath not onely right to all things, but
aboue all the good things of God, as appeareth by the 24. of <hi>Mathew,</hi> verily hee
shall make him ruler ouer all his goods: and in the eight to the <hi>Romans, God spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not his Sonne, but gaue him for vs, how then did hee not giue vs all things with
him:</hi> this allureth vs to loue God, that hath chosen vs to so many great and true
riches.</p>
               <p>4 None can giue any temporall Dominion or gift, but as the Minister of God;
the Apostle saith Iesus Christ was a Minister, let not his Uicar then which should
be a seruant of seruants be ashamed to vse the ministerie of the Church, for his pride
of seculer Dominion, with his worldly stile, seemeth blasphemie, and the aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Antichrist: especially, where they repute the Scriptures as cockle, and the
determination of all controuersies of Scripture in themselues.</p>
               <p>5 As sure as God is: the Temporall Lords may lawfully and meritoriously
take away the riches from the Church, when they doe offend: yet I say, that it is not
lawfull to doe it by the authoritie of the Church, and for lacke of some spirituall
gouernour, and in case when the Ecclesiasticall Minister, being strayed from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
faith, is to be corected and punished.</p>
               <p>6 The Uicar of Christ is not able by his Buls, of himselfe, not by the consent
of his colledge, to make a man the more able, or disable a man, that ought to procéed
of God, but he onely in the Name of God, to notifie to the Church whom God hath
enabled, else he is as presumptuous as <hi>Lucifer,</hi> for in the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. All our sufficiency

               <p>7 A man cannot he excommunicated to his hurt, except hee be first excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated

of Gods Law: <hi>For if God iustifie, who can condemne?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10 There is no power giuen by the example of Christ, or his Apostles, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
any for denying of Temporalties: in the ninth of <hi>Luke,</hi> Christ rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

               <p>In the yeare 1384. he wrot an Epistle to Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> the sixt, that the Gospell

ought to leaue his temporall dominion to the seculer power, and therevnto exhort his

               <p>There was none so great enemies to him as the Clergy, yet he had many good frends

               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> hauing read ouer <hi>Wickliffes</hi> Bookes, concludeth by many infallible
presumptions and reasons that hee was no Heretick, but in the number of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and that it was a foolish consequent, because the number of Prelates and
Clergy in England, France, and Boheme doe count him for an Heretick, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is one: like is the reason for burning of his bookes, for in the first Chapter of
the Booke of <hi>Machabees,</hi> they burned the Bookes of the Lord, and tore them, and
whosoeuer was found to haue or vse them was put to death by the Kings comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement:
if this argued the wickednes of the bookes, then the Law of God was wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked:
so likewise of the burning of S. <hi>Gregories</hi> bookes and of diuers other good men,
it followeth not because the Scribes and Pharisies condemned Christ as an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
that therefore he was one, so <hi>Iohn Chrysostome</hi> was twice condemned an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
by the Bishops and Clergy.</p>
               <p>Besides the Articles afore, there were other Articles gathered out of his Bookes,
which his malicious aduersaries peruersly collecting, and maliciously expounding,
did exhibit to the Councell of Constance.</p>
               <p>They sinne in Simony that be hired by temporal liuings to pray for others.</p>

And they inforce, that all holy Scripture should bee expounded according to their

               <p>Therefore all Kings and Rulers, that knowe the trueth of this Testimony of

of Christ and his Church, all these striue with Antichrist against Iesus, and
they shall beare the indignation of God Almightie, without end, if in conuenient

through the presumptuousnesse and negligence of the Prelates, wicked men are
wrongfully named Hermits, and haue leaue to defraude the poore, and liue by
their false winnings, and begging, in sloth, and other vices, and the copper nosed
Prelates, are suffered to liue in pride and hypocrisie, and to defile themselues bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily

and Priesthoodes, full of pride, they are cause of much dissention, and
exercise themselues in eating, and drinking vnmeasurably, and out of time, and
they are of one cloathing, and holde together, and in all vnlawfull doings they are
Partners, medlers, and Councellers.</p>
               <p>Also, Prelates admit Pardoners, and strange beggers, with flatterings to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile
the people, against true beliefe, and to increase diuerse vices in them:
and thus the viciousnesse of Prelates haue beene, are, and shall bée cause of
Warres within this Realme and without, and cause of Pestilence of men, and
murren of beastes, and barrennesse of earth, and all other mischiefes, vntill the
Lords and Commons able them with grace, accordring to Gods will, to redresse

               <p>Therefore, all that know the viciousnesse that now raigneth cursedly in these
Priestes, and in their learning, let them pray for the health of his Church, and
abstaine from these indurate enemies of Christ and his people, and from all their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,

               <p>Christ likeneth the Kingdome of Heauen to a Housholder, that went in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to hyre Worke-men into his Uineyard; so did he about the third houre, the
sixt houre, and the ninth, and the eluenth, and as he found men standing idle, Hee
said to them; <hi>Why stand you beere vn-occupyed, goe into my Vineyard, and that
which is duty I shall giue you, and when the day was ended, he called his Steward,
and bad him giue euery man a penny.</hi> This Housholder is Christ, head of the
Church on Earth, which calleth in diuers ages; as in the time of Nature he called
by inspiration <hi>Abell, Enoch, Noah, Abraham,</hi> and diuers others. In the time of
the olde Law, <hi>Moses, Dauid, Esau, Ieremy,</hi> with the Prophets: In the time of
Grace, the Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, and Uirgines, some in youth, some in
middle age, some in the latter dayes: it is to labour in his Uineyard, which is his
Church, as there be diuers Officers in trimming of the maternall Uine, no lesse
néedfull in the Church be these thrée Officers, Priest-hood, Knight-hood, and Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.
The Priests must cut away the branches of sinne with the Sword of Gods
Word: the Knights must maintaine Gods Word: the Teachers thereof, and the
Land from wrongs and Enemies: the Labourers must by their sore sweat, get su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenance
for themselues and others, if Priests want, the people for want of Gods
Word all will grow wilde in vices, and dye ghostly, and were not men to rule peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Théeues and Enemies would so increase, that none could liue in peace, and
were it not for Labourers, Priests and Knights must be Artificers, Plough-men,
and Heard-men, or else die for want of sustenance: as the great Clarke <hi>Auicenna</hi>
saith, euery vnreasonable Beast, if he haue that which belongs to Nature, can liue
of himselfe alone. But if there were but one man in the World, if he had all the
goods in the World, yet for default he would dye, or his life worse then if he were
not, because that which is prepared for mans sustenance must be altered, or else it
accordeth not with him; therefore he saith, it is very needfull to haue men of diuers
trades and callings. This should be a great cause that euery calling should loue,
and not hate one another, and this I dare say, that they which doe not diligently la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in some one necessary calling or other, when the day of reckoning shall come,
which is the end of this life, as he liued without trauell, so shall hee want the
reward of the Penny, the endlesse ioyes of Heauen, and be cast into Hell. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if thou be a labouring man, doe it truelie; if thou be a Seruant, be subiect,
&amp; feare to displease thy Maister for Christs sake; if thou be a Marchant, deceiue not
thy Brother in chaffering; if a King, defend the poore and needy; if a Iudge, goe
not to the right hand for fauour, nor to the left for hate. If thou be a Priest, instruct
the ignorant, praise the obedient, and reprooue the disobedient to God, for in the
end of the world you shall euery one haue a reward, a good or a bad, then Christ wil
say to euery of these three States, <hi>Come giue a reckoning of thy Bayliwicke:</hi>
First, Priests that haue cure of Soules shall bee called, and they shall answer for
themselues and others: The second is, Temporall Lords shall answere for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
and others: The third Baily shall account but for himselfe, or at least, haue
lesse charge then the other, and euery one shall answere three questions: How en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trest
thou? How rulest thou? How liuest thou? To the Priest, how entrest thou?
by Truth or Symony, God or the Deuill, for that thou wouldst labour in thy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
or for that thou wouldst bee richly arrayed? Answere in thy conscience to
thine offence now, or thou shalt ere it be long answere to GOD? and I aske the
question, why men set their Children to schoole, whether for their worldly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement,
or to make them the better to know GOD and serue him? They set
them to the Law, not to be Ministers of Iustice, to defend the poore, but because
it is a meanes to make them great men; therefore there bee so f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w to learne the
word of GOD to be Preachers, because there is no gaines therein. <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:14787:59"/>
saith, Parents care for the bodies of their Children<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, but not for their soules; they
desire their welfare in this world, but they passe not what they shall suffer in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
they will sore bewaile the hurt of their bodies, but they reckon not much of
the health of their soules, they are moued for their pouerty, but not for their sin: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they shew, that they begot the bodies, but not their soules.</p>
               <p>To returne to Priests, there is now great abhominations in the Church; Priests
come into Christs fold, not at his calling, but to make themselues rich, which is cause
of many errors. In the Booke of mourning the Prophet saith, <hi>The enemy hath put his
hand to all things he would, for he hath seene a lawlesse people in the Sanctuary, of
which thou saidst they should not enter,</hi> The enemy is Sathan, for in what plenty is
pride, enuy, wrath, and couetousnesse; and wherefore, but because such are entred
into the Temple, which cannot kéepe the Law of God themselues, nor teach others:
And <hi>Osea</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ose. 4.</note> saith to them, <hi>Because thou hast put away the knowledge of Gods will, I
haue put thee away from vsing Priest-hood to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second question, how hast thou ruled Gods flock committed to thy cure, for the
good of the sheep, or for hire, as a father, or a wolfe; whom hast thou turned from their
cursed liuing by thy preaching and good example? whom hast thou taught the law of
God? he that is ignorant, the fatherlesse, Children and thy flocke shall greeuously ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
thee, that thou hast liued by their labour, and done nothing therefore, but let them
go astray. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> saith, Priests be in place of Saints, and they doe wickedly, not
being content with necessary wages, but ouer-plus: that the needy should liue by, they
wast in houses of pride and lechery; beware, thou shalt giue an account to the last far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
thinkest thou that thou shalt not be disalowed for nourishing young men, idly
taught, as in a schoole to blaspheme God in all euill liuing: for féeding of fat palfries,
of hounds, and of haukes, and of lecherous women. Heare what is said of such, <hi>they
lead their daies in vanity and wealth, and in a moment go downe to hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third question, what light hast thou shewed, and what myrror hast thou béen
vnto the people in thy liuing? It is wonder to sée how the life of Priests is changed,
they be cloathed like Lords, they speake as dishonestly as any Ribold or Harlet: No
Marchant more couetous for gaine, they ride like Princes, and all is of poore mens
goods, they be blinded with to much shining of riches, they make houses as bigge as
Churches, superfluously abounding with all things, they paint their Chambers with
pictures, and cloath their Images with Silkes of diuers colours, but the poore for
want of cloathing, and with an empty womb, cryeth at their doores; and oftentimes
the poore be robbed to cloath stockes and siones: thou occupiest the place of <hi>Peter</hi> and
the Apostles, no otherwise then <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> as a candle newly quenched
that stinketh ouer the house, in stead of light, and as smoake that blinds ones eyes in
stead of fire; they shall haue an hard iudgement, because they haue misentred, and
harder, because they haue misruled, and the hardest, because they haue cursedlie
liued.</p>
               <p>The second that shall make account for himselfe and others, is Kings, and other
temporall rulers; Hast thou entred thine office to profit the people, to destroy sinne,
and further the truth, or for worship and riches? Some desire such estate to be rich,
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to oppresse such as they hate, and to take bribes, for sparing to punish sinne, and
make themselues partners of other sinnes, and for bribes worke all things. Many in
high office, thinke they are of higher kind of nature then others, not knowing they
are poore mens brethren, and seruants for the good of the Common-wealth, and that
their glory is vanity. Of whom the Prophet <hi>Osea</hi> saith, <hi>They haue raigned, but not
by me;</hi> so was <hi>Roboam</hi> when he answered the people, <hi>My little finger is bigger then
my Fathers Rib-bone, my Father greeued you somewhat, but I will adde more,</hi> which
made the people rebell, and the kingdome neuer came wholy together again; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is good for Rulers to take sober councell, to eschew eare-rounders, and to haue
an eye of loue vnto the Commons, for be they neuer so high, they shall come before an
higher Iudge to giue a reckoning.</p>
               <p>The second question, how hast thou ruled? Hast thou not beene the harder to the
poore for his pouerty, nor fauored the rich for his riches? what abuse is now amongst
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14787:59"/>
Officers, if a rich man plead with a poore, euery Officer is ready to further the rich
man, and the poore man shall haue so many delaies, that though his right be neuer so
good, for default of spending, hee shall be constrained to let his cause fall. And I
haue heard say of them that haue proued both Courts, that the Court that is called
most Spirituall, is most cursed; therefore it is truly said, a guift out of the bosome
subuerts right Iudgement, but the words of Christ be to be feared, <hi>As you iudge you
shall be iudged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third question, how hast thou liued? Thou that punishest other for sinne,
must not sinne thy selfe, else thou condemnest thy selfe in doing the thing thou dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
in others, and when any standeth before him in Iudgement, hee must take
héede before what Iudge hee must stand himselfe: but it is to be feared, that it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
with some, as with the two false Priests that would haue put <hi>Susanna</hi> to death,
because sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hanged, damne the lesse worthy. <hi>Socrates</hi> being demaunded why hee laughed,

Theefe, he that taketh House and Land from one, and his Heires, or he that stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

               <p>The third Bayly, is euery Christian that shall reckon to God for the goods he hath
had of him; First, how haue you entred heere to your goods, if by extortion, stealth,
vsury, or deceit; woe shall it be to you at this dreadfull day, as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, if
hee shall be in hell that hath not giuen of his goods well gotten, what shall become of
him that stealeth others goods: desire of honour, and feare of pouerty be the causes
that ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e men liue by the rape of other mens goods; the vengeance of this couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
is discribed by the pot in the sixt of <hi>Zachary,</hi> wherein sat a woman named Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
into which the Angell threw a waight of Lead: and two women like Spirits
with winges, carryed it betwixt Heauen and Earth, vnto the Land of Sinear; as
a pot with a wide mouth, so Couetousnesse gapeth for riches and honour, and as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
in a pot profiteth not the pot, but them that draw it out, so worldly goods
profit not the Getters, but others that comes after, as Owles see better by night
then by day, so the couetous are blinde in heauenly matters, and quicke-eyed in
earthly matters. The Lead is obstinacy, the Woman is called Impietie, because
Piety is lost by Auarice: the Pot is couered with Lead, which stoppeth in Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to shew that Couetousnesse hardeneth the heart, that Impiety cannot goe out
by repentance, the two Woemen that bare the Pot, are Pride and Lust of the
Flesh: which in Scripture are called the two Daughters of the Water, each
crying, bring, bring. The first Winge is Pride of Spirituall guifts: The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Wing Pride of Temporall guifts: The Winges of the second Woman,
be Gluttony and Sloth. Doctor <hi>Gregorie</hi> speaking of Gluttony, when the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

saith, <hi>Lot</hi> was a good man whilst he was in businesse in Sodome, when hee was
idle in drunkennesse he lay with his Daughters. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, rauening

they carry the pot to the Land of Synear, that is, the land of stench or Hell. Héere
wee should aske how thou hast gouerned thy Wife, thy Children and seruants,
whether thou hast brought them vp in Gods Lawes, and continued them ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
according to thy power, otherwise thou shalt giue an account, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide

               <p>Now we will consider, who shall call vs to this reckoning, before whom, and
what punishment to the wicked, and what reward to the faithfull: there bee two
Iudgements, one at separation of body and soule, which is the particular doome:
and the second at the generall resurrection that is vniuersall; to the first we shall be
called one after another, to the second we shal come altogether in the twinckling of an
eye: we are called to the first by thrée summons; sicknes, age, death: the first war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
the second threatneth, the third taketh; some are slayne without sicknes or
age, and the most part without age, and there is a sicknes that makes the body fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and a sicknes of the soule which is generall to all men, and the continuance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is cause of corruption: if a man cast all worldly things out of his minde, yet can
he scantly thinke onely of God a Pater-noster while: O God, what a sicknes is
this to the sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> of this sicknes spake S. <hi>Paul, I see another Law of my
members, rebelling against the Law of my Spirit;</hi> as a man looking on the Sunne
cannot long indure, yet the fault is not in the Sunne for it is most cleere, but in the

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: the second sicknes is of the body, as hunger thirst, cold, heat,
sorrow, wearinesse, and many others: as <hi>Iob</hi> saith. <hi>A man borne of a woman is full
of many miseries, and is but for a little time:</hi> there be other sicknesses that happen to
some as Feuers, Dropsie, Blindnes, and such like, as it is said of the Israelites, <hi>if
thou keep not the comman dements of God I shall increase the sorrows and sicknesses
of thy seed,</hi> but God sendeth such sicknesses sometimes to good men, and tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for two causes: First to know that it is of God, and to increase in méekenes: of
this saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>least my great reuelations should extoll me in pride, to mee is

<hi>my grace is sufficient;</hi> for my power is manifested in weaknes; the Diuell
asking <hi>Iob</hi> to be tempted, was heard, and not the Apostle asking his temptation to
be remooued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he heard the damned, and heard not him that should bee saued: also
God sendeth sometime his Saints to giue vs sinners example of patience, being we
haue deserued much more: as <hi>Toby</hi> came from the Charitable worke of burying the
dead Swallowes were suffered to dung in his eyes being asleepe, and make him
blind it is written, that it was for an example of patience to them that should come
after, and though he euer feared God he was not agreeued with God, but feared
him still, and thanked him alwaies, and the sicknesses of wicked men be for two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
first that they should leaue their sinnes and loue God; we see often men in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
know God, that neuer would turne to him whilst they were whole: Also
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:14787:60"/>
God sendeth sicknes and troubles often to the wicked, to make others afraid to folow
their sinnes, as <hi>Antiochus</hi> wormes crauled out of his body whilst he was aliue, and
his friends were weary of his stinke, yea he might not abide his owne stinke: then
he said it is rightfull to be subiect to the Lord, &amp; for mortall man not to hold himselfe
equall with God: the Story saith, hee asked mercy of God, and could none haue, and
vowed to doe more good to the Temple and Iewes then he had done harme, and to

not out of true repentance springing of Faith, but of his odious paine, hee obtained
not fauour: by this men should see what it is to be disobedient to God: also sicknes
sheweth that the patient is mortall, and that hee must die though hee may now
scape.</p>
               <p>The second Somner is age, hee will not leaue thee vntill hee haue brought thee
to death: yet many, though they see all their members decayed with age, take no
heed; but if he see a little mirth forgetteth the Somner hath him by the sleeue,
and what a reckoning he must make, which if he answere not well, he forfeiteth bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and soule to damnation: a Doctor saith, this is the greatest abuse of the world;
the reason is because these three, idle youth, vnhonest speech, and wicked déed, which
if they grow with a man from his childhood to his old age, they make a three-fold cord
to binde the old man in custome of sinne: wherefore <hi>Esay</hi> saith, <hi>breake the cordes of
sinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Somner is death, his condition is come, hee, first or last spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

               <p>We shall likewise be called with three messengers vnto the last Iudgement: the
first the sicknes of the world, the second his age and feeblenes, the third his end: as
decay of Naturall heate, and increase of vnnaturall heate, is the sicknes of the body:
so decay of the loue of God, and our neighbour, and increase of vnnaturall lusts is

               <p>I said in my second principle, that it was to be knowne before what Iudge wee

euery mans deeds, and the secrets of their hearts shall be opened to all the world: as
Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>the dead men, great and small, stood about the Throne, and bookes
were opened, and the Booke of Life was opened, and the dead were iudged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

now are closed, but then shall be open to all men: the Booke of Life is Christs Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
which is now hid from the damned, through their owne malice: in the first book
is written all that is done, in the second all that should be done: therefore look in the
Booke of the Conscience whilest thou art heere, if thou findest any thing contrarie to
Christs example and Doctrine, scrape it out with the knife of repentance, and write
it better.</p>
               <p>I said it were good to know what reward the good shall haue, and what reward
the wicked shall haue: it is written, Christ shall come with the same body that was
crucified, all that shall be saued shall cleaue to him, and be rauished, meeting him in

that I my selfe am in the hands of these Cardinals and Bishops, so hee retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
very pensiue, and complained openly and priuately of the Popes wrong, but
it profited not. Then <hi>Hus</hi> was led to prison and kept there eight daies, from

of his life.</p>
               <p>In the middest of his sicknes they put vp these Articles to Pope <hi>Iohn,</hi> the
23. and to the principals of the Councell, desiring that <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> might bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
               <p>1 That hee taught that the Sacrament ought to bee ministred in both kindes,
and so his Disciples did now vse it, and that materiall bread remaineth in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
after consecration.</p>
               <p>2 A Minister in mortall sinne cannot minister the Sacrament, and that other
men besides Priests may minister the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>3 Hee both not admit that the Church signifieth the Pope, Cardinals, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14787:63"/>
and the Clergy vnderneath them: but saith this signification was tooke
from the Schoolemen; and that the Church ought to haue no temporall possessions:
and that the temporall Lords may take them away without any offence: and saith
also that <hi>Constantine,</hi> and other seculer Princes haue erred by endowing Churches
and Monasteries.</p>
               <p>4 That all Priests are of like power, and that the reseruations of the Popes
casualties: the ordering of Bishops, and consecrating of Priestes, were inuented
onely for couetousnes.</p>
               <p>5 When the Pope, Cardinals, and rest of the Priests are in sinne, as is possible
enough, then the Church being in sinne hath no power of the Keyes:</p>
               <p>6 Hee beeing excommunicated contemneth it, and saith Masse notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>
               <p>7 Hee maketh Ministers himselfe, and putteth them into Churches without
the ordinarie of the Dioces, or other Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, and teacheth it to be
lawfully done.</p>
               <p>8 That one being ordained a Priest or Deacon, cannot be kept back from the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
or preaching: therefore he would neuer be let from preaching by the Apostolick
Sea, nor the Arch-bishop.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, when there was Questions moued in the Uniuersitie of Prage, vpon
the 45. Articles of <hi>Iohn Wickliffe,</hi> and the Diuines of Boheme concluded euery one
of them Articles, either to be hereticall, seditious, and erroneous: he held that none
of them were hereticall, seditious, or erroneous, as after hee did dispute &amp; teach
in the common schooles of Prage: notwithstanding they were condemned in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,

               <p>Because I finde these Articles and many others answered by <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,

there are diuers Articles drawne out of the said Treatise, deliuered vnto me.</p>
               <p>1 The first Article: there is but one holy vniuersall Church, which is the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
company of all the predestinate. <hi>Answere.</hi> I confesse this proposition is mine,
and confirmed by the saying of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was neuer a member of the Diuell, though he did many things
like the malignant Church: nor Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> though he horribly sinned in periury,
and denying his Master. <hi>Answere.</hi> It was by Gods permission, that they might
more stedfastly rise againe and be confirmed: I answere according to S. <hi>Augustine,</hi>
that it is expedient that the Elect should offend: there be two separations from the
Church; the Elect are diuided from the Church, but not to perdition: the second
is to perdition, by the which certaine Heretieks are through there deadly sinne diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the Church.</p>

Iustice: yet he is alwaies a member of the Church. <hi>Answere.</hi> I declared in my booke
that there be diuers manners of being in the Church: there be some in the Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to a mishapen Faith, and some according to Predestination, which are now
in sinne, but shall returne to grace.</p>
               <p>5 No degree of dignitie, nor election of man, nor any sensible signe can
make a man a member of the Church. <hi>Answere.</hi> I say Predestination maketh vs
members of the Church, and prepareth for vs grace heere, and glory in the world
to come; and not degree of dignitie, nor the election of a man, nor sensible signe:
for <hi>Iudas,</hi> though Christ elected him an Apostle, and gaue him Temporall Graces,
and that he was so reputed of men, yet was he a Woolfe in a sheeps-skin, as Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> saith.</p>
               <p>6 A Reprobate man is neuer no member of the Church. <hi>Answere.</hi> It is in my
Booke with sufficient long probation of the Psalme 26. and the 5. <hi>Ephes.</hi> and by
Saint <hi>Bernards</hi> saying; the Church of Christ is more plainely his body, then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that was crucified: the Church is the flower of the Lord in which is corne and
chaffe: the Elect and Reprobate.</p>
               <p>7 <hi>Iudas</hi> was no true Disciple of Christ: <hi>Answere.</hi> This I confesse, S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
in his Booke of penance where he expounds 1. <hi>Iohn 2. They came out from vs,
but were not of vs:</hi> Christ knew from the beginning who should beleeue, and him
that should betray him: and said, <hi>none commeth to mee except it be giuen him of
my Father,</hi> from that time many departed from him, though they were called by
the Gospell, they were no true Disciples, because they did not continue in the word
of Christ, as it is said, <hi>if you remaine in my word you bee my Disciples:</hi> it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that <hi>Iudas</hi> could not be the Disciple of Christ, by meanes of his couetousnes:
For Christ saith, <hi>except a man forsake that hee hath, he cannot be my Disciple:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore because <hi>Iudas</hi> was a Theefe <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. and a Diuell, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. It is euident that
<hi>Iudas</hi> was no true but a fained Disciple. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> vpon Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> that
Christs sheepe heare his voice, saith, what manner of hearers were his sheepe; <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
heard him but was a Woolfe, yet he followed the shepheard, but being clothed in
a sheep-skin he laid waite for the shepheard.</p>
               <p>8 The predestinate whether they bee in the state of grace, or no, according to
there present Iustice, is the same Church which hath neither wrinkle nor spot, but
is holy and vndefiled, which Christ calleth his owne. <hi>Answer.</hi> In the fift to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesians,
Christ so loued his Church that he offered himselfe for it.</hi> I pray you then,
is there any faithfull man that doubteth that the Church doth not signifie all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect:
the glorious spouse of Christ, holy and without spot: This is an Article of faith
which we ought firmely to beleeue.</p>
               <p>9 <hi>Peter</hi> neuer was, nor is the vniuersall head of the Church. <hi>Answere.</hi> All men
agree, that <hi>Peter</hi> receiued of Christ, which is the Rock of the Church, humility, sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse,
and blessednes: When Christ said vpon this Rock I will build my
church, he did not meane that he would build euery Militant Church vpon <hi>Peter,</hi> but
vpon Christ which is the Rock: from whom <hi>Peter</hi> receiued his Faith, for he is the
head and foundation of euery Church, and not <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10 If he that is called the Uicar of Christ, follow Christ in his life, then he is his
true Uicar; otherwise he is the messenger of Antichrist, the enemy of <hi>Peter</hi> and
Christ, and the Uicar of <hi>Iudas: Answere.</hi> For this cause Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> in his fourth

my Booke, if thy life be contrary to <hi>Peters,</hi> or giuen to auarice, then he is the Uicar of
<hi>Iudas,</hi> which loued the reward of iniquity, and sold the Lord: As soone as they reade
the same, the Rulers of the Councell looked one vpon another, and making mockes
and moes, nodded their heads at him.</p>
               <p>11 Priests that vse Symony, and liue desolutely, haue an vntrue opinion of seuen
Sacraments, as Bastards and not Children, not knowing the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

of Censures, neither of the rights of Cerimonies and seruice of the Church, nor of
worship of Relikes, nor of Orders of the Church, nor of indulgences and pardons.
<hi>Answere.</hi> It is in this manner in my Booke, the authoritie is abused by such as sell
Orders, and get riches by Symony, making markets of holy Sacraments, liuing
voluptuously, desolutely, a filthy villanous kind of life. They pollute the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
estate, and though they professe they know God, they deny him indéede,
and beléeue not in him, but as vnbeléeuing Bastards hold a contrary opinion, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid,
to whom <hi>Malachy</hi> in his first Chapter saith, <hi>Vnto you Priests be it spoken,
which despise my name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12 The papall dignity hath his originall from the Emperors of Rome. <hi>Answer.</hi>
This is proued by the 96. distinction, for <hi>Constantine</hi> granted this priuiledge to the
Byshop of Rome, and others after confirmed the same; that as <hi>Augustus</hi> is counted
the most high King aboue all others, so the Bishop of Rome shall be called the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Father aboue other Bishops: then a Cardinall said in <hi>Constantines</hi> time, there
was a generall councell at Nice, in which the highest place in the Church was giuen
to the Byshop of Rome, why did you not then say it tooke his dignity rather from
the Councell?</p>
               <p>13 No Man with reason, without reuelation can affirme, that hee or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is head of any particular Church. <hi>Answere.</hi> I confesse it, but it followeth,
that he ought to hope through his good liuing, that he is a member of the Spouse of
Christ.</p>
               <p>14 No man ought to beleeue that the Pope is head of any Church. <hi>Answere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
confesse it, for the Church was deceiued by <hi>Agnes,</hi> a Woman Pope, as it app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> and it so being deceiued, Christian Faith should bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued.</p>
               <p>15 The Popes power, as Uicar, is nothing worth, if he liue not according to
Christ, and follow the manners of <hi>Peter. Iohn Hus</hi> confessed this, and said before the
Councell, I vnderstand, the power of such a Pope as doth not represent the manners
of Christ, is void.</p>
               <p>16 The Pope is most holy, not because he supplieth the place of <hi>Peter,</hi> but because
he hath great reuenues, my words be mutilated. Thus it is written, he is not holie
because he is Uicar of <hi>Peter,</hi> nor for his great possessions, but if he follow Christ in
humilit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, patience, labour, and perfect loue.</p>
               <p>17 The Cardinals are not the true Successors of the Apostles, if they liue
not after the fashion of the Apostles, keeping the ordinances of Christ. <hi>Answere.</hi> I
confesse it, for if they enter not in at the doore which is Christ, they be Theeues and
Robbers.</p>
               <p>18 An Hereticke ought not to be committed to the secular power to be put to
death, it is sufficient that he suffer the Ecclesiasticall censure. <hi>Answer.</hi> These are
my words, that they might be ashamed of their false iudgement, for Christ would
not condemne such to bodily death: The first point appeareth in the 12. of <hi>Luke:</hi>
The second, by <hi>the Woman taken in Adultery,</hi> and in the 18. Chapter of <hi>Mathew,
If thy Brother haue offended thee, &amp;c.</hi> therefore an Hereticke ought first to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
with Christian loue, by reasons drawne out of holy Scriptures, as Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> and others haue done, disputing against Heretickes; but if for all this they
will not leaue their errors, they ought to suffer corporall punishments. The Iudges
had read in <hi>Iohn Husses</hi> Booke, where hee greeuously inueyed against them which
deliuered an Heretike vnto the Secular power, not being conuicted of Heresie, and
compared them vnto the High-Priests, Scribes, and Pharises, which told <hi>Pilate</hi> it
was not lawfull for them to put any man to death, and deliuered Christ vnto him,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14787:65"/>
but Christ told <hi>Pilate</hi> they were greater murderers then he which deliuered him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, then the Cardinals and Bishops made a great noyse, saying; <hi>Who are they
that thou dost asimule vnto the Pharisies?</hi> And he said, <hi>All that deliuer any that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
vnto the ciuill sword.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>19 The Nobles of the World ought to compell the Ministers of the Church to
kéepe the Commaundements of Christ. <hi>Answere.</hi> These be my words, the Militant
Church consisteth of these parts; Ministers of the Church, which should kéepe
purely the Ordinances of Christ; and the Nobles of the World, which should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
them to keepe his Commaundements, and of the common people seruing to both
parties.</p>
               <p>20 The Ecclesiasticall obedience, as the Priests and Monkes haue deuised, it hath
no authority in the Scripture. <hi>Answer.</hi> I confesse it, there be three obediences, the
Spirituall, Secular, and Ecclesiasticall: the Spirituall, which is onely according to
the ordinances of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which Christ and his Apostles liued, and all Christians
ought to liue in: the Secular obedience, is due according to ciuill ordinance: the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
obedience is such as the Priests haue inuented, without any expresse au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Scripture.</p>
               <p>21 He that is excommunicate of the Pope, and apealeth vnto Christ, the curses
of the Pope cannot annoy him. <hi>Answere.</hi> I acknowledge not this, but I did make
complaint in my Booke, that they had done mee, and such as fauoured mee, great
wrong, and they would not heare me in the Popes Court: and after the death of one
Pope, I apealed to his successors, and it profited not, and to apeals to the Councell, it

said a Cardinall, wilt thou presume aboue Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who apealed to the Emperor,
and not to Iesus, and they mocked him: the tenor of his apeale, was nothing but
an earnest Prayer to Christ, to be his refuge and helpe when all kel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Robert</hi> Bishop of Lincolne, apealed vnto Christ, who is not defiled with cruelty, nor
corrupted with gifts, nor deceiued by false witnesses.</p>
               <p>22 A vitious man liueth naughtily, and a vertuous man liueth godly. <hi>Answere.</hi>
My words are these: All humane workes are deuided into two parts, they be either

               <p>23 The Minister of Christ liuing according to his Lawes and hauing knowledge
of the Scriptures, and an earnest desire to edifie the people, ought to preach, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

for a Minister to preach, and a rich man to giue Almes, are duties commaunded of

               <p>25 Ecclesiastical Censures, are Antichristian, such as the Cleargy hath inuented

you to Saint <hi>Augustine, Ierome, Chrysostome, Gregory, Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Barnard,</hi> who
say moreouer, that he that is in deadly sinne, is no Christian; how much lesse, Pope,
Bishop, or Prelate, of whom it is said in the eight of <hi>Amos, They haue ruled but not
through me; they became Princes, and I knew them not:</hi> but I graunt, a wicked
Pope, Bishop, or Priest, is an vnworthy Minister of the Sacrament, by whom
God doth baptise, consecrate, or otherwise worke, to the profit of his Church. God
saith by <hi>Samuell</hi> to <hi>Saul, because thou hast cast off my word, I haue cast thee off from
being a King,</hi> much more a Pope sinning.</p>
               <p>2 The Grace of Predestination, is the bond whereby the body of the Church
and euery member thereof are firmely knit vnto the Head. <hi>Answere.</hi> This Article
is mine, and it is proued out of the eight to the <hi>Romanes, Who shall separate vs from
the loue of Christ:</hi> And the tenth of <hi>Iohn, My Sheepe heare my voyce, I know them,
and giue them eternall life, they shall not perish, nor any shall take them out of my
hands.</hi> This is the knot of the body of the Church, and the spirituall head, vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Church of the predestinated.</p>
               <p>3 If the Pope be a Reprobate, then as <hi>Iudas,</hi> he is a Deuill, a Théefe, and the
Son of perdition, and not the head of the Militant Church, nor member thereof. I
answer, If he were a member of the Church, then should he be a member of Christ,
and then he should cleaue vnto Christ by grace of Predestination and present Iustice,
and should be one spirit with God, as in the 1. <hi>Cor. 6. Know you not that our bodies
are the members of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4 That an euill Pope or Prelate is no Pastor. <hi>Answer.</hi> The Text of my Booke,
is, if he be euill, he is a hireling: of whom Christ saith, <hi>He is no Shepheard, nor the
sheepe his, he seeth a Wolfe and forsaketh his sheepe,</hi> so doth euery Reprobate, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no true Pastor.</p>
               <p>5 The Pope is not, nor ought not by his Office, to be called most holy. I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
When as the King, according to S. <hi>Augustines</hi> mind, representeth the Deity
of Christ, and the Priest representeth only his humanity; therefore the King of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
by reason of his Office, ought rather to be called most holy. These thinges
are more at large discided in my Booke (saith <hi>Iohn Hus</hi>) but I can finde no foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whereby I should call the Pope most holy, when it is only spoken of Christ.</p>
               <p>6 If the Pope liue contrary to Christ, though he be lawfully chosen according to
humane election, yet he commeth in another way then by Christ. <hi>Answere.</hi> The text
is thus, if the Pope liue contrary to Christ, in Pride and Auarice, doth he not then
come in another way, then by the lowly and méeke doore of Christ. <hi>Iudas</hi> was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
chosen by Christ, yet bee came in another way: and as Christ saith in the sixt
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14787:66"/>
of <hi>Iohn, Was a Theese, a Deuill, and the Sonne of perdition,</hi> and whosoeuer doth enter
into a Bishopprick or any other place, not with intent to labour in the Church, but to
liue voluptuously and richly, and to aduance himselfe with all kind of pride, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
in another way, and not by Christ, and is a Théefe.</p>
               <p>7 The condemnation of the forty fiue Articles of <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> made by the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
as wicked and vnreasonable, and the cause by them alleadged is fained and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true.
<hi>Answere.</hi> So it is, to say that euery one of them is hereticall, erronious,
and offensiue: then he said to Cardinall <hi>Cambray?</hi> O Maister Doctor where is your
proofe! Then the Cardinall said: <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> thou diddest say thou wouldst defend
none of <hi>Iohn Wickliffes</hi> errors? I will not if they be errors, but in my conscience,
I could not consent to the condemnation, being I saw no Scripture against them.</p>

               <head>There remaineth sixe Articles of the thirty nine,

               <p>1 THe first Article: A Minister is not the Successour of Christ by his humane ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
be it neuer so rightly done, but in that he doth more aboundantly worke
to the profit of the Church, hee hath thereby more aboundant power giuen him of
God. <hi>Answere.</hi> It standeth in the hands of wicked Electors to chuse a Woman into
Ecclesiasticall office, as it appeareth by the election of <hi>Agnes,</hi> which was called <hi>Iohn,</hi>
who occupied the Popes place and dignity two yeares and more, and they may chuse
a théefe, a murderer, a deuill, and an Antichrist, or such a one as God alloweth not
of: so whatsoeuer the election is, we ought to giue credit to the works of him that is
chosen; therefore Christ saith in the tenth of <hi>Iohn, Giue credite vnto workes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 The Pope being a Reprobate, is not head of the Church. <hi>Answere.</hi> I would
know of the Doctor how this is contrary to Faith? Did not Christ dispute against
the Faith, when he demanded of the Scribes and Pharisies. <hi>Math. 12. You off-spring
of Vipers, how can you speak good things when your selues are wicked.</hi> I demand of
the Scribes, if the Pope be a Reprobate, and the stock of Uipers, how is he head of
the holy Church? for it is more possible that a Reprobate may speake good things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

glory amongst your selues, and seeketh not the glory that commeth of God:</hi> And I
demand how the Pope can be head of the Church which is a Reprobate, and receiueth
the glory of the world, and séeketh not for the glory that commeth of God, for it is
more possible he should beléeue so doing, then be head of the Church.</p>
               <p>3 There is no apparance that there ought to be one head in the spiritualty to
rule the Church. <hi>Answere.</hi> I grant it, Christ sitteth at the right hand of God, doth
necessarily rule the Militant Church as head, and there is no sparke of apparance,
that there should be one head in the spiritualty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ruling the Church that should alwaies

               <p>4 Christ would better rule his Church by his true Apostles, dispierced through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the world, without such a monstrous head. I answere, Albeit that Doctor doth
say, that the body of the Church is often without a head; yet we verily beleeue that
Christ is the head of euery Church, ruling it without lacke or default, powring on it
motion and sence, euen vnto the latter day: then they said, behold now hee prophesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth?

               <p>6 The Apostles and faithfull Priests of the Lord, haue stoutly ruled the Church
in all thinges necessary to saluation, before the office of the Pope was brought into

               <head>Certaine other Articles which were brought vnto
IOHN HVS in Prison.</head>
               <p>1 THE first Article, <hi>Paul,</hi> according to present Iustice, was a Blasphemer, and
none of the Church, and withall in Grace, according to Predestination of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life. <hi>Answer.</hi> This proposition is not in the Booke, but thus: as <hi>Paul</hi> was both
a blasphemer according to present Iustice, and also a faithfull child of our holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Church according to Predestination; So <hi>Iscariot</hi> was both in Grace accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to present Iustice, and withall, was neuer of our holy Mother the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he lacked Predestination of life euerlasting.</p>
               <p>2 Christ doth more loue a predestinate Ban being sinfull, then any Reprobate,
in what grace soeuer he be. <hi>Answere.</hi> The reason is, because the predestinate
shall haue perpetuall blessednesse, and the Reprobate eternall fire; therefore GOD
infinitely loueth them both as his Creatures, and much more because he giueth them
greater graces, to wit; euerlasting life, which is far more excellent then onely grace,
according to present Iustice; and the predestinated cannot fall from Grace, for they
haue a certaine redicall grace rooted in them, although they be depriued of the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of grace for the time.</p>
               <p>3 All the sinfull according to present Iustice are vnfaithfull, swaruing from the
true Catholike faith, for none can commit deadly sinne, but in the point he swarueth
from the faith. <hi>Answer.</hi> I acknowledge it to be my sentence: for if they did beléeue the
punishment that shall be laid vpon sinners, and had faith of the diuine vnderstanding,
&amp;c. then they would not so offend. This is verified by the Prophet <hi>Esay, Thy fellows
are misbeleeuers, and fellowes of theeues, they loue bribes, and are followers of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi>
so he calleth them Infidels for their offences: also in the first of <hi>Titus, They
confesse they know God, but in workes they deny him.</hi>

               <p>4 <hi>Iohn 22. Math.</hi> 16. and the 18. <hi>Receiue the holy Ghost, whatsoeuer you shall
binde in earth, shall be bound in heauen, &amp;c.</hi> Many for lack of vnderstanding, shal be
terrified by the Priests and be deceiued, presuming vpon their power and authority.
<hi>Answer.</hi> I allow this sentence, it is not possible for a Priest to binde and lose, except
that binding and losing be in heauen: but many are made afraid, thinking whether
they be iust or vniust, the Priests may at their pleasures bind them, and the ignorant
Priests presume to haue such power, saying; they haue such power to absolue euery
man confessing himselfe, of what sinne soeuer it be, though many sins are forbidden
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And an Hypocrite may confesse himselfe, that is not contrite for his sin, whereof
proofe is often found, &amp; is euident, because the Letter killeth, but the spirit quickneth.</p>
               <p>5 The binding and losing of God is plainely the cheefe and principall. <hi>Answere.</hi>
This is verie euident, for it were a blasphemous presumption, that a man may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
an offence to GOD, hee not allowing the same: for it is necessarie, that
GOD doe first forgiue, before his Uicar can doe the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and no Article of
our Faith ought to be more common and knowne to vs then this, and whosoeuer
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:14787:67"/>
granteth this authority to the Pope, graunteth he is without sin, and that he is God,
the fact of the Pope proueth this same: for alwaies in his Absolutions, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
contrition and confession, but vnto true Absolution there is required; first, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition;
secondly, the purpose to sin no more; thirdly, true confession; fourthly, sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
hope of forgiuenes: the first appeareth by <hi>Ezechiel, If the wicked repent:</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

the Priests:</hi> the fourth, Christ saith, <hi>My Son beleeue, and thy sins shall be forgiuen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6 The Priests heap vp out of the Scriptures, such things as serue the belly, but
such as pertaine to the imitation of Christ, they reiect as impertinent to saluation.
<hi>Answere.</hi> This Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> prooueth in his seuenteenth Homily, <hi>The Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest
is great, but there are few Haruest-folke;</hi> and speaking that, which I cannot
without gréefe, though there be many that would heare good things, there lacks such
as should declare the same vnto them. The world is full of Priests, yet there are
few Worke-men in the Haruest of the Lord: we would be willingly Priests, but
we do not the office of Priest-hood; we are fallen into outward affaires, and take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vs an office for honor, and hire another to ease our labour; we leaue preaching, we
are called Bishops to our paine; we retaine the name of honour, but not the vertue;
we daily call for our stipend, but care not for our flocke; wee gape after earthly
things and glory, and leaue the cause of God vndone; we take vpon vs the place of
holinesse, and are wholy wrapped in cares and troubles. And S. <hi>Barnard</hi> saith in his
33. Sermon vpon the Canonicals, all are friends, and all enemies, all kinsfolkes,
and all aduersaries, all of an houshold, and no peace-makers, they are the Ministers
of Christ, and serue Antichrist; they goe honorably, honoured with the goods of the
Church, and yet they do no honor.</p>
               <p>7 The power of the Pope, which doth not follow Christ, is not to be feared. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.</hi>
Subiects are bound willingly to obay their good Rulers, and those which are
wicked: yet if the Pope do abuse his power, it is not to be feared as by bondage: so
his Cardinals as I suppose, did not feare <hi>Gregory</hi> the 12. before he was deposed,
when as they resisted him; saying, He did abuse his power.</p>
               <p>8 A wicked Pope is not the Successor of <hi>Peter,</hi> but of <hi>Iudas. Answere.</hi> If the
Pope be humble, neglecting the honors and luker of the world: if he be a Shepheard,
taking his name of féeding his shéepe, if as Christ commandeth, he feed the shéep with
the word and good example, then is he the Uicar of Christ, but if he walke contrary,
because there is no society betwixt Christ and <hi>Beliall:</hi> and Christ saith, <hi>He that is not
with me, is against me.</hi> How is he the Uicar of Christ, and not rather the Uicar of
Antichrist? Christ called <hi>Peter, Sathanas,</hi> when he contraried him but in one word,
why should not any other then being more contrary to Christ, be called <hi>Sathanas,</hi> and
Antichrist.</p>
               <p>9 The Pope is the same beast, of whom it is spoken in the <hi>Reuelation, Power is
giuen him to make warre vpon the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10 It is lawfull to preach notwithstanding the Popes inhibition. <hi>Answere.</hi> The
Article is euident, because the Apostles did preach contrary to the commaundement
of the Bishop. And S. <hi>Hialry</hi> did the like, contrary to a Pope that was an Arian: and
Cardinals, contrary to the commaundement of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 12. sent through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all Realmes such as should preach against him.</p>
               <p>11 If the Popes commaundement be not agréeable to the word of God, it is
not to be obayed. <hi>Answer.</hi> S. <hi>Isidore</hi> saith, He that ruleth and commaunds any thing
contrary, or besides the word of God, he is honored as a false witnes, and a Church-Robber;
therefore we are bound to obay no Prelate, but in case he commaunds the
commaundements of Christ. And Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> speaking of the Chaire of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
saith; They teach in the Chaire of <hi>Moses</hi> the Law of God, therefore God teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by them: but if they will teach you any of their owne inuentions, heare
them not, neyther doe as they commaund you; let therefore my Aduersaries and
Slanderers learne, that there be not onely twelue Councels in the Gospell, but as
many Councels as there be Commaundements of God binding vs thereunto, vnder
the paine of deadly sinne.</p>

hee himselfe by the example of Christ: when hee had put on his vestures, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

according to the manner of the Ceremony, going to the top of the scaffold, hee spake
to the people in this sort.</p>
               <p>These Lords and Bishops exhort me, that I should confesse before you all that
I haue erred, if it were a thing that might be done without the slander of any Man,
they might easilie peraduenture perswade me, but I am in the sight of my Lord
my GOD, without whose great ignominy, and the grudging of mine owne
conscience, I cannot doe that which they require. I neuer taught the thing that
they haue falfely alleadged against me; with what countenance should I behold
the Heauens? With what face should I looke vpon them whom I haue taught,
Whereof there is a great number: if those things which they haue hitherto
knowne most certaine, should now be made vncertaine by mee, should I by this
example astonish so many consciences, indued with so certaine knowledge of the
Gospell of Christ armed against all assaults of the Deuill, I will neuer commit such

               <p>And being commaunded to come downe, one of the Bishoppes tooke away the

curses for the Name of Christ. When they should raze off his shauing, they
could not agree with what Instrument they should doe it, then hee turning to
the Emperour, said; I maruaile being they are of like cruelty, they agree not
in their kinde of crueltie: At length they agreed, to cut off the skinne of the
crowne of his head with a paire of Sheares: Then they saide; Now hath the

followed him in Armour. In his Prayers he often repeated; into thy hands I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

               <p>A Priest sitting on horsebacke in a greene gowne, draw no about with red Silke,
said he ought not to be heard, because he is an Heretick: as he prayed his crown fell
off, one of the Souldiours said, let vs put it on againe, that it may be burned with
his Maisters. When he rose from prayers, he said, Lord Iesus assist me, that with
a constant mind I may beare this cruelty, and ignominious death whereunto I am
condemned for preaching thy most holy Gospell: when he was fastned to the stake,
being turned to the East, certaine cryed, he ought not to looke towards the East,

Exposition of holy Doctors, therefore with a cheerefull courage I am ready to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

the Sonne of the euerliuing God haue mercy on me, and when hee had said it thrice,
the fire smothered him, they made a new fire and burned the part of his body, they
cut the head into small gobbits that it might the sooner be consumed: his heart being
found amongst his bowels, when they had well beaten it with staues, they pricked it
vpon a sharpe prick, and rosted it in another fire till it was consumed: they tooke
the ashes and cast into the Riuer Rheyne that there might bee no dust of that man

sent him to prison againe, but not so straitly chained as before: but when his Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries

Fornicator, drunkard, or any vicious person, but a chast &amp; sober man, and a iust
true preacher of the Gospel, and whatsoeuer thing Maister <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> had holden or
written against the enormities, pomp, and disorder of the Prelates, he would defend
vnto the death: and added that all his sinnes did not so much gnaw and trouble
his Conscience, as that sinne which hee committed in that pestiferous seat which
in his recantation he had spoken against that man, and his Doctrine: concluding
that he vtterly reuoked and denied that wicked recantation, and that he did it throgh
weaknes of heart, and feare of death: when hee had spoken these and many other
things touching the praise of <hi>Iohn Wickliffe,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> then was he caried again
vnto prison, and greeuously fettered by the hands, armes, and feete, with great
chaines and fetters of Iron: and when he was brought againe to his Iudgement,
they exhorted him againe to recant: he answered, I take God to my witnes I hold
all the Articles of the Catholick Faith, but I shall be condemned, because I will
not consent vnto the condemnation of those most holy &amp; blessed men aforesaid, whom
you haue most wickedly condemned, for certaine Articles abhorring your abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

lifted him vp from the ground, stript him naked, and girded him about the lomes
with a linnen cloth: and so bound him to the Image: when they beganne to lay

Thus endeth the tragicall Historie of <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> and <hi>Ierome</hi> of Prage faithfully
collected by a Bohemian, being a present beholder of the same: <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> beeing a
Minister at Bethelem, had a vision by night, that he had pictured in his Church of
Bethelem, pictures of Christ and his Apostles: and the Pope and his Cardinals
came and defaced them, and that a while after other Painters renued the said pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
much more fairer then before: and that there was so many Painters that they
gloried against the Pope and his Cardinals, bidding them put them out if they
could, which with all their power they were not able to doe: this vision he thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth,
applying the pictures to the preaching of Christ and his Apostles, which
though the Pope and Cardinals should extinguish in him, yet the time would come
that Doctrine should be renued by other preachers, so plentiously that the Pope
with all his power should not be able to preuaile against it: wherevnto the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie

a memoriall of their deaths, decréeing it to be holden yéerely, and after they obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
certaine Churches of the King to preach and minister the Sacraments in: then
they suppressed diuers Monasteries, and Pharasaicall and Idolatrous Temples,
driuing the vicious Priests and Monkes out of them, or compelling them to a better
order, whereby their number augmented vnder the conduct of one <hi>Nicholas</hi> a Noble

péeces the Images, driuing away the Priests and Monkes, which hée said were
kept vp in their Cloisters like Swine in their fat sties a fatting: his army increased

Papists fled to the Castle Lytius, but he took the Castle, and put them all to sword

he compassed in with walles, and commanded euery man to build them houses,
and named it Thaber, and his companions Thabarites, as if they had seene the
transfiguration of Christ in the mount: the way to it by land was scarse thirty foot

               <p>The Councell of Basill also wrote their Letters to the Bohemians, to send their

the Church cannot bee better represented then by the Councell, and that they should
giue no lesse credit to the Councell, then to the Gospell, by whose authority the
Scriptures themselues are receiued and allowed, and that the Bohemians, which
call themselues the Children of the Church, ought to heare their Mother, which

               <p>The Bohemians answered: they had neither contemned the Church nor Councels,
and that they are come to manifest their innocency before the whole Church, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

               <p>One affirmed hee heard sundry things of the Bohemians offensiue to Chr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

Friers was diabolicall. Then <hi>Procopius</hi> said, it is not vntrue: for if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Moses,</hi> nor the Partriarcks before him, nor after him the Prophets, nor in the

all the Councell derided him, and Cardinall <hi>Iulianus</hi> laboured to prooue
that not onely the Decrees of the Patriarcks, Prophets, Christ and his Apostles:
but also the Decrees which the Church should ordaine to be the workes of God;
yet the order of begging Fryers may seeme to be taken out of some part of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell:
the Bohemians chose foure Ministers to dispute for them, and the Councell
chose foure, the disputation continued fifty daies, many things were alledged on

great men were wrought out of the way which were chiefe maintainers of the

he not onely sent them thither, but maintained them with force and armes, and that
hee beleeued otherwise of the Sacrament of the Altar, of penance, of pilgrimages, of
Image worshipping, and of Ecclesiasticall power then the Church of Rome taught,
and it was concluded that proces should goe against him, but first they would know
the Kings minde: wherevpon the Archbishop with his Bishops, and a great part of
the Clergy went to the King, and gréeuously complained against the Lord <hi>Cobham:</hi>
the king desired them, in respect of his Noble stock, they should fauorably deale with
him, and that if it were possible they should reduce him to the vnity of the Church

threatned the seculer power with curses and interdictions if they did not assist him,
against that seditious Apostata, Scismatick, and Heretick, troubler of a publike

in teaching and preaching the Scriptures purely; in giuing wholesome Councell of

And because he would not be sworn to submit himselfe to the Church, and take what

though they neuer goe in pilgrimage, as men vse now-a-dayes to Canterburie, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singham,

this day to answer other matters.</p>
               <p>Whether doe you beleeue that there is materiall bread in the Sacrament after
consecration, and whether a Christian be necessarily bound to confesse his sinnes to
a Priest? The Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> said, he would answer no otherwise then he had in his

               <p>The Archbishop sayd, the holy Church of Rome followed the sayings of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,

matters, which all christian men ought to beleeue and follow. Then he said, I will

                  <p>With the Bill I haue nothing to doe: but this is my beleefe touching
the Sacrament, That Christ sitting at his last supper with his Disciples, the night
before his death, he tooke Bread, blessed it, and brake it, and gaue it to his Disciples,
and said, <hi>Take and eate it, this is my bodie that shall bee betrayed for you; doe this
in remembrance of me, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <speaker>Cobh.</speaker>
                  <p>I beleeue it is Christs very bodie in the forme of bread. Then said a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
If the sacramentall words be vttered, there remaineth no bread, but it is the onely
bodie of Christ. Then he said to one Master <hi>Whithead;</hi> you said once to me that the
sacred Host was not Chrsts bodie. I proued there was his bodie, though Seculars
and Friers could not therein agree, but held one against another in that opinion.
Then said many together with great noise, We say all it is Gods bodie. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

earnestly vpon the Archbishop, he said: Sir, I beleeue surely that it is Christs bodie
in forme of bread. Do not you do so?</p>

                  <speaker>Archb.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes marrie doe I. And the Doctors asked him if it were only Christs
bodie after consecration, and no bread.</p>

                  <speaker>Cob.</speaker>
                  <p>It is both Christs bodie and bread, as Christ on earth was both God and
man, and the inuisible Godhead was hidden in the manhood, as one of your owne
Doctors <hi>Eutiches</hi> saith. As the selfe same Sacraments doe passe by the operation of
the holy Ghost into a diuine nature, and notwithstanding keepe the propertie still of
their former nature: so that principall mysterie declareth to remaine one true and
perfit Christ. Then they smiled one vpon another, that the people might iudge
him taken in an heresie: and diuers said with a great bragge, it is a foule
heresie.</p>

                  <speaker>Archb.</speaker>
                  <p>What bread is it? And the Doctors inquired of him whether it were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall, or not.</p>

                  <p>The Scripture maketh no mention of materiall bread, therefore my faith
hath nothing to doe therewith: but I say and beleeue, that it is Christs bodie and
bread. Christ saith in the sixt of <hi>Iohn, I am the liuing bread, and not the dead bread.</hi>
Then all with one voyce said, it is an heresie. And one of the Bishops said, it is an
error manifest to say it is bread after the Sacramentall wordes once spoken, but
Christs bodie onely. He said I am sure S. <hi>Paul</hi> was as wise and more learned then
you be and in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. calleth it bread and not Christs bodie, but a meanes whereby
we receiue Christs bodie. They said; <hi>Paul</hi> must bee otherwise expounded: for it is
an heresie to say it is bread after the consecration. Hee asked how they could make
that good? They answered, it is against the determination of holy Church.</p>

                  <p>I know none holier then Christ and his Apostles, and that determination
is none of theirs: for it standeth not with the Scriptures but is cleane contrary. It
hath beene the Churches but since shee receiued the great poyson of worldly posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,

the Church. Hee answered no: for it is no God. <hi>In</hi> is but thrice ment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Creed, in God the Father, and in God the Sonne, and in God the holy Ghost: the

Neither hath the Church the Sacraments, the forgiuenesse of sinnes, or resurrection,
or eternall life any other <hi>In</hi> then in the holy Ghost. Then one of the Lawyers said,
But what is your beleefe concerning holy Church? I beleeue the Scriptures bee
true, all that is grounded vpon them I beleeue, and I know it is Gods pleasure I

                  <speaker>Cobh.</speaker>
                  <p>Yea truely can I. Then a Prior said, it is doubt to you who is thereof:
for Christ said <hi>noli iudicare;</hi> if you must not iudge your neighbors, much lesse your
superiors. He answered, Christ saith in the same Chapter, <hi>As the ill tree is knowne
by his ill fruits, so a false Prophet by his workes.</hi> And he saith in <hi>Iohn, Beleeue the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
doings.</hi> And againe in <hi>Iohn, Iustum Iudicium iudicate:</hi> When wee know the
thing is true we may iudge. And <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>Recte iudicate filii hominum.</hi> As for
your superioritie; were you of Christ you would be meeke Ministers, and not proud
superiours.</p>
                  <p>Then Doctor <hi>Walden</hi> said, You make no differences of iudgements: so swift
Iudges alwaies are the learned Schollars of <hi>Wickliffe.</hi> He answered, your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are preposterous, as the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> saith, <hi>yee iudge ill good, and good ill:</hi>
therefore your wayes are not Gods wayes, nor Gods wayes your wayes. Afore
that vertuous man <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> whom you disdaine, I will say before God and man;
before I knew the despised doctrine of his, I neuer abstained f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>om sinne, but since I
trust I haue done otherwise: so much grace could I neuer finde in all your glorious
instructions. Doctor <hi>Walden</hi> answered, It were not well with mee if so many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and vertuous men, teaching the Scriptures, and the examples of the Fathers
so plenteous, if I had no grace to amend vntill I heard the Diuell preach. <hi>Hierome,</hi>
saith, hee which séeketh such suspected masters, shall not finde the mid-day, but the
mid-day Diuell. He answered, the Pharises your fathers ascribed Christs miracles
to Belzebub, and his doctrine to the Diuell; and you, their naturall children, haue
still the same iudgement of his faithfull followers: they that reproue your vicious
liuing must needs be hereticks, and when you cannot proue it by Scriptures, then
your Doctors must proue it. Then said he to them all, to iudge you we néede goe no
further then your acts: Where finde you in Gods law that you should thus sit in
iudgement, and sentence euery man to death as you doe here daily? You haue no
ground in Scripture but in <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Cayphas,</hi> which sat thus vpon Christ, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
his Apostles after his ascention: you learned it not of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi> A Lawy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
said, yes sir, Christ iudged <hi>Iudas.</hi> Hee answered, no; Christ iudged him not, hee
iudged himselfe: Christ said indéed vnto him, woe vnto him for that couetous act of
his, as he doth yet still to many of you; for since the venom was shed in the Church,
you neuer followed Christ, neither were perfit in his law.</p>

your owne Chronicles mention, Wo, wo, wo, this day is venome shed into the

since that time one hath put down another, one hath poysoned another, one hath cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

the Pope is proude and a tyrant; Christ was poore and forgaue, the Pope rich

Monks be like Pharises, deuided in outward apparell and visages: so yee make
deuision amongst the people. Thus you, with such others, are the naturall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Antichrist. Then hee said vnto them all; Woe vnto you Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises
hypocrits, you shut the Kingdome of heauen from others, and enter not your
selues, nor suffer any other to enter: you stoppe vp the wayes with your traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
therefore are you the houshold of Antichrist. You will not let Gods veritie

                  <p>Both Christ and his Apostles were accused of sedition making, yet were
they most peaceable men. Both <hi>Daniel</hi> and Christ prophesie that such a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blous
time shall come as hath not beene been before: this is partly fulfilled in your
dayes and doings; for many haue you slaine, and more will you slay if God fulfill
not his promise: if hee shorten not your dayes scarcely should any flesh bee saued.
Moreouer, though Priests and Deacons, for peaching Gods word, and ministring
the Sacraments, with prouision for the poore, bee grounded in Gods law, yet your
other Sects haue no ground thereof.</p>
                  <p>Then a Doctor of the law plucked out of his bosome a Writing, wherein was

                     </gap>esse himselfe to a Priest; hee answered, a diseased or wounded man had neede
haue a true and wise Chirurgion, knowing the ground and danger of the same:
therefore it is most necessarie to be first shréeuen to God, which only knoweth our
diseases, and can helpe vs. The lawes of God are to be required of a Priest which
is godly learned: but if he be an idiot or vicious, that is my Curate, I ought rather
to flie from him then seeke him, for I might sooner get ill then good of him. The
third was touching the authoritie of the Pope: hee answered, he that most followed
<hi>Peter</hi> is next him in succession; but your Lordly order esteemeth little the lowly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour
of <hi>Peter,</hi> nor the humble manners of them that succeeded him vntill <hi>Silue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
which for the most part were Martyrs: you let their good conditions goe, and

one of the Doctors, then what say you of the Pope? Hee answered, he and you to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

<hi>Peter</hi> follow Christ in conuersation. The fourth was touching Pilgrimage
to Images: hee answered, I owe them no seruice by the commaundement of
GOD, therefore I will not seeke them for your couetousnesse. You were
best sweepe them faire from Cobwebs and Dust, or lay them vp safe for
catching hurt, or burie them in the ground, as you doe other aged people
which are GODS Images. It is a wonder that Saints beeing dead should
bee so couetous, néedie, and beggers, which in their life time hated couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and begging. I would all the world knew it, With your shroeues and
Idols, your fained Absolutions and Pardons, you draw vnto you the wealth
and chiefe pleasures of all Christian Realmes. Then a Frier said, Will you

that were generally obiected against them, were; That auriculer confession is not to bee
made vnto a Priest, but vnto God, because no Priest hath no power to absolue a sinner.
That no Priest can make the body of Christ in the Sacrament, and that material bread
remaineth after consecation. That euery true Christian man is a Priest to God. That
none is bound, vnder paine of damnation, to Lent, or other dayes prohibited. That the
Pope is Antichrist, and his Prelates Antichrists disciples; and that the Pope hath no
power to binde and lose on earth; and that it is lawfull to doe any worke, except sinne,
vpon the holy daies. That Priests may haue wiues lawfully. That the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

not to pray to any Saints, but onely to God. That bels, and ringing in the Church

of Antichrist: therfore an enemy to Christs truth, that men ought not to worship Images
or other Idolatrous paintings, nor the holy men which are deade. That the Romish
Church is the figtree that Christ cursed, because it brought forth no fruit of the true belief.
That such as weare Coules, or are annointed, and shorne, are the Lance-knights, and sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and that all of them, because their lamps are not burning, shal be shut out

comfort of the Church, through the enuy of Sathan, it turned into a matter of most

flattering promises, granting him further time to consult, that the delay of death

the French King After <hi>Eugenius</hi> brought to passe by the Emperour, and
his Orators of which <hi>Aeneas Siluius</hi> was one, that they were content to

This Pope, to gather great summes of Mony, appointed a Iubile in the yeare
of our Lord 1450. there resorted great number of people to Rome, more then
at any time before were seene there. At which time, as there were a great sort of
people going to Mount Uaticane, to behold the Image of our Sauiour, which
they had there to shew to Pilgrims, a Mule of the Cardinals of Saint <hi>Marke</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that way, the people for multitude being not able to voyde the way, one
or two falling vpon the Mule, there was such a throng, that two hundred men
and thrée horses were strangled vpon the bridge, and many fell ouer into the water
and were drowued: wherefore the Pope caused the small houses to bee plucked
downe, to make the Bridge broader. In the yeare 1453. Constantinople was taken
by the Turkes.</p>
            <p>In the yeare one thousand foure hundred fifty fiue, when the death of Pope <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi>
was published, the Germaines bewayling their miserable estate, perswaded
the Emperour that he should be no longer vnder the Popes obedience, except
they first obtained certaine thinges touching the Charter of Apeales, shewing
that they were in worse case then eyther the French-men or Italians, and as it
were their Seruants, and especially of the Italians: that they alone had not the
vse of their Lawes, and that the French Nation had not made their sute in
vaine vnto their King, against the exactions of the Popes, by whom they were
defended, which also prouided decrées for the liberty of his people: The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
promised, hee would prouide for them, no lesse then the King of Fraunce
had done for the French-men. But <hi>Aeneas Siluius</hi> brake off the matter, saying;
Though there bee variance amongst Princes in waighty matters, yet peace may
be made againe: but betweene the Prince and the Common people, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
mortall hatred, and because he should be Successour vnto the Pope; hee
concluded, he thought it better to accord to the Pope, then to follow their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
whose minds are led with couetousnesse, rather then by reason: and the
Emperour chose him Ambassadour to Pope <hi>Calixtus,</hi> to sweare vnto him in his
Name, and to promise the absolute obedience of all Germany. Thus twice
<hi>Fridericke</hi> of Austrich contemned and derided the Germaines, frustrating them
of their natiue ordinances, and brought them into subiection vnder the Pope,
which was the cause that seauen yeares before his death, he caused his Sonne
<hi>Maximillian</hi> to bee crowned King of the Romaines, least after his death the
Empire should be transported vnto another Familie, as it afterwards came to
passe. Whereupon Germany being in this miserable pouerty, and greeuous
subiection of the Popes tyranny and polling, with teares and sighes lamenting
their estate, continued so almost vnto <hi>Luthers</hi> time, as those Histories hereafter
doe testifie.</p>
            <p>The Ambassadour of the Arch-bishop of Maydenburge, <hi>Henry Token,</hi> writeth,
that in the Councell of Basill, the Arch-bishop of Lyons did declare, that in Pope
<hi>Martines</hi> time, there came out of Fraunce to the Court of Rome, nine millions of
Gold, which was gathered by the Byshops and Prelats, besides the poore Clergy,
which daily without number runne vnto the Court of Rome, carrying with them all
their whole substance.</p>
            <p>The Arch-byshoppe of Turonne said, also at Basill, that three Millions of
Gold in his time came to Rome in foureteene yeares of the Prelates, besides
the poore Cleargy, which daily runne to that Court. Let the man which fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

            <p>The Pope fearing him, being in great reputation amongst all men, least hee

But the said <hi>Hierome</hi> withstood him alwaies: wherefore hee was accursed, yet

               <p>There were besides these 100.<note place="margin">1522</note> grieuances, complained vpon to the Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats,
in the raign of the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, out of which we haue but touched
certaine which we thought to be most effectuall.</p>
               <p>First, that many things are commaunded and forbidden by mens Constitutions,
contrary to the commandement of God, as innumerable lets of Matrimony, and the
vse of meats forbidden, which are created for mans vse, &amp; are indifferently to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
with thanks-giuing: by which Constitutions, men are brought into bondage,
vntill by Money they obtaine dispensations, so that Money maketh that lawfull to
the rich, which is prohibited to the poore, by which snares of mens Lawes, great
summes of Money are gathered out of Germany, and it bréeds priuate offences of
the poore, when they see themselues intangled in these snares, onely because they
haue not the thornes of the Gospell, for so Christ often calleth riches.</p>
               <p>That those that haue receiued Ecclesiasticall orders, being free from the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Secular Magistrates, doe presume in sinning, and are maintained therein
by the principall estates of the Cleargy. They attempt the chastity of Matrons and
Uirgins, and by gifts and flattering, they bring to passe, and by their secret confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
that many, which otherwise would liue honest, haue beene ouercome and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to sinne: and often they keepe wiues from their husbands, and daughters from
their Fathers, threatning them with fire and sword that require them. They of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
liuewise daily, in robbery, murders, accusing of Innocents, burning, rapine,
theft and counterfeiting Coyne; besides many other mischiefes, and the Bishops
cannot openly punish them, except hee disgrade them; and they are bound by their
Charters, that they dare not punnish them; therefore necessity and Iustice doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
that the said priuiledges of the Cleargy should bee abrogated, and that they
should haue the same iudgement as the Layty for such offences.</p>
               <p>That Christians are excommunicated for vaine and prophane causes, for desire
of filthy luker, whereby the weake in faith are burdened, and brought to dispaire,
where a man ought to be excommunicated only for heresie.</p>
               <p>That there are so many holydaies, that Husbandmen haue scarce time to gather
the fruits of the earth, which were brought forth with so great trauell: and vpon
these holidaies innumerable offences are committed.</p>
               <p>If any fight or shed blood in any hollowed place, it is interdicted, and cannot
haue any more seruice done in it, vntill all the Cittizens, with great pompe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
haue caused it to be now consecrated, which charge redound vpon the Laity,
and none but the Suffragans can baptize Bels, who do affirme, that Bels so bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,

are appointed: and such as bee rich, at the baptising, hold the Bell-rope, the
Suffragan speaking for them, and they all answere, and name the Bell, it hauing
a new Garment vpon it: then they goe to sumptuous banquets, to which the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sips
are bidden, the Suffragan and his Chaplaines are sumptuously fed, and yet
he must haue a reward, that in small Uillages 100. Florens are often spent about
such Christenings.</p>

               <head>The Historie of Doctor VVESALIANVS.</head>
               <p>THis <hi>Wesalia</hi> was complained vpon to <hi>Piorherus</hi> Archbishop of Mentz, by the
Thomists, which is an Order holding of <hi>Thomas de Aquino.</hi> The Bishop made
him answer, he should giue vp all his workes and writings which he had made and
preached. This being done, they deuided them amongst themselues, that euery man
might finde out what errours and heresies they could. His Articles and opinions
were these:</p>
               <p>That all men be saued fréely and through méere grace by faith in Christ Iesus:
frée-will to be nothing; only that we should beléeue the word of God, and not the
glosse of any man or fathers: that the word of God is to be expounded by the collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of one place with another: that Prelats haue no authoritie to make lawes or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the Scriptures, by any peculiar right more then another: that mens traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as Fastings, Feasts, long prayers, Pilgrimations, and such like are to be reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Extream vnction and confirmation to be reproued, confession and satisfaction
to be reprehended: the primacy of the Pope he also affirmed to be nothing. Upon
which Articles this <hi>Wesalia</hi> by a generall assembly was condemned, and his books
to be burned.</p>
               <p>He bring required of the Councell, what he thought of the Uicar of Christ in
earth? He said he beléeued that Christ left no such Uicar in earth: for ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
into heauen hee said, <hi>Behold I am with you &amp;c.</hi> By which wordes hee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that he would substitute vnder him no Uicar in earth: for a Uicar signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
one who in the absence of the principall hath to doe the workes of the
principall.</p>
               <p>And being asked his opinion of Indulgences and Pardons: he said he beleeued
that the treasure-boxe of the merits of Saints could not be distributed of the Pope
to others, because their treasure is not left here on earth: for it is written in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation,
<hi>Their works follow them;</hi> and that their merits could not be applied to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men, for the satisfaction of their paine due to them: and he called Indulgences
and Pardons <hi>pias fraudes fidelium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And being asked the question, he said, He thought that hallowing of Altars, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics,
Uestments, War Candles, Palmes, Hearbes, Holy water, and other diuine
things, made them haue no spirituall power in them to driue away any Diuells, and
that holy water had no more efficacie then other water, concerning remission of veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
sinnes and driuing away Diuels, and other effects which the Schoole Doctors
attribute vnto it.</p>
               <p>After these Articles were condemned by the Inquisitor and his assistants, hee
said, As you doe with me, if Christ himselfe were here he might be condemned as an
hereticke: but within thrée or foure dayes, with much perswasions, he was content
to condiscend vnto them, and submit himselfe to their holy mother Church.</p>

<hi>Vesalianus</hi> was condemned, this <hi>Veselus</hi> thought that the Inquisitor would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

reprehended the Papists doctrines of the diuision of Repentance, and Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,
and workes of Supererogation, and Pardons, and Indulgences, and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
against them at Rome and at Paris; so that many of the Popes Court per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
by him, began to speake more freely and more boldly against these matters
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:14787:83"/>
then himselfe did: hee disallowed the abuses of the Masses, prayers for the dead,
and the Supremacie of the Pope, and that no such supreme head ouer all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ought to bee in the world: and that the Pope hath no authoritie to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
but so farre as truth goeth with him, and that hee ought not to preuaile by
commanding, but by teaching that the Pope and the Prelates proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Christes Doctrine, are plaine Antichristes. Hee said those Priestes
that had vowed not to marrie, and were not able to bee chaste might breake
there vow.</p>
               <p>Hee said that their forefathers before <hi>Albert</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> did resist the Popes
indulgences, and called them Idolatry, fraude and errour: in his Booke <hi>de
subditis &amp; superioribus;</hi> he disputeth against the Pope, and his Prelates: affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
except their Faith be sound, they are not to bee obayed, and that the Pope
may erre, and men ought to resist him therein, that superfluous riches in the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
doe not profit but hurt.</p>
               <p>That the Pope doth wickedly distribute the rents of the Church, and the Church
itselfe to vnworthy Ministers by Symony for hir own profit: whereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
hee careth not for GOD nor the Church: That the precepts of the Pope and

holsome, and stand with the truth of the word; that the Pope can command no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
vnder paine of deadly sinne, but what God commandeth: The Kingdome of
heauen, is rather shut then opened by the Popes keyes, as the Pharisies did: that
the hearers ought to discerne and Iudge the Doctrine of the Prelates, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
all things they say without due examination.</p>
               <p>Hee prophesied to <hi>Iohn Ostendorpius,</hi> well my Childe thou shalt liue
to that day, that the Doctrine of these new and contentious Diuines of
<hi>THOMAS</hi> and <hi>BONAVENTVRE,</hi> with other of that sort, shall bee vtterly
reiected from true Christian Diuines: And hee often disputed of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
of faith, and why Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did so often inculcate that men be iustified by
faith and not by workes, that all men were deceiued who attributed to Traditions
any opinion of GODS worship, or that they could not in any wise be violated
or broken.</p>

               <p>THus proceeding in our Storie (by the ayde of Christ) we approach vnto the

the desolate ruines of religion by the industrie of this <hi>Luther,</hi> sent &amp; set vp by
the mightie spirit of Christ, to abolish the abuses and pride of Antichrist, which so

               <p>Many prophesies went before of this time, as of the aforesaid prophesie of <hi>Iohn
Hus</hi> and <hi>Ierome</hi> of Prage, that a hundred yeares come and gone they should giue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to God and him. This prophesie was in the yeare one thousand foure hundred

               <p>
                  <hi>Philip Melancton</hi> maketh mention of a Monke about fiftis years before this time,
named <hi>Iohn Hilton,</hi> in Thuring, who was cast into prison for speaking against cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
abuses of the place and order where he liued: and being weake and feeble, hee
desired the Warden of the Couent to respect his wofull case; he rebuked him for
that which he had spoken: he said he had spoken nothing preiudiciall to their Monke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
or religion, but there shall come one in the yeare one thousand fiue hundred and
sixteene, which shall vtterly subuert all Monkerie, and they should neuer be able to

               <p>The Angell falling from the high pinicle of the Popes Church into the Riuer Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris

               <p>By these and such like prophesies it was euident, that the time of resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

at last by prayer and reading he perceiued that Doctrine more euidently.</p>

so Diuinely that hee seemed to all the faithfull and learned a shining light,
which beganne to cleere after the long cloudy sky; hee shewed the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

in the Schooles and Sermons, teaching that men merite remission of sinnes
by their proper workes, and were iust before GOD by outward Discipline,

for the loue of the Sonne of GOD, and that wee ought faithfully to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
this bountifull gift: His life was likewise correspondent to his profession,
whereby it appeared his words were not lip-labour, but proceeded from the
heart, whereby many notable personages consented with him in his opinions: at
this time <hi>Luther</hi> altered nothing in the ceremonies, but taught this onely doctrine
as the principall of all others; to wit, the Doctrine of Repentance, of remission of
sinnes, of Faith of true comfort in time of aduersitie, euery man receiued good taste

certaine Monkes, and sophisticall Diuines, and commaunded them to
write something against <hi>Luther,</hi> and in his Sermons, he taught that <hi>Luther</hi> was
an heretick, and worthy to bee burned, and he burned <hi>Luthers</hi> positions, and the
Sermon he writ against indulgences: This forced <hi>Luther</hi> to intreat more amply
of things and to maintaine the truth. <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of Saxony, in the presence
of the Emperor, besought <hi>Erasmus,</hi> his opinion, if <hi>Luther</hi> had erred, he answered his
opinions were good, but he desired he would moderate his stile.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Luther,</hi> the plainer to expresse the doctrine of repentance, of remission of
sinnes, of Faith and of Indulgences, Hee added also these matters; the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

               <p>He came contrarie to the expectation of many, and of his aduersaries; for they
thought he would not come, because his bookes a few dayes before were condemned
by publique proclamations, and many perswaded him not to submit himselfe to any
danger: who answerd, since I am sent for, I am resolued to enter into Worms, in the
name of our Lord Iesus Christ, though I knew there were so many Diuels to resist
me, as there be tiles to couer the houses in Wormes.</p>
               <p>The fourth or fift day after he came to Wormes, he was enioyned at foure of the
clock in the afternoone, to appeare before the Emperor, Dukes, and other estates of
the Empire, to vnderstand the cause he was sent for. And standing before them, he
was commanded silence vntill he was interrogated. Then was asked him, whether
those books were his which were written in his name, a great company of them ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before them? and if they were thine, whether thou wilt recant, and reuoke
them, and all that is contained in them, or rather meanest to stand to that which is
written in them? Then <hi>Luthers</hi> Aduocate desired that the titles of the books might
be read, which was done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> answered, Hée could not but acknowledge those bookes to be his, and that
he would neuer recant any clause thereof: and for the iustifying of them he desired
some time to consider, because there be questions of faith, and the saluation of the
soule, wherein it were dangerous, and a rash thing to pronounce any thing without
good aduisement.</p>
               <p>After they had consulted, the Officiall said, Though thou doest not deserue to haue
opportunity giuen thée to determine, yet the Emperour of his méere clemencie g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thée one day: to morrow at this time thou shalt render before him; conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
thou do not exhibit thine opinion in writing, but pronounce the same with liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
voyce.</p>
               <p>At which time, when he was appointed to answer, he answered to this effect; All
my books are not of one sort: there be some in which I haue so simplie and Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically
intreated of the religion of faith and honest conuersation, that my very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are compelled to confesse they be profitable, and worthy to be read of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
and the Popes Bull iudgeth certaine of my books inculpable: if I should
reuoke these, I should condemne that truth which friends and foes confesse.</p>
               <p>There is another sort of my books, which containe inuectiues against the Pope
and doctrine of the Papists, as against those which haue corrupted all Christendom
bodily and spiritually, with their pestiferous doctrine, and pernicious examples: for
I cannot dissemble this, when the vniuersall experience and common complaint of all
beare witnesse, that the consciences of all faithfull men haue béen most miserably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapped,
vexed, and most cruelly tormented by the Popes lawes, and doctrine of
men: and further, their substance deuoured, specially in this famous Countrey of
Germanie.</p>
               <p>If then I should reuoke these, I can doe none other but augment force to their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie,
and not only open windowes but wide gates to such an infernall impietie,
the which will extend more wide and with more libertie then yet she durst, and by the
testimonie of this my retractation, their insolent and malitious Kingdome shall be
made most licentious, and lesse subiect to punishment, If I <hi>Luther</hi> should do this by
the authoritie of your most excellent maiestie.</p>
               <p>The third sort of my books I haue written against priuat persons, such as with
tooth and nayle labor to protect the Romish tyrannie, and deface true religion, which
I haue taught and professed; I confesse, against these I haue been more violent then
my profession required: if I should recant these, it would come to passe that tyranny
and impietie shall raigne, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Neuerthelesse, as Christ when he was examined of his doctrine before <hi>Annas,</hi> and
hauing receiued a buffet of the Minister, said, <hi>If I haue spoken ill, beare witnesse of
the euill.</hi> If Christ, which was assured he could not erre, refused not to haue testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
giuen against his doctrine, how much more I that cannot but erre, ought ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14787:85"/>
to intreat, if any will beare witnesse against my doctrine: and if any can by
Scripture conuince me of error, I will reuoke any manner of error, and be the first
that shall consume my books with fire. I conceiue no greater delectation in any thing
then when I behold dissentions stirred vp for the word of God; for such is the course
of the Gospell, as Christ saith, <hi>I came not to send peace vpon the earth but a sword:
I came to set a man at variance against his father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we must thinke our god is terrible in his Councels against his aduersaries,
lest the condemning of the word of God turne to a huge Sea of euils, lest the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of this yong and bounteous Prince <hi>Charles</hi> bee lamentably and miserably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.
I could amplifie this with authorities of Scripture, and <hi>Pharo,</hi> the King of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,
and the Kings of Israell, who then most obscured the bright Sunne of their
glorie, and procured their owne ruine, when they attempted to pacifie their
Realmes in this manner.</p>
               <p>Then the Emperours Ambassador checked <hi>Luther,</hi> saying, he had not answered
to any purpose, and that he ought not to call in question things long time agoe defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by generall Councels: therefore they required whether he would reuoke
or no. Then he answered, If I be not conuicted by testimonies of Scriptures and
probable reasons (for I beléeue not the Pope nor his generall Councels) I will not
nor may not reuoke any thing: for it is vngodly to doe against my conscience.</p>
               <p>Then the Embassador replied; if all such as impugne that which was decréed by
the Church and Councels may once get this aduantage, to be conuinced by the
Scriptures, we shall haue nothing established in Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ndom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> answered, the Councells oft gainsaid themselues, and that he was able to
proue that Councels haue erred: and night approaching, the Lords arose; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Luther</hi> had taken his leaue of the Emperor, diuers Spaniards scorned and scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
at him, hollowing and whopping after him a long time.</p>
               <p>After, there were bills set vp against <hi>Luther,</hi> and others with him: but this was
subtilly done of his enemies, as it was thought, that there might be occasion offered
to infringe the safe conduct giuen him, the which the Romane Embassador with all
diligence indeuoured to bring to passe.</p>
               <p>When he was sent for to the Archbishop of Triers, they protested vnto him they
sent not for him for disputation, but beningly and brotherly to exhort him: and they
said, though the Councels had erred, yet their authoritie was not thereby abased, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was it lawfull for euery man to impugne their opinions, and that Decrées,
Traditions of men, and Ceremonies were established to represse vices according to
the qualities of times, and that the Church could not be destitute of them. the trée is
knowne by his fruits. These lawes haue much profited.</p>
               <p>And they alleadged that <hi>Luthers</hi> books would breed great tumult and incredible
troubles, and that he abused the common sort, with his booke of Christian liberty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
them to shake off their yoake, and to confirme in them a disobedience, and
that now the world was at another stay then when the beleeuers were all of one
minde.</p>
               <p>And albeit he had written many good things, and doubtlesse with a good spirit,
yet now the Diuell hath attempted by wily meanes that all his works for euermore
should be condemned: and by these last workes, it is easie to know the tree by the
fruit, not by the blossomes, often repeating in his Oration that this admonition was

he added menasings, that if he would abide in his purposed intent, the Emperour
would exterminate him his Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> answered to this effect, That the Councell of Constance had erred in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
this Article of <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> That the Church of Christ is the communion of
the predestinat, and that we ought rather to obey God then man.</p>
               <p>There is an offence of faith, and an offence of charitie: the slander of charity consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
in manners and life, the offence of faith and doctrine consisteth in the word of
God; and they commit this offence which make not Christ the corner stone. And if
Christs sheepe were fed with the pure pasture of the Gospell, and the faith of Christ
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14787:85"/>
sincerely preached, and if there were good Eclesiasticall Magistrates who duely exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
their office, wee should not néede to charge the Church with mens tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
               <p>And that hee knew and taught, that wee ought to obay the higher powers, how

                  </gap>rsly soeuer they liued, so that they inforce vs not to deny the word of God.</p>
               <p>Then they admonished him to submit himselfe to the Emperour and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires
Iudgment, hee answered hee was well content, so that this were done with
authority of the word of God, and that he would not giue place except they taught
sound Doctrine by the word of God, and that St. <hi>Augustine</hi> writeth, hee had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to giue honor onely to the Canonicall bookes of the Scripture, and touching
other Doctors, though they excell in holin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them vnlesse they pronouced truth, and St. <hi>Paule</hi> saith, proue all things, follow
that which is good, and againe, if an Angell teach otherwise let him bee accursed,
finally, hee meekely besought them not to vrge his conscience, captiued in the bands
of the word of God, to deny that excellent word.</p>
               <p>After the Arch-bishop sent for <hi>Luther</hi> to his Chamber, and tould him for the most
part that at all times holy Scriptures haue ingendred errors, and went about to
ouerthrow this proposition that the Catholike Church is the communion of Saints,
presuming of cockle to make wheate, and of bodily excrements to compact mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
<hi>Martin Luther</hi> and one <hi>Ierome Schu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Hee was oftentimes assayled to reforme the censure of his bookes vnto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
and Empire, or to the Generall Councell, which he was content to doe, so
they would iudge them according to the word of God, otherwise not, aleaging the
words of the Prophet, <hi>trust you not in Princes, nor in the children of men wherein is
no health, also, cursed be hee that trusteth in men:</hi> and when newes came hee should
returne home, hee sayd, euen as it hath pleased God so it is come to passe, the name
of the Lord be blessed, and sayd, hee thanked the Emperour and Princes that they
had giuen him gracious audience and graunted him safe conduct to come and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
and said hee desired in his heart they were reformed according to the sacred
word of God, and sayd, hee was content to suffer any thing in himselfe for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
but only the word of God he would constantly confesse vnto the latter end:
About a yeare after this, <hi>Luther</hi> dyed, when hee had liued almost thrée score and thrée
yeares, and had béene Doctor thrée and thirty yeares, hee sayd at his death, O hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly,

were sent to Paris to bee iudged by the Sorbonists, the iudgment was

               <p>Pope <hi>Leo</hi> commanded <hi>Luthers</hi> bookes to bee burned openly, <hi>Luther</hi> also burned
the Popes decrees and Decretalls in the Uniuersity of Wittenberge.</p>

the cause to bee supposed is this, other men spake but against the pompe, pride,
whoredome, and auarice of the Pope, <hi>Luther</hi> went further with him, charged him
with his Doctrine, not picking at the rine, but plucking vp the roote, charging
him with plaine Heresie, as resisting against the blood of Christ, for whereas the
Gospell leadeth vs to bee iustified onely by the worthinesse of Christ and his bloud,
the Pope teacheth vs to séeke our saluation by mans merits, and deseruings by

benefit appeared to the world, the greater persecution followed the same, and where

Commaundements in English; so he brought her backe againe to the Bishop, where
she was presently condemned, and burned with the sixe before. There was another

glory of God, and the Gospell, beleeuing in the Sonne of God, saying; This is the
day we long desired, being in their shirts, they ioyfully imbrased the stake, praysing
God, singing Psalmes, and making testimony of their Faith. A Doctor seeing their
iolity, bid them take heed so foolishly to glorifie themselues: they answered, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid

to haue God before their eies; they answered, We trust we carry him truly in our

The Senate sent for the head men of the Parish, and shewed them the complaint

the Word of God, they will be ready with them to persecute him, otherwise wee

to Breame for the Preacher: they receiued this answere of the Senators; That
being he was hyred of the Church-wardens, and was not conuicted of Heresie, they
could not obtaine of the Cittizens that he should be carried away. Wherefore they
desired the Byshop, that he would send his learned men to dispute with him, and if

Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, and the Decrée of the Emperour, made at Wormes, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
he procéeded daily in preaching the Gospell. The Papists sent
their Chaplaines to euery Sermon, to trap him in his wordes, whereby many of

his doctrine was Gods truth, against which no man could contend, and such as

because he had preached two yeare at Breame, and that there were men sufficiently
instructed in the Gospell to build further: and that the Papists there, were for the
most part vanquished, and that their folly was knowne euen to women and children,
and that <hi>Diedmar</hi> liued without a Pastor in the midst of Wolues, he could not with

               <p>When he came thither he was ioyfully rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The Papists hearing hereof, before he had preached, stormed and fumed, especiallie
the Prior of the Black Monastery, who went to the Officiall, to take councell what
was to be done, least they lose their Kingdome, they tooke councell to withstand the
beginning, that he might not haue leaue to preach, least their crafts and wickednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
being laid open, it were folly after to resist, remembring what happened at
Breame.</p>
               <p>The next day early in the morning, the Prior, with the Chancelor, went to the
forty eight Presidents, being vnlearned men, and perswaded them what a seditious
Fellow was come from Breame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there-withall, if they would put him to
death, what fauour they should haue of the Byshop of Breame, whereupon they
decréed he should be put to death. Further, they had Letters from the forty eight
Presidents vnto the Parish-priest, commaunding him vnder great paine, that he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

should send away the said <hi>Henry</hi> without preaching. The Priest maruelled at
their meddling in such matters, being it belonged not to them, but the Parish-Priest
onely to receiue and put out a Preacher: and shewing this to <hi>Henry,</hi> hee
said he was sure hee must dye for the Gospell, and it was as neare to Heauen to
dye there, as in another place: and being he was sent for, and was sure it would be
gratefull to the people, he resolued to preach: and after the Sermon, the whole
Congregation be wayled, called together the Priors, deliuered them the Letter from
the Presidents, and that they should be fined a thousand Gildrons, if they suffered
him to preach. They were moued, because it was against the custome of their
Country as aforesaid: yet they concluded to keepe <hi>Henry</hi> for their Preacher, and
defend him. In the after noone hee preached againe, the next day the Cittizens
sent Ambassadours to the Presidents, offering to answer all causes for their Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
and they declared what godly Sermons he had preached, and the Parish-Priest
wrote to excuse himselfe, that <hi>Henry</hi> neuer intended sedition, but to
preach the Word truly, and offered himselfe ready to answere for the saide <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>

Finally, this Prior and others determined to take this <hi>Henry</hi> by night, and burn him

               <p>All the Presidents and others that were in this conspiracy, assembled in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish

prepared them torches, they burst into the Parish Priests house, they tooke away all
things, they fell vpon the Parish Priest, crying, kill the théefe; they pulled him by

out of his bed, bound his hands hard behind him, and drew him to and fro so vnmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully,
that a cruell Persecutor of the word cryed, let him alone. When they had led

that the blood gushed out of his mouth, and the Ladder being propped vp with a

of these foure Articles. First, that he did not beleeue that Priests could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
sinnes; neither that a man could call God out of heauen, neither that God was
in the bread that the Priests hang vpon the Altar: Fourthly, that the element of
water in Baptisme, doth not giue grace: Then one asked him whether he feared
not his Iudgement, neither loued his Wife and Children, and if he would recant
he should returne to them, and be pardoned. Wherevnto hee answered, my wife
and Children are so dearely beloued vnto mee, that they cannot be bought from mee
for all the Duke of Bauaria his riches: But for the loue of my Lord God, I will
willingly forsake them: as hee was going to execution, one bid him beleeue the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Altar, and not to beleeue it to be onely a signe. Hee answered, hee
beleeued the Sacrament to bee a signe of the body of Christ offered for vs: Then
he said why doest thou so little esteeme Baptisme, beeing Christ was baptized:
Hee answered not the baptisme of Christ, but his suffering, was our Saluation:
Him this day will I confesse before the world: Hee is my Sauiour in him I will
beléeue: Then one bid him put his trust in God, and say if I erre, truely I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent:

to hazard the matter, but to choose some Christian brother not to confesse thy self vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,

He answered, truely thou art our Father, and no other, this day I trust to be with

thy Name Hallowed in this world: Then he said, <hi>thy Kingdome come:</hi> He said let
thy kingdome come this day vnto me, that I may come to the Kingdome: the other

sent his army to Millaine, &amp; tooke the City &amp; Castle; marching towards Rome,
took it &amp; spoiled it, &amp; besieged Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> with his Cardinals in mount Adrian,
and took the pope, who could not be ransomed vnder 40000. Floreines: This Pope
bare great hatred against the Family of the Columni, because it was imperiall,
and threatned the Cardinall thereof to take away his Cardinals hat, who answered,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:14787:90"/>
if he so did, he would put on a helmet to ouerthrow the Popes triple Crowne. Our
Cardinall of England hearing of the captiuitie of his father the Pope, stirred vp
the King all he might fight with the Emperour, and defend the Faith, and he
should receiue a great reward of God. The King answered he was sorie for it: but

Faith, but for temporall possessions: I and my people can by no meanes rescue
him; but if any treasure may helpe him, take that which seemeth to you conuenient.
Then the Cardinall made out of the Kings treasure twelue score thousand pounds,
which he carried ouer the Sea with him: then the Cardinall sent his commission to
all Bishops, commanding fastings and solemne processions to be had, wherein they
did sing the Letany after this sort: <hi>Sancta Maria ora pro Clemente Papa: Sancte Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
ora pro Clemente Papa &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cardinall passing the Seas, went out of Callice with the Bishop of London,
the Lord <hi>Sandes</hi> the Kings Chamberlaine, the Earle of Derby, Sir <hi>Henry Gilford,</hi>
Sir <hi>Thomas Moore,</hi> with many other Knights and Esquires, to the number of one
thousand and two hundred horses, hauing in his carriage foure score Wagons, and
threescore Mules and Sumpter Horses: he bestowed great summes of money in hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Souldiers, and furnishing out the French Kings armie, and appointed certain
English Captains, in the K. of Englands name to go against the Emperor to rescue
the Pope: hee caused <hi>Clarentius</hi> king at Armes, to ioyne with the French Herald,
openly to defie the Emperor; wherupon ensued great troubles in England, Spain,
the low Countries of Flanders, Brabant, and Zeland: all which his priuie policies
and treasons, were shortly after known to the King.</p>
               <p>In this yeare a Iew in Constantinople was baptized and became Christian,<note place="margin">1528.</note>
which thing vehemently exasperated the Turks against him: and fearing it should
be some detriment to their Mahumeticall law, they sought to kill him, which they
did, and cast his dead carkasse into the stréets, commanding that none should burie it.
Wherin the glorie of Christ appeared: for the dead corps lying there nine daies, was
as fresh coloured, without corruption or smell, as if it had bin aliue; whereat the
Turks being astonished, took it vp and buried it.</p>
               <p>The Cardinall hauing defied the Emperour, as before, and made him displeased
with the King of England, he further whispered in the Kings eare, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
had euill intreated and imprisoned the Kings Embassadours in Spaine: by
which meanes the Emperours Embassadour in England was imprisoned, and
his goods seised, vntill Letters came to the contrarie, and then he was set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.
When the Embassadour complained vnto the Cardinall, hee layed all the
fault vpon <hi>Clarentius,</hi> and that <hi>Clarentius</hi> had defied the Emperour without the
Kings knowledge, by the request of the Herald of France, and that at his returne
he should lose his head at Callice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clarentius</hi> hearing hereof, came priuily into England, and was brought vnto the
King before the Cardinall knew it, to whom he shewed the Cardinalls commission,
and their gentle intreatie.</p>
               <p>When the King heard hereof, and had mused a while, he said, O Lord Iesus, hee
that I trusted most told me all these things contrary: well <hi>Clarentius,</hi> I will be no
more so light of credence. And from thence the King neuer put any more trust in the
Cardinall.</p>
               <p>Some write that the Cardinall did beare the Emperour such malice, because
when the Pope was imprisoned, as before, the Cardinall wrote vnto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
to make him Pope; and he sent him an answere that pleased him not: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he writ menacing Letters vnto him, that if he would not make him Pope, hee
would make such a rufling betwixt Christian, Princes as was not this hundred
yéers before, to make the Emperour repent, yea, though it cost the whole Realme
of England: the Emperour returned him answere, bidding him looke well
vnto it, lest through his doings it should cost him the Realme of England in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede.</p>
               <p>Thus King <hi>Henry</hi> came to the Title of Defender of the Faith. When <hi>Luther</hi>

had vtterd the abomination of the Pope and his Clergie, and diuers books were com

the breach valiantly a month, he brake vp the siege, and returned with great dishonor.</p>
               <p>The Emperour came to Strawsborough,<note place="margin">1530.</note> and commanded the Protestants to be
present at Masse which they refused to do: and he called the Prince Elector of Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony
to beare the Sword before him at the Masse; and the Diuines resolued, because
he was sent for, to beare the Sword and not to heare Masse: therefore hee might
there present himselfe. There was an Assembly holden, and diuers Decrées made
against the Protestants; and <hi>Faber</hi> and <hi>Eckius</hi> forged confutations against them,
with diuers other troubles.</p>
               <p>At this time the new Testament was newly translated, and imprinted by <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Tindall;</hi> wherewith the Bishoppe of London was grieued, and deuised how he
might destroy it. The Bishop being at Antwarp, and desirous to bring this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to passe, communed how he would buy the New Testaments. One <hi>Packing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
which was a fauourer of <hi>Tindall,</hi> but made the Bishop otherwise beleeue, said,
My Lord, I can doe more in this matter then most Merchants: for I know them

pay for them: for he intended to burne euery booke of them at <hi>Paules</hi> Crosse. Hee
hereupon declared the matter to <hi>William Tindall:</hi> so the Bishop had all the bookes.
After this <hi>Tindall</hi> corrected the same againe, and had them the second time newly
reprinted; so they came abundantly into England. The Bishop sent for <hi>Packing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
to know the reason thereof: he said he bought all that were there, and these were
new printed.</p>
               <p>One <hi>George Constantine</hi> was apprehended by Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> L. Chancelor

               <p>The Townes of Zurick and Berne being at contention with the Townes of
the Cantons, stopped all the Straits that there could no victuals passe vnto them;
wherefore they prouided a power to come against them of Berne and Zurick, and
fought a great conflict with them: in which fight <hi>Swinglius,</hi> being Minister of Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
was slain, and after his dead corps taken by his enemies and burned: when his
body was burned to ashes, his heart was found in the midst of the fire whole, which
could not be without the great miracle of God. The like happened after to <hi>Thomas
Cranmer</hi> Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>
               <p>In this yeare the King held a Parliament at Westminster: diuers Articles were
put vp against the Clergie touching their excesses and extortions, and there was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
for pluralties and non-residents, and for buying and selling of pardons. This
so displeased the Clergie, that they called the commons hereticks and schismaticks:
and the Lords put a book of articles against the Cardinall, that he procured the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
without the Kings consent, whereby he took away the right of all Bishops, that
in all writings to Rome and other Princes he wrote <hi>Ego &amp; Rex meus,</hi> that he stande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Church of England to be brought into a reprobate sense, sending to Rome to
be Legat, to reforme the Church, and carried the great Seale with him to Flanders,
and that without the kings consent he sent commission to conclude a league betwéen
the King and the Duke of Florence, and that hauing the French pocks, he presumed
to come and to breathe on the King, and that hee had caused the Cardinalls Hat to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:14787:92"/>
be put on the Kings coyne, that he had sent innumerable substance to Rome to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
his Dignities, to the great impouerishment of the Realme, with many other
things.</p>
               <p>The princely possessions and great pride of the Clergie in those dayes, did not
only farre excéede the measure of subiects, but surmounted the estates of Kings and
Princes.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth his dayes the Temporalties in the possessions of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
of England amounted to three hundred twentie two thousand marks by the

<hi>Fish,</hi> that the Cleargie had gotten into their hands more then the third part of
the lande of the Realme, and the goodliest Lordships, Mannors and Territories are
theirs, besides the tenth part of corne and all things else, and seruants wages: and

they get by their foure offering dayes, prouing of wills, priuie tythes, offerings to
pilgrimages, and at their first Masses; euery one that is buried must pay somewhat
for Masses and Dirges to be sung for them, else they will accuse their frinds and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors
for hereticks. What money get they for mortuaries, by hearing confessions?
and yet will keepe no Councell; by hallowing of Churches. Altars, Superaltars,
Chappels and Bels, by cursing men and absoluing them againe for money. What
a multitude of money gather the Pardoners in a yeare, by cyting men to the Court
and releasing them for money, and what abundance the begging Friers get yearly.

they spend away their husbands goods, and make the women runne away from their
husbands; and runne away themselues with the wife and goods, bringing man and
wife, and children to idlenesse, theft, and beggerie. Who is able to number the broad

may haue at least twentie pence a day to fleepe an houre with a Frier, Monke, or

pence a day to be bawde to one of these? What a sort are there that marrie Priests
Lemans but to cloake the Priests incontinencie, and that they may liue of Priests
for their labour? and who is he, though he be grieued neuer so sore for the death of
his Ancestor, rauishment of his wife or his daughter, robberie, trespasse, maime, debt
or any other offence, dare lay it to their charge by any way of action? if he do, then by

him, and then all his Actions be dashed.</p>

into their hands, is, that they pray for vs, to deliuer our soules out of Purgatorie:
without whose prayers, and especially the Popes pardon, we could neuer be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
thence: but the truth is, there is no Purgatorie, but it is a thing inuented by the
couetousnesse of the spiritualtie. And if there were a Purgatorie, if the Pope can
deliuer them there with money, he can deliuer them without; and if hee can deliuer
one, he can deliuer all, and so destroy Purgatorie, and then is he a cruell tyrant, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

They will not let the New Testament goe abroad in the mother tongue, lest
their cloaked hypocrisie, and that their cruelty, vncleanenesse, and vnmercifulnesse
be seeue, and that they seeke not Christs honour but their own, that remission of sins
are not giuen for the Popes pardon, but for Christ by true faith in him. And except
your Maiestie suffer their hypocrisie to be disclosed, the people will think you take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their liberty from them, to buy their soules out of Purgatorie by giuing to the

were well done to know whether she be his lawfull Daughter or no; because hee
begat her on his brothers Wife, which is directly against Gods Law: Thinke you
my Lords, that these words touch not my body and soule, and that it doth not daily

               <p>Then the Cardinall which did not greatly feare any power of Kings, but onelie
feared the Gospell of Christ to be preached, least it should detect their Hypocrisie and

impugne the same. He said, He had made such an Oath, but not lawfullie:

               <p>1 It was laid against him that he preached, though Preachers bee restrained

should not pisse there: When there were but few men did reuerence them,
but when in euerie corner there was a Crosse, of necessitie men pissed vppon
the Crosses: So that when there were but few Lawes in the Church, then
men were afraid to offend them: after ward they made many lawes, whereof some

spake.</p>
               <p>3 If I should suffer persecution for the Gospell, yet there are seuen thousand
more that would preach the Gospell as I doe now: therefore good people thinke not
much if these tyrants put a man to death for preaching the Gospell. This Article
he confessed.</p>
               <p>5 That euery Christian man is a Priest so offer vp sacrifice of prayer: and if
they murmured against Priesthood, they murmured against themselues: and that
we should not pray to Saints nor worship Images.</p>
               <p>6 That he should preach at Cambridge: that a Bachelor of Diuinity, or any other
knowing the Gospell, should be let from preaching by no man: and if any Bishop did
accurse them for so doing, their curses should returne to themselues. All these hee
confessed.</p>

What Articles were obiected vnto him, appeareth by a breefe Commentary,
written and sent to his friends out of prison, as followeth.</p>
               <p>First, the whole matter of the examination was two Articles, to wit; purgatory,
and the substance of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Touching purgatory, they asked whether I beleeued that there was any place to
purg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the spots of the dead after this life: I denied there was any, because the nature
of man consisteth but of two parts, the body and mind: one Christ purgeth in this
world by laying afflictions vpon vs, and death the reward of sinne is laid vpon it, but
our soules are purged with the word of God, which we drinke in through Faith, to
the saluation both of body and soule: If you will shew a third part of man, I will
grant you a third place, which you call Purgatory, otherwise I must deny vnto you
the Bishops shop of Purgatory.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it was required of me, whether the very body of Christ were in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Altar.</p>
               <p>I answered, it is both Christs body &amp; ours, for as of many corns is made one loafe,
so we being diuers, are but one body in Christ, therein it signifieth our body: so of the
Wine that is made of many clusters, one liquor.</p>
               <p>But the same bread againe, in that that it is broken, signifieth the body of Christ,
declaring his body to be broken and put to death for our redemption; and in that it is
distributed the fruit of his Passion is signified: the communication whereof equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
redounds to all Christians.</p>
               <p>And againe, when it is receiued to be eaten, it is the signification of the bodie of

               <p>Touching the question, whether grace be giuen only by the Sacraments; God
sendeth his grace where it pleaseth him, either with them or without them, and when
he pleaseth: and many lewd persons receiue the Sacraments that are destitute of
grace, to their confusion; yet in due receit of the Sacraments God giueth grace.</p>
               <p>Where you aske,<note place="margin">In opere imperf.</note> whether all things necessary to saluation are in Scripture; S.
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith he would haue a true preacher of Gods law not to swerue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:14787:100"/>
neither on the right hand nor the left: for hee that should thereunto adde or
withdraw, should enterprise to be wiser then God.</p>
               <p>And Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his Epistle <hi>ad Cicilium fratrem,</hi> teacheth how we ought to
heare
Christ only, not regarding traditions of men, like as he doth in diuers other
places. And this agreeth well with Scripture, which is called the word of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the administration of righteousnesse, the word of truth, the rodde of direction,
our spirituall food, the spirituall sword that we ought to fight withall against all
temptations and assaults of our glostly enemies, the seed of God, the kingdome of
heauen, the keyes of the same, the power of God, the light of the world, the law of
God, his wisedome and Testament: euery one of which wordes will giue sufficient
matter of argument, that following the same doctrine only shal haue sufficient safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct
to come vnto the inheritance promised, though no other way or mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xed vnto the same. In the hundred and eightéene Psalme, <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>The
word of God is true and his way verity; euery man is vanity and lying:</hi> and Christ
saith, <hi>Euery one that heareth my words and doth them, is like one that buildeth his
house vpon a sure foundation;</hi> and that there is none other foundation by S. <hi>Paule:</hi>
and he would haue vs <hi>follow one doctrine of Christ to a vnitie of faith, that we may
bee perfect men; not carried about with euery winde of doctrine, brought vp by the
slights and wilines of men that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Touching the question, that there are many things to be beléeued vpon paine of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
that are not in the Scripture: I say lawes ordained for the ciuill regiment
of the body, and all other Lawes, so they be not hurtfull to Faith or Charitie, but
help to the same, we ought to keep them not onely for feare of punishment, but for
Conscience sake, although such ordinance be not expressely in the Scripture; but I
say there is nothing that is not expressely in the Scriptures, that is to bee beleeued
vpon necessitie of saluation.</p>
               <p>Touching your Question of purgatory, and whether soules departed be there in
torment and purged: I say there is a purgatory in this world, which is the fire of
tribulations, through which all Christians shall passe, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith: <hi>All that liue
godly in Christ shall suffer persecution:</hi> In this purgatory I doe reckon my selfe now
to stand, God send me well to perseuere vnto his honour.</p>
               <p>Other Purgatory doe I know none, neither can any be proued by any place of
Scripture: And S. <hi>August: de ebrietate,</hi> saith, let no man deceiue himselfe; for
there be two places, the third is not knowne: He that with Christ hath not deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to raigne, shall perish with the Diuell, and in his Booke <hi>de vanitate seculi,</hi>
he saith, know you that when the soule is departed from the body, it is incontinent
for the good deeds put into paradice, and else throwne headlong into the Dungeon of
hell for the sinnes; and to this all Scripture agreeth.</p>
               <p>Touching your question, whether Martirs, Apostles, and Confessors departed,
ought to be honored and prayed vnto.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his Booke <hi>de vera religione,</hi> would haue that we should wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
no men departed, be they neuer so good and holy, no nor yet an Angell, nor to
honour them, but onely in imitating their good liuing as they followed God, not
building Churches to them; no, the Angels would not haue vs builde Churches to
them, but would with them we should honour the Maker of all things. They refuse
all honour, sauing <hi>honor Charitatis,</hi> which loue wee should expresse, in helping the
poore and helplesse: And the Scripture teacheth, that there is but one Mediator, and
we are exhorted in all places of Scripture to call vpon God in néed, but in no place
to call vpon any Saint.</p>
               <p>Touching your demaund, whether Oblations and Pilgrimages, may deuoutlie
and meritoriously be done vnto the Sepulchers and Reliques of Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> when he died, would be buried where no man should know which was his
graue: &amp; it was, because the Iewes, which were prone to new fangled worshipping,
should not fall into Idolatr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, worshipping him as God, for the great and many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
that were wrought by him when he was aliue. It is no point of my beleefe, to
thinke that Oblations &amp; Pilgrimages at Saints graues and Reliques, are meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:14787:101"/>
workes, neither is there any deuotion at all in doing of them.</p>
               <p>Touching fasting daies and time I say they are good for diuers respects, but it
is no deadly sinne to breake them, for they are but the traditions of men.</p>
               <p>Touching your question whether Images ought not to be in the Churches for a
remembrance of Christ, and his Saints. I know no Images made with hands that
ought to be worshipped; For the Psalme saith, <hi>Confusion be vnto all such as worship
carued Images and glory in pictures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his Book <hi>de vera religione,</hi> let vs not be bound to worship the
workes of men, for the workemen are more excellent then the things that they make;
whom notwithstanding we ought not to worship: and if Christs Doctrine were so
opened, that people might vnderstand it, as Prelates chiefely ought to doe by tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
we should haue no need of Images, for nothing is so effectuall to excite the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of Disciples, as the liuely voice of good teachers.</p>
               <p>Touching your demands, whether men forbidden to preach as suspected of
Heresi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ought to cease from preaching, Christ and his Apostles were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
heretickes, and the Apostles were forbidden oftentimes of the High Priest
and others to preach any more, and were imprisoned and scourged for it, yet
they would not leaue preaching, but told them to their faces they must obey
God which bad them preach, rather then men which forbad them; yea, the Angel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering
them out of prison, bad them go preach againe. This is for our instruction,
doubt not, for such practice is shewed in all ages, so you may sée when men bée
wrongfully infamed of heresie, and so prohibited by Bishops to preach the Word of
God: they ought not to stop for any mans commandement.</p>
               <p>Touching your question of hauing the Bible in English, in England. In my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
I say it was not well done to inhibit it: and worse, that the Bishops haue not
sithence amended it if they could, that the people might haue it to vse vertuously. And
I will adde one reason, the Scripture is the food and sustinance of mans soule, as it
appeareth by many places of the Scripture, as other meate is the foode of the body:
then if he be an vnkind Father that kéepeth away the bodily meate the space of a
wéeke or a month from his Children, it should seeme that our Bishops be no gentle
Pastors or Fathers, that kéep away the food of mens souls from them, both months,
yeares, and ages, especially when others offer the same.</p>
               <p>Touching you question, whether faith onely iustifieth. I answer with S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi>
Good works make not a man iustified, or right wise: but a man once iustified,
doth good works.</p>
               <p>These Articles being directed to the Archbishop of Canterburie, which was not
<hi>Cranmer</hi> but Doctor <hi>Warham:</hi> whereby it may be gathered, that this godly learned
man was long before he disputed before the King, or was condemned to death: vpon
the day that was appointed for him to suffer, this holy martyre of God was brought
out of prison vnto the house of the Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and carried into his inward cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where it is reported <hi>Cromwell</hi> asked him forgiuenesse for what he had done. And
being admonished of his houre of death, he was greatly comforted; and comming
into the hall, he saluted the Gentlemen and sate down to breakfast, shewing no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of sadnes or feare; after breakfast he was carried to the place of execution, where
he should offer himselfe a sacrifice of sweet sauour vnto the Lord, who is blessed in
his Saints for euer and euer. Amen.</p>

Christ the onely head of the Church; And I say with S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> that whosoeuer
calleth himselfe an vniuersall Bishop, he is the fore-rider of Antichrist. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they alledge the high priesthood of the old law, I say the right of that high priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
is onely transported vnto Christ, for this Priest-hood doth not onely consist in
learning but in the propitiation and mercy of God, which Christ hath fulfilled by his
death, &amp; in the intercession by the which he doth now intreat for vs vnto his father.</p>
               <p>Whereas they alledge out of the 16. Chapter of <hi>Mathew, Thou art Peter, and
vpon this rock, &amp;c.</hi> If they do thinke that this was particularly spoken vnto <hi>Peter,</hi>
S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and S. <hi>Augustine</hi> shall sufficiently answer them, that Christ did it not
to preferre one man aboue the residue, but that he might set forth the vnity of the
Church, hee saith: if this were spoken onely vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> the Church hath not
the <hi>Keyes,</hi> and if the Church haue them, then <hi>Peter</hi> when he receiued the Keyes did
figurate the whole Church.</p>
               <p>Touching their Arguments, that these words were spoken to none but <hi>Peter,</hi>
this will easily be dissolued, if we know why Christ gaue this name <hi>Peter</hi> to him,
whose name was <hi>Simon,</hi> hauing respect onely to the constant profession which hee
made of Christ, as God changed the name of <hi>Abraham</hi> from <hi>Abram,</hi> which tooke
the name of the multitude, which should come forth of his seede: so <hi>Peter</hi> took his
name of the constant confession of Christ, which indeede is the true Rocks vpon
which the Church is builded, and not <hi>Peter,</hi> no otherwise then <hi>Abraham</hi> was not
the multitude himselfe, whereof he tooke his name: and the Church if it had béene
builded vpon <hi>Peter,</hi> should haue béene builded but vpon a weake foundation, who
was ouercome with the words of a litle wench, so constantly to deny Christ, so any
man may vnderstand how these Romish builders doe wrest the scriptures to their
pleasures. And when they alledge out of the 20. chapter of S. <hi>Iohn, feed my sheep,</hi>
it is a childish Argument, for to feed shéep, is not to beare dominion ouer the whole
Church: and <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts all Byshops, <hi>to feed their flocks;</hi> therefore there was
no authority giuen vnto <hi>Peter</hi> more then to others, or that <hi>Peter</hi> did equally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
the authority which he had receiued vnto others, and did not reserue it to
himselfe, to be transported to the Bishops of Rome.</p>
               <p>2 Touching pardons or indulgences: they say, that the merits of Chirst, and
of the Saints, Apostles and Martyrs, which they impudently affirme to haue me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
more at Gods hands, then was néedfull for themselues, and there did so much
superabound, that might redound vnto the helpe of others: and they affirme, that
their blood was mixed with the blood of Christ, and the treasure of the Church was
compounded of them both, for the remission of sinnes, and that the kéeping of this
treasure is wholy committed to the Pope, and in his power consisteth the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
thereof, and that he himselfe may bestow these treasures, and giue power to
others so to do.</p>
               <p>Hereupon riseth the pleanary indulgences and pardons, granted by the Pope, for
as many yeares as he will by Cardinals for 100. daies, they haue such power, and
bishops but for forty daies, and no body but Satan taught this doctrin, who would
vtterly extinguish the merits of Christ, which he knoweth to be the only remedy of
saluation. Christ in the 17. of <hi>Luke</hi> saith; <hi>When you haue done all that you are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
count your selues but improfitable seruants.</hi> And the 46. of <hi>Esay. All the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of mans righteousnesse is compared to menstruous cloth:</hi> by the Scripture the
corruption of our nature is so manifest, that in our most perfect workes there
lacketh not imperfection. The Parable of the ten Uirgines in the twentie fiue
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:14787:103"/>
of Mathew, putteth this out of all controuersie, where the wise virgins said, <hi>They
had not sufficient oyle for themselues and others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This they ground vpon the Epistle of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Collossians, I fulfill the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
of Christ which were wanting in my flesh, for his body which is the church:</hi>
But <hi>Paul</hi> referreth to those afflictions wherewith the members are and shall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
so long as they liue in this world, euen as Christ was afflicted: and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
S. <hi>Iames</hi> addeth this word, <hi>for the Church:</hi> he doth not meane for the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, but for the edifying of the same, as in the 2. to <hi>Timothy,</hi> he saith; <hi>He suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
for the elect sake,</hi> for by his constancy and stedfastnes in troubles, he sheweth
he contemneth this life, in hope of a better life: whereby he doth confirme and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
the faith of the Church for great fruit, by the afflictions and martirdome of
the faithfull, ariseth to the glory of God, in that they subscribe and beare witnesse
vnto the truth by their blood, and being the Popes pardons are nothing else then
such as he faineth, he is a manifest deceiuer, and a Simonist in selling such mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise
as can in no place help.</p>
               <p>Touching the marriage of Priests, it is against the word of God, &amp; against Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
to forbid Priests to marry in the 13. to the <hi>Hebrewes, The band of marriage is
vndefiled and honorable amongst all men:</hi> And in the 1. <hi>Cor. 7. chap. For auoiding
of whoredome, let euery men haue his owne wife:</hi> and in that they say, this is
meant of others, and not of Ministers: That is disproued by the 1. <hi>Tim. 3. Chapt.
Bishops and Deacons ought to be the husbands of one wife.</hi> And what can be more
spoken against them herein, then in the fourth Chapter of the said Epistle; <hi>In the
latter daies shall come deceiuers, and wicked spirits, which shall forbid to marry;</hi>
they excuse themselues, that this was fulfilled in the hereticks cald <hi>Tatians,</hi> which
did condemne matrimony, but we do onely forbid Church-men to marry, but this,
notwithstanding this prophesie of the holy Ghost, redoundeth vpon them. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
S. <hi>Pauls</hi> saying, that a Bishop shall haue but one Wife: That a Bishop
ought not to bee chosen that hath married the second Wife; but this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
appeareth to be false: in that he presently declareth what manner of women
Bishops wiues ought to be. S. <hi>Paul</hi> reckoneth matrimony amongst the principall
vertues of a Priest, and these men call it in the Canons, the poluting of the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sh:
God instituted matrimony, Christ sanctified it with his presence, and the turning
water into wine, and would haue it the Image of his loue to the Church. They a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge
the Leuiticall Priests, which as often as they came to minister, were bound
to be apart from their wiues, &amp; being our sacraments be more excellent then theirs,
and daily vsed, it would be very vncomely that they should be handled by married
men. The Priests of the old Law were forbidden all outward vncleannesse of the

               <p>3 Touching that he should say that the Scottish nation and their Cleargy be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
blinded, no man will deny that people to be blind that neither heare Christ
nor his Apostles, such is the people of Scotland, in that they cal the Pope supreme
head of the Church, whith belongeth onely to Christ, and contrary to the word, they
forbid Priests to marry in the tenth of <hi>Iohn, Christ is the doore,</hi> they affirme they
must enter by the Uirgine <hi>Mary</hi> and S. <hi>Peter,</hi> Christ would haue vs worship him
in Spirit and truth: The Scots build Temples and Chappels for Idols, in which
they commit Fornication: In the tenth to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Christ, <hi>By one sacrifice,
hath made those perfect for euer which are sanctified:</hi> And to this effect Christ said
on the Crosse, <hi>It is finished,</hi> shewing that by his death all Sacrifices for sinne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
yet the Scottish Church-men daily offer Christ for sins, both of them aliue,
and them that be dead: God commaundeth not to worship any Grauen Images,
the Scots fall flat to them, and offer them: Incense. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, that <hi>Christ is
our wisdome, righteousnes, satisfaction, and redemption:</hi> the Scots prefer the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of men before the law of God, they stablish righteousnes in their own works,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:14787:103"/>
and Sanctification in holy water, and other outward things, and Redemption in
péeces of Lead, which they buy of their great Antichrist.</p>
               <p>Touching the possessions temporall, and iurisdiction in temporalities, in the 18.
Chapter of <hi>Numbers,</hi> God said to <hi>Aaron, Thou shalt haue no portion amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
I am thy portion and heritage, thou and the Leuits shall haue all the tithes of Israell
for their ministry;</hi> but what heritage is pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uided for them I doe not say but they
may possesse, but all temporall iurisdiction should be taken from them: when twice
there rose a contention, which of Christs disciples should be greatest: he told them
they should not haue dominion one ouer another, like the Kings of the Nations, &amp;
Christ in the 12. of <hi>Luke,</hi> answered him that desired him to deuide his Brothers
inheritance vnto him, <hi>Who made me a Iudge.</hi> And in the 8. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> he refused to
giue iudgement vpon the Adulteresse: whereby it appeareth, Christ reiected the
office of a Iudge, as a thing not agréeable to his office. When <hi>Moses</hi> tooke vpon
him the ciuill gouernment and the priest-hood, he was commaunded to resigne the
Priest-hood to <hi>Aaron,</hi> for it was against nature one man should suffice both char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and as long as the face of the true Church did continue, no Priest did vsurpe
the right of the sword. S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, Emperors rather desired the Office of
Priest-hood, then Priests any Empire, then sumptuous Palaces belonged to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,
and Churches to Priests. And S. <hi>Barnard</hi> saith, <hi>Peter</hi> could not giue that
which he had not, but he gaue to his successors that which he had, carefulnesse ouer
the Congregation, for this cause the kingdom of heauen is giuen vnto you, why do
you inuade other mens bounds?</p>
               <p>They were ignorant of all iudgement that did fat with their possessions these
belly-beasts, all they which do indow such filthy sinkes with their reuenues, they
follow the steps of <hi>Iezabell,</hi> for what do they daily but bleat and bow before their
Images, burning Incense, aud falling flat before the altars, as the Prophets of
<hi>Baall</hi> did, and if <hi>Daniell</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were Hereticks, when they would destroy the
Priests of <hi>Baall,</hi> so am I: We do but desire, that their riches wickedly bestowed
vpon them, might be taken from them, but <hi>Elias</hi> was more rigorous, for he cast the
Prophets of <hi>Baall</hi> into the brooke Kidron.</p>
               <p>The Pope cannot make lawes according to his owne mind and will, and say
they are spirituall, and pertaine to the soule, and are necessary to eternall life: for
the word of God giueth them no such authority, in the 23. of <hi>Iosua, Thou shalt not
swarue from my law to the right hand, nor to the left:</hi> And in the 12. of <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
Thou shalt neither adde to, nor take from my Commaundements:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the second of <hi>Malachy; The Priest shall maintaine wisdome, and the law shal
they require at his hands.</hi> And where he speaketh of hearing them, he putteth this
condition, that they answere according to the Law of the Lord, then these are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant-breakers,
that binde the consciences of men with new lawes: And in the
33. of <hi>Ezekiell, Thou shalt heare the word out of my mouth, and declare it vnto
my people,</hi> So he could not speake any thing of himselfe, and God by <hi>Ieremie,
calleth it Chaffe,</hi> whatsoeuer doth not procéede from himselfe: The Prophets
speake nothing but the words of God, therefore they so often vsed these wordes;
<hi>The word of the Lord, the burden of the Lord, the vision of the Lord, thus saith
the Lord:</hi> The Apostles must not teach their owne deuises, but that which God
commaunded them. <hi>Paul</hi> in the second to the <hi>Collosians,</hi> denieth he hath any domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
ouer their Faith, though their Apostle. And in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nth to the <hi>Romains, Faith
commeth by hearing the word of God,</hi> and not by hearing the dreames of the
Pope: &amp; Christ himselfe saith for our example, <hi>My doctrin is not mine, but his that
sent me;</hi> to teach Ministers what to do: The power of the Church is not such, that
it may teach new Doctrines, frame new Articles of Faith, and new lawes, but
is subiect to the word of the Lord included in the same.</p>
               <p>They defended their Constitutions by these reasons, if it were lawfull to the
Apostles to make a decree besides the commaundement of Christ, that the people
should abstain fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> things offered to Idols &amp; blood, it is lawful for their successors as
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:14787:104"/>
oft as néede requireth to do the same: but the Apostles made no new decree, but to
warne them how to rule themselues amongst their Brethren, least they should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
their liberty to the offence of others: and contrary, <hi>Peter</hi> in the same councel
pronounceth God to be tempted, if any yoake be laid vpon the necke of the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
and S. <hi>Iames</hi> saith, the Gentiles that are conuerted vnto God, are not to be
troubled with externe decrées, and outward Elements.</p>
               <p>And by the 23. of <hi>Mathew, The Scribes and Pharises sit in Moses Chaire, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
they command to obserue, keep; but do not after their doings.</hi> Christ taught
his Disciples, that he saw nothing in the doing of the Scribes and Pharises to be
followed, yet they should not refuse to do those things which they did teach by the
word, but not what they taught of their owne head.</p>
               <p>Being accused for hauing the New Testament, and other Books of heresie, he
called them blasphemers and Romish Swine, and their stomacks rankered, and
tongues most venomous, which durst note the New Testament of heresie, as they
were the greatest murderers that murdered Christ, so these men filled the measure
of all other Heretickes and blasphemies: how shall these Serpents and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               <p>And being accused that he was so obstinate, that none of his friends could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him: he said he knew not why he should call them friends, which so great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laboured to conuert him, nor will more estéeme of them then of the Madianits,
which called the Children of Israell to do sacrifices to their Idols.</p>
               <p>Then they condemned him for an Hereticke, and his goods to be forfeited, and

The which to bring to passe the onely methode is to discusse all things according

               <p>Then <hi>Bonner</hi> Bishop of London, the most earnest Champion for the Pope,

First they set vpon the Uillage about Merindoll, and destroyed and burned

               <p>THis <hi>Adam Damlip</hi> had bin a great Papist, and Chaplaine to the Bishop of
Rochester: he iournyed to Rome, thinking to haue found all godly and sincere

Christs true religion, loosenesse of life, and abomination and filthinesse, that he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
to tarrie there any longer, although he was greatly requested by Cardinall
<hi>Poole,</hi> to continue there to reade three Lectures euery weeke in his house, offering
him great entertainment, which he refused; and returning home, the Cardinall
gaue him a French crowne. And wayting at Callice for passage into England,
<hi>William Steuens</hi> and <hi>Thomas Lancaster</hi> desired him to reade there two or three
dayes, and got him license of the Lord <hi>Lisle</hi> the Kings Deputie of the towne, and
the license of <hi>Iohn Butler</hi> the Commissary.</p>
               <p>When he had preached three or foure times he was wel liked, so that they hyred
him to preach there; and twenty dayes or more, euery morning at seuen of the
clocke, he preached learnedly and plainely the truth of the blessed Sacrament of
Christs body and bloud, mightily inueighing against all Papistrie, but especially
against transubstantiation &amp; the propitiatorie sacrifice of the masse, declaring how
popish himselfe was, and how by the detestable wickednesse that he did see vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
in Rome, he was returned and become an enemie to all Papistre. He came at
last to speake against the Pageant or picture set forth of the resurrection, in Saint
<hi>Nicholas</hi> his Church, that it was meere Idolatrie and illusion of the French-men
before Callice was English.</p>
               <p>Then there came a commission to the Lord Deputy, the Commissary, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:14787:108"/>
if they found it not so, that immediatly it should be pulled downe, and so it was;
for they breaking vp a stone in the corner of the Tombe, in stead of three Hosts
found souldred in the Crosse of Marble lying vnder the Sepulchre, three plaine
Counters, which they had pointed like vnto Hosts: and aboue that was the tippe
of a Sheeps tayle, which <hi>Damlip</hi> shewed to the people the next day, which was
Sonday, out of the Pulpit. And after they were sent by the Lord Deputie to the
King. Then the Prior of the white Friers, and one of the Lord <hi>Lisle</hi> his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains,
contradicted his Sermons, and caused him to be sent for to <hi>Cranmer</hi> and
<hi>Steuen Gardiner,</hi> and others, before whome hee did so constantly defend the
doctrine which he had taught, that <hi>Cranmer</hi> being yet but a Lutheran, maruelled
excéedingly at it, and said, that the Scripture knew no such terme of transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.
Then the other Bishops threatned him, to whom he promised, the next
day to deliuer them all in writing which he had formerly preached in Callice. In
the meane time he had secret intimation giuen him by <hi>Cranmer,</hi> that if hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
the next day, he should be sure to be committed: whereupon he sent them
his Faith with the arguments thereupon in writing, and he went aside into the
West countrey.</p>
               <p>Then the King was certified that there were many diuersities of opinions
in Calice, tending to the danger thereof: Whereupon Doctor <hi>Champion</hi> and M.

all out without money. Whereupon the Commissary made him beare a Billet,
and procured his wages, which was sixe pence a day, to be taken from him: then
he went vnto the King, and declared the whole matter, who after gaue him eight
pence a day.</p>
               <p>In Nouember,<note place="margin">1545.</note> after the King had subdued the Scots, and ioyning with the
Emperour, had inuaded France, and had got the Towne of Bullen, he summoned
a Parliament, in which was granted him, besides subsidies of money, all Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Chanteries, Free Chappels, Hospitals, Fraternities, Guilds and perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of stipendary Priests to be disposed at his will and pleasure.</p>
               <p>They being thus giuen to him by act of Parliament in December, the next
Lent Doctor <hi>Crome</hi> preached in the Mercers Chappell: amongst other reasons to
induce the people from the vaine reasons of Purgatorie, he said, It Trentalls and
Masses could auaile the soules in Purgatorie, then did not the Parliament well in
giuing away Monasteries, Colledges, and Chanteries, which serued principally
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:14787:109"/>
to that purpose: but if the Parliament did well, as no man could denie, then it is
plaine that such Chanteries and priuate masses confer nothing to relieue them in
Purgatorie. This <hi>Dilemma</hi> was insoluble, but at Easter next they brought him in
question for it, and so handled him, that they made him to recant, or else they would
haue dissolued him and his argument in the fire.</p>

               <p>There was the like commotion in Oxford, and Buckingham, but that was soon
appeased by the Lord Gray, of whom two hundred were taken, and twelue of them
ringleaders deliuered to him; where of certaine were executed.</p>
               <p>In Norfolk &amp; the parts thereabouts the Marquesse of Northampton, was sent

them from victuals, whereby they might the sooner be brought to acknowledge
their fault, and séeke pardon, who pined himselfe within the Citie of Norwich,
but the Rebels pressed vpon the Citie, and at length obtained it, yet there
was but a hundred on both sides slaine, and the Lord Shefield, then the Earle of
Warwick was sent against them, by whom the confused rabble was ouerthrown,
to the number of foure thousand, and both the <hi>Kets,</hi> chiefe stirrers of that Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>And when they had called forth Maister <hi>Latimer,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Hooper,</hi> Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,

asked him whether hee would credit the people there present, and because many

I haue not séene him before, howbeit I haue heard much of his naughtie prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching;

I said the same substance that was hanged vpon the Crosse, hee like an Asse,
(as he is an Asse indéede) turned the word That, into As, saying; That I said,
as it hanged vpon the Crosse: Then the Arch-Bishoppe demaunded of him,
whether Christ were in the Sacrament, Face, Nose, Mouth, Eyes, Armes,
and Lips, with other lineaments of the bodie; whereat <hi>Bonner</hi> shooke his head,

               <p>The first trouble of the Lord Protector,<note place="margin">1549</note> was presentlie after the depriuation

hearing of the apprehension of the Lord Protector, they began to brute abroad,
that now they should haue their Latine Seruice, the holy Bread and holy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

was sent to the Bishops of the Dioces, to warne the Parsons, Uicars, Curats,
and Church-wardens of euerie Parish, to deliuer vp all Antiphoners, Missalls,
Grayles, Processionals, Manualls, Legends, Pyes, Portuasies, Iournals,

such persons as should be found disobedient in this matter, to be committed to

               <p>And because many refused to pay towardes the finding of Bread and Wine

onely of the Bishop of Winchester, who by conference with others, by open

might haue bred much trouble: Wherefore he was sent for before the Councell,
before whom he denied to receiue the said Articles, and so misused himselfe before
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he was sent to the Fléete: but vpon promise of conformity, hee was
set at liberty againe, then he set forth such matters as bred more contention in
that Shire, then in all the Realme againe, and he caused all his Seruants to bée
secretly armed and harnised, to withstand such as he thought to haue béene sent
by the Councell into those parts, and when Preachers were sent into that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
by the Councell to preach the Word of GOD, the Bishop to disappoint

Wherevpon rose great tumult, and one wounded him with a Dagger in the
soulder: The King commanded to saue him, whereby they abstained from mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
him.</p>
               <p>When he was brought before the King: he demanded what country man he
was, and how hee durst worke such a contumacie against his Maiestie, and the
Sacraments of the Church: Hee answered hee was an English man, by birth
and Religion, and am come hither for traffick of Marchandize, and when I saw
in this famous assembly so great Idolatry committed, my conscience neither ought
nor could any longer suffer, but must needs doe that you haue séene me doe, which
was not done for any contumacy of your Maiestie, but of purpose, as before
God I do confesse to séek the saluation of this people: then vnderstanding that king
<hi>Edward</hi> had restored Religion in England, and thinking he had beene set on by
some others: they would know who set him on; He answered he was not mooued
thereto by any man, but by his owne conscience, but that hee owed this seruice
first vnto God, and secondly vnto their saluation, and they ought to impute the
act onely to themselues, which so vnreuerently vsed the holy Supper of the Lord
vnto so great Idolatry, to the perill of their owne soules, except they repented.
He was like to faint with the aboundance of blood that ranne out of his wound,
and Surgeons were sent to cure it, then all English-men were committed
vnto Prison, and one <hi>Pendigrace,</hi> because that he was his Bed-fellow, was

               <p>Then they caused a Linnen Cloath to bee sowed round like a Ball, which
they violently put downe his throat to the bottome of his belly, tyed with a
small string which they held in their handes; and when it was downe they pulled
it vp againe with violence, so plucking it too and fro through the meat pipe. When
all torments and tormentors were wearied, they asked him if he did not repent
his wicked deed, he answered, if it were to doe againe he thought he should doe it,
but he was sorie it was in the presence of the King: the fault ought to be ascribed
to the King and not to him, in that he hauing power would not prohibit so great I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie
vsed amongst his people.</p>
               <p>Three dayes after they brought him to execution: when they had vsed all kind
of torments against him, then they cut off his right hand, which he tooke vp with
his left and kissed it; then they cut off his other hand, which he, kneeling downe,
kissed, and so he was carried to the place of execution, where was an Engine, from
the which a great rope comming downe by a pullie, was fastened about this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
which first pulled him vp: then there was a great pile of wood set on fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
him into the which he was by little and little let downe, not with the whole
body, but so that his feet only felt the fire: then he was hoysed vp and so let downe
againe; in the which torment he continued with a constant spirit, and the more
terribly he burned the more vehemently he prayed.</p>
               <p>When his feet were burned the tormentors asked him whether he did not yet
repent, and exhorted him to call vpon our Ladie and other Saints; he answered he
had done nothing whereof he did repent, and needed not our Ladies nor Saints
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:14787:121"/>
help, and what torments soeuer they vsed: hee remained alwaies one, desiring
them to leaue off such vanities and follies, for when Christ ceased to bee our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate,
then he would pray our Lady to be his Aduocate: and when they sought
to stop his prayers, he said Iudge mee O Lord, and reuenge my cause against
the vnmercifull people, before he had ended the Psalme, pulling him vp &amp; downe
in the fire for the more torment, the rope was burned, hee fell into the middest of
the fire, where he changed his Temporall paines, for eternall quietnes: Thus
GOD by this message did prouoke the Portugales to the sincere know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>But this cruelty was not vnreuenged, for with a sparke from the fire of
his burning, one of the Kings Shippes was burned, and the Kings Sonne that
was married died halfe a yeere after, and the next yeare the King himselfe
dyed.</p>
               <p>The Clergy appointed a solemne Fast certaine daies for penance to purge
that fact: there be some yet as I haue heard diuers report, out of whose remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
this constant Martyr can neuer be pulled, and is so fresh yet amongst them
as if it were but lately done, his death as fruitfull seede hath taken such fruit in
some that it is yet a linely, and diligent preaching vnto some against superstition
and Idolatry vsed in their Churches.</p>

               <p>Notwithstanding this Letter, the Lords persisted still in their purpose, and took
aduice to kéep themselues in the Citie of London, as strong as they might, and
willed the Mayor and Aldermen to prouide a substantiall watch by night, and by
day, for the safegard of the Citie and gates.</p>
               <p>Then they demanded fiue hundred men to ayde them to fetch the Lord Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
out of Windsor from the King: and they published a Proclamation against the
said Protector to this effect.</p>
               <p>First that the Protector by his euill gouernment was the cause of all the sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that of late happened within the Realme: and of the losses of the Kings ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
in France: and that it appeared by the building of his sumptuous houses in
the time of the Kings warre, that he sought his owne glory: that he esteemed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
the graue counsell, of the Councellors, that he had sowed diuisions betwéen
the Nobles, Gentlemen, and Commons.</p>
               <p>That the Nobles assembled themselues only to cause the protector to haue liued
within limits, &amp; to haue put such order for the surety of the King as was fit.</p>
               <p>That the protector slandered the Councell vnto the King: and that hee was a
great traytor, and therefore the Lords defired the Citie &amp; Commons to ayde them
to take him from the King.</p>
               <p>Then the King sent a Letter vnto the Mayor and Citizens, commanding them
to ayde him with a thousand men out of their Citie, well armed, and to send them
with all speed vnto the Castle of Windsor.</p>
               <p>These contrary commandements comming both at one instant vnto the Mayor
&amp; Citizens of London: it séemed very doubtfull to them which way to take: at the
last stepped vp a Citizen <hi>George Studlaw,</hi> and said. I remember in the time of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the third; the Barons as the Lords doe now, demanded ayde of the Mayor and
Citizens of London, and the Citie ayded them against the King, and it came to an
open battell, and the Lords preuailed against the King, and took the King and his
son prisoners, and vpon certaine conditions, the King &amp; his Son were restored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and the King openly granted his pardon to the Lords and Citizens, &amp; it was
ratified by Act of Parliament, but it was neuer forgotten during the Kings life:
the Liberties of the Citie were taken away, and strangers appointed to be our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors,
and the Citizens giuen away body and goods, and from one persecution
vnto another were most miserably afflicted, such it is to enter into the wrath of a
Prince: for <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>the wrath of a Prince is death:</hi> Therefore I would
councell the Lords with vs, to make sute to the King, that he would please to heare
the complaints that may be iustly proued against the L. Protector, and I doubt not
but this matter will be pacified, and that the King, nor yet the Lords haue cause
to seeke for further ayde, neither we to offend any of them both.</p>
               <p>Then the Lords sent Sir <hi>Philip Hobby,</hi> with their Letter of credence vnto the
King, beséeching him to giue credit to that which he should say: who so handled the
matter, that the Lord Protector was commanded from the Kings presence: and
shortly committed to warde in the Castle of Windsor: The same day the Lords of
the Councell resorted vnto the King, and the next day they brought the Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
vnto the Tower.</p>
               <p>Shortly after the Lords resorted vnto the Tower, and there charged the Lord
Protector with sundry Articles; the effect of them is contained in the proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
aforesaid: and although these purposes of man intended the spilling of his life;
and the Lord so ordered the matter by the meanes of the Kings so laboring for his
vnkle, that in short while he was let out of the Tower, and continued at liberty
two yeares and two daies.</p>
               <p>After he was againe apprehended &amp; committed againe to the Tower, after hee
was brought to Westminister Hall to be arraigned, and there was charged with
felony &amp; treason: he put himselfe to be tried by his Péeres, who discharged him of
treason, but they accounted him guilty of Felony, for purposing the death of the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:14787:122"/>
Duke of Northumberland and others, and was returned vnto the Tower againe.</p>
               <p>When he was brought to his execution vpon tower Hill, he came with the same
gesture which he vsed, changing neither voice nor countenance, and knéeling down
he commended himselfe to God, and his prayers ended, he turned toward the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as it were with a certaine fatherly loue to children, and said:</p>
               <p>Dearely beloued friends, I am brought hether to suffer death, albeit I neuer
offended against the King in word nor deed: and haue alwaies béene as faithfull
as any man vnto this Realme: but because I am by Law condemned to die, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
my obedience which I owe vnto the Lawes, I am come hither to suffer
death: Wherefore I thanke God that he hath giuen me this time of repentance,
who might so suddenly haue béen taken with death that I could not haue acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
God, nor my selfe.</p>
               <p>I would something put you in minde of the Christian Religion, which so long as
I was in authoritie I did alwaies diligently set forth, and I reioice therein, sith
now the state of Christian Religion commeth most neere to the order of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue
Church, which I esteeme as a great benefit of God to me, and vnto you:
most heartily exhorting you all, that you will most thankefully imbrace it, &amp; set out
the same in your liuing, which if you do not, no doubt great calamitie will follow.</p>
               <p>Upon these words there was heard a terrible noise, as it had beene of some
great tempest from aboue, as if a great deale of Gun-powder, being inclosed in an
armory, hauing caught fire, had violently broke out: or as if a great company of
horsemen had been running together vpon them, whereby the people were so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed,
that they ranne away; s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>me into Ditches and Puddles, and some into the
houses; others with their Halberts fell vnto the ground: Crying out, Iesus saue
vs, Iesus saue vs: and those which tarried in their places knew not where they
were: It happened heere euen as when the officers of the High Priests came to
take Christ: They runne back and fell to the ground, in so great slaughter of
Dukes within this few yeares, there were neuer so many weeping eyes at one
time, and the people seeing Sir <hi>Anthony Browne</hi> ride to the Scaffold: they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectured
that the King had sent his Unkle pardon, therefore with great reioycing
they cast vp their caps, and cryed out pardon, pardon, is come, God saue the king.
Thus the good Duke, although he was destitute of mans help, yet hee saw before
his departure in what great loue and fauour he was with all men.</p>
               <p>Then said the Duke, dearely beloued friends, there is no such matter as you
vainely beleeue: Therefore I pray you be contented with my death which I most
willingly suffer; let vs ioine in prayer for the King, vnto whom I haue alwaies
shewed my selfe a faithfull Subiect, and haue béen most diligent to seeke the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
of the whole Realme; at which words all the people cryed out and said, it
was most true: And praying for the King and Councell, and exhorting the people
to obedience, forgiuing all his enemies, and desiring forgiuenes of them which he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had offended, and praying them to beare witnes, he died in the faith of Christ.</p>
               <p>Then he knéeled downe and prayed, and rising againe without any trouble of
minde, he tooke them all on the Scaffold by the hand, and bid them all farewell:
when he lay vpon the block he called thrice on the name of Iesus, saying, Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
saue me: And as the name of Iesu was repeating the third time, in a moment,
he was bereft both of head and life.</p>

purposed to haue procéeded further with her, as it is reported, had not the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of <hi>Thomas Cranmer</hi> the Archbishop reconciled the King againe to fauour

               <p>And about the eighth of September 1552. Doctor <hi>Ridley</hi> Bishop of London,
went to visit the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> and was gently entertained of Sir <hi>Thomas Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
and other her officers. About eleuen of the clocke the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> came forth of
her chamber of presence: then the Bishop saluted her Grace, and said he was come
to doe his dutie vnto her Grace; she thanked him, and for a quarter of an houre
talked with him pleasantly, and said, she knew him when he was Chaplain to her
father, and remembred a Sermon that he made before her father, at the Lady <hi>Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>

               <p>After dinner the Bishop being called, resorted againe vnto her Grace: then said
the Bishop, Madam, I come not only to doe my duety to sée your Grace, but also to
offer my selfe to preach before you on Sonday next, if it please you to heare me:
she said, I pray make the answere your selfe, for you know the answere well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:
but if I must make answere, this shall be your answere, The doore of the
Church shall be open for you if you come, but neither I nor none of mine shall
heare you. The Bishop said, Madam, I trust you will not refuse GODS word.
She answered, I cannot tell what you call GODS word; that is not GODS
word now that was GODS word in my fathers dayes. The Bishop said,
GODS word is one in all times, but it hath beene better vnderstood and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
in some ages then in others. She said, you durst not for your eares haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouched
that for GODS word in my fathers dayes that now you doe: as for
your new books, I thanke GOD for it, I neuer read none of them, nor neuer

               <p>After many bitter words against the forme of Religion then established, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the gouernment of the Realme, and the lawes made in the young yeares of
her brother, which she said she was not bound to obey vntill her brother came to
perfect age, and then affirmed she would obey them. Then she asked him whether
he were one of the Priuie Councell; he answered no: you might well enough,
quoth she, as the Councell goeth now-a-dayes: so she concluded, that she thanked
him for his gentlenesse to come and see her, but for your offering to preach before
me, I thank you neuer a whit.</p>
               <p>Then was the Bishop brought by Sir <hi>Thomas Wharton</hi> vnto the place where
he dined, who desired him to drinke: after he had drunke he looked very sadly, and
brake out in these words, Surely I haue done amisse, in that I haue drunke in that

she was about the age of King <hi>Edward;</hi> in learning and wit she might be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the Uniuersitie men which haue taken many degrees of the schooles.</p>
            <p>Then Queen <hi>Mary</hi> wrote to the Councel that they should proclaime her Quéen,
and she would pardon them for that which was done: they answered her, that by
the Diuorse betwixt King <hi>Henry</hi> and her mother, she was made illegitimate and
vnheritable to the Crowne.</p>
            <p>Then she speeded her selfe farre from the Citie, hoping vpon the Commons,
whereupon the Councell sent forth the Duke of Northumberland, with other
Lords and Gentlemen with an Armie, the Guard assisting the Duke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mary</hi> withdrew her selfe into Northfolke and Suffolke, where she knew the
Duke was hated; and there gathering such aide of the Commons as she might,
kept her selfe in Fremingham Castle, to whom Suffolk-men resorted, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
her their aide if she would not alter the religion which her brother had establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
to which she agreed, with such promises as no man could haue misdoubted
her: and thus being guarded with the power of the Gospellers, she vanquished the
Duke and all that came against her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:14787:123"/>
But after, the Suffolk-men making supplication vnto her Grace for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of her promise, she answerd, You shall one day well perceiue that members
must obey their head, and not looke to rule the same: and one <hi>Dobbe</hi> a Gentleman
for aduertising her of her promise by humble request, was three times set in the
pillorie, to be a gasing-stock to all men; others deliuered her books and supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
out of the Scripture, to exhort her to continue the doctrine then established,
who were sent to prison.</p>
            <p>The Councell at London, vnderstanding that the Ladie <hi>Marie</hi> increased in pui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance,
and the peoples hearts mightily bent vnto her, they turned their song, and
proclaymed for Quéen, the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> eldest daughter of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, and
appointed by Parliament to succeed King <hi>Edward,</hi> dying without issue: the Duke
of Northumberland with some of his sonnes, were left destitute at Cambridge,
as also the Earle of Huntingdon, who were arrested and brought to the Tower as
Traytors.</p>
            <p>Then the Quéen came to the Tower, where the Lady <hi>Iane</hi> and the Lord <hi>Gilford</hi>
her husband were imprisoned fiue months, but the Duke within a moneth was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,
with Sir <hi>Iohn Gates</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Palmer:</hi> the Papists promised the
Duke pardon if he would openly recant vpon the Scaffold, which in hope of pardon
he did, and yet he was beheaded; whose recantation the papists published not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
reioycing at his conuersion: but Sir <hi>Thomas Palmer</hi> confessed his faith in the
Gospell, and was sorie that he had not liued more Gospell-like.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Steuen Gardner</hi> was released out of the Tower, and made Bishop of Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
and Lord Chancellor, and <hi>Poynets</hi> displaced; and <hi>Bonner</hi> restored to his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick
againe, and <hi>Ridley</hi> displaced; and <hi>Day</hi> made Bishop of Chichester, and
<hi>Storie</hi> put out; and <hi>Heath</hi> made Bishop of Worcester, and <hi>Hooper</hi> committed to
the Fleet; and <hi>Vesie</hi> to Exeter, and <hi>Couerdale</hi> put out.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Ridley</hi> Bishop of London had preached against Quéen <hi>Mary</hi> in Queene
<hi>Ianes</hi> time: shortly after the Sermon Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was proclaymed; then he went
to the Queen to salute her, who dispoyled him of his Dignities, and sent him to
the Tower vpon a halting horse.</p>
            <p>Then Queen <hi>Mary</hi> directed forth an inhibition by proclamation, that no man
should preach or reade openly in Churches the word of God.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Bourne,</hi> who after was Bishop of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the praise of <hi>Bonner</hi> being there present, and in dispraise of King <hi>Edward,</hi> that
his words sounded euill to the hearers, which caused them to murmur and stirre,
insomuch that the Maror and others feared an vprore: one hurled a dagger at the
Preacher, who for feare pulled in his head. Master <hi>Bradford</hi> stood forth and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased
the people, and after he and <hi>Rogers</hi> conducted the Preacher safe into the
Grammer-schoole, but shortly after they were both rewarded with burning.</p>
            <p>The next Sonday the preacher at the Crosse was guarded with the Queenes
Guard; then men withdrew themselues from the Sermon, and the Mayor took
order that the ancients of al Companies should be present, lest the Preacher should
be discouraged with his small auditorie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cranmer</hi> Archbishop of Canterburie, assisted with <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> and a few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
offered to defend the doctrine of the booke of Common Prayer by the

            <p>The first day of October the Queen was crowned, and the tenth day a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
began, where <hi>Taylor</hi> Bishop of Lincolne, &amp; <hi>Harley</hi> Bishop of Herford after

Sir <hi>Iames Hales</hi> Iustice of the Common pleas, notwithstanding he had ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his life for Quéen <hi>Mary</hi> in not subscribing to King <hi>Edwards</hi> Will, as before;
for giuing charge vpon the Statuts against Papistrie, at the Assises, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to diuers prisons, and so terrified, that he wounded himselfe, and meant to
haue killed himselfe with a knife, and after was contented to say as they willed
him; whereupon he was discharged, but he neuer rested vntill he had drowned
himselfe.</p>
            <p>Then, according to the Quéens commandement, there begun a disputation in
the Conuocation house about the Sacrament, which continued six dayes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

which was very euill taken of the people,<note place="margin">1554.</note> and of many of the Nobilitie, who
for this and for religion, conspiring amongst themselues, made a rebellion, wherof
Sir <hi>Thomas Wyat</hi> was chiefe. News comming to London of this stirre in Kent,
the Quéen caused <hi>Wyat</hi> and the Duke of Suffolke, who was fled to Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire
and Leister-shire, there to gather a power, and the two <hi>Carewes</hi> of Deuon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,
to be proclaymed Traytors; and <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of Northfolke was sent
into Kent against <hi>Wyat,</hi> but about Rochester Bridge the Duke was forsaken of
all his men, and returned to London.</p>
            <p>The Earle of Huntington was sent post to apprehend the Duke of Suffolke,
who entring the Citie of Couentrie before the Duke disappointed him, and one
<hi>Vnderwood</hi> his man betrayed and bewrayed him, so that he was brought to the
Tower of London.</p>
            <p>In time Sir <hi>Peter Carew</hi> hearing what was done, fled into France, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were taken: and the Quéen hearing of <hi>Wyats</hi> comming towards London, she
came into the Citie to Guild-hall, where she made a vehement Oration against
<hi>Wyat,</hi> and to incourage them to stand with her.</p>
            <p>Two dayes after the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> was committed vnto the Tower; and
<hi>Wyat</hi> comming to Southwark, being he could not enter that way into London,
he went with his Armie by Kingstone, and came through the stréets to Ludgate, but
returning he was resisted at Temple-barre, and there yeelded himselfe to Sir <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Church in Oxford before the Altar, <hi>Cranmer</hi> Archb. was brought to them with a
number of Bill-men. When he had read ouer the Articles, he said they were all
false and against Gods holy word. Then was Doctor <hi>Ridley</hi> brought in, who
hearing the Articles read, answered they were all false, and that they sprang out
of a bitter root. Then came in <hi>Latimer:</hi> when he had denied the Articles, he said

               <p>NEuer did I see a thing done more vainly and contumeliously then the dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
with me in the Schooles in Oxford: I thought it had not been possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to haue béen found amongst men of learning and knowledge, any so brazen fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and shamelesse, so disorderly and vainely to behaue themselues, more like to
Stage-players then Diuines. The Sorbonicall clamours, which in times past I
haue séene in Paris, when Poperie most raigned, might be thought modestie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of them, yea, and the chiefest did as it were blow the Trumpe vnto the rest,
to rayle, rore, rage and crie out, whereby it appeareth they neuer sought for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
but for their owne glorie and bragging victorie. Much time appointed for
Disputations, was vainly consumed in opprobrious checks, taunts, hissings, and
clapping of hands. Whensoeuer I would make an end of my probations, they
would euer crie out Blasphemies, blasphemies. I neuer heard or read the like,
but by <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Siluer-smith, and them of his occupation, crying but against
<hi>Paule, Great is Diana of the Ephesians:</hi> and except it be a disputation of the Arrians
against the Orthodoxes, where it is said that such as the Presidents of the dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
were, such were the rest, all were in a hurly-burly; and the Arrians cast
out such great slanders, that nothing could quietly be heard; and he concludes, thus
ended this glorious disputation of the Sacrificers, Doctors, and Masters, which
fought manfully for their God and goods, their faith and felicitie, countrey and
Kitchin, and for their beautie and bellie, with triumphant applauses and fauour of
the whole Uniuersitie.</p>
               <p>After seuerall disputations with euery one of them, the Commissioners sate in

whether they would subscribe or no: Hee told the Bishop of Canterbury, hee
was ouercome in Arguments, which he said was false, for hee was not suffered
to oppose as he would, nor answere as he would, vnlesse hee would haue brau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with them, all denying to subscribe: then sentence was read ouer them,
that they were no members of the Church, and therefore condemned for he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</p>
               <p>Then the Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> answered, from this your sentence I appeale to
the iust iudgement of God, trusting to be present with him in heauen, for whose
presence in the Altar I am thus condemned.</p>
               <p>Bishop <hi>Ridley</hi> answered, though I be not of your company, yet my name is
written in another place, whither this sentence will send mee sooner then wee
should by nature haue come.</p>
               <p>Bishop <hi>Latimer.</hi> I thanke God most heartily that hee hath prolonged my
life to this end, that I may in this case glorifie GOD by that kinde of
death.</p>
               <p>After they were all three called to behold a solemne procession, wherein
Doctor <hi>Weston</hi> carried the Sacrament, and foure Doctors carried the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
ouer him.</p>
               <p>In the last yeere one thousand fiue hundred forty and three, it is shewed how
the Duke of Northumberland was apprehended by the Guard, and brought to
London by the Earle of <hi>Arundell</hi> and others, these were committed to the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
with the Duke, the Earle of <hi>VVarwick,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Huntington,</hi> Lord <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi>

Sir <hi>Iohn Gates,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Gates,</hi> Sir <hi>Andrew Dudley,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Palmer,</hi> and
Doctor <hi>Sands</hi> Chancelor of Cambridge, many were committed to diuers prisons
about the same time.</p>
               <p>About this time Maister <hi>Bradford,</hi> Maister <hi>Beacon,</hi> and Maister <hi>Veron</hi> were
committed vnto the Tower, and Maister <hi>Sampson</hi> was sought for, and because he
could not be found the Bishop of Winchester fumed.</p>
               <p>About this time Doctor <hi>Weston</hi> preached at Paules Crosse, he willed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to pray for the soules departed, that be neither in heauen nor hell, but in a place
not yet sufficiently purged to come to heauen, that they may be releeued by your
deuout prayers: he named the Lords Table an Oyster boord: hee said the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme
lately set forth was abominable heresie, and likeneth the setters forth of
the same to <hi>Iulianus Apostata,</hi> and the booke to the booke of <hi>Iulianus Apostata,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Christ and Pilate were the speakers, which Sermon was learnedly confuted in

               </p>
               <p>About this time a Priest of Canterbury said Masse on the one day, and the next
day he came into the Pulpit, and desired all the people to forgiue him, for he said
hee had betrayed Christ, but not as <hi>Iudas,</hi> as <hi>Peter,</hi> and made a long Sermon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Masse.</p>
               <p>In February one thousand fiue hundred fifty and foure, before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

there was séene two Sunnes both shining at once: and that time was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
seene a Raine-bow turned contrary, and a great deale higher then it was
wont.</p>
               <p>About this time at Saint <hi>Pancrase</hi> in Cheape, the Crucifixe with the Pixe
were taken out of the Sepulchre before the Priest rose to the resurrection: so that
when he put his hand into the Sepulchre, &amp; said very deuoutly <hi>surrexit non est hic,</hi>
he found his words true, for he was not there indéede, wherevpon being dismaide,
and debating amongst themselues whom they thought likest to doe it: they
layed it to one <hi>Marsh,</hi> which a little before had beene put from that parsonage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was married, but when they could not proue it, being brought before the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:14787:128"/>
Mayor, they burdened him to haue kept company with his wife since they were

               <p>About this time there was a Cat hanged vpon a Gallow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

two fore-feete were tyed ouer her head, with a round paper like a Wafer Cake
put betweene them, where on rose great euill will against the Citie of London: the
Quéene and the Bishops were very angry, and there was a proclamation in the

had preached before the Queene for the straite execution of <hi>Wyats</hi> Souldiours:
Wherevpon there was twenty Gibbets and Gallowes set vp, in and about the

in the Tower, the Quéene sent vnto him Doctor <hi>Bourne,</hi> to conuert him: he
answered <hi>Bourne</hi> that he beleeued in the holy Catholick church of Christ, grounded
vpon the Prophets and Apostles, but he tooke exception to the Antichristian popish
Church: and hee said, hee thought the Masse not fit, both for the occasion of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and also the cléere <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Collects therein are blasphemous. Then said the Doctor, see how vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory
toucheth you; then I found fault it was not a Communion: Yes said he one
Priest saying Masse heere, and another there, and the third in an other place is
a Communion: Then he desired God to receiue him to his mercy, that he might
die vndefiled in his truth, at vtter defiance with all papisticall and Antichristian
Doctrine: and to defend all his chosen, from the tyrany of the Pope and Antichrist
and from his subtilties: at his first casting off the Gallowes the rope broke, then
they would haue had him re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then he should haue the Queenes Pardon: but Master <hi>Mantell,</hi> like a worthy gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
refused their serpentine Councell, and chose rather to die then to liue for
dishonouring of God.</p>
               <p>Maister <hi>Bradford,</hi> Maister <hi>Sanders,</hi> and diuers other good preachers hearing
that they should be brought vnto a Disputation at Cambridge, sent a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
out of prison, to the effect as followeth; That they did not purpose to dispute
otherwise then by writing, except it be before the Queenes Highnes &amp; her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
and before the Parliament houses, because we shall dispute against the things
which already they haue determined, whereby it appeareth they seeke not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but our destruction, and their glory; otherwise they would haue called vs to
shew our consciences before their lawes were so made: and againe the Censors
and Iudges are manifest enemies of the truth, before whom Pearles are not to be
cast by the commandement of Christ, and by his example: and because some of vs
haue been in prison eight or nine monethes, where we haue had no Bookes, paper,
nor Inke, and because we shall bee stopped of our Arguments, as the Bishops
were at Oxford: and because the Notaries that shal write our Arguments shal be
such as either doe not, or dare not fauour the truth, therefore must write to please
them, or else they will put to, or take from, at their pleasure, as it appeared at Oxford:
Yea if any man was seene there to write, he was sent for and his writings
taken from him.</p>
               <p>If they will write, we will answere by writing, and proue by the word of God
and most ancient Fathers, this our faith &amp; euery péece thereof, and we are ready to

Iudge of all Controuersies of Religion: and we beléeue the Catholike Church is
the Spouse and beloued Wife of Christ, and to imbrace the doctrine of these bookes
in all matters of Religion, and therefore to bee heard accordingly, and those that
will not heare her, are Heretickes and Schismaticks, according to the saying:
He that will not heare the Church, let him be an Hereticke; and wee beléeue
the Symbols of the Créede of the Apostles, and of the Councels of Nice, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,
Ephesus, Chalcedon, and of Toletum, before the foure hundred fifty
foure yeare, and the Symbols of <hi>Athanasius, Ireneus, Tertullian,</hi> and of <hi>Damasus,</hi>
which was in the yeare thrée hundred seauenty sixe. We beléeue that Iustification
commeth onely from the mercy of GOD through Christ, and it is had of none of
discretion but by Faith: which Faith is a certaine perswasion wrought by the
Holy Ghost, and as it lightneth the mind, so it suppleth the heart, to submit it

               <p>By this we disalow Papisticall Doctrines of free will, of workes of superero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
of merits, of the necessity of auriculer confession and satisfaction: And we

a tongue as may be most to edifie and not in Latine, where the people vnderstand
not the same: And we beléeue, that God onely by Iesus Christ, is to bee prayed

departeth this life, he is either blessed, or damned for euer; by reason whereof we
affirme Purgatory, Masses of <hi>Scala Caeli,</hi> Trentals, and such suffrages as the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Church doth obtrude, as necessary, to be the Doctrine of Antichrist. And wee
beleeue two Sacraments of Christ, Baptisme and the Lordes Supper, and that
they ought to be ministred according to the institution of Christ, and that they bée
no longer Sacraments then they were in vse, and vsed to the end for which they
were instituted, and the mutilation of the one kind from the Lords Supper, from
the Lay people, is Antichristian; and so is the transubstantiation; and so is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration
of the Sacrament, and the reseruation and carrying about of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and so is the Doctrine of the Masse, it to be a propitiatory sacrifice for the quick and
dead, or a worke that pleaseth God: and so of the inhibition of marriage in any
state as vnlawfull; we doubt not but we shall be able to proue all these our verities
by Gods word, and the Church which hath followed Gods word and Spirit: and
we hartily desire all men to be obedient with vs vnto all that bee in authority, and
not to cease to pray to God for them, that he would gouerne them with his Spirit
of wisedome, and not to consent in any kind of rebellion against the Quéens High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but where they cannot obey, but they must disobey God, there to suffer with
all patience the pleasures of the higher powers, as we are ready to do, rather then
we will consent to any doctrine contrary to this which we heere confesse, wee shall
be iustly conuinced thereof. The Lord indue vs with his Spirit of truth, and grace

the meanes wherby you shall receiue this benefit, is by reuoking the lawes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you haue disseuered yourselues from the vnity of Christs Church, therefore
you, as prouident men for the weale of your soules and bodies, pouder what is to
be done in this waightie cause. The next day the three estates sitting in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament-house,
all on their knees exhibited a Supplication to their Highnesses, the
King and Queene, that their humble sute, by their Graces intercession and meane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
might be exhibited vnto the Cardinall, declaring themselues sorie and repentant
for the Schisme committed in this Realme against the Apostolike Sea, promising,
in token of their repentance, to be readie vnto the vttermost of their power, to doe
their endeauour for the repealing of the said lawes: and we desire that your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties

and that we may be receiued into the bosome of Christs Church, so that
this whole Realme may in perfect obedience vnto the Sea Apostolike serue God
and your Maiesties, to the furtherance of his honour and glorie. The king and
Queene deliuered it vnto the Cardinall, who perceauing the effect thereof to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
his expectation, hee receiued it most gladly: and after he had thanked Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God for the prosperous successe of his comming from Rome, by the Popes
authoritie he gaue them full absolution: Then they went to the Chappell &amp; sung
te <hi>Deum</hi> with great ioy of the reconciliation: the report of this was sent to Rome
with great speed, as well by the King and Cardinals Letters, which thou maist
see in the Booke of Martyrs: Wherevpon the Pope caused Processions to
bee made with great ioy for the conuersion of England, and praising the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
deligence, and the deuotion of the King and Queene, on Christmas Euen
by his Bulles hee set forth, a generall pardon to all such as did truely reioyce for
the same.</p>
               <p>The Sonday following the second of December, <hi>Gardiner</hi> Bishop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester
and Lord Chancellor preached at Paules Crosse: Upon the third to the
Romans: <hi>It is time that we should awake out of sleepe, for our saluation is neerer
then when we beleeued:</hi> First he shewed how the saying of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
vpon the Gentils, which had long time slept in ignorance: therefore to stir vp
their dulnes he desired them to wake out of sleepe: then hee compared our time to
theirs.</p>
               <p>As the sacraments of Christ did declare Christ to come, our Sacraments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that he is come: now that hee is come the Iewes sacrifices bee done away,
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Sacrament: wherefore it is time that we now also awake who haue slept &amp; rather
dreamed this twenty yeares, as shall bee declared by the properties of sléepe or
dreame.</p>
               <p>As we going to sléepe, separate our selues from company, so we haue separated
our selues from the Sea of Rome, no Realme in Christendome like vs, and as
Shepheards dreame sometimes of killing, mayning, or drowning, and sometimes
of beastlinesse, so we haue not onely dreamed of beastlinesse, but also done it: and
as in sléepe, all ones senses is stopped, that hee cannot see, not smell, nor heare;
so the Ceremonies of the Church being to mooue our senses, are taken away,
whereby our senses are stopped: and further, when a man would sleepe, he wil put
out the Candle, least it wake him. So lately, all such Writers as did hold with
the Apostolike Sea, are forbidden to be read, and Images, which were Lay mens
Books, were cast downe and burned.</p>
               <p>Wee haue beene this twenty yeares without a head, for when King <hi>Henry</hi>
first tooke vpon him the head of the Church, it was then no Church at all. After
whom King <hi>Edward</hi> could not be head, but was onely a shaddow of a head: and
in our Queenes time we had no head, for she alone could not be head, and her two
Arch-bishoppes were both conuicted of one crime, and deposed in <hi>Henry</hi> the eights
time, when the tumult was in the North, the King would haue giuen the supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masie
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:14787:130"/>
againe to the Pope, but the houre was not then come, least it had beene said
he did it for feare. After Master <hi>Kneuet</hi> and I were sent Ambassadors to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
to be a means to reconcile the King to the Pope, but the time was not come,
for it might be said it was done for policy: the matter was likewise moued in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of King <hi>Edwards</hi> raigne, hut the time was not yet come; for it might haue
been said, the King was bought &amp; sold in his infancy, neither was the houre come in

and if it had been done when the King first came, it might haue been said it had
beene done by violence, but now, <hi>hora est,</hi> when nothing can be obiected, but that it
is the prouidence of God. Now Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the hath sent vnto vs this most reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend

wéepe with them that wéepe, and reioyce with them that reioyce. The King and
Quéenes Maiesties haue restored the Pope to his supremacy, and the thrée Estates
of Parliament haue also submitted themselues to his Holinesse, and his successors
for euer, therefore let vs no longer stay.</p>
               <p>And as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith to the <hi>Corinthians, He was their Father,</hi> so may the Pope
say, he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the time was thought to be nigh, and mid-wiues, rockers, and nurses, with

Then the Bishop bade him write what he beléeued of transubstantiation, which
he did, saying, My Lord, you séeke my bloud and you shall haue it: I pray God you
may be baptized in it, that you may after loath bloud-sucking, and become a better
man: this writing the Bishop kept to cut his throate with. Then the Bishop
sent him to the Lord Chancellor, who kneeling before him, the Lord Chancellor
said, How happeneth it that you haue preached contrary to the Quéens Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<hi>Saunders</hi> answered, as he was admonished by <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> because he saw per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous
times at hand, he exhorted his parishioners to perseuer in those things which
they had learned, for by the example of the Apostles we must obey God before man:
we doe only professe the sinceritie of the word, which although it be now forbidden
vs to preach with our mouthes, yet our bloud hereafter shall manifest the same.
The Bishop said, carrie away this frensie foole to prison. <hi>Saunders</hi> answered hee
thanked God he had giuen him a place of rest, where he might pray for the Bishops
conuersion.</p>

he was wonderfully comforted, and receaued a taste of the communion of
Saints: a pleasant refreshing did issue from euery part of his bodie to his heart,
and from thence into all parts againe. He continued in prison a yeare and three
moneths, and then he was sent for before the Lord Chancellor, who offered him his
pardon if he would recant; which because he refused, he was condemned vpon his
opinion against the Sacrament, with his hand in writing vnto <hi>Bonner,</hi> as before is
related.</p>
               <p>Then he was carried vnto <hi>Couentrie,</hi> and one night he was put into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Gaole amongst other prisoners, where he slept little, but spent the night in
prayer and instruction of others: the next day he was ledde to execution into the
Parke without the Citie, going in olde gowne and a shirt, bare-footed, and as
he went he oftentimes fell flat on the ground and prayed. When he was come

               <p>Maister <hi>Bradford,</hi> that deuout and vertuons Preacher, who was a miracle or

They sent for <hi>Taylor</hi> before my Lord Chancellor, and either Commissioners, the

That so to rise, should bee the greatest fall that euer I could receiue, for I

as I liue.</p>
               <p>My Lord Chancellor asked me, whether I had read his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ooke vpon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
I said I had read it: He asked mee how I liked it; My Lord said I,
there are many things farre <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> from GODS truth in that Booke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then he

               <p>I said, My Lord, you wrote a Booke <hi>De vera obedientia,</hi> I would you had béen

that Booke.</p>
               <p>How like you that said my Lord, I wrote against Priests mariage but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> pleaseth

not such as thou art. I answered their procéedings now against Priests mariages,
is against naturall Law, Ciuill Law, Canon Law, generall Councels, Canons
of the Apostles, ancient Doctors, and Gods Lawes.</p>
               <p>Then because I would not turne, I was sent to prison againe.</p>
               <p>After Doctor <hi>Taylor,</hi> Maister <hi>Bradford,</hi> and Maister <hi>Sanders,</hi> were called to
appeare before my Lord Chancellor, and other Commissioners, where because
they would not yéeld to papistry, they were condemned, and sentence was read a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Taylor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They reioyced that they were worthy to suffer for Christe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Word and truth,

               <p>So <hi>Taylor</hi> was sent to the Clinke, hee said vnto the people that flocked about
to sée him as he was going; GOD bée praised good people, I am come away

nights.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bonner</hi> came to the prison to him, to disgrade him, he said; Maister Doctor, I
would you would remember your selfe, and turne to your holy Mother the
Church, and I will sue for your pardon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Taylor</hi> answered, I would you and your fellowes would turne to Christ, as for
me, I will not turne to Antichrist.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Bonner</hi> had him put on the Uestures to bee disgraded, but hee would
not, when they were put vpon him, he put his handes by his side, and said; How
say you my Lord, am not I a goodlie Foole: How say you my Maisters, it I
were in Cheape-side, should I not haue Boyes enough to laugh at these apish
toyes and toying trumperie; and when the Bishoppe should strike him vpon

not.</p>
               <p>When he came to Maister <hi>Bradford,</hi> for they both lay in one Chamber, hee told
him laughinglie, how he had made the Bishop affraid to strike him: that night
his Wife, his Sonne <hi>Thomas,</hi> and his man <hi>Iohn Hull,</hi> were suffered to sup with
him, after Supper, he thanked GOD, that hee had giuen him strength to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
by his holie Word: Then he said vnto his Sonne; My deare Sonne, God
giue thee his Spirit, truly to serue Christ, to learne his word, and to stand by it
all thy life: my Sonne, feare God, fly sinne, pray to him, and apply thy booke, and

               <p>Then he said, my deare Wife, be steadfast in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Lord will reward you for your faithfulnesse towards me, I now must be taken

GOD, he will prouide such a one for you, and he will bee a mercifull Father to

               <p>The next day he was carried away towards Hadley, to be burned there, diuers
Gentlemen and Iustices came to him there, who laboured him to returne vnto the
Romish Religion, shewed him his pardon and promised him great promotions, yea

body, and that we are thereby taught onely to pray to our heauenly Father, and is
no Saint nor Angell.</p>
               <p>4 We beléeue there is a Catholick Church, euen the Communion of Saints,
builded vpon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, Christ being the head

without fault in his sight.</p>
               <p>5 This Church of it selfe is sinfull, and must needs say Father forgiue vs our

               <p>6 Hee is our onely Mediator as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>there is one God, and

               </p>
               <p>8 The true Church teacheth the Word of God truely, not adding thereto, nor
taking there-from; and Ministers the Sacraments according to the Primitiue
Church, and it suffreth all men to reade the Scriptures: as Christ saith: <hi>Search
the Scriptures:</hi> And when <hi>Paul</hi> preached, the audience searched the Scriptures;
whether hee preached truely: <hi>Dauid</hi> teacheth to pray with vnderstanding: Saint

Christ saith, <hi>you shall forsake Father and Mother and follow me,</hi> whereby we
learne if our elders, teach otherwise then God commanded in that point we must
forsake them.</p>
               <p>10 The Supper of our Lord ought not to be altered, because Christ the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the Father did institute it: For it is written, <hi>cursed is he that changeth

               </p>
               <p>This Supper is sorely abused, it is giuen in one kinde, where Christ gaue it in

it to all his Apostles in the name of the whole Church, &amp; not to one alone: Christ
ordained it for a remembrance of his euerlasting sacrifice vpon the Crosse once for
all; and not againe to bee a dayly sacrifice both for them that are aliue, and them
that are dead: And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, where there is no remission of sinnes, there

               <p>12 Concerning Christs words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> the minde of Christ must bee
searched out by other Scriptures: for the Apostle saith no Scripture hath any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate

after the Letter, as the Capernaites did which taught that Christs body should
haue been eaten with their teeth; when he spake of the eating thereof, to whom
Christ said, <hi>the Spirit quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing, for my words are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and life:</hi> so we see Christs words must be vnderstood spiritually, and not lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally:
hee that commeth to this worthy supper must not prepare his iaw but his
heart: neither tooth nor belly, but beleeue, saith Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> and thou hast ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
it: so wee must bring with vs a Spirituall hunger, and examine our selues
whether our Conscience doe testifie that we doe truely beleeue in Christ according
to the Scriptures, whereof if we be truely certified, beeing new borne from our
old conuersation, in heart, minde, will and deed, then may we boldly with this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
garment of Faith come to the feast.</p>
               <p>And that there is no change but bread still remaineth, Christ saith, <hi>Doe this
in remembrance of me:</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul, As often as you shall eate this bread and
drinke this Cup, you shall remember the Lords death vntill hee come:</hi> heere is no
change but bread still: And Christ saith, <hi>except I goe to my Father the Comforter
cannot come:</hi> And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>heauen shall keep him vntill the last day:</hi> in
that he is God he is euery where, but in that hee is Man hee cannot be but in one
place, as his body was not in all places at once when hee was heere: Hee was
not in the graue when the women sought him as the Angell said: neither was
hee at Bethania when <hi>Lazarus</hi> died by Christs owne words: and thus we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that the Christ is in the holy Supper sacramentally and spiritually, in all
them that worthily receiue it: and corporally in heauen both God and Man.</p>

a true Gospeller by word and deed.</p>
               <p>At the beginning of Queene <hi>Maries</hi> raigne, the masse not being restored by law,

to whom he iustified that he did it both by the iustice of the law, and of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
wherein he was fully bent to stand in triall to the vtmost that can be obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
and it therein I haue done any iniury, let me be iudged by the law; for I will
séeke or desire no better defence for my selfe, considering chiefly that it is my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>
               <p>Ah Sir, said the Chancellor, you be very quicke and stoute in your answers, it
seemeth that which you did was more of will, fauouring your opinion of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against the seruice now vsed, then for any occasion of zeale of iustice, seeing her
Highnesse doth set it forth as yet, but withing all her subiects to imbrace it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
               <p>My Lord, quoth <hi>Hales,</hi> I doe but shew my selfe as I am bound in loue to God
and obedience to the Quéenes Maiestie, in whose cause willingly for iustice sake, I
did of late, as your Lordship knoweth, aduenture as much as I had: and as for
my religion, I trust it is such as pleaseth God, wherein I am ready to aduenture
both my life and substance, if I be called thereto; and for lack of mine owne power

               <p>Shortly after he was committed vnto the Kings Bench, then he was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Counter in Breadstréete, and from thence he was conuayed to the Fléet,

draw him from the truth, which at length he brought to passe; then next morning

eat little meat that night. When supper was done he gate him straight to bedde,

a pen-knife he wounded himselfe in diuers places, and would haue killed himselfe,

               <p>Upon this <hi>Cranmer</hi> straight-way took occasion to call the doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell

by one <hi>Troyanus Nauus,</hi> and the Pope suffered this beastlines vnder his nose in his
chamber, which could not abide the doctrine of Christ.</p>
               <p>This Pope delighted greatly in Porke flesh and Peacocks: by the aduice of

asked what it meant: it was told her it was for the Pope, and that she must pray
for him; nay, quoth she that I will not, for he needeth not my prayers, seeing hee

God keepe me from: Well said he, if thou wilt not receiue mercy offred vnto thée,
know for a truth, that the Queene is minded to make a purgation of all such as
thou art. <hi>Bradford</hi> answered, I would be glad of the Queenes mercy, to liue as a
subiect without a clogge of Conscience, otherwise the Lords mercy is better to
me then life, and I commit my life into his hands that will keep it, that none can
take it away without his pleasure: There are twelue houres in the day as long

               <head>Reasons against Transubstantiation, gathered by

               <p>1 TErtullian saith that which is former is true, that which is later is false. Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation
is a late Doctrine; for it was not generally defin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d vntill the
Councell of <hi>Laterane,</hi> about the yeare one thousand two hundred and fifteene, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Innocent</hi> 3. before it was free to beleeue it, or not beleeue it: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of Transubstantiation is false.</p>
               <p>2 That the words of Christs Supper be figuratiue: the Circumstances of the
Scripture: the proportion of the Sacraments: the sentences of all holy Fathers:
For a thousand yeares after Christ doe all teach: It followeth there is no Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</p>
               <p>3 The Scriptures doe witnes that the Lord gaue bread to his Disciples, and
called it his body: He took bread in his hands: hee gaue thankes ouer bread, he
brake bread, and gaue bread to his Disciples: As <hi>Ireneus, Tertullian, Origene,
Cyprian, Epiphanius, Augustine,</hi> and all the Fathers of antiquitie doe affirme:
but in asmuch as the substance of bread and wine is another manner of thing:
then the substance of the body and bloud of Christ, it is plaine there is no Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation.</p>
               <p>4 The bread is no more transubstantiated then the wine: <hi>CHRIST</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
that the fruit of the Uine, saying, <hi>I will drinke no more of the fruit of
the Vine:</hi> Therefore by Christes wordes it was not Bloud but Wine:
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:14787:145"/>
therefore it followeth there is no Transubstantiation: <hi>Chrysostom</hi> vpon <hi>Mathew</hi>
and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> doe confirme this reason.</p>
               <p>5 The bread is called as well Christs mysticall body, as his naturall body:
for the same spirit that saith the bread is my body; saith also, wee being many are
one body, but it is not the mysticall body by transubstantiation, no more is it his
naturall body by transubstantiation.</p>
               <p>6 The words ouer the Cup are not so effectuall as to transubstantiate it int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the New Testament: Therfore the words spoken ouer the bread, are not so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to make Transubstantiation.</p>
               <p>7 The Doctrine of Transubstantiation doth not agree with the Apostolick
and mother Churches, which receiued there Doctrine of the Apostles, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
it of Christ, and Christ of God: as of Gréece, of Corinthus, of Philippos,
Collosia, Thessalonica, Ephesus, which neuer taught Transubstantiation: yea,
it agreeth not with the Doctrine of the Church of Rome, taught in times past,
for <hi>Gelasius</hi> the Pope doth manifestly confute the errour of transubstantiation,
and reproueth them of sacriledge, which diuide the mysterie, and keep the Cup
from the lay people: Therefore the Doctrine of transubstantiation agreeth not
with the truth.</p>

you be wiser then Christ, and God the Father, or the Holy Ghost? what, wiser

on his Fathers message, did forget halfe his arrant by the way: for it is hard to

               <p>The Catholike Church is built vpon the foundation of the Prophets and
Apostles, Christ being the head corner stone: it is the Congregation of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
dispersed through the whole world; and two or three gathered together in
Christs name are the members thereof. This Church doeth preach GODS
holy word and minister the blessed Sacraments truely: the Church of England

altered the Testament of GOD, and set vp a Testament of their own deuising,
ful of blasphemy and lies, Christs Testament being that we should haue all things
done for the edifying of the Church.</p>
               <p>The Masse now vsed is most abominable idolatrie and intollerable blasphemie:
Christ ordained his Sacraments to be eaten together in remembrance of his death
vntill he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

GOD will not be worshipped in his creatures, but we must remember to praise

him for his creatures: what is kneeling, holding vp your handes, knocking of the
breast, putting off the cap, and making curtsie, with other superstition to the bread,
but Idolatrie?</p>
               <p>You obiect you worship not the Bread and Wine, but the body of Christ, borne
of the Uirgin vnder the forme of Bread and Wine: but that is a very lye, for
Christs body that was borne of the Uirgin is in heauen.</p>
               <p>Auricular confession is not good: if I haue offended God I must séeke to him
for remission of sinnes by Christ: if I haue offended my neighbour, I must recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile

Salt; the like is to be said of the rest of the ceremonies of the Church.</p>
               <p>And he said there were but two sacraments, except they would make the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow

in the fire; then cruell Doctor <hi>Storie</hi> commaunded one to hurle a Faggot at him,

as the body is dead if the blood be gone, so their Sacrament is a dead God, because
they take away the blood of Christ from his body, being the Cup is taken from the

                     </gap>er</hi> knéeled downe and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the whole matter to the King, and begged her pardon, which the King graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and gaue it him when he went home. In the meane time the woman was
brought a bedde in prison, and Master <hi>Latimer</hi> was God-father, but hee told her
not of the pardon, but laboured to haue her confesse the truth. When the time
came that she looked to suffer, she greatly lamented that she should not be purified
before she did suffer, thinking she should be damned if she died vnpurified. Master
<hi>Bilney</hi> and Master <hi>Latimer</hi> told her that the law was made for the Iewes, and not
for vs, and how women be as well in the fauour of God before purification as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And when they had brought her into a good way, they shewed her the Kings
pardon, and let her goe. Many moe like good matters were wrought by him, but
the more his vertues and good doings began to be knowne, the more his aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
began to spurn against him.</p>
               <p>One Doctor <hi>Redman,</hi> of great authoritie in Cambridge, séeing the boldnesse of
Master <hi>Latimer,</hi> in setting abroad the Gospell, he wrote to him earnestly, requiring
him for charities sake not to stand so much in his owne conceit, nor to preferre his
singular iudgement in matters of religion and controuersies, before so many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men and the whole Catholike Church, hauing neither the word of God, nor the
testimony of any authentike writer to make for you: consider you are but a man,
therfore lying and vanity may quickly bleare your eyes, which doth somtime trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it selfe into an Angell of light: suffer not the Church to take offence by the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:14787:157"/>
hardnes of your heart, let not the vnitie of Christs coat without seame be torne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder,
trust not in your owne wisdome.</p>
               <p>To which he answered, it is enough for me that Christs sheepe heare no mans
voyce but Christs: you haue no voyce of Christ against me: for my part I haue a
heart that is readie to hearken to any voyce of Christs that you can bring me; so
fare you well, and trouble me not any more from the talking with the Lord my
God.</p>
               <p>At length M. <hi>Latimer</hi> was called before the Cardinall for heresie, by the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his aduersaries, where he was content to subscribe to such articles as
were propounded vnto him.</p>
               <p>After he was appointed for one of them that laboured for the Kings supremacie,
and remaining at Court, he preached often in London: after, at the sute of the

very diligent in teaching: his diligence extended also to all the countrey round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
but there also he could not escape without enemies. It so chanced that hee
preaching vpon the Uirgin <hi>Marie,</hi> he proued that Christ was her Sauiour. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Popish Priests being therewith offended, drew Articles against him concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the matter of our Ladie, of praying vnto Saints, and of Purgatorie: to
which Articles he answered in effect as followeth;</p>
               <p>1 To reproue certaine Priests and beneficed men which giue so much to our
Lady, as though she had not bin saued by Christ, which is the sauiour of her and of
all that be or shall be saued. I did reason that either she was a sinner or no sinner;
if a sinner, then she was deliuered from sinne by Christ, or if she were no sinner
she was preserued from sinne by him, so he was her Sauiour which way soeuer
you take it.</p>
               <p>2 Images of Saints are called Saints: to pray to these Saints is Idolatrie.
Saints in heauen doe of Charity pray for vs, but we are not commanded to pray
to them, for Christ only is a holy Mediator for them and vs.</p>
               <p>3 The scurfe must be taken away from pilgrimage before it be good, to wit
superstition, Idolatrie, false faith, and trust in the Image, debts must be paide, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions

               <p>4 I said the <hi>Aue maria</hi> was a greeting which the Angel brought from God to the

Christ made, and bade vs say for a prayer, not adding that we should say ten or
twenty <hi>Aue Mariaes</hi> with it.</p>
               <p>5 The torment of hell is not a materiall fire, no more then it is a materiall
stinging of a worme or snake, but a metaphor signifying the paine, torment, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
griefe, miserie, sorrow, and heauines inexplicable and intollerable, whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and condition none can tell.</p>
               <p>6 That the soules that are not in hell, are in as great ioy as soules can be, and
cannot be put from eternall ioy, and suffer no paine, of charitie they pray for vs, and
haue no need that we should pray for them, and besides this there is no other Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie.
I had rather be there then in the Bishop of Londons prison, though
they call the fire thereof neuer so hote, yet if the Bishop with his two fingers can
put away some of the fire, and a Friers Cowle the fourth part thereof, and <hi>Scala
Coeli</hi> altogether, I will neuer found Abbey, Colledge, or Chauntery for that
purpose.</p>
               <p>Prouision for Purgatorie hath brought thousands to hell, debts haue not beene
paide, nor lands and goods euill gotten restored, poore people are suffered to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
for want, and all to builde religious houses to deliuer out of Purgatorie, and
to pay for Dirges, Masses, and ringing of Bells to carrie vs to hell withall; who
can purge pilgrimage from Idolatrie, and Purgatorie from robberie, but he shall
be in suspition of heresie?</p>

and they beléeue verily it is the blood of Christs body, shed vpon Mount Caluarie
for our saluation, and that the sight of it doth certifie them out of doubt, that their

them comming and going what faiths they haue, you would wonder, they cannot

suffer the Diuell to vse his craftie fashion for our probation: it were very little

               <p>Many dangerous hazards he suffered amongst the Popes friends and Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
for the Gospell sake. When there was a Proclamation set forth for the
calling in of the Bible in English, and many other good bookes, he hazarded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to write to King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight to disswade him therefrom, which Letter
thou mayest see in the booke at large: at length by the means of Doctor <hi>Butts</hi> and
of good <hi>Cromwell,</hi> he was made Bishop of Worcester and continued so a few
yeares, instructing his Diocesse according to a diligent Pastor, but (as before) both
in the Uniuersitie, and at his Benefiee he was tossed and turmoyled by the wicked,
so in his Bishopricke some sought his trouble, insomuch that he was accused to the
King for his Sermons. Thus he continued in this laborious function of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
for certaine yeares, vntill the comming vp of the sixe Articles, and altering of
Religion, so when he could not keepe his Bishopricke with a good conscience, of his
owne free will he resigned the same: at which time <hi>Shaxton</hi> Bishop of Salesburie
resigned also with him his Bishopricke. These two remained a great space vnbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopped,
keeping silence vntill the time of King <hi>Edward.</hi> A little after <hi>Latimer</hi>
had renounced his Bishopricke, hee was sore bruised with the fall of a tree, and
comming to London for remedy, hee was troubled of the Bishops, and at length
was cast into the Tower, where he continued prisoner vntill the Raigne of King
<hi>Edward,</hi> then the golden mouth of this preacher, shut vp long before, was opened
againe, and beginning a fresh to set forth his plough againe, and continued all the
time of the said King, labouring in the Lords haruest most fruitfully: hee preached
for the most part twice euery Sunday to no small shame of vnpreaching prelates,
which occupied great rome, to doe little good: he did most euidently prophes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all these kinde of plagues which after ensued: so plainely that if England euer
had a Prophet, he might seeme to be one, and he did euer affirme, that the preaching
of the Gospel would cost him his life, and he was certainely perswaded that <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi>
was kept in the Tower, to be his death, which fell out right, for after the
death of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> proclaimed, a Purseuant was sent down
vnto him (by the doing no doubt of <hi>Winchester) Latimer</hi> had warning thereof six

and be it knowne vnto you and the whole World; that I goe as willingly to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
at this present, being called of my Prince to giue a reckoning of my Faith and
Doctrine, as euer I was to goe vnto any place in the world: and I doubt not, but
that God which hath made me worthy to preach to two most excellent Princes, so
he will able me to witnesse the same to the third, either to her comfort or discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
eternally. When the Purseuant had deliuered his Letters, he departed, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that hee was not commaunded to tarry for him: whereby it appeared, they
would not haue him appeare, but rather to haue fled out of the Realme: they knew
his constancy would deface them in Popery, and confirme the godly in the truth.
When he came through Smithfield, he said merrily, Smithfield bad long groned
for him: after he had béene before the Councell, hee was sent to the Tower, and
from thence he was transported to Oxford, with <hi>Cramer</hi> Arch-bishop of Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and <hi>Ridley</hi> Bishop of London, there to dispute, as before is said: Of the order
of the disputations, and bow they were condemned, thou maist sée before, where
they continued vntill this time in continual prayer, godly conference and writing.
<hi>Latimer</hi> sometimes continued so long knéeling at prayer, that hee was not able to
arise without helpe: three thinges especially he prayed for in his Prayers: First,
as God hath appointed him to preach his Word, so hee would giue him grace to
stand to the same vntill his death: Secondly, that God would restore his Gospel
vnto England againe once more: which once more hee inculcated oftentimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the eares of the LORD, as if he had spoken vnto him face to face: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
hee prayed for the preseruation of Queene <hi>ELIZABETH,</hi> then but Lady
<hi>ELIZABETH,</hi> whom with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to this comfortles Realme, the Lord most graciously granted al these things
which he requested.</p>
               <p>The twentith day of September, a Commission was sent from the Cardinall
to the Bishops of Lincolne, Glocester, and Bristow, to examine Doctor <hi>Ridley,</hi> and
Maister <hi>Latimer,</hi> vpon the points they were condemned for at Oxford: and if they
would not recant there opinions, to disgrade them, &amp;c. The first point was whether
the reall presence of Christ was in the Sacrament: D. <hi>Ridley</hi> first appeared before
them; when the Commission was read, he standing bare-headed, assoon as he heard
the Cardinall named, and the Popes Holines: he put on his cap, the Bishop of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne
reprehended him for it, and told him if he would not of himselfe put off his cap
another should doe it for him: He answered, that it was not done for any contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
that he bare vnto their own persons, nor for any derogation of the Cardinall in
that he was borne of the Bloud Royall, &amp; was indued with much le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whose vsurped supremacie I vtterly renounce, which I will not onely denounce
in words, but in gesture, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>auiour, and all my doings expresse the same: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
by the commandement of the Bishop of Lincoln his cap was taken off: he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
twice, and thus he did at both times, their answeres were both to one effect
in substance.</p>
               <p>First they made their protestation, that notwithstanding their answers, it should
not be taken thereby that they would acknowledge any authority of the Pope, but
that they answered as subiects to the king and Queene: to the first point they did
confesse that in the sacrament, by spirit and grace, is the very body and bloud of
Christ, because that euery man receiuing bodily the bread and wine in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
spiritually receiue the body and bloud of Christ, and thereby is partaker of
the merits of his passion, but they denied the naturall body and bloud of Christ to
be really in the outward sacrament.</p>
               <p>The second question was, whether after consecration of the sacrament of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
there did remain any substance of bread and wine: to that they answered, there
was such a change in the bread and wine, as no man but God can make, being the
bread had that dignity to exhibit Christs body, yet the bread is still bread, and the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:14787:158"/>
wine still wine, for the change is not in the nature but in the dignity, because that
which was common bread hath the dignitie to exhibit Christs body, for now it is
an holy bread sanctified by Gods word.</p>
               <p>The third question was, whether the masse were a liuely and propitiatorie sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
for them aliue, and for them that be dead: this article they denied to be true,
because Christ made one perfect sacrifice for the whole world; neither can the
Priests offer vp Christ againe for the sinnes of man; neither is there any propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for our sins, but his Crosse only. And because neither for feare nor flatterie
they could be made to recant, at their second sitting they were condemned, disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and deliuered to the secular power.</p>
               <p>Upon the North-side of the towne of Oxford, in the ditch, ouer against Baliol
Colledge, the place of execution was appointed, Doctor <hi>Ridley</hi> came vnto the
stake in a faire black gowne, such as he was wont to weare when he was Bishop,
with a tippet of sables about his neck; M. <hi>Latimer</hi> came in a poore frize frock, in
one they might behold the honor they sometimes had, in the other the calamitie
whereunto they were now descended: after Doctor <hi>Ridley</hi> had prayed, seeing the
chéerfulnes of M. <hi>Latimer</hi> he ran vnto him, imbraced him, and kissed him, saying,
be of good heart brother, for God will either asswage the fury of the flame, or else
strengthen vs to abide it.</p>
               <p>Then Doctor <hi>Smith</hi> began his Sermon vpon 1. <hi>Co. 13. If I giue my body to the
fire to be burned, and haue not charity, I shall gaine nothing thereby:</hi> wherein he
alledged that neither the holinesse of the person, nor the manner of the death, but
the goodnes of the cause made a martyr; this he pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ued by the example of <hi>Iudas</hi>
and many others, which then might be counted righteous because they desperatly
sundred their liues from their bodies (as he feared these men that stood before him
would do) and still he cried vnto the people to beware of them, for they were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
&amp; died out of the Church: at last he exhorted them to recant and come home
again vnto the Church, &amp; saue their liues and soules, which else were condemned.
They would haue answered him, but some ran to them &amp; stopt their mouthes with
their hands, &amp; would not suffer them to speak. Then Doctor <hi>Ridley</hi> said, Heauenly
father, I giue thée most hearty thanks that thou hast called me to be a professor of
thée, euen vnto death: I beséech thée be mercifull to this Realme of England, and
deliuer the same from all her enemies. When the fire was kindled he cried, Into
thy hands I commit my spirit, Lord receiue my spirit, crying often, Lord, Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
my spirit: M. <hi>Latimer</hi> crying as vehemently on the other side, O Father of

his equals stout and enuious if they any thing withstood him in iudgment: it was
constantly reported that the nayles of his toes were crooked and sharp downward
like the clawes of a beast: his death happened so opportunely that England hath a
great cause therefore to praise God, not so much for the great hurt it had done in
times past, in peruerting his Princes, in bringing in the sixe Articles, in murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

it should stand for euer: whether he died with his tongue swolne out of his mouth,

               <p>HEe was Sir <hi>Peter Philpots</hi> sonne in Hampshire, brought vp in new Colledge
in Oxford: going from Oxford into Italy, comming from Uenice to Padua
he was in danger through a Franciscan Frier accompanying him in his iourney,
who comming to Padua accused him of heresie. In King <hi>Edwards</hi> time he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
conflicts with <hi>Gardner</hi> Bishop of Winchester: after he was made Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con of
Winchester, where he continued during King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, to no small
profit of those parts: in Quéen <hi>Maries</hi> time he being one of the Conuocation, with
a few other sustained the cause of the Gospell manfully against the aduersary part,
as is before recited, wherefore he was called to account before <hi>Gardner,</hi> and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by him, and then hée was remoued to <hi>Bonner</hi> and other Commissioners,
with whom he had diuers conflicts, as in his examinations hereafter following
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:14787:159"/>
may appeare, when he had lien a yeere and a halfe in the Marshalsey, being twice
examined, but no point of Religion handled: then hee was committed to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Londons Cole-house, where he found a married Priest of Essex named
<hi>Thomas Whittle,</hi> This Minister greatly lamented his owne infirmitie, for that
through imprisonment hee was constrained by writing to yeelde to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of London, and was set at liberty, and after felt such an hell in his conscience
that hee could scarce refraine from destroying himselfe, and could not bee at quiet
vntill he hauing got the Bishops register to see his Bill, hee tore it in peeces, and
after he was as ioifull a man as any could be: When <hi>Boner</hi> heard thereof be sent
for him, and buffeted him, and plucked off a peece of his Beard, but now he
is ioyfull vnder the crosse.</p>

                  <p>Where can you proue that the Church of Rome hath erred at any time:
<hi>Eusebius</hi> saith, the Church was established at Rome by <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi>
was Bishop there 25. yeares.</p>

                  <p>I know <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith so, but if you compare him with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the
Galathians, it will appeare manifestly to the contrarie: He liued not past fiue
and thirty yeares after he was called to be an Apostle: and S. <hi>Paul</hi> maketh mention
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:14787:160"/>
of his abiding aboue eighteene yeares, and I am able to proue by <hi>Eusebius</hi> and
others, that the Church of Rome hath manifestly erred, because shee agreeth not
with that which the primitiue Church did vse according to the Gospel in their time
as they write, there need no other proofe, but compare the one with the other.</p>

God giueth knowledge of his truth through his free grace, to whom he
listeth, <hi>Iames.</hi> 1. And I beleeue Christ hath his vniuersall Church, his Spouse,
scattered through many Realmes, where hee list: the Spirit inspireth where it
will, he is no more adicted to any one place, then to the person and quality of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one man of this Church. I know I am a member trusting to bee saued by
the faith that is taught therein: But how this Church is knowne, is the end
of all Controuersies; the true markes of this Church, is the true preaching of
his Word, &amp; ministring of his Sacraments: these markes were sealed by the
Apostles, and confirmed by the ancient Fathers, vntill the wickednesse of Men

that he was alone sent Ambassador to the Emperour to debate this businesse, but

dying, he was sent for by king <hi>Henrie</hi> and made Archbishop of Canterbury,
then came in the question of the Popes supremacy, and all the weight of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
was chiefly laid vpon <hi>Cranmers</hi> shoulders; he therefore alone receiued, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
and confuted all the obiections of the Papists, he proued that the Popes
Lordship was not brought in by any authoritie of Scriptures, but by ambitious
tyranny, and that the chiefest power on earth, belonged to the Emperor, to kings
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:14787:165"/>
and Potentates, to whom the Pope, Cardinals, Bishops, Priests, by Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
were no lesse subiect then other men, and therefore it were best by the
consent of the king, and other estates, the ambitious Lordship of the Pope, being
driuen out of England, should keepe it selfe within his owne Italy, as a riuer is
kept within his bankes, which was performed by act of Parliament, then by little
and little he reformed the Church into a more wholesome discipline of Christ, and
laboured to banish the Popes errours, heresies, and corruptions, and he obtained
of the king, that certaine learned men should make a booke of Ecclesiasticall insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
which was called the Bishops Booke: then the abolishing of Monasteries
began to be talked of, the kings desire was, that all the Abbey lands should come
vnto his coffers, the Archbishop and others would haue them imployed to other
good vses, whereby the king being bent against <hi>Cranmer,</hi> especially by the instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Gardiner</hi> Bishop of Winchester, which sought all occasions to hinder the
Gospel, he set forth the 6. Articles by full consent of Parliament, which contained
the summe of Popish religion. What slaughter by the space of 8. yeares these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
made, is already declared: but after, he forgoing his anger with the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop:
séeing he stood against him, in conscience, not in stubburnesse, he began to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
him, and thought to haue taken away the 6. Articles, and reformed other
matters if he had liued; but <hi>Cranmer</hi> and the Lord protector brought it to passe in
king <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes: his story how he was vsed in Quéene
<hi>Maries</hi> reign is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, and his disputations at Oxeford, and how he was condemned there
and left in prison vntill this time.</p>
               <p>And because the sentence was voyde in law, because it was giuen by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
excommunicated, (for they were not then absolued by the Pope nor his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
receiued in the realme) therefore there was a new commission sent from
the Pope for the conuiction of <hi>Cranmer, Latimer,</hi> and <hi>Ridley,</hi> and the Bishop of
Glocester was appointed the Popes delegate, and after they had condemned <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer</hi>
and <hi>Ridley,</hi> as before is said. The said Legate and his company being set
in Saint <hi>Maries</hi> Church apparelled in his Pontificalibus as if the Pope in
person had bene there: the Bishop of Canterbury was brought before them, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off his cappe he did obeysance to the king and quéenes proctors, then looking
in the Legats face, he put on his bonnet againe, making no obedience toward him,
wherefore the Bishop sayd vnto him, that it might beséeme him well, waying the
authoritie which he did represent, to doe his duety to him: he answered, hee had
sworne neuer to admit the Pope into this Realme, and therefore he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
nothing by signe or token which might argue his consent to the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him, and that he did it not to any contempt of his person.</p>
               <p>Then the Legate made an eloquent oration, to put him in remembrance, that
from a meane gentleman he was raised to bee a Princes Ambassadour, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be Archbishop and Primate of the Realmealmost 30, yeares, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in trust with the king, that he made him president of his councel, and after left him
in speciall trust for the gouernement of the young Prince during his minoritie,
such blessing God had giuen him whilest he continued in the Catholicke faith.</p>
               <p>He exhorted, him on the other side, to consider how he was now fallen from his
dignities and officices, and in high displeasure of the King and Quéene, iudged to
die for high treason; and all these things to haue happened vnto him, only because
he had seuered himself from the Sea of Rome, and was become a father of new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised
religion, and although your estate is so miserable, that the meanest in this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
will not change his condition and calling with you: yet further he was
like to fall by the iust iudgement of God into hell and euerlasting damnation, if
he did not repent of his errours and schismes, whilest he had time of repentance,
whereunto he exhorted him earnestly, repeating many places of Christs mercies
to them that repent, and shewed that to returne to the Church was the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to saue both body and soule, and I doubt not but the King and Quéene will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
your condemnation of treason if you will returne vnto the Church and
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:14787:165"/>
forsake your opinions, which I desire you to do.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Cranmer</hi> desired license to speake, which was gently granted him: first
he made protestation that hee did not answere to him as to a lawfull Iudge; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was deputed for the Pope, but to giue a reason of his faith, which God
hath commanded him to doe to euery one that shall demand a reason thereof.</p>
               <p>Then he said, My Lord you haue learnedly put me in remembrance of many
things touching my selfe, which I will not answere: I acknowledge Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
vnto me, and thanke him as heartily for this estate that now I am in, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
I did for the time of my prosperity, shewing that his greatest griefe was, to
sée the Popes Iurisdiction restored to England againe: Alas! what hath the
Pope to do in England, whose lawes are so farre different from the Lawes of this
realme, that whosoeuer sweareth to both, must néedes incurre periury in the one?
And I am heartily sorry to thinke that her grace, the day before her Coronation,
tooke an oath to obserue the lawes of this realme; and also tooke an oath to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Rome, promising to maintaine that Sea, which was impossible but shee
must néeds be forsworne in the one.</p>
               <p>And as for the matter of Heresie, wherewith you charge mee, I call God to
witnesse I know none which I maintaine: but if it be heresie to deny the Popes
authority, and the religion which the sea of Rome hath published vnto the world
these latter yeares, then all the ancient Fathers of the primitiue Church, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and Christ himselfe, taught heresie: And hee desired all them present to
beare him witnesse, that he tooke the Traditions and Religion of the Pope to bée
most erronious, false, and against the doctrine of holy Scriptures, which hee had
often proued by preaching and writing; and the Pope to bee very Antichrist, so
often preached by the Apostles and Prophets, in whom most euidently doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
all the signes and tokens whereby hee was painted vnto the world to bee
knowne by: for hee aduanceth himselfe aboue all Emperours and Kings of the
world, whom he affirmeth to hold of him, and to be at his commandement: and
the stories make mention of his intollerable pride and tyranny vsed to them, as
no King would haue done to his subiects, nor a good maister to his seruants, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his féet vpon Emperours necks, and making others to hold his stirrops, and
remoued others from their Empires; &amp; hath not onely occupied the highest places
in the world aboue Kings, but hath presumed to fit in the seat of Almighty God,
which is the conscience of man, &amp; to kéepe the possession thereof, he hath promised
forgiuenesse of sins, he hath brought in Gods of his own framing, and inuented a
new religion full of lucre, quite contrary to the Scriptures, only for maintaining
of his kingdome, displacing Christ from his glory, &amp; holding his people in misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
seruitude of blindnesse, to the losse of a number of soules which God at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
day shall exact at his hands; boasting in his Canons &amp; decrées, that he can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
against <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> the old Testament, &amp; New: &amp; that in his fulnesse of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
he can do as much as God. If any man can be aduanced aboue him, let him
be iudged Antichrist.</p>
               <p>This enemy of God and our redemption is so euidently painted out in the
Scriptuers, with such manifest tokens which all sée clearely appeare in him, that
except a man will shut his eyes and heart against the light, hee cannot but know
him; therefore I will neuer giue my consent to the receiuing of him into the
Church of England: and my Lord sand you that be here, examine your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
you are sworne against him, you are learned and can iudge the truth, I
pray God you be not wilfully blind, I haue discharged my conscience to the world
&amp; I will write my mind to her grace, which letter you may sée in the book at large.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Storie</hi> and <hi>Martine</hi> diuers times interrupted him, saying, he spake blasphemy,
and would faine haue the Bishop put him to silence, who notwithstanding suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him to end his spéech.</p>
               <p>Then they charged him that he was sworne vnto the Pope when he was made
Archbishop; but he denied it, and said: It appeareth that he did not, by the record
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:14787:166"/>
of the countrey, which one of them confessed. Many maruelled that in so peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
a time he had so sincerely proceeded, choosing rather to venture the losse of
his life, and all his glorious pompe, then to do any thing that might spill his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
               <p>Then they obiected, that he was married; which he confessed: Doctor <hi>Martine</hi>
said, his children were bond-men to the Sea of Canterbury. At which he smiled,
saying: If a benificed Priest had a Concubine, and had bastards by her, they are
not bond-men to the benifice, I trust you wil make my childrens cause no worse.</p>
               <p>Then D. <hi>Martine</hi> demanded of him who was the supreme head of the Church;
he said, Christ: <hi>Martine</hi> said, you made K. <hi>Henry</hi> supreme head of the Church. He
said, of the people of England, Ecclesiasticall &amp; Temporal, and not of the Church:
for Christ is the onely head of the Church, and of the Faith and Religion of the
same.</p>
               <p>The Articles of religion, touching the Sacrament, denying transubstantiation,
the Sacrifice of the Masse, and the reall presence, he affirmed as he taught in his
Booke. Then they cited him to appeare 80, daies after at <hi>Rome,</hi> and then sent him
to prison; where thou maist sée their visored face of Iustice, as though the Court
of <hi>Rome</hi> would condemne no man before hee answered for himselfe: but
the same time the Pope sent letters executory vnto the King and Queene to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade
and depriue him, which was done before twenty dayes were done: And
though he were kept in prison, at the end of the 80 dayes hee was decreed Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>max,
and thereupon condemned.</p>
               <p>Upon S. <hi>Valentines</hi> day next after, the Archbishop was disgraded, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by <hi>Bonner,</hi> &amp; <hi>Thurlby</hi> Bishop of Ely, who sometimes was <hi>Cranmers</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine,
and preferred by him: at which time <hi>Bonner,</hi> which a long time had borne
great malice towards him, and reioyced greatly see this day wherein he might
triumph ouer him at his pleasure, made an Oration to the people in this sort:</p>
               <p>This is the man who hath euer despised the Popes holinesse, and now is to be
iudged by him: this is the man that hath pulled downe so many Churches, and
now is come to be iudged in a Church: this is the man that contemned y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> blessed
Sacrament of the Altar, and now is come to be condemned before the said Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
hanging ouer the Altar: this is the man, that like <hi>Lucifer,</hi> sate in the place
of Christ, vpon an Altar, to iudge others, and now is come before the Altar to bee
iudged himselfe. Thus he continued halfe an houre heaping vp a number of lies
together, beginning euery one with, <hi>This is the man,</hi> so lothsomly, that he made
euery man weary. When they had disgraded him, they stript him of his gowne,
&amp; put vpon him a poore yeoman Bedles gowne thrid-bare, and as ill-fauouredly
made as could be, and a Townsmans cap vpon his head, and so deliuered him to
the secular power: in this filthie gowne he was carried vnto prison.</p>
               <p>The Queene &amp; Bishops hauing kept the Archbishop now almost three yeares
in prison, seeing by no means they could preuaile with him all this while, to turn
him from his religion, they suborned certaine men which should, by intreaty, and
faire promises, or any other means, allure him to recantation: so the wily Papists
flocked about him, labouring to draw him from his former sentence to recantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
especially <hi>Henry Sidall,</hi> and Frier <hi>Iohn,</hi> a Spaniard, they shewed him how
acceptable it would be to the Kings &amp; Queene, and how gainfull it would be both
bodily &amp; spiritually, they added that the Councell &amp; Noble-men bare him good wil,
promising him both his life &amp; ancient dignity, saying the matter was but small,
the setting of his hand to a few words; but if hee refused, there was no hope of
pardon: for the Queene was purposed that shee would haue <hi>Cranmer</hi> a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
or else no <hi>Cranmer</hi> at all. By these and such like prouocations, they at last
w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nne him to subscribe: It may bee supposed that it was for hope of life and
better dayes to come: But it appeareth by a Letter of his to a Lawyer, that
the most cause why hee desired his life to bee delayed, was, that hee might
make an end of a Booke against <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> a Papist, which hee had
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:14787:166"/>
begun; but it is manifest that it was against his conscience: it pleased God that so
great vertues in this man should not be without some blemish; and that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> falshood
of the Pop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sh generation by this meanes might be the more euident, and that we
should haue the lesse confidence of our owne strength, presently this recantation
was put in Print and published, notwithstanding it was decréed that <hi>Cranmer</hi>
should be burned out of hand, and the Quéene commanded a funerall Sermon to
be made for him by Doctor <hi>Cole;</hi> and hauing his lesson giuen him, he went spéedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>Oxford</hi> to play his part. The morning before hee should bee executed <hi>Cole</hi>
gaue him 15 crownes to giue to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> poore. The Archbishop surmised whereabouts
they went, after the Spanish Frier came vnto him with a paper of Articles which
<hi>Cranmer</hi> should openly professe in his recantation before the people, desiring him
to write his name vnto it: then he prayed him to write a Copy of it, and kéepe it
with him, which he did, &amp; knowing wherunto their deuices tended, he put secretly
into his bosome his prayer with his exhortation written in another paper. <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
was brought from prison to S. <hi>Maries</hi> Church betwixt two Friers, which
mumbled certaine Psalmes in the stréets as they went: when they came vnto the
Church they sung <hi>Nunc dimittis:</hi> then they brought him to his standing, where
they left him, there he stood all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Sermon in a bare ragged gowne, &amp; ill-fauouredly
clothed with an old square cap, exposed to the contempt of all men. In this habite
when he had stood a good while vpon the stage, he turned vnto a pillar, &amp; knéeling
&amp; lifting vp his hands to heauen, he praied vnto God once or twice. After a while
<hi>Cole</hi> came &amp; began his Sermon, altogether to the disgrace of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> shewing
that he was the onely man that began this heresie &amp; schisme from the Catholique
Church, that he was the cause of the diuorce betwixt the Quéenes father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and that for these and other maine causes, the Quéene and Councell did
thinke fit that he should be burned, although he had recanted.</p>
               <p>At the end of his Sermon he brought many scriptures to comfort him, that such
as die in Gods faith, he will either abate y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fury of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> flame or else giue him strength
to abide it, he glorified God much in his conuersi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his worke, shewing what great meanes was vsed to conuert him, but none could
preuaile vntill God reclaimed him, saying; whilst he flowed in riches &amp; honor, he
was vnworthy of death; but lest he should carry with him no comfort, he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that immediatly after his death there should be Dirges, Masses, &amp;Funerals
executed in all the Churches in Oxford for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Sermon, lifted vp his hands &amp; eyes to heauen: the very shape of forrow
was liuely expressed in him, more then twenty times: he shed aboundant teares
from his fatherly face, but especially when he made his prayer before the people.
After <hi>Cole</hi> had done his Sermon, he had <hi>Cranmer</hi> performe his promise, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
your faith, that you may take away suspicion from men, that they may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnderstand
you a Catholique indéed.</p>
               <p>I wil do it said the Archbishop with a good will: then he desired y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> people to pray
for him, that God would forgiue him his sins: and one offence doth trouble me
more then all the rest, whereof in processe of my talke you shall heare; and after he
had made a very pithy praier with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> people, which you may sée in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> book at large,
then he said, euery man at the time of his death, desireth to giue some god exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
vnto others: so I pray God at this my departing, I may speake somwhat
whereby God may be glorified, &amp; you edified. His first exhortation was, that we
should not set our minds too much vpon this glozing world, but vpon God, &amp; the

saith, it is hard for a rich man to enter into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> kingdome of heauen. Secondly, S.
<hi>Iohn</hi> saith, he that hath this worlds goods, and shutteth his compassion vpon his
needy brother, how can he say he loueth God. Thirdly, Saint <hi>Iames</hi> biddeth
them weepe and howle for the miseries that shall come vpon you, your clothes be
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:14787:167"/>
moth-eaten, your gold and siluer cankred and rusty, and the rust shall witnesse a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainst
you, and consume you like fire: you hoord vp treasure of Gods indignation
against the last day. Let them that be rich ponder well these thrée sentences: for if
euer they had occasion to shew their charity, it is now, the poore beeing so many,
and victuals so deere.</p>
               <p>Now being I am come to the end of my life, whereupon hangeth my life past,
and my life to come, either to liue with my Maister Christ for euer in ioy, or else
for euer in paine with the Diuell: Therefore I will declare my faith vnto you
without dissembling.</p>
               <p>I beleeue all the Articles of the Créede, and all the Doctrine of Christ, his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
and Prophets in the new and old Testament; and now I come vnto the
great thing that so much troubled my conscience more then all that euer I did in
all my life; and that is in setting abroad a writing contrary to truth, which now
I renounce, as written with my hand, contrary to my heart, for feare of death;
and that is all such Billes and Papers which I haue written or signed with my
hand since my degradation; and because my hand writ contrary to my heart, it
shall be first burned. And as for the Pope I refuse him, as Christs enemy, and
Antichrist, with all his false Doctrine. And as for the Sacrament, I beléeue as I
haue taught in my Booke, and my Booke shall stand at the last day, before
the iudgement of God, when the Papisticall doctrine shall be ashamed to shewe
her face.</p>
               <p>It was a world to sée the Doctors beguiled of so great a hope, I thinke there
was neuer cruelty more notably deluded; and when he began to speake more of
the Sacrament, and of the Papacie, <hi>Cole</hi> cried to stop the Heretiques mouth:
then the Friers pulled him from his seate, and led him to the fire: then they cried
to him; What madnesse hath brought thee againe into this error, by which thou
wilt draw innumerable soules with thee into hell. Hee answered them not, but
directed his talke vnto the people: But the Spanish Barker raged, and foamed
almost out of his wits; and he and the other Spanish Frier began to exhort him
afresh, but all in vaine. When the fire began to burne neere him, he put his
right hand into the flame, which he held so stedfastly, that it was burned before
his body was touched, he abode the fire with such constancy, that he stood al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in one place without mouing of his members, with his eyes vpward, he
off repeated his vnworthy right hand, saying, <hi>Lord Iesus receiue my spirit,</hi> and
so gaue vp the Ghost.</p>

this day for Gods word, which we haue beene taught by the Apostolike Preachers
in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, whom you haue murthered because they preached the
truth, and they haue sealed their doctrine with their bloud, whom I will follow.
Then <hi>Bonner</hi> perswaded them not to stand to the litterall sense of the Scriptures,
but to vse the interpretation of the Fathers. Then <hi>Tims</hi> said, what haue you to
maintaine the reall presence of Christ in the Sacrament, but only the bare letter?
We haue (quoth <hi>Bonner</hi>) the Catholike Church: no, said he, the Popish Church

set forth in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, and therein they would continue as long as
they liued; they refused to be partakers of the Sacrament of the Altar, because it
was vsed contrary to Gods word and glorie; they said the Popes authoritie was
vsurped, and that he was an oppressor of Christs Church and Gospell, and that he
ought not to haue any authoritie in England, and that they vtterly abhorred the
Sea of Rome, for putting downe the booke of God, and setting vp the Babylonicall
Masse, with all the rest of Antichrists merchandise; and that after consecration
there remaineth in the Sacrament Bread and Wine as well as before; and that

Be it knowne vnto all to whom this our Certificate shall be feene, that whereas
vpon Saturday the thirteenth of Iune, sixteene of vs were condemned to dye, by
the Bishop of London, for the sincere truth of Christs verity, which truth hath bin
continually defaced from the beginning by the wicked aduersaries, as it is slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
now by the Diuell and his Imps, which constraineth vs to manifest our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe,
and the articles, wherefore we were condemned for auoyding the slanders
that might happen by occasion of the flanderous Sermon lately preached at Pauls
Crosse by Doctor <hi>Fecknam</hi> Deane of Paules, where he defamed vs to be of six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
sundry opinions.</p>
               <p>1 We beleeue by Baptisme we were made members of Christs Church, and
although wee erred for a time, yet the roote of Faith was preserued in vs by the
Holy Ghost, which maketh vs certaine of the same, and we doe and will persist by
Gods assistance vnto the end: And though the Minister were of the malignant
Church, yet he did not hurt vs, because he baptized vs in the name of the Father,
the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost; there was the word and the element; Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and Godmothers, renouncing for vs the Diuell and all his workes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
the Articles of the Christian Faith.</p>
               <p>2 There are but two Sacraments, Baptisme, and the Lords Supper, in
these are contained the two Testaments: the effect of the Law is Repentance, and
the effect of the Gospell is remission of sinnes.</p>
               <p>3 There is a visible Church wherein the word of God is preached, and the
Sacraments truely ministred: Uisible to the wicked world, although it bee not
credited, and by death of Saints confirmed: as in the time of <hi>Elias</hi> as well as
now.</p>
               <p>4 The Sea of Rome is the Sea of Antichrist: The Congregation of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
whereof the Pope is head vnder the Diuell.</p>
               <p>5 God is neither spiritually nor corporally in the Sacrament of the Altar, and
there is no other substance but bread and Wine.</p>
               <p>2 The Masse is not onely a prophanation of the Lords Supper, but a most
blasphemous Idoll.</p>
               <p>We affirmed to beleeue all that the Bishop or any could proue by Scriptures:
but he said he would not stand to proue it with hereticks, but said, they themselues
were the holy Church, and that we ought to beleeue them, or else to be cut off like
withered branches.</p>
               <p>When they were brought to Stratford the Bow they were deuided into two

of them tyed to a rope by two and two, and so lead in a rope through the stréetes to
<hi>Bonner.</hi> Now the Bishops and Councell perceiuing the number, and fearing to put
them to death, being so many together, least I some disturbance might rise vpon the

good or bad, that the purpose of God, which is by election, might stand, not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
workes, but by the grace of the Caller, <hi>The elder shall serue the yonger:
Iacob haue I loued, and Esau haue I hated.</hi> This proueth that Faith is before
Baptisme: For Circumcision was before Baptisme: And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> fetcheth
the proofe of Baptisme from <hi>Noes</hi> flood, saying: <hi>Whilst the Arke was a preparing
wherein but eight persons were saued by water, like as baptisme now saueth vs;
not in washing away the filth of the flesh, but in that there is a good conscience
consenting to good.</hi> But you said, if they be baptised with water, if they die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
yeares of discretion, they be all saued: the which S. <hi>Peter</hi> is cleane against,
vnlesse you grant that Children haue faith before they bee baptized; but what
consent of conscience haue Infants? you say they beléeue not before they bee

                  <p>The children are baptized in the God-fathers and God-mothers faith;
and that is the good conscience that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh of, and the Christning is
the kéeping of the Law that S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of, saying: <hi>Neither is Circumcision
or vncircumcision any thing, but the keeping of the Law is altogether; like as
Circumcision was the keeping of the old law, so is Baptisme the keeping of the

is nothing so; for <hi>Abraham</hi> beléeued God, and that was imputed vnto him for
righteousnesse: and this was before he was circumcised, so the children beléeue
before they be either circumcised or baptized, according to my first saying, <hi>Iacob

was counted vnto him for righteousnesse: and I am sure, if they had died before
they had either receiued circumcision or baptisme, concerning the outward déede,
they had béene saued: for Gods gifts and calling are such that hee cannot repent
him of; but by your saying he doth repent and change: for you say, kéeping of the

originall sinne. For if we be set as free by the death of Christ, as <hi>Adam</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his fall, I am sure <hi>Adam</hi> had no originall sinne before his fall. If wee bee so
frée now as hee was then, I maruell why Saint <hi>Paul</hi> complained thrice to God

                  </p>
                  <p>This proueth originall sinne, but not that it shall hurt Gods elect, but that his
grace is sufficient for his. But you say in one place it is not without baptisme,
and in another place you put it away quite by the death of Christ. And you haue
spoken truer then you be aware of: for all that beleeue in Christ are baptized in
his blood; and yet I say with <hi>Dauid</hi> in the 51 Psalme, <hi>I was borne in sinne, and
in sinne hath my mother conceiued me:</hi> but no such sinne as shall be imputed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I am borne of God by faith, as saith Saint <hi>Iohn:</hi> therefore I am blessed, as
saith the Prophet, because the Lord imputeth not my sinne: and not because I
haue no sinne; not of mine owne deseruing, but of his free mercy hee saueth vs.
Where is now your free-will? If we haue free-will, our saluation commeth of
our owne selues, and not of God, and his word. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>Euery good
and perfect gift commeth from the Father of light: of his owne will begat he vs.
For the winde bloweth where it listeth, and wee heare the sound thereof,</hi> saith

                     <pb n="339" facs="tcp:14787:176"/>
Euen so it is with euery one that is borne of God: For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith: <hi>It is
God that worketh the will and the deede,</hi> euen of his good will;
therefore our
owne will is nought at all, except it be to wickednesse.</p>
                  <p>After these and other Examinations, wherein there is no other materiall

that Christ died for her: I grant he died, but that hee died for thée, how canst thou
tell? She being troubled with this suggestion, they that were about her counsailed
her to follow the example of S. <hi>Paule,</hi> to be faithfully perswaded that Christ loued
her, and gaue himselfe for her: for S. <hi>Paule</hi> was perswaded that Christ loued him;
and her calling, and true beléefe, and knowledge of Gods word was a manifest to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of Gods loue towards her, and the operation of the spirit of God, in working
in her a loue and a desire to please God: by these perswasions and the comfortable
promises of Christ brought out of the Scripture, Sathan was put to flight, and she
comforted in Christ. When she came to the stake, she prayed to God most instantly

                  <hi>Awstoo</hi> being in the Bishops Chappell at Fulham, the Bishop asked him if hee
knew where he was; he answered in an Idoll Temple: and he said he receiued
the very body and bloud of Christ by faith in the Supper of the Lord, but not in the
Sacrament of the Altar: and his wife said, she beleeued that the Religion then v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in England was not according to Gods word, but false and corrupted, and that
they which did goe thereto did it more for feare of the law then otherwise; and she
said that she defied the Masse with all her heart, and that she would not come into
any Church wherein was Idols.</p>
               <p>As she was in the Bishops prison, by his procurement there was sent a stoute
Champion, as appeareth, about twelue of the clock at night, who suddenly opened
the doore, and with a knife drawne, fell vpon her to haue cut her throat; but shee
calling to God for helpe, he giuing a grunt, and fearing (belike) to commit so cruell
a deede, departed without any more hurt doing: the next night they made a great
rumbling like thunder ouer her head, to the intent to haue feared her out of her
wits, but God be thanked they missed of their purpose.</p>
               <p>The aforesaid <hi>Richard Roth</hi> affirmed that there was not the very body and
bloud of Christ in the Sacrament of the Altar, as it was then vsed, but that it was
a dead God, and that the Masse was detestable and contrary to Gods word and
will, from the which faith he would not decline. He said to <hi>Bonner,</hi> My Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

beleeue that in the Sacrament is really the body and bloud of Christ, and he would
not receiue the same, because he did beleeue that the body of Christ was onely in
heauen: and he said that <hi>Cranmer, Latimer, Ridley, Hooper,</hi> and generally all that
of late haue beene burned for hereticks, did preach truly the Gospel, and vpon their
preaching he grounded his faith, and he said that the saying of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the

he did so, but it was with a troubled conscience. He tolde the Bishop, that
which you call truth I beleeue to be heresie: he confessed that since his submission
he had preached against the Sacrament of the Altar, against auricular confession,
and other Sacraments, and he said, If euery haire of his head were a man, hee
would burne them all rather then goe from the truth: and he said, that the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
Lawes and the Masse were naught and abhominable, whereupon hee was
condemned.</p>

                  <hi>Richard Gibson</hi> was condemned for not comming vnto confession, and for not
receiuing the Sacraments of the Popish Masse, and for that he would not sweare
to answere vnto their intergatories laid against him: When sentence was read
against him, he boldly affirmed, that he was an enemy vnto them all in his minde,
though hee had kept it secret for feare of the Law, and hee said hee was blessed

they commanded me to tell them whom I willed to come to the English seruice, I
answered I would declare nothing, whereupon I was set in a racke of Iron three
houres, then they asked if I would tell them, I answered as before: the Sonday
after they examined me againe, and I answered them as before: then they bound
my two fore-fingers together, and put a small arrow betwixt them, and drew it
thorow so fast that the bloud followed, and the arrow brake, then they racked mee
twice, and so I was carried vnto my lodging againe. Ten dayes after the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
asked me if I would not confesse, I answered I had said as much as I wold:
fiue wéeks after he sent me vnto the high Priest, where I was greatly assaulted,

hath felt some sorrow, yet did I neuer see his patience broken.</p>
               <p>They all thrée answered <hi>Bonner,</hi> that the Church is grounded vpon the Apostles
and Prophets, Christ being the head corner stone, and in that Church there is the
true faith and religion of Christ: that there is but two Sacraments, Baptisme and
the Lords Supper; they said that they haue and will speake against the sacrifice of

vnto Gods word, and to giue themselues vnto prayer, with patience to beare
the crosse laid vpon them for their triall, and with boldnesse to confesse the truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the aduersaries, and with vndoubted hope to wait for the crowne of eternall
felicitie: and perceiuing his aduersaries to lie in wait for him, he got a Pedlers
packe, and trauelled from village to village, selling such things, and thereby got
somewhat to sustaine himselfe, his wife and children.</p>
               <p>At last M. <hi>Moyle</hi> a Iustice of Kent took him, and set him in the stocks a day and
a night; but when he had nothing against him, he discharged him, so he came vnto
Hadley, and tarried secretly a yeare with his wife and children, spending the time
in prayer and reading the Scriptures, and carding of wooll, which his wife did
spin; his wife also did begge bread and meat for her selfe and her children: thus
the Saints of God sustained hunger and miserie, whilest the Prophets of <hi>Baall</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in iollitie, and were costly pampered at <hi>Iesabels</hi> table: at last Parson <hi>Newall</hi>
perceiuing this, came with the officers in the night, and broke open fiue doors vpon
<hi>Yeoman,</hi> whom he found in bed with his wife and children: then he said he thought
he should finde a knaue and a whore together, and he would haue pluckt off the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,
but that <hi>Yeoman</hi> held them fast, and bade his wife arise and put on her clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes:
then he said, Nay parson, no whoore, but a man and his wife, according to
Gods ordinance, and blessed be God, for lawfull matrimony, and I defie the Pope
and all his popery: then they led him vnto the Cage, and set him in the stocks vntill
it was day. There was then in the Cage an old man, named <hi>Iohn Dale,</hi> who had sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

               <p>The said parson <hi>Newall</hi> caused them both to be carried vnto Bury Gaole, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

they were throwne into the lowest dungeon, where <hi>Iohn Dale</hi> died in prison, whose

boldly professed himselfe to be of the faith and religion that was set forth by King

himselfe to the holy Father the Pope, I defie him (quoth he) and all his dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable

               <p>That Baptisme is not administred at this present, as it was in the Apostles
time, because it is not in the English tongue, that in the Sacrament is not the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

or not, and whether the Bishop giueth Grace or not; that sinnes bee not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen
by absolution pronounced of a Priest, and that it is not necessary for a man
to confesse all his sinnes vnto a Priest: that he beleeued that the Bishops bee not
the Successors of the Apostles, for that they bee not called as they were, nor haue
not that Grace; that it is not the Pope but the Deuill that is supreme head of the
Church which you speake of; that he will not beleeue touching Purgatorie as
their Church doth; that Matrimony is no Sacrament, but a sacred order in signe
of an holy thing; that <hi>Martine Luther</hi> died a good Christian, whose doctrine and
life he did allow, for which he was condemned. He came vnto the stake very rich
in apparell, when the fire was kindled, first it tooke away a peece of his Beard,
whereat he nothing shranke, then it tooke his legges, and his stockings being Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Pecksall,</hi> of his owne authority tooke him from the stake, and sent him to

               <p>In the beginning of Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> Raigne, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the Lord

the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being at her house at Ashredge, Quéene <hi>Mary</hi> sent her two
Lords, and Sir <hi>Iohn Williams,</hi> afterward Lord <hi>Tame,</hi> with their retinue and
troupes of horsemen, to the number of two hundred and fifty, who found her sore
sick in her bed and very feeble and weake of body: and at ten of the clock at night
they rushed into her Chamber without leaue: whereat her Grace beeing not a

came from the Queene for her, and that she must be at London the seuenth day of

vnto her Maiesty, and that she was sorry she was not able to goe with them; they
answered, That their Commission was such, that we must needs bring you with

at nine of the clocke to goe with them, and on the next day morrow at the time
prescribed, they had her forth as she was, very faint and féeble, and in such case,
that she was ready to sound thrée or foure times betweene them. From Ashridge
all sicke in the Litter, she came vnto Redborne, where shee was garded all night:

Maister <hi>Dodds</hi> house at Mimmes, where also they remained all night, and from
thence to Highgate, where she being very sicke, tarried all night and next day.

and she asked him what his meaning was in that be vsed her so vncomfortably? so
she went into the prison and the doores were locked and boulted vpon her: then
she called to her Gentleman for her booke, desiring God in no wise to suffer her

to build her foundation vpon the sands, but vpon the rocke, whereby all blasts of
blustering windes should not hurt her: the Lords consulting about her straight
keeping, the Lord of Sussex said, My Lords, let vs take héed that we doe no more
then our Commission will warrant vs, whatsoeuer shall or may happen hereafter;
for shee was the King our Masters daughter, whereunto they all agreed and
departed.</p>
               <p>It would make a strange storie to recite what examinations and rackings of

               <p>When her officers had prouided her diet, and brought it to the vtter gate of the

vnto the Lord Chamberlain Constable of the Tower, and desired that her dyet
might be brought in by them, which were apppointed therevnto: Hee answered, I

sware that if they did either frowne or shrug at him, he would set them where they
should neither see Sunne nor Moone; but after they obtained their request of the
Councell with much adoe: Then he would haue had his seruants to haue serued

               <p>When she had lien a month in close prison, and was ill at ease, she requested the

very much adoe, that she might walke in the Queenes lodging, in the presence
of the Lord Chamberlaine and the Lord <hi>Shandoys,</hi> the Windows being shut,
wherewith she contented her selfe, and thanked him. Afterward she had libertie
for to walke in a little Garden, and the Doores and Gates being close shut:
during which time there vsed a mans Childe in the Tower many times to bring
her Grace Flowers, but certaine suspitious heads thinking to make some

answered euery day: then they asked him what the Lord of Deuonshire sent by him
vnto her Grace, he said; I will go know what he will giue me to cary her. This is
a crafty boy (quoth the L. <hi>Chamberlain</hi>) I pray you (quoth the boy) giue me the figs
you promised me: no (quoth he) thou shalt be whipped if thou come any more vnto
the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> or the Lord <hi>Courney,</hi> and the childs Father was commanded

to suffer the Boy to come no more vnto their chambers: the next day, as her Grace

I can bring you no more Flowers; whereat she smiled, perceiuing how the

               <p>The sixtéenth day of May she was remooued from the tower, where Sir <hi>Henrie

               <p>About this time her grace was requested by a secret friend to submit her selfe

be, with some stranger that she might goe out of the Realme with her portion:
then a Lord said, that the King should neuer haue quiet Common-wealth in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
except her head were striken from her shoulders: the Spaniards answered,
God forbid that their King and Master should consent to such a mischiefe. From
that day the Spaniards neuer left good perswasions vnto the King, that he should

might speak with some of the Councell. Not long after came to her <hi>Gardner</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Winchester, the Lord <hi>Arundel,</hi> the Lord of Shrewsbury, and Secretary <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
who with great humility humbled themselues vnto her Grace. My Lords,
quoth she, I am glad to sée you; for me thinks I haue bin kept a great while from
you desolatly alone, wherefore I would desire you to be a meane to the King and
Quéens Maiesties, that I may be deliuered from prison, wherein I haue bin kept a
long space.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Gardner</hi> knéeled down, and requested her to submit her selfe to the Quéen,
and then he doubted not but her Maiestie would be good vnto her: she answerd,
rather then she would do so she would lie in prison all the dayes of her life, adding,
that she craued no mercy but the law, if euer she did offend her Maiesty in thought,
word or déed; and in yeelding I should confesse my selfe to be an offendor, which I
neuer was towards her Maiesty, by occasion wherof the King and Quéen might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

               <p>The next day <hi>Gardner</hi> came again vnto her Grace, and knéeling down, declared

Nay, quoth <hi>Gardner,</hi> her Maiesty willed me to certifie you, that you must tell her

God to preserue her Maiestie, not in any wise doubting but that she should proue
her selfe as true and faithfull a subiect towards her Maiestie as euer did any,

your Grace) to you; why then, said the Queene, belike you will vnto others: no,
quoth she, I haue borne the burden, and must beare it: I humbly beseech your
Maiestie to haue a good opinion of me, and to thinke me to be your true subiect, not
only hitherto, but as long as life lasteth, and so they parted with a few comfortable
words in English, but what she said in Spanish God knoweth. It is thought that

               <p>Then there came vnto her house Maister <hi>Ierningham,</hi> and <hi>Norris</hi> Gentleman

Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was proclaimed Queene, with as many glad hearts of her sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,

which was the cheefe Disputer against <hi>Cranmer, Ridley,</hi> and <hi>Latimer.</hi> First,

It pleased the Queens most excellent Maiesty to haue a conuenient chosen num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the best learned of either part, to conferre together their opinions and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and thereby to come to some good and charitable agreement:</p>
               <p>For the Papists were appointed the Bishops of Winchester, Lichfield, Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
Carlile, Lincolne, Doctor <hi>Cote,</hi> Doctor <hi>Harpsfield,</hi> Doctor, <hi>Langdall,</hi> and
Doctor <hi>Chedsey.</hi>
               </p>

The matters which they should talk of follow:</p>
               <p>1 It is against the word of God, and the custome of the auncient Church, to
vse a tongue vnknowne to the people, in Common-prayer, and the administration
of the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>2 Euery Church hath authority to appoint, take away, &amp; change ceremonies,
and Ecclesiasticall Rites, so the same be vnto edification.</p>
               <p>3 It cannot be proued by the word of God that there is in the masse offered by
a sacrifice propitiatory for the quick and the dead.</p>
               <p>It was resolued by the Quéens Maiesty, with the aduice aforesaid, that it should
be in writing on both parts, and that the Bishops should first declare their mindes
touching the matters, with their reasons in writing; and they on the other part
should the same day declare their opinions in like manner, and each of them deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
their writings vnto the other to consider what were to be improued therin, and
the same also to declare in writing some other day: the parties of this conference
were to put and reade their assertions in the English tongue, before the Nobles
and States of the Realme, that thereupon in the Court of Parlament, consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
following, some lawes might be grounded.</p>
               <p>The first méeting was the last of March, in Westminster Church: the Lords
and others of the priuie Councell were present, and a great part of the Nobilitie:
the Bishop of Winchester and his Colleagues alleadged that they had mistake<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
that their reasons should be written, but they were readie to argue and dispute;
this séemed somwhat strange to the Councell, yet it was permitted, so Doctor
<hi>Cole</hi> Deane of Paules was appointed the vtterer of their mindes, who partly by
spéech, and partly by reading authorities written, and somtimes was informed by
his Colleagues what to say, made a declaration of their meanings and reasons to
the first proposition; which being ended, they were asked by the Councell if they
had any more to say, and they said no: so the other part was licensed to shew their
minde, which they exhibited in a booke written; which after a prayer made most
humbly vnto Almighty God for the induing them with the holy spirit, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
to stand to the doctrine of the Catholike Church, builded vpon the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
of the Prophets and Apostles: the effect of the protestation i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>We referre the whole iudgement of the controuersie vnto the holy Scriptures,
and the Catholike Church of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whose iudgement vnto vs ought to be most sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred;
notwithstanding by the Catholike Church we vnderstand not the Romish
Church, whereunto our aduersaries attribute such reuerence, but that Church
which S. <hi>Augustine</hi> and other fathers affirme ought to be sought in the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and which is gouerned and led by the spirit of Christ.</p>
               <p>It is against the word of God, and the custom of the primitiue Church, to vse a
tongue vnknowne vnto the people in the common prayers, and in administration
of the Sacraments: by the word of God wemeane the written word of God, or
Canonicall Scriptures; and by the custome of the primitiue Church, we meane
the order most generally vsed in the Church for fiue hundred years after Christ, in
which time liued <hi>Iustine, Ireneus, Tertullian, Cyprian, Basill, Chrysostome, Hierome,
Ambrose, Augustine, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This assertion hath two parts: first, that it is against the word of God; and
secondly, that it is against the vse of the primitiue Church. The first is proued by
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:14787:194"/>
Saint <hi>Paule</hi> in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. where he intreateth of this matter, <hi>ex professo,</hi> purposely:
and though some say that he there meaneth of preaching and not of prayer, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
by the exposition of the best writers, that he speaketh of prayer and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing,
and of all other publique actions which require any speach in the Church:
of prayer he saith, <hi>I will pray with my spirit, and with my vnderstanding:</hi> and of
thanksgiuing he saith, <hi>Thou giuest thanks wel, but the other is not edified, and how
can the vnlearned say Amen at thy giuing of thankes, when hee vnderstandeth not
what thou sayest?</hi> then he concludeth, <hi>that all things ought to be don to edification;</hi>
and he vseth the similitude of a Trumpet, <hi>If it giue an vncertaine sound who can
prepare to battell? so if thou speake with vnknowne tongues, you speake in the ayre,</hi>
that is, in vaine.</p>
               <p>In the old Testament all things belonging vnto publike prayers, benedictions,
thanksgiuings, and sacrifices were alwayes in their naturall tongue: if they did so
in the shaddowes of the law, much more ought we to doe the like.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Augustin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> in his fourth booke <hi>De doctrina Christiana,</hi> and the tenth Chapter,
saith, <hi>If they, for whose cause we speake, vnderstand not our speaking, there is no
cause why we should speake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The barbarous Heathen of all nations and sorts of men euer made their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and sacrifices to their gods in their mother tongue, which sheweth that it is the
very light and voyce of nature.</p>
               <p>Touching the second part of the assertion, that it is against the custome of the
primitiue Church: it is a matter so cléere, that the deniall of it must néeds procéede
either of great ignorance, or els of wilfull mallice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iustinus Martyr, Apol.</hi> 2. describeth the order of the primitiue Church, saying,
<hi>Vpon the Sonday, assemblies are made both of the Citizens and Countrey-men,
where the writings of the Apostles and Prophets are read as much as may be: when
the Reader doth cease, the head Minister maketh an exhortation to follow honest
things, then we rise altogether, and offer prayers, then bread, wine, and water are
brought forth, then the head Minister offereth prayer and thanksgiuing as much as
he can, and the people say Amen.</hi> He liued about the yeare 160. This declareth
plainly that the Scriptures were read, and prayers and administration of the
Lords Supper were done in a tongue vnderstood.</p>
               <p>Both the Lyturgies of <hi>Basill</hi> in <hi>Chrysostom</hi> declare that the people were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to answer to the prayer of the Minister, sometime Amen, somtime Lord haue
mercy vpon vs, somtime With thy spirit and truth we haue our hearts lifted vp
vnto the Lord, which they could not haue done if they had not vnderstood the long
the prayers were said in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Basilius Epist.</hi> 63. saith, <hi>That their Psalmes which they sing, being diuided into
two parts, they sing by course together, one beginning the song, and the rest fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ambrose</hi> vpon the fourtéenth of the first to the Corinthians, saith. <hi>This is that S.
Paule saith, Because he that speaketh in an vnknowne tongue speaketh to God, for
he knoweth all things, but men know not, therfore there is no profit of these things;</hi>
and further he saith, <hi>The vnlearned hearing that which hee vnderstandeth not, hee
knoweth not the end of the prayer to say Amen.</hi> And againe he saith, <hi>If an Infidell
or one vnlearned come in, if he heare in a language which he vnderstandeth God to
be praised and Christ to be worshipped, he seeth perfectly that the Religion is true,
nothing to be done colourably nor in darkenes as amongst the heathen, whose
eies are blinded, they not perceiuing themselues to be deluded with diuers vanities,
for all falshood speaketh darknes, and sheweth false things for true, therefore with
vs nothing is done couertly, for if there be none that he can vnderstand he may say
there is some deceit, because they are ashamed to open it:</hi> further, thus he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
<hi>Let all things be done to edifying: this thing ought chiefly to be labored for,
that the vnlearned might profit, lest any part of the body should be darke through
ignorance:</hi> and further he saith, <hi>He that speaketh in an vnknowne tongue, and hath
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:14787:195"/>
no interpreter, let him pray secretly to God, which heareth all dumb things, for in
the Church he ought to speake that which may profit all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And S. <hi>Hierom</hi> vpon that place of <hi>Paul, Quomodo qui supplet locum idiotae,</hi> and
vpon other places vseth the very same arguments that S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> did; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> vpon 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. vseth the like arguments, and <hi>Dionysius, Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
and S. <hi>Augustine</hi> agrée in the same, and <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Emperour, who liued 527.
yeares after Christ, made a Constitution that all Bishops and Priests should ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate
their holy oblations and prayers, not speaking low, but with a loude voice,
that the mindes of the hearers may be stirred vp with greater deuotion, for so saith
the Apostle in the first to the Corinthians, saying, <hi>If we only blesse and giue thanks
in the spirit, how doth he that occupieth the place of the vnlearned say Amen?
Thou verily giuest thanks well, but the other is not edified:</hi> And in his Epistle to
the Romans he saith, <hi>With the heart a man beleeueth vnto righteousnes, and with
the mouth confession is made vnto saluation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When this was ended, certaine of the Bishops began to say contrary vnto their
former answer, and that they had much more to say vnto this matter, whereupon it
was agreed that vpon the Monday following the Bishoppes should bring their
mindes in writing vnto the second assertion, and to the last also, if they could, and
that they should first reade the same; and that the other part likewise should bring
theirs, and being read each of them shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and that in the meane time the Bishops should put into writing all that Doctor
<hi>Cole</hi> had that day vttered, and whatsoeuer they could more thinke of for the same,
and that they should send it vnto the other partie, and receiue that which they had
written.</p>
               <p>At which day the Bishops were concluded to reade that which they had to say
to the first question, and would not procéede then vnto the rest; and after they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

because they should reade their writings, first saying that if the aduersaries
should end the talke, then should the veritie on our sides not be so well marked, for
they should depart speaking last, with the reioycing triumph of the people, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

as hath not bin séene in such an honourable assembly, whereby the godly and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
purpose of the Quéens Maiestie was made frustrate; the Bishops of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester
and Lincolne were committed vnto the Tower, and the rest were bound
daily to make personall appearance before the Councell, and not to depart the City
vntil further order was taken for their comtempt, and <hi>Bonner</hi> about the same time

               <p>About this time was a Parliament holden at Westminster, wherein a great
many of the Papists and Protestants were imployed, the one to retaine still, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to impugne the doctrine established in Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> time. Amongst others,
the words of Doctor <hi>Story,</hi> the stout champion of the Pope in the Parlament house,
are worthy to be knowne of posterity.</p>
               <p>He said, whereas he was much complained of to haue beene a great setter forth
of such Religion, orders, and procéedings, as of Quéen <hi>Mary</hi> were set forth in this
Realme: he confessed it to be true, and protested that he therein had done nothing
but what his conscience did leade him vnto, and his Commission commanded him,
and that he was no lesse readie now to doe the like, and more, if the Quéens Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:14787:195"/>
would authorize him therevnto: and hee said hee was sorie for nothing
but that hee had done no more then hee had done, and that they had not beene
more seuere in executing those lawes, wherein there was no default in him,
but in them, whom hee both oft and earnestly exhorted vnto the same, beeing
not a little greeued with them, for that they laboured onely vpon the yong and
little springs and twigges, whereas they should haue striken at the roote, &amp; cleane
haue rooted it out: and he said that he was once at the burning of an herewigge at
Uxbridge, meaning Maister <hi>Denley,</hi> where he tossed a Fagget at his face, as hee
was singing of Psalmes, and set a bush of thornes vnder his feete, and he named
Sir <hi>Philip Hobby,</hi> and another Knight in Kent, with such other of the richer and
higher degree, whom his Councell was to pluck at, wherein if they had followed
my aduice they had done wisely.</p>
               <p>In this Parliament through the goodnes of the Lord the true cause of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,

               <p>The Franciscan Fryers had gotten such estimation, that they were counted
GODS Kinsmen: they onely had the handling of the Gospell, they tooke out
heere and there a peece, and mixt it with lies, false miracles and dreames of
Purgatory: they kept the people more in feare of their Commaundements then
of Gods: that Towne was counted vnhappy where one of their Monasteries
was not néere: men thought to weare their apparell, or of their colour, was good
against the Ague, and other diseases, and for one to be burned in their habit, was
the right way to heauen. <hi>Longolius</hi> was burned in their habit, and so was <hi>Carpi</hi>

Mans folly could not be content with Christ onely, the diuine iudgement suffered
them to fal into a Sea of Ceremonies and superstitions, that except Christ had bin

               <p>By the Papists Tradition, the Soule for euerie deadly sinne is to abide seuen
yeares in Purgatorie: <hi>Moses</hi> ordained many Sacrifices for the sinnes of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
but none for them in Purgatorie; he chideth for weeping for the dead: It
is deuised onely to deceiue the people with Trentals and Quarentals, and other
foolish Inuentions, full of Couetousnesse: The Scripture biddeth vs remember
the poore that be aliue, the Papists bidde vs bring hither for the Soules of your

The places of Scripture that they ground Purgatorie vpon, are the fift of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew:
Agree with thine Aduersarie by the way, least thou be cast into Prison, &amp;c.</hi>
And in the 18. of <hi>Mathew; Hee that owed thee tenne thousand Talents, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered

Therefore we must be purged with Purgatorie before we can come there. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas

And in his Booke of Motiues he calleth these Martyrs; to wit, the Earle of
Northumberland, Doctor <hi>Story, Felton,</hi> the <hi>Nortons,</hi> M. <hi>Woodhouse,</hi> M. <hi>Plumtree,</hi>
and so many hundreds of the Northerne men.</p>
               <p>The said <hi>Nortons</hi> were <hi>Thomas Norton</hi> and <hi>Christopher Norton</hi> of Yorkeshire,
and they were hanged, beheaded, and quartered for Treason, for the late Rebellion
in the North.</p>
               <p>The said <hi>Felton</hi> was one <hi>Iohn Felton,</hi> which this yeare was drawne from
Newgate to <hi>Paules</hi> Churchyard, and hanged before the Bishops Pallace Gate,
cut downe aliue, bowelled, and quartered, for hanging a Bull from the Pope for
the Excommunicating of the Queene, at the Gate of the Bishop of Londons
Pallace.</p>
               <p>And the afore-mentioned Doctor <hi>Story</hi> was that cruell <hi>Story</hi> that burned so
manie in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time: who the first of Iune, this yeare 1571. was
drawne from the Tower of London to Tyburne, and there hanged and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
               <p>And in his seuenth Booke, <hi>page</hi> 734. he sayth, The fulnesse of the Apostolike
Power hath declared the said <hi>Elizabeth</hi> an Hereticke, and a fauourer of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes,
and that such as adhere vnto her, haue incurred the Sentence of <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma:</hi>
And that she is depriued of her Right of her Kingdome, and of all her Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
Dignitie, and Priuiledge, and that the Nobles, People, and Subiects of
the Realme, and all others that haue made Oath vnto her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are assoyled for euer
from such Oath, and all dutie of Allegeance, Fidelitie, and Obedience, by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of the Popes Sentence, whereby he hath depriued her of her Kingdome,
and forbidden all the Nobles, People, and Subiects, and others aforesaid, that
they be not so bold to obey her or her Lawes, and whosoeuer doth otherwise, hee
hath bound with like Sentence of Curse.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Bristow</hi> in his sixt Motiue, fol. 31. They miserably forget themselues, who
feare not the Excommunications of <hi>Pius</hi> the fift, in whom Christ himselfe hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and excommunicated, with as great power as S. <hi>Paul</hi> excommunicated: and
Christ hath done Miracles by him, euen as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did Miracles.</p>
               <p>And in his 40. Motiue he sayth: When the Pope doth duly discharge vs from
subiection, and the Prince offender from Dominion, he doth it with such griefe of
heart, as if a man should cut off from his bodie, to saue the wholesome most princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall,
but rotten part thereof.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Sanders, lib. 7. fol.</hi> 744. he calleth <hi>Felton</hi> an honorable Martyr; for he was
led with the loue and zeale of the Catholike Faith: when hee saw that the despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
health of his Country could not be restored but by some most bitter medicine,
would not suffer the sentence of the Pope should be hidden from his Countrymen:
And there he calleth Doctor <hi>Story</hi> a noble Martyr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saying: When he was arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of high Treason, for conspiring with certaine of Antwarpe against the Quéene,
attempting to change the schismaticall Religion, which now raigneth in England,
vnto the Catholike Religion; being brought vnto the Barre, he onely pleaded vnto
the Iurisdiction of the Court, denying that the English Iudges had any power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
him, being no Subiect to the English Queene, but rather to the King Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like;
and hee expounds his meaning to be, because hee very well knew, that the

created by her, or adhering vnto her, could be acknowledged by him, least himselfe
also should be bound with the same Curse.</p>
               <p>And further, there were many Seminarie Priests, which laboured by all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasions
that might be to iustifie the foresaid Excommunication of Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> and

though vpon that condition he might haue bin discharged: he would not pray in

fault therein he should be resolued; O (quoth he) you and I be not of one faith,

               <p>He confessed that he was acquainted by his brother <hi>Thomas Throgmorton</hi> with

had prepared the forces, but there wanted money and assistance of the Catholiques

was a Protestant, they stabbed him that came to open the Gate, then they entred
the Admirals Chamber: one thrust him through the body, and striketh him on the
head; another shot him thorough with a Pistoll, another wounded him in the legs,
and euery one of them giue him a blow: then the Duke of Guise commanded them
to cast him to him out of the Widdow, then the Duke spurned him with his foote,
and going into the stréete, said; Courage Companions, we haue begunne happily,

head vnto the King, and Queen his Mother, who sent it imbalmed vnto the Pope,
and the Cardinall of Lorraine: for assurance of the death of their Capitall enemy,
one cut off his head, another his priuy members, and three daies they dragged his

vnto himself amongst his owne Subiects, the sur-name of Great, whose life and
actions,<note place="margin">Ed: Grimston. An: Christi. 1589.</note> future ages may reade with admiration, was likewise trayterously mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by the disloyall and vngodly practises of the Papists.</p>
               <p>A Parliament being holden at Paris, haning disanulled the Buls of Cardinall
<hi>Caietans</hi> Legation, and other Bulls come from Rome the first of March, together
with their procéedings, excommunications, and fulminations, made by <hi>Marcellin
Landriano,</hi> tearming himselfe the Popes <hi>Nuntio:</hi> The said Bulls, and all their
procéedings an edicts being burnt in the Market place, which contained a pardon
of that most cruell paracide on <hi>Henry</hi> the third lately murthered: the King was
first therefore excommunicated by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 4. of that name. Afterward
the Iesuits vnderstanding that the King did purpose something against them, for
the cruell murder committed on the person of the late King, and for other their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
and deuillish practises daily intended and contriued, the Deuill stirres vp
another of his deerely beloued Sonnes to murder his Maiestie on this manner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>On Friday, the day after the Quéenes Coronation, the King being aduertised
of some omninous prediction, he went into his Chamber and fell on his knees and
prayed: and thus he did thrée times, in the end he went and walked in the Gallery
vntill dinner time. After dinner many Noble-men came into his Chamber, and
began to tell some tales to put him out of his melancholly humor, and to make him
laugh: hauing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the end he said: <hi>We haue laughed enough for Fryday, we may well weep on
Sunday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Héereupon he sent to the Arcenall at foure of the clocke; whereupon, they say
that the Duke of Uendosme told him that he had beene warned to beware of the
foureteenth day; yet making no account thereof, hee went downe into the Court,
whereas a man of a meane condition detained him a quarter of an houre, then hee
went into his Caroch, by the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> (who sat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

horsebacke, hauing commaunded <hi>Mounsier de Vitry,</hi> and the rest of his Guard to

Being betwixt the draw-bridge and the poole, this miserable wretch, who watched
his opportunity, drew néere vnto the Caroch on the right side, thinking his Maiesty
had béene there; but seeing he was on the left hand, and hearing them commaund
the Coachman to go on, he went the néerest way by the narrow lanes, and met with
his Maiesty in the stréet called Ferroneire, neere vnto S. Innocents Church, wher
staying to make way for a Cart to passe, the King leaned downe on the one side to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

Duke of <hi>Montbazon</hi> turned towards them, and one of the footmen was busie tying

the knife entring betweene the fift and sixt rib, it cut asunder the veine leading vnto

murderer from killing presently, yet in the end hee was conuaied to the house of
Retz.</p>
               <p>The King was carried backe vnto the Louure, vpon the way they met with the
Dolphin, who went to take the ayre, but they caused him to returne, and be cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>In that these Papisticall and trayterous attempts, tooke effect vnto the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of these two French Kings, when the Lord of his infinite goodnesse still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
Quéene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and our now dread Soueraigne King <hi>Iames</hi> from so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and from more dangerous practises: It may certainly be concluded, that if they
had no worse feared the Papists then they did, and put their trust in God as wel as
they, and had according to their example purely purged their Realmes from Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
the sure prouidence of God would haue beene as sure their Castle, strong hold,
