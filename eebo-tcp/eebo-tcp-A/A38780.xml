            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Many have promiſed well, and God gaue them golden opportunities to make thimſelves and the Nation glorious; but their ſelf-ends deceived them, and they fell into contempt, becauſe their minds was not fixed on juſt things to the glory of God and good of the whole Nation. For the Nation now are not ignorant as they were in the

was diſpleaſed with the people, and bids them tell him wherein he had wronged them, and tells them a ſtory of the excellency of their former Judges, and that they had highly ſinned in asking a King, and threatneth them to the purpoſe; but for all that they were for King-ſhip, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Samuel</hi> who is he that ſaith <hi>Saul</hi> ſhall not reign, bring him forth that we may put him to death, <hi>1 Sam. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12. 1 Sam. 12.</hi> then ſeeing that <hi>Samuel</hi> is angry with <hi>Saul</hi> that be could not pleaſe him at all, and whatſoever <hi>Saul</hi> did he found fault with it; and he laid ſnares for him about the ſacrifice, though indeed it ſeems <hi>Samuel</hi> was in the fault, for he came not according to his promiſe; yet he came as ſoon as <hi>Saul</hi> had ſacrificed, and then he tells him that he had broke the Commandement, and that God would have another to be King, <hi>1 Sam. 13.</hi> after that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> ſend <hi>Saul</hi> againſt <hi>Amalek:</hi> and commanded him to do ſuch a thing that <hi>Saul</hi> could not do, and then he Pronounceth judgement againſt <hi>Saul</hi> and came no more at him, <hi>1 Sam. 15.</hi> but went and anointed <hi>David</hi> to be King of <hi>Iſrael, 1 Sam. 16.</hi> and after <hi>Samuel</hi> died, his Ghoſt roſe from the Earth to diſcourage <hi>Saul,</hi> by telling him of his death, and of his ſons death, <hi>1 Sam. 28. 15, 19.</hi> here we ſee what power ſelf-intereſt hath ever good men; therefore he that can deny himſelf is higher then an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, for <hi>Lucifer</hi> fell through <hi>Ambition,</hi> and that a Witch had power to raiſe <hi>Samuel</hi> is a great diſhonour to him, &amp; a terrour to me; and ſhoweth that ſelf-intereſt is to be abhorred; <hi>Eli</hi> was free from it for he ſubmited to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of God, when it put a period to his time of proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>1 Tam 3. 18.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y laſt Book printed <hi>May</hi> 1659. ſheweth you the Kingdom of Chriſt in part; but now through Chriſt's aſſiſtance, I ſhall ſhew you further; and to give you a hint of what is contained in the ſaid book, called <hi>A Rule from Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Ye have <hi>page</hi> 1. to pag. 26. the Introduction, wherein is ſhewed the Deſcent of our Nation; the noble Actions of our Predeceſſors, with their Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings at ſeveral times for their ſin; and a view of our ancient Propheſies that foretels the trouble and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of our KING, Nobles, and Royal party, with a promiſe of great Glory to them at laſt, and an Aſſurance of peace for Ever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, From page 26. to pag. 45. ye have the Kingdom of Chriſt ſhewed; though indeed not ſo fully and ſo clear as I had done, if time had permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for when the combuſtion was among us, by the Armies throwing down one Government to ſet up another, it was in my mind ſuddenly afore they run into errour, and to prevent it, to ſhew them a better Government then they knew before, even a Government of Chriſt's own Inſtitution; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haſtned and was brief, having not time enough to clear the matter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:44823:6"/>
Thirdly, <hi>Page</hi> 45. Ye have a threatning of our Army, if that they would not ſuddenly ſtand up for this <hi>Good Old Cauſe</hi> (namely the Kingdom of Chriſt) and ſet it up; elſe as ſtout as they were, they ſhould fall and come to nothing; and their Parliament you know, ſought divers wayes their ruine ſince that time; and they have been divided; ſo that now they had need look upon my words, leſt they repent too late, as their Parliament did once, yea twice now, and knew not how to help it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, (page 46. and page 47.) Ye have a ſpeech to the Long Parliament, to tell them that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their endeavour to ſet up themſelves, their General ſhould diſſolve them; and I bad them beware of <hi>Jehu;</hi> (for ſo I called him:) and though they us'd all their craft againſt him; yet I ſaid he ſhould prevail: and I told them that the Army had a Deſign they knew not of; and ſhewed them that they had no way to make themſelves happy, but ſpeedily while they had time, to make their peace with CHARLS STUART; and I gave them a Viſion I had 1634. to aſſure them, if they ſought it, they might have had peace; as you ſee all along, if you read to the end of the ſaid book; I ſay you may diſcern (if you read from page 46. to page 60. of that book) how far thoſe words of my penning have been fulfilled upon the Army and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Thus ye have the Contents of the ſaid book.</p>
            <p>Now it is true, that it diſpleaſeth ſome of the Kings party: the reaſon is, becauſe they did not fully underſtand it; and it is left dark in ſome
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44823:6"/>

               </gap>  KING. It is true, there is none above the KIN<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> namely <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt. We read that <hi>Iſrael</hi> had two Kings at one time, and the weaker was above the ſtronger; ſo that the ſtronger obeyed the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: which thing was a type of Chriſt's Kingdome; for King <hi>David</hi> being old and weak, cauſed <hi>Solomon</hi> to be made King long before he died: and King <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſat on the Throne, but he obeyed King <hi>David</hi> all the time: (and is it not ſo with the Pope and the Emperor?) Here was two Kings at one time, the Father and the Son; yet no ſtriving as you ſee 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 28. &amp; 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.</p>
            <p>But Chriſts intention is that King <hi>Charls</hi> which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſhall not only Reign in his ſeed according as our former Kings did, but ſhall alſo Reign above his Seed, he being raiſed in Name, Spirit, and Power to Reign as chief, having a perfect body prepared and choſen of God for him: that perſonally from time to time hereafter he might be above our Kings to controule them (inſtead of a high Conſtable of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> and to be a King of Kings for ever to keep the peace between the King and people.</p>
            <p>The Gods of the Gentiles to gratifie their worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers would fain have done ſuch a thing; that is, to immortalize them and make them to have a name and power on Earth for ever; ſo that from <hi>Iulius Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> all the Emperours were called <hi>Ceſars</hi> for a long time; and ſo the <hi>Pharao</hi>'s and others had ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of their Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alas, none of their Gods were able to do it; their Gods knew ſuch a thing was to

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> do it, and none elſe.</p>
            <p>Again the Royal party cannot abide to hear of a poor Almes-man to be King, and that he ſhould have but two hundred a year, they thinking I would have young King <hi>Charls Stuart</hi> to have no more, and therein is their great miſtake, for I would have young <hi>Charls</hi> and his Seed after him to have all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Crown; and that he which perſonates old King <hi>Charls</hi> ſhould have but two hundred a year; the reaſons why he ſhould be firſt a poor man, and after his inſtallment ſhould have no more means, is becauſe old King <hi>Charls</hi> was made poor in this world before he ſuffered, and moſt rich in Faith; having no Money ſave a bare allowance to ſubſiſt, though he was the ſupream Lord.</p>
            <p>Therefore he that perſonates him (in whom he is to live again) muſt be like unto him in Graces and outward ſtate, having but ſmal allowance yet enough to live: for I believe old King <hi>Charls</hi> was never better ſatisfied in this World, then he was when God took from him his temporal Pomp and Glory, and gave him a view by Contemplation of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Glory in the World to come, ſo that I ſay, ſuch a body fitted and choſen of God, and made ſo as he himſelf was made at laſt, is moſt meet for him, and is moſt profitable for the King his Son and for the Nation, to ſtand in the gap and ſtop the bloody Iſſue, a diſeaſe that <hi>England</hi> is too much ſubject too.</p>
            <p>The want of this Government of Chriſt (for ſo I call it in my book) brought this Kingdome many
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44823:7"/>
times into deſolation, for when the Court grew cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt yet ſo inſolent and prove that it thought none could or durſt Controul it; then ſtarts up one great popular Earl or other that watcheth for an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity and under the notion of a high Conſtable of <hi>England</hi> he heads the people, and Wars againſt the Court, ſo that the cure proved alwaies worſe then the diſeaſe, becauſe it was done by the Sword: and as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 52. They that take the Sword ſhall periſh with the Sword; therefore in Chriſts Kingdome every one muſt obſerve his rule: there muſt be a law for the Kings to walk by, as well as for the people; and they that are weakeſt, loweſt, and leaſt in the worlds account <hi>(Luke</hi> 16. 15. <hi>James</hi> 2. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 4.) hath Chriſt choſen to be the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Judges thereof, yea to perſonate old KING <hi>Charls</hi> and to be over the Kings of the world as ye have it more at large ſet out in the aboveſaid book called a rule from Heaven.</p>
            <p>And there muſt be in Chriſts Kingdome a perfect Law made for all occaſion, and according to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, a Law that needeth not to be altered every foot, but it muſt be ſuch a Law as nothing ſhall be added to it, or taken from it; that every one may know his rule and the puniſhment of his errour, and the ſaid Law muſt be truly and ſpeedily executed upon the offenders, elſe it profiteth nothing, for ſo long as our Law is imperfect, and that our Parliaments are alwaies making and nulling Laws, we ſhall never be quiet or come to reſt according to Gods promiſe which ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 9. there is a reſt for the people of God, and the Lord is well pleaſed for his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe

Lands and ſtates in rich mens hands, and they could not deny it? but told them in a bravado they would ſpend in law thouſands before they ſhould get it: and the poor knowing aforehand the courſe of the law was content to looſe their Right, and it was wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in them ſo to do; ſeeing their going to law will not relieve them, being ſure it will make their condition worſe; what a ſad thing is it for men to live under ſuch a law, let all good juſt reaſonable men judge, ſuch doings are not to be in Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>Again a man ſteals a Horſe, and by the laws of <hi>England</hi> he muſt die for it; what reaſon is for that? is a mans life for whom Chriſt died of leſs value with you, then a Horſe or ſome wordly Lomber which periſheth with the uſing; and weighs ſuch as ſet their hearts upon them down to hell; I muſt tell you and that from the word of God, that all the thieves that have been put to death for only thie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (except they were men ſtealers) have been mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and that their Blood lyeth heavily upon this Nation; and ſpecially upon the Royal Family as one of the greateſt cauſe of Gods wrath againſt them; I remember that one told me five and twenty years ago, that a thief being to be executed, deſired be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death to have <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 43. Sung, which begun thus, <hi>Judge and revenge my cauſe O Lord;</hi> but the Miniſter no doubt knowing that by Gods law, <hi>Exo.</hi> 22. 1, 2, 3, 4, that he ought not to have died for his theft, would not ſuffer him to ſing that <hi>Pſalm;</hi> yet alas, how ſore hath God Judged the thieves Cauſe upon this Nation, and ſpecially the King and Nobles, it is too evidently written in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Characters of Blood;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44823:8"/>
and verily it is right that God ſhould do it, for it is a great contempt againſt God and his law, for men to attempt and to leave Gods law, and to make a bloody law for thieves, contrary to Gods law; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they have the law of God extant to judge thieves, what is it? but that men would have themſelves ſeen to be wiſer then God.</p>
            <p>The law of God <hi>(Exod.</hi> 22. 1, 2, 3, 4.) in the caſe of theft, proves that the looſer, ſhall be no looſer by by a thief, but that in caſe he find him with the goods in his hands; the thief muſt reſtore it at leaſt double, and if he hath not to pay, he is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſold for his theft.</p>
            <p>But by the laws of <hi>England,</hi> a man may put a poor man into priſon upon ſuſpition, and keep him in to his undoing a quarter of a year for nothing, and the poor man can have no reliefe by law, for the wrong done to him in ſuch a caſe; again, if a man take a great thief that ſtole much from him and put him in priſon, he ſhall get nothing at laſt but his life, a ſad recompence to become a Murderer, to looſe his ſoul after his goods; and though the true man and thief this ſuffer, the receivers, thieve-takers, Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and the Whore-houſes get by it, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and Whore-houſes the Nurſeries of thieves, to increaſe and multiply them exceedingly; now if the law of God were put in execution there would not be ſo many thieves.</p>
            <p>Eor God ſaith <hi>Fxod:</hi> 21. 15, 16, 17: <hi>He that ſmiteth his Father or his Mother ſhall be ſurely put to death, and he that ſtealeth a man and ſelleth him, or if he be found in his hand he ſhall ſurely be put to death, &amp; he that curſeth</hi>

               <hi>or revileth his father or mother ſhall ſurely be put to death;</hi> for all wickedneſs floweth from diſobedience to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; and a wicked father commonly gives good councel to his ſon, and will rejoyce to ſee him doe well: it is naturally ſo with all men, good or bad; but in <hi>London</hi> and other great Towns, the moſt part of children are very rebellious, eſpecially poor mens children are diſobedient, running away from their parents, becauſe they ſee nothing but hunger at home, and that charity is cold: then the Thieves takes them up, and feeds them with good Victuals, telling them, that if they will forſake their parents and follow them, they will teach them a trade to get good Chear; and they will make them ſwear, that they will forſake their parents, and not work but ſteal for their living, and not confeſs it: and when they have tried them a while, if they find that a child hath any principle of grace remaining, ſo that they dare not truſt him, then will they make uſe of him and force him upon ſome great deſign, and after ſell him away to Sea, leſt being taken, he ſhould confeſs all: In theſe Caſes, thieves are men-ſtealers, and by the law of God they ought to die for it; and the children alſo that abuſe their parents by ſmiting and reviling them, ought to die for it.</p>
            <p>Therefore if you would have the wicked rooted out of the Land, you muſt deſtroy the foreſaid men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtealing-thieves, and be charitable to the poor, by helping them to bring up their children in the fear of God; and thoſe that continue ſtubborn, rebelling and abuſing their parents, muſt be made examples, that the reſt may fear: and for the reſt of the thieves
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44823:10"/>
make them to reſtore, according to <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 1, 2, 3, 4. and if they have not to ſatisfie the owners, let them be ſold away to the Merchants for their theft, and ſhipt ſuddenly whether they will or no; for a thief hath loſt his liberty to chooſe, and by the law of God ought to be ſold away for a ſlave: and if they were ſo puniſhed, it would terrifie and reſtrain them more then hanging; for a thief will rather chuſe to die, then be ſo bound to work; it's their nature to be ſo minded always.</p>
            <p>All the Thieves may be divided into three Sorts: Firſt, the covetous thief, that hath enough, yet will ſteal to encreaſe his riches; he is worthy to make a five-fold reſtitution. 2ly, there is a thief that will not work, but makes a trade of ſtealing, yet lays up lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing; make him reſtore double: or in caſe he hath not to doe it, he muſt be ſold. Thirdly, there is a thief that is not able to work, or that would work and can get none, nor any relief, is forced to ſteal or ſtarve; I know no reaſon why he ſhould ſuffer, but that ye ſhould ſay to him, as <hi>Juda</hi> ſaid to <hi>Tamar,</hi> Gen. 38. 26. thou haſt been more righteous then we, becauſe thou waſt not <hi>relieved</hi> thou didſt <hi>ſteal;</hi> and you ought to make reſtitution for him, and put him in a way to live that his ſoul may bleſſe you.</p>
            <p>And put no thieves in Priſon, but as ſoon as they are taken, judge them; and ſo clear the innocent, and make the guilty to reſtore, or ſell him away to Sea ſpeedily: and this every Juſtice of the Peace may doe immediately; for the Lord ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 22. <hi>That the people are ſpoiled in priſon-houſes;</hi> there they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44823:11"/>
learn all villany, and are made ten times worſe then they were when they came in; for judgement muſt be ſpedily executed becauſe delays encourageth men to do evil, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 11. And you ſee <hi>(Lev.</hi> 24. 11, 12, 13, 14. 15, 16. <hi>Num.</hi> 15. 32, 33, 34, 35, 36.) <hi>Iſrael</hi> at firſt put none in priſon, but thoſe offenders they had not a Law in readineſs;e to judge them; and as ſoon as God by <hi>Moſes</hi> gave them a precept for it, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately executed.</p>
            <p>Now to conclude; If you ſeverely (according to God's law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 15, 16, 17.) puniſh diſobedient children and men-ſtealers, it will produce theſe three Effects following.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It will make parents careful and diligent to ſave their children by bringing them up always in fear, and not cocker them up in wantonneſs, and ſuffer them to be bold and impudent with them; but to fear and reverence them, leſt they ſhould come to ſuffer for it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It would make children tremble and give reſpect to their parents, when they ſee the law thus executed upon diſobedient children.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It will make ſuch as draw Children away from their obedience to their Parents, to tremble (leaſt they ſhould come under the Verge of men-ſtealers) when they ſee how ſeveerly men-ſtealers are puniſhed with death.</p>
            <p>Another great defect in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> law, is this, a man commits an offen ce, and not onely he, but alſo his innocent Children muſt ſuffer for it; when as God to the Contrary, (ſaith <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 20.) <hi>That the S on ſhall not bear the iniquity of his Father;</hi> for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44823:11"/>
Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> and the <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Gentry is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have committed Treaſon, but to be ſure if their Statebe ſequeſtred (as many was upon the like ſcore) their innocent Families are robbed, fot is it not ſufficient, that if they have committed a crime that they only in their own perſon ſuffer for it, and not to have their innocent Families Ruinated alſo by it.</p>
            <p>In King <hi>James</hi> his time, when I was a Boy, a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of ours being then the Conſtable, made bold to ſteal ſome ſheep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and kill them to ſpare his own, yet though he was Conſtable who thought by vertue of his Office to carry it out unqueſtionable, he was brought in for a thief, all his goods taken for the King; his innocent Children turn'd out to beg their bread, and the owners of the ſheep, had nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a ſhare of the Curſe from the poor Children.</p>
            <p>But ſee how God ſince by way of retaliation met with King <hi>James</hi> and his ſeed for ſuch things, they alſo were turned out of all to ſeek their Bread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If King <hi>James</hi> had maintained the law of God, the thief might have made Reſtitution to the owner of the ſheep, and left him enough for his Children; and the Kings ſeed been bleſſed, and not come to ſuch diſhonour and want as they did ſince that time; though men regard not God nor his law, yet they may behold his works here, and be ſure of his truth, <hi>that ſaith vengance is mine I will repay,</hi> Rom. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 19.</p>
            <p>And now to ſpeak ſomething in the matter of Tiths, which many are offended at, and willingly would pay none. Firſt I need not prove it lawful to take tyth, for we ſee it was paid before the law,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44823:12"/>
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 20. and all along under the law, none can deny it; and after the law our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 23. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 42. preſſeth the payment of tyth as a duty that ought to be done. Therefore ſince the Church of Chriſt came to any Maturity and power to command tythes hath been paid all along to this our time.</p>
            <p>But now in my judgement Tything is not rightly done; for in the beginning <hi>Abraham</hi> had got a good booty, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 20. <hi>And he paid Tythes of it once and no more,</hi> Heb. 7. 4. <hi>Jacob</hi> alſo having then nothing but his ſtaff, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 10. <hi>Voweth to God, ſaying, of all that thou giveſt me, I will ſurely give the Tenth unto thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> it is not meant to Tyth all he hath every year, but to tyth all his ſtock once, and then to Tyth all the increaſe of his ſtock yearly; but if his ſtock do not increaſe but decreaſe, or is at a ſtand, between both, there is no more Tythes to be required of ſuch an one; for ſaith he, of all that thou giveſt me, I will ſurely give the tenth unto thee. And therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 22. <hi>Thou ſhalt truely Tyth all the increaſe of thy Seed;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 16. 2. <hi>Let every one of you lay by him in ſtore, as God hath proſpered him;</hi> that is, every one of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> truely muſt lay in ſtore, (againſt St. <hi>Paul</hi> came) the tenth of his increaſe, and no more; for he that groweth poor ought to have a ſhare of the Tyth, rather then pay it as you ſee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 28, 29.</p>
            <p>But our Teachers will have the tenth from a man, whether he proſpereth or not proſpereth, whether he increaſe or decreaſe ſo long as he hath any thing, they will have the tenth until at laſt drawing him
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44823:12"/>
dry year by year; they take all from him under the notion of Tyths and ſend him a begging</p>
            <p>And to ſtate the Caſe aright; ſuppoſe I were now a rich man entring into my affairs in the world, and being worth a thouſand pound, I give a hundred of it to the Miniſter for his Tyth; and I take a Farm of a hundred pound a year, and I lay out all the reſt of my money to ſtock that land, I keeping a great family and paying my rent can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keep my ſtock whole, till the years end; what reaſon hath any Miniſter to come to me any more for tyths? I paid once and my State is not encreaſed; why ſhould I give the tenth of my Corn or of my Sheep to him, ſince I do not encreaſe; becauſe the Land is not mine? ought he not rather and more equal get the tenth part of the Rent from the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord? for if he forceth tyth from me year by year, I not thriving, he will in time get all my ſtock; and how is that juſt in the Miniſter, who ſhould teach men to be juſt in their dealing one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
            <p>Again', There is a Tradeſman that takes a great Houſe, and lives at a high rate, only upon his credit, and at the years end making his account, is more in debt then he is worth by half; yet this man goes on in his way, and muſt pay the Miniſter more then his neighbour that is in a thriving way and worth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands: yea, there are ſome that lodgeth in ſuch poor mens houſes that are worth thouſands a year in lands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who beſides in the way of Merchandiſe get ſometime a thouſand a year clear gain; and why do not the Miniſters get tyth of ſuch men?</p>
            <p>

Therefore I ſay the true way of tything is this; for every young man to obſerve, when he beginneth to be for himſelf, he that hath a portion to begin the world, let him give the tenth part thereof to God, that is for the Miniſter and the poor; and if it pleaſe God to bleſs him and he encreaſe in wealth, let him make his account once a year, &amp; as God is pleaſed to add to his ſtock (whether by wares or merchandiſe, or cattle, or by the death of friends, or any way elſe whatſoever,) let him tyth the addition or encreaſe of his ſtock year by year ſo long as he liveth upon earth: and he that hath nothing at firſt, if God ſend him an eſtate, let him doe the like; and that is his way to get more of God.</p>
            <p>As for Example, a man at the beginning is worth a hundred pound, he pays ten pound tyth; next year he is worth two hundred pound, he pays eleven pound tyth; the third year, he is worth four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound, he pays twenty one pound two ſhillings tyth; the fourth year his ſtock doth not encreaſe a peny, then he pays no tyth; for why? he gave the tenth of all he had already: but the fifth year his ſtock encreaſeth two hundred pounds, then he pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth twenty pound tyth; and ſo forward payes the tenth of his encreaſe yearly, according as he truly valueth his eſtate; for he muſt doe it between God and himſelf; and this men ſhould doe, not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, but voluntary in obedience to God that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it; and in hope that he will not only pour riches upon them, but will alſo rebuke the Devourer, who is ready (if God permit him) to take all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comforts from them, as once he did from <hi>Job,</hi>

            <p>Touching the Miniſters of our time, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> hits them home, for their greedineſſe after their tyth, and their ignorance in tything, as alſo in other things belonging to theſe times; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſets up a Miniſtery of Eunuchs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 4, 5. in the Houſe of the Lord; becauſe ſaith he, all theſe Miniſters devour: and leſt they ſhould looſe their tyth, they will wink at all faults, and conſent to any ſin in Governours, &amp; that makes the holy Prophet to brand them ſaying, <hi>Iſa.</hi>

               <hi>Origen</hi> one of the moſt famous ancient Fathers of the Church, for this cauſe would have none to be Miniſters but <hi>Ennuches,</hi> and he himſelf would, and had his privy Members taken from him upon that account; yet the Church then did not approve of his judgement in that point; what arguments or reaſons he uſed for it at that time, I know not; I am ſure there is, much more might now be ſpoken in it: for beſide Scripture &amp; Reaſon, time and woful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth evince it; ſo that we may confeſſe it to be an impregnable truth.</p>
            <p>For Scripture you ſee our Saviour Chriſt in his time would have <hi>Eunuches</hi> to be his Miniſters, if men
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44823:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
could receive it upon that account, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 13. For if none were admitted or eſteemed to be a Miniſter of the Word and Sacrament, but ſuch as enter in at ſuch ſtrait gate, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 24. I beleive we ſhould not have had ſuch Heaps or Swarms of Teachers, or Preachers as we had of late, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3. but ſhould have had a pure ſort of Preacher, that had rather die then turn; as Miniſters have done in theſe times; for we believe in reaſon, that he which hath laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his privy Members from him for the truth ſake, is moſt likeſt if need require to lay down his life, for the truth ſake; for that qualification worketh a glorious change in nature, ſo that I may ſay, if it were poſſible to Gold <hi>Lucifer</hi> the grand Divel, it would bring to the true obedience of God, to have a ſaving faith and to become a holy Angel again.</p>
            <p>As for Example, Behold the difference between the Ox and the Bull, the Ox is meek, gentle, and quiet, the Bull hot, furious, and quarrelſome, ſometime for no cauſe but his humour, he roareth and teareth the ground with his feet and hornes, and if there be ſtacks of Wheat, or Cocks of Hay or any ſuch thing nigh him, he will ſpend his ſury in ſcattering them about; and think it is his glory that nothing can ſtand before him, &amp; ſo is the ſtone Horſe, Bore, Ram, Cock, or any ſtoned creature, proud, furious, and of a quarrelſome nature, but being Gelded they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of a clean contrary nature, ſo that I ſay as I ſaid before, Gelding is ſo virtual, that it would change the Devil in nature; and make him a holy Angel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as good as he was when he was created<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Here you ſee a man may argue much for <hi>Eunuches</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:44823:14"/>
Miniſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the different nature of beaſts, and bring many reaſons bac'kt with Scripture to maintain it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for <hi>David</hi> in the perſon of Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. <hi>Many Bulls have compaſſed me,</hi> he doth not tearm them (Prieſts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 1, 2. Oxen <hi>For the Ox knoweth his owner, Eſa.</hi> 1. 3. And thoſe Prieſts had they been <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuches</hi> ſhould have known Chriſt; therefore their ſtony proud hearts was their ruine and deſtruction; and now I will ſhew you what time hath manifeſted in this point.</p>
            <p>Firſt it is clear that the Apoſtles in their time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Prieſts to marry, yet with ſome reſtriction, for whereas then Laymen might have two or three Wives, the Prieſt muſt have but one, and after as the Church grew &amp; was ſtabliſhed in power, the Prieſts ſtriving one with another for means, and preferment ſets all in a bloody War; then the pariſh Prieſt turn as ours do now; turn this way or that way, any way to keep their means becauſe of their Wives and Children after the Wars is ended; the Church ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe of their miſery to be the married Prieſt, and that ſuch would ſoon let the Church ſink, rather then ſuffer the leaſt to ſave it; made a decree that no married men ſhould be Prieſts, and the Church had reſt a thouſand years.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Hus, Luther, Calvin,</hi> with many more cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous ſtone Prieſts doth quarrel, and will have Wives contrary to their Vows, &amp; divide Chriſtendom put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it into a bloody War; making a great rent in the Church, (which had they been <hi>Eunuches,</hi> they would not have done it) &amp; we Engliſh take part with them, and excluding the old Romiſh Church, ſet up a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44823:15"/>
Church of our own moulding with married Prieſts; and no ſooner was it <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et up, but ſome of our Prieſts having not preſerment, and means enough to ſatisfie their greedy minds, under pretence of ſhewing a more holy way, quarrels with the Church; ſo that all thoſe Prieſts whoſe greedy bellies are not ſatisfied get together, conſults, (and being called Puritans,) reſolve to preach againſt the decent Ceremonies of the Church, taking any ſleight occaſion to quarrel, and holding forth any whimſie, that would work upon the people, and ſtirring them up for their own advantage; and this they did in a more cunning way then can be declared, until they brought it to a bloody cruel war, and overthrew the Church by force of tumults that knew not what they did; in aſſiſting a few Members to overthrow the legality of the whole Parliament in 1641.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Prieſts then preaching, that Oaths was not obligary, damn themſelves and the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in perjury, murders, and theft, beyond all Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Infidels, that they now ſtink in the ſight of all Nations; thus they preaching rebellion get up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt: yet being not the Miniſters of Chriſt, none would obey them, neither could they ſettle any thing, but were forced to come down again, to ſay any thing to keep in, and turn like weather-cocks, or baſe ſlaves to the ſeveral humors of their ſeveral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Maſters; ſo that if the Divel would come, they would deny God, and preach him for a piece of bread or the tyth; and their wives and children is the main cauſe of this evil: for if the Prieſts were ſingle, they would not be ſo greedy and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44823:15"/>
covetous; and they would ſtand to the death for the Church, as we ſee the Prieſts of ROME doe: but the Romiſh entrance to the Miniſtry, is too broad a way, which was and is the cauſe that their Church is ſubject to miſcarry, as I ſhewed before.</p>
            <p>But ſome men will ſay, Why then did <hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Paul, Tim.</hi> 3. 2. give toleration for Prieſts to marry? I anſwer, becauſe of the hardneſs of mens hearts did he then ſuffer Prieſts to marry; for if he had ſaid none ſhall be Prieſts but Eunuchs; or that he had ſaid, Prieſts ſhall not be married to women, but live a ſingle life, the Church then being in its Infancy, ſhould have fallen for want of Miniſters; for who then would have been a Miniſter upon that account? Alas! you ſee how the Diſciples fall away from Chriſt for a leſs occaſion, <hi>John</hi> 6. 66. But from the beginning of the Creation it was not ſo; for God had ordained Eunuches to be his Miniſters; and when thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Eunuchs, called the Sons of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 2. broke their order, and would no more part with their privy Members, but take wives and are become worldings like other Lay-men; for whom it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſo to doe. Then evil encreaſed ſo, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents that he had made man, and drown'd the whole world, except <hi>Noah,</hi> a righteous perſon that foreſaw it, and was ſaved by obeying Gods command, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. and the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> underſtanding this, invites the order of Eunuches to the Houſe of God again to be his Miniſters, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 4, 5. and Chriſt himſelf alſo doth invite them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 12. and that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 37, 38, 39. <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 26, 27, 18, 29. It was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lay-men did marry, and give in marriage,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44823:16"/>
eat, drink, plant, build, which things are for lay-men to doe; but for Miniſters, it is unlawful and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive for themſelves and Nation, to build, plant, and to exceed in eating and drinking, or to be worldly given; for why? they ought to be true Eunuches only for God's ſervice, as the Oxe is, which minds not to propagate his own ſeed, but his Maſters ſeed.</p>
            <p>Now the Proteſtant Prieſt will ſay, I have the Scripture for my warrant to marry; ſaith the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Prieſt, I am ſure thy marrying will be thy ruin: thou hadſt beſt come to me again: ſaith <hi>Origen</hi> the the Eunuch Prieſt, ye are both in the way to damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for your Gates is wide, but enter in at the ſtrait gate as I did; take your unruly member away from you, and then you come into me: I am ſure we ſhall not have too many Prieſts, and we ſhall be peaceable, we ſhall care only for God &amp; his Church, we ſhall leaven the world with our meekneſs which we nor they could not obtain, while we had ſtones to move us to a cholerick nature; we ſhall be as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for to feed mens ſouls as the Oxen is for their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>And you ſhall find that the ſtrivings and quarrels of their Prieſts have been the cauſe of all the civil Wars in the world; for the Prieſts war will at length prove a national quarrel: and the reaſon why the Prieſts quarrel, is, becauſe there is too many of them; every one of them will be a Prieſt for lucres ſake, and he that is truly called of God will not refuſe it: if he cannot have it without he came in as aforeſaid, it's the only way to try their calling whether it be of God: or not of God and God ſaith, that he will
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44823:16"/>
give Prieſts after his own mind; and thoſe muſt be Eunuches.</p>
            <p>Kings found <hi>Eunuches</hi> to be the moſt fitteſt for their preſence and ſervice as you may read in the Scripture, and yet in Forraign Countries Kings have them; and what a glorious fine godly man was that <hi>Eunuch</hi> of great Authority under <hi>Candace</hi> Queen of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> who as he was riding in his Chariot was reading the Scripture: and how ſweet was his nature, that as ſoon as <hi>Philip</hi> ſhoweth to him Jeſus Chriſt, he preſently believeth and is Baptized, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. from v. 25. to the end, but contrarily, how ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born againſt Chriſt the Prieſts were, you ſee through out the Goſpel, and what miſchief then and all along they did to their Nation; one Levite Prieſt for his Wife or Whores ſake, (for ſhe was but his Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine) ſets all <hi>Iſrael</hi> to fight one againſt the other; that it was Gods mercy to them, they were not all conſumed that bout, <hi>Judg.</hi> 20. let this ſuffice now for this matter.</p>
            <p>Now to conclude, 1. The General (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) being a ſingle perſon muſt give us a law; and he muſt frame it by Scripture rule, and ſo the people of <hi>Roome</hi> gave advice, when the King of <hi>England</hi> (after his converſion) ſent to the <hi>Pope</hi> to know by what law he ſhould govern, the <hi>Pope</hi> anſwered him, ſaying you have the Old and New Teſtament make you a law agreable to that.</p>
            <p>2. The General muſt be one that knoweth all the caſes in the Nation uſually tryed by law; for <hi>Moſes</hi> was learned in all the wiſdome of the <hi>Egyptians, Act.</hi> 7. 22. he knew all their laws and controverſies, and ſo doth the Maſter of the Rolls; our General know
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44823:17"/>
all the controverſies of this Nation, that is the Man to give law.</p>
            <p>There muſt be a King to execute the ſaid law, elſe it will do no good, for notwithſtanding the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had a good law, they did not regard it; <hi>when there was no King in Iſrael every one did what was right in his own Eyes, Judg.</hi> 17. 6. and if you read from hence <hi>Judg.</hi> 17. to the end of that book, you ſhall ſee what evil they did; ye, as bad as <hi>Sodom, Judg.</hi> 19. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. and what wars was among them for it, <hi>Judg.</hi> 20. and the reaſon is becauſe they had no King, and the ſaid reaſon is cited three times to ſhew us the reaſon and truth of it, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17. 6, 18. and 1. 19. and 1. therefore it was time for <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ask a King; and I ſpeak it with reverence, when the people as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a King, it touched <hi>Samuels</hi> ſelf intereſt, and he looked upon it as a great affront; therefore he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed (becauſe the people now would caſt him out to have a King in his place) and ſpeaks bitter things to the people; yet you ſee the peoples caſe was good, for his ſons who were made Judges, (whom he thought ſhould Reign) carried themſelves baſe, took bribes, and perverted judgement, and the Lord ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies the people and bids him hear them; and the Lord by arguments perſwadeth <hi>Samuel</hi> to be patient and not lay it ſo to heart; yet ſelf intereſt is ſo ſweet, that the good Prophet for all that, labours to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the people not to have a King, until they were at laſt ſo reſolute, that they refuſe to hear <hi>Samuel,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Nay, but there ſhall be a King over us.</hi>
