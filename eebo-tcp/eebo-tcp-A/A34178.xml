            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A View of the most Remarkable Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of that great Minister of State, <hi>Anthony</hi> Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> Baron <hi>Ashley</hi> of <hi>Wimbourn S. Giles's,</hi> and Lord <hi>Cooper</hi> of <hi>Pawlett.</hi>

            </head>
            <p>IT was an excellent Caution of the Moralist, <hi>de vivis nil nisi verum, de mortuis nil nisi bonum,</hi> which if the Relators of our Age adhered to, there could not be so many base reflections on the Living, nor such inhumane Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the Memories of the Dead, as we daily see imposed upon the too credulous World; so that we often see the gallant actions of the most Heroick, and generous, smutted, &amp; bespattered with false &amp; palpably scandalous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations; and on the other side, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of little Figure, &amp; small Demerit, guilded and vernished with all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause and encomium due to the Brave and Noble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:103619:4"/>It is therefore the design of this small Tractate, not to write after either of these two Copies; but to manage this discourse with that deference to truth, and the knowledg of the present Age, that calumny it self may not find where to fasten upon any part of the ensuing Relation. Nor would I have the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er imagine, that any design of being seen in P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>int, or of reflecting on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Administration of publick Affairs, hath occasion'd the writing hereof; but having heard that several Pens were employed in a work of this nature, and being sensible likewise of the present detracting Genius before hinted; I thought I might in some measure gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the inquisitive World by a sincere and candid Relation of the naked truth of things. Some men may object, that it cannot be thought proper to expose the Reputation of any person in an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical way, until he hath acted out his part, &amp; be fairly gone off the Stage, no more than it would be for a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralist to dissect a living person, to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the soundness of his vitals.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:103619:4"/>But, as it's reported of Queen <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> that on her Death-bed she said, Had there been a Window to her Breast, they might have seen <hi>Callis</hi> in her heart: So doubtless, could there be a view taken of the in-side of this Noble Peer, we might see his heart filled with Loyalty to his Prince, Love to his Country, &amp; Zeal for the Protestant Religion; the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which only can secure us from the Attempts of His Majesties and His Peoples Enemies. Ye<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, if it be a truth, that the Actions of men are Mirrours, in which their Souls are discerned, we may, by taking a view of some of the most remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Passages of his Life, in some measure calculate the Dimensions and Complexion of his Soul.</p>
            <p>The wisest of Kings tells us, That in the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> there is strength; and how much it is the Interest of Princes to advance men of the highest Qualifications into such Trust, the Experience of all Ages

testifieth. The Affairs of the Publick receive their Exaltation or their De<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ment, from their Advices; and according to the Qualifications and Inclinations of those great Ministers, may be calculated the Fate of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. This hath obliged Monarchs to take to their Councils men of the largest Prospect, the greatest Eloquence, and steddiest Principle to the Interest of the Government; persons knowing in the Laws and Constitutions of the Kingdom, whereof they are Members, that Espouse the Interest of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with an Inviolable Resolution of adhering to it, with the hazard of their dearest Lives and Liberties; such as prefer the Concern of the Publick above their own private Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions and Enjoyments; that dare deny themselves for the good of the Prince. And of this sort, (without Encroachment on the just Acquirements of any other Minister) we may affirm this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103619:5"/>
Noble Peer to be. With what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Polity did he influence and manage the Councils he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in during the <hi>Inter-Regnum,</hi> towards His Majesties Interest? With what exquisite Subtilty did he turn all the Chanels of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils to swell this Stream? And how unweariedly did he <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ugg at the Helm of State, till he had brought his great Master safe into the desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Port? A sense of these his great Abilities, and Firmness to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, still kept him up in the Esteem of the Country, who would alwaies chuse him one of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives, in the great Emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of State. They knew him to be one of those that could not believe Prerogative to be incompatible with Property, but as he believed that Motto, <hi>Rex Legis Tutamen;</hi> so he would not have that other, <hi>Grex Regis Tutamen</hi> to be rejected.</p>
            <p>In the year 1656, when a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was chosen without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103619:6"/>
of the People, and to serve a a private Interest, we find him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those Worthies that Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated against that Arbitrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding: for none were admitted into the House but such as received a Certificate in the following Form.</p>

            <p>Hereupon Complaint being made to the House that some persons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned for Members, were not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the House; upon the question it was Resolved, That those persons should make their Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103619:6"/>
to the Council for Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Hereupon several of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that were chosen to serve in Parliament, and not Returned, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished a Remonstrance, wherein they claimed the priviledge of the Antient Fundamental Laws, and their Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Right as Freemen of <hi>England.</hi> But the Remonstrance being much too large to be here inserted, I shall only present you with one or two Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs, as a Specimen of those brave <hi>Hero</hi>'s Resolution against a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorian</hi> Invasion: And the greatness of their Courage, and brave English Gallantry, will be the more conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, if we consider this was done when the then Protector was in his Zenith; when almost all <hi>Europe</hi> trembled before him; and he gave Law to the Neighbour-Princes; when he had in his hand that Thunder that had shook the Nation off her very Foundations; And the House too filled with those who either were,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103619:7"/>
or seemed to be his Creatures: Yet in a general Defiance of this so po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Conquerour, did those Noble Patriots (amongst other things) Remonstrate.</p>
            <p>When our Worthy Ancestors have been met in Parliaments, and have found Oppression and Tyranny supported by such strong hands, that they could not prevail to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their Countries, Lives and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties by wholsom Laws, they have often made their Protestations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Injustice and Oppression; and forewarned the people of their danger. In like manner, we who have been duly chosen by the people to be Members of the Parliament, that should now have met, and have an undoubted Right to Meet, Sir, and Vote in Parliament, although we are Oppressed by Force of Arms, and shut out of the usual place of Parliament Sitting; yet having Hearts sensible of that highest Trust reposed in us, and being filled with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103619:7"/>
Cares for the <hi>Church</hi> and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which with grief of heart we behold bleeding; we do hold our selves bound in duty to God, and our Country, to declare unto the People of <hi>England,</hi> their and our woful condition, and the most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent danger of the utter Subversion of Religion, Liberty, Right, and Property.</p>
            <p>We believe the Rumour is now gone through the Nation, that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men employed by the L. P. have prevented the free Meeting and Sitting of the intended Parliament, and have forcibly shut out of doors such Members as he &amp; his Council supposed would not be frighted or flattered to betray their Country, and give up their Religion, Lives, and Estates to be at his Will, to serve his Lawless Ambition. But we fear that the Slavery, Rapines, Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, Cruelties, Murthers, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions that are comprehended in this horrid Fact, are not so sensibly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103619:8"/>
discerned, or so much laid to heart as the case requires; and we doubt not, but as the common practice of the Man hath been, the Name of God, and Religion, and formal Fasts and Prayers will be made use of to colour over the Blackness of the Fact: We do therefore in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to God, and our Country here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Remonstrate;</p>
            <p>First, That whereas by the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws of this Nation the People ought not to be bound by any Laws, but such as are freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented u<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>to by their chosen Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Parliament, and it is a most wicked Usurpation, even against the very Laws of Nature, for any man to impose his <hi>Will</hi> or <hi>Discretion</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another as a Rule, unless there be some Pact or Agreement between the Parties for that intent. And whereas by the Mercy of God only, in preserving this Fundamental Law and Liberty, the good People of <hi>England</hi> have beyond memory of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103619:8"/>
any Record, preserved their Estates, Families, and Lives, which had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise been destroyed at the will of every wicked Tyrant; and by keeping this only as their undoubted Right, they have been kept from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brutish Slaves to the lusts of their Kings, who would otherwise have despoiled them of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Lives, and Estates by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, and the Orders of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Council. Now the <hi>L. P.</hi> hath by force of Arms invaded this Fundamental Right and Liberty, and violently prevented the meeting of the peoples chosen Deputies in Parliament; and he and his Council<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> boldly declare;</p>
            <p>
               <q>That none of the Peoples Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties shall meet in Parliament, unless they agree to the measure of their Fantasies, Humours and Lusts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>They now render the people such Fools, or Beasts, as know not who
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103619:9"/>
are fit to be trusted by them with their Lives, Estates and Families: But he and his Council, that daily devour their Estates, and Liberties, will judge who are fit to counsel and advise about Laws to preserve their Estates and Liberties. Thus doth he now openly assume a power to pack an Assembly of his Confidents, Parasites, and Confederates, and to call them a Parliament, that he may from thence pretend that the People have consented to become his Slaves, and to have their Persons and Estates at his Discretion. And if the people shall tamely submit to such a Power, who can doubt but he may Pack such a Number as will obey all his Commands, and consent to his taking what part of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states he pleaseth, and to impose what Yoaks he thinks fit to make us draw in.</p>
            <p>They know it to be the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Right of the People to trust whom they think fit, and as much
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103619:9"/>
the Right of every man duly chosen and trusted, to meet and Vote in Parliament, without asking their Leave, or begging their Tickets. And although there have been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Secret Designs for many years to subvert Religion, Liberty, and Property in this Nation; and to that end the Designs of Tyranny have attempted to destroy some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Being, sometimes the Power, Priviledges, and Freedom of Parliaments; yet the Mercy of God hath almost miraculously preserved the Being, Priviledges and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Parliaments, and therein Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Liberty, and Property, until the time of the Lord Protector.</p>
            <p>But now he hath assumed an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Arbitrary Soveraignty (as if he came down from the Throne of God) to create in himself, and his Confederates, such Powers and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, as must not be under the cognizance of the peoples Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. His Proclamations he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103619:10"/>
shall be binding Laws to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments themselves; he takes upon him to be above the whole Body of the people of <hi>England,</hi> and to judge and censure the whole Body, and every Member of it, by no other Rule or Law than his pleasure, as if he were their Absolute Lord, and had Bought all the people of <hi>England</hi> for his Slaves. Doubtless he would pretend only to have conquered <hi>England</hi> at his own Expence; and, were there as much Truth as there is Falshood in that pretence, yet he could not but know that the Right of the peoples Deputies to their Antient Powers and Priviledges would remain good against him, as against their publick capital Enemy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whom every man ought to destroy, until by some agreement with the the Body of the people in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, some sort of governing Power in him were submitted unto, that hereby he might cease to be a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Enemy and Destroyer, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103619:10"/>
a King, or Governour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conditions accepted by the people; and if he would so pretend, he could not be so discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his publick Enmity by any Conditions or Agreement made with a part of the Peoples chosen Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whilst he shut out the other part; for no part of the Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives Body are trusted to consent to any thing in the Nations behalf, if the whole have not their free Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Debating and Voting in the Matters propounded.</p>
            <p>If he would pretend no higher than to be our Conqueror, who for Peace and his own safety's sake, was content to cease from being a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Enemy, and to be admitted a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, he would not compass those ends by forcibly excluding (as now he does) whom he pleases of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative Body of the People, who were to submit to him on the Peoples behalf; therefore he either takes upon him to be such a Conqueror as scorns
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103619:11"/>
the Peoples acceptance of him by their Representative as their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and fears not to remain a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Enemy, or else he takes himself to be such an unheard of Soveraign, that against him the people have no claim of Property or Right in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or any thing else; for he hath now declared, that the peoples choice cannot give any man a Right to sit in Parliament, but the Right must be derived from his gracious Will and Pleasure, with that of his Councellors, and his Clerks Ticket only must be their evidence for it.</p>
            <p>Thus hath he exalted himself to a Throne like unto God's, as if he were of himself, and his power from himself, and we were all made for him, to be commanded and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of by him, to work for him, and serve his Pleasure and Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>A little after there is an Instance of Chief-Justice <hi>Tresilian,</hi> who was executed at <hi>Tyburn</hi> in the time of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103619:11"/>
               <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, for advising the King, that he might at any time dissolve the Parliament, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Members to depart under the penalty of Treason. Divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Protestations were contained in that Instrument against the Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness and Tyranny of that proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and in conclusion they declare they will <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap>t their complaints before the Lord against their power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Oppressors, hoping he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem his people out of the hands of wicked and deceitful Men. This protestation was signed by One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and seventeen persons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Sir <hi>Anthony Ashly Cooper,</hi> the present Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> was one, and many others of great Loyalty and Integrity, some whereof are since dead, and others still alive in great Honour and Office.</p>
            <p>By this may be easily discerned the Opinion he had of the Illegal and Arbitrary proceedings of <hi>O. C.</hi> and how much of the sufferings of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103619:12"/>
Loyal Party would have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, had that point of a free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament been then gained: His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Restauration must have been the natural consequence of it. The constant correspondence he always kept with the Royal Party, and that almost to the hazard of his Life and Family, are sufficient Testimonies of his sincerity to his Masters Interest and Service.</p>
            <p>His House was a Sanctuary for distressed Royalists, and his corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence with the Kings Friends (though closely managed, as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of those times required) are not unknown to those that were the principal managers of His Majesties Affairs at that time.</p>
            <p>This made that great Politician <hi>O. C.</hi> so apprehensive of this great Assertor of his Countries Rights, and Opposer of Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Enthusiasm, that though his vast Abilities were known (at least) to equal the ablest Pilot of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103619:12"/>
State, yet we cannot find him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Creatures of his Cabinet, or Council, nor amongst the Eleven Major Generals, to whom the Care of the Nation was committed: No, their Principles, their Aims and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs were incompatible; one was for Subverting, the other for Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Antient standing Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of the Nation; which once dissolved, it were impossible but an universal Deluge of Confusion, Blood and Rapine must ensue. This made our brave Patriot (with divers of the Heroick English Race) to the utmost oppose the growth of a <hi>Protectorian</hi> Power. So that we find Sir <hi>Anthony Ashly Cooper</hi> accused before the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in the year 1659. for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Intelligence with the King, and for having provided a Force of Men in <hi>Dorsetshire,</hi> to joyn with Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> in attempting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store and bring His Majesty that now is to His Rightful Throne. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny persons of great note were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103619:13"/>
on the account of this Plot; and amongst the rest Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Ashly Cooper,</hi> who though (at that time one of the Commissioners of the Army, and a Member of the House of Commons, yet was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of to the Parliament for a great Manager of the Design; and although no man knew better how to obviate the Reasons of the House, and plead his own Cause, yet was with great difficulty cleared and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of that Imputation by the House of Commons.</p>
            <p>The Eyes of the great States-men were so much upon him, that he was one of those Loyal Persons mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Baker</hi> in his Chronicle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Council of State was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; in which List we find General <hi>Monk</hi> to be the foremost; and that Council the Chronologer calls men of Integrity, and well affected to Kingly Government: And he that will but consider how soon His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Restauration ensued upon the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103619:13"/>
Election of this Council, will have good reason to be of the same Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And in the 673 page we find him to be one of the Nine of the Old Council of State, who sent that encouraging Letter to the said Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to promote his undertaking for the Advantage of the Three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Again, we find him in the List of that Council of State consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Thirty Nine, upon whom an Oath was endeavoured to be Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for the Abjuration of the Royal Line, but by the Influence of Sir <hi>Anthony Ashly Cooper,</hi> and General <hi>Monk,</hi> upon Coll. <hi>Morly,</hi> that Oath was opposed in Council, as being a snare, and against their Consciences. This was strongly pleaded by the Soberer part of the Council, whereof this great Patriot was one, and so an end was put both to that Oath, and to the Council. Nor is it in the least unknown to persons then in being, how much his Advice influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the Councils of those times.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:103619:14"/>He was the person that was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly singled out of the whole Council by Commissary <hi>Clargis</hi> in <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1659. and had communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him a dangerous Design, tending to Involve the Nation in further trouble, which this Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable person imparted to the Council of State. This-was that great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil that complied with General <hi>Monk</hi> in that great Revolution of Restoring His Majesty. And if that great Action were the occasion of a candid construction put on all the former Actings of the General, why they should not have the same Candour for this Noble person, I think none can determine. His Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment at this time was in places of the highest Trust and Importance; an undeniable Testimony of the great Opinion the then great Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners had of his Loyalty, as well as known Ability for the Management of the then Intrieate and close De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs. A further prospect will be taken
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103619:14"/>
of his Concurrence with Gen. <hi>Monk</hi> in that Important Juncture, if we remember that his Regiment was one of the first that declared for the Parliament, and General <hi>Monk,</hi> in <hi>March</hi> 165<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>. So zealous was he in putting all his strength to the turning the great Wheel of State.</p>
            <p>At the time of His Majesties Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration, as a most signal Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of His Majesties good Sentiments of his former Actions, he was Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to be one of the first Rank in His Majesties most Honourable Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Council, and was placed above His Majesties Royal Brother, the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and even Gen. <hi>Monk</hi> himself, whom His Majesty used to call his Political Father. And about three daies before His Majesties Coronation, he was in the Banquetting-house created Baron <hi>Ashly</hi> of <hi>Wimbourn</hi> St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s; and another addition of Honour was conferred on him (<hi>viz.</hi>) Lord <hi>Cooper</hi> of <hi>Paulett;</hi> And at last in the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103619:15"/>
year 1672. he was made Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> at the same time when Duke <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> were promoted. To his happy Councils do both King and Kingdom owe for the happy Conduct of things for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers years; so that now he seemed to be incorporate into the heart of his Prince; the Events of his Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were commonly agreeable to what he at first proposed; so that it may be said of him as was spoken of <hi>Polibius,</hi> that (as <hi>Scipio</hi>) so the King seldom miscarried in any thing that was carried on by his Advice; so that at length he seemed to be the Royal Oracle. In fine, such was the Opinion which his wise Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration had gained, that as he sate in one of the highest places in his Masters favour, so he was preferred to the highest Trust of Honour in the Kingdom; he was made Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Lord High Chancellor of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103619:15"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> about the beginning of the Year 1672. Now was the Kings Conscience (as it were) entrusted to his care and management; this was the highest Orb a Subject was capable to move in; but with what Sagacity, Honour and Integrity he acquitted himself in that great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, the Transactions of the Court of <hi>Chancery</hi> at that time can best witness. Justice ran in an equal channel, the cause of the Rich did not swallow up the Rights of the Poor, he that was oppressed found Relief, and the Oppressor a Rebuke suitable to his crime; the usual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays of that Court were much abated, and all the Transactions thereof were managed with the greatest Judgment and Equity.</p>
            <p>As an Instance of his constant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the Interest of his Master, and the <hi>commune Bonum,</hi> or Weal of the publick, you may take a copy of his Thoughts from that excellent Speech made by him in favour of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103619:16"/>
the Subject in the <hi>Exchequer, Jan.</hi> 24. 1673. at Baron <hi>Thurland</hi>'s taking the Oath, a copy whereof follows.</p>

                           <hi>Mr. Serj.</hi> Thurland,</p>
                        <p>The King of his Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour hath made choice of you to be one of the Barons of the <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer;</hi> he designed to place you in a Court of more profit, though not of more Dignity; but your own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and Virtue hath chosen this Court, where you thought you could serve the K. best. And I could not omit to mention it here to your Honour, it being the greatest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a good man, that he had rather be found serviceable than rich. His Majesty hath had large proof of your former services; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, he takes you upon the credit of that Recommendation that hath justly the best place with him, I mean his Royal Brothers. Some few things it is fit I should here mention to you, and leave with you as Admonitions, or rather Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="33" facs="tcp:103619:16"/>In the first place you are to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Kings Prerogative, and let not the Kings Prerogative and the Law be two things with you: For the Kings Prerogative is Law, and the principal part of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in maintaining that, you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Law. The Government of <hi>England</hi> is so excellently interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that every part of the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative hath a broad mixture of the Interest of the Subject, the ease and safety of the people being insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from the greatness and securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Crown.</p>
                        <p>In the next place let me advise you that you acquaint your self with the Revenue, as also with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Records, Precedents, and Practices of this Court, for want of which knowledge, I have seen this Court a most excellent <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> when at the same time I could not say so much for it as an <hi>Exchequer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the third place let me recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103619:17"/>
to you so to manage the Kings Justice and Revenue, as the King may have most profit, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject least vexation. Raking for old Debts, the number of Informations, Projects upon Concealments, I could not find in the 11 years Experience I have had in this Court, ever to advantage the Crown; but such proceedings have for the most part delivered up the Kings good Subjects into the hands of the worst of Men.</p>
                        <p>There is another thing I have observed in this Court, which I shall mind you of, which is, when the Court hearkens too much to the Clerks and Officers of it; and are too apt to send out process, when the Money may be raised by other ways more easie to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. I do not say that the Kings Duty should be lost, or that the strictest course should not be taken, rather than that be; but when you consider how much the Officers of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103619:17"/>
this Court, and the Undersheriffs get by process upon small summs, more than the Kings Duty comes to; and upon what sort of people this falls, to wit, the Farmer, Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Clothier, in the Country, that is generally the Collector, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable and Tythingman, and so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbs the industrious part of the Nation, you will think it fit to make that the last way when no other will serve.</p>
                        <p>Give me leave also to mind you of one thing more, which is in your Oath, <hi>That the Kings needs ye shall speed before all other:</hi> that is, the business of the Revennue of the Crown you are to dispatch before all other, and not turn your Court into a Court of Common Pleas; and let that justle out what you were constituted for.</p>
                        <p>In the last place let me conclude with what concerns all my Lords the Judges, as well as you, let me recommend to you the Port and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103619:18"/>
way of Living suitable to the Dignity of your place, and what the King allows you. There is not any thing that gains more Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Respect to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than that doth: and let me tell you, Magistrates, as well as Merchants are supported by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>

            </q>
            <p>His particular Application to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any misunderstanding between the King and his Parliament, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obvious to any that shall but look into his Speeches to the Parliament during his Chancellorship, and with how great concern he still vindicated his Masters Actions: He acquitted himself in all the great Emergencies of this High Employment with that universal Applause and satisfaction, as seldom happens to men in such an envied station: The vilest of his Detractors not being able to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten any Imputation upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in those great and weighty Trusts he was advanced to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:103619:18"/>So little of self appeared in his Actions, that it may be modestly affirmed of him, he made his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest strike sail to the publick, and his care for others seemed more than for himself, and at the time of his highest Elevation, he would not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the meanest Suitors that applied themselves to him.</p>
            <p>Thus having gradually traced the Advancement of this great Minister to the highest pitch of Honor, where he appeared <hi>sicut Luna inter Stellas minores.</hi> I shall now take notice of his Relinquishment of that High Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and what other contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies have happened to him since.</p>
            <p>About <hi>November</hi> 1673. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty was pleased to send for the Lord Chancellor to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> where he resigned the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> to His Majesty, and was dismist from being Under-Treasurer of the <hi>Exchequor,</hi> which place was conferred on Si<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

Thus this mighty Minister, who had to the universal satisfaction of all good Men, been raised to that degree of Interest in his Masters favour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a murmur laid all his Honours at his Masters Feet, and was observed not to abate of the chearfulness of his Temper upon the loss of his honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Employment.

            <p>The 27th and 29th of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1677. The E. of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> was brought to the <hi>King's-Bench-Bar,</hi> upon the Return of an <hi>Alias Habeas Corpus,</hi> directed to the Constable of the <hi>Tower,</hi> where the Council for the Earl prayed that the Return might be filed, and the <hi>Friday</hi> following appointed for Debating the suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the Return, and my Lord was remanded until that day.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> the Earl was brought into Court again, and his Council argued the Insufficiency of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. After Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop,</hi> Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> had shewed divers weighty Reasons in behalf of the Earl, that that Court might relieve him, they were opposed by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor General, and the Attorney General, who brought divers Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces why that Court could not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge a person Committed by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; whereupon the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> is said to have spoke to this purpose:</p>

                           <salute>My Lords,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>I did not intend to have spoken one word in this business, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath been objected, and laid to my Charge by the King's Council, <hi>Mr. Attorney,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Solicitor,</hi> that enforceth me to say something for your better satisfaction. They have told you, that my Council in their Arguments said, That this Court was greater than the House of Peers, which I dare to Appeal to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, and the whole Court, that it was never spoken by them; I am sure it was not by any direction of mine. What is done by my Council and by me, is, that this is the most proper Court to resort unto, where the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Subject is concerned. The Lord's House is the Supream House of Judicature in the Kingdom; but yet there is a Jurisdiction that the Lord's House does not meddle with. The King's Council hath mentioned as a wonder, that a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103619:21"/>
of the Lord's House should come hither to diminish the Jurisdiction of the Lords. I acknowledge them to be Superiour to this, or any other Court, to whom all Appeals and Writs of Errour are brought; and yet there are Jurisdictions that they do not Challenge, and which are not natural to them, or proper for them. They claim not to meddle in Original Causes and so I might mention in other things; and I do not think it a kindness to any Power, or Body of Men, to give them some Power that is not natural or proper to their Constitutions: I do not think it a kindness to the Lords to make them Absolute, and above the Law, for so I humbly conceive this must do, if it be adjudged that they by a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Warrant, or without any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Cause Assigned do Commit me, or any other man to a perpetual and indefinite Imprisonment: And my Lords, I am not so inconsiderable a person, but what you do in my Case,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103619:21"/>
must be Law for every man in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Mr. Attorney</hi> is pleased to say I am a Member of the Lord's House, and to lay weight on the word Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                        <p>It is true, I am one of them, and no man hath a greater Reverence or Esteem for the Lords, than my self; but my Lords, I hope my being a Peer, or a Member of either House, shall not lose my Priviledge of being an English man, or make me to have less Title to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or the other Laws of English Liberty. My Opinion is not with one of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, who argued very learnedly, that the Passing an Act by the King's Royal Assent, can make a Session, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the usual promise was not in it. It was without any Instruction of mine to mention that point. The King's Council tells your Lordships of the Laws and Customs of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if this were so, I should submit; but this Case of mine is <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae Impressionis,</hi> and is a new way
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103619:22"/>
such as neither <hi>Mr. Attorney,</hi> nor <hi>Mr. Solicitor</hi> can shew any President of; and I have no other Remedy or place to Apply to, than the way I take.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mr. Attorney</hi> confesseth, that the King's pleasure may Release me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Lords: If so, this Court is <hi>Coram Rege,</hi> this Court is the proper place to determine the King's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. This Court will, and ought to Judge of an Act of Parliament void, if it be against <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> much more may Judge an Order of the House that is put in Execution to deprive any Subject of his Liberty. And if this Order or Commitment be a Judgment, as the King's Council af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, then it is out of the Lords hands, and properly before your Lordships, as much as the Acts which were lately Passed, which I presume you will not refuse to Judge of; notwithstanding that the King's Atorney General saith this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is still in being. I take it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103619:22"/>
ill that <hi>Mr. Attorney</hi> tells me I might have Applied elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>My Lord, I have not omitted what became my Duty toward the King; for besides the Oath of Allegiance I took as a Peer, or an English man, there is something in my Breast that will never suffer me to depart from the Duty and Respect that I owe him; but I am here before him; he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies supposed to be here present, and he alloweth his Subjects the Law.</p>
                        <p>My Lord, They speak much of the Custom of Parliament; but I do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, there is no Custom of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ever their Members were put out of their own Power; and the Inconveniencies of it will be endless.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mr. Attorney</hi> was pleased easily to answer the Objection of one of my Council; if a great Minister be so Committed, he hath the Cure of a Pardon, a Prorogation, or a Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: But if the Case should be put, why Forty Members, or a greater
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103619:23"/>
number, may not as well be taken away without Remedy in any of the King's Courts, he will not so easily answer; and if in this case there can be no Relief, no man can foresee what will be hereafter.</p>
                        <p>I desire your Lordship well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what Rule you make in my Case, for it will be a President that in future Ages may concern every man in <hi>England.</hi> My Lord, <hi>Mr. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney</hi> saith, you can either Release or Remand me; I differ from him in that Opinion. I do not insist upon a Release; I have been a Prisoner above Five Months already, and come hither of Necessity, having no other way to get my Liberty, and therefore am very willing to tender your Lordship Bail, which are in, or near the Court, as good as any are in <hi>England,</hi> either for their Quality or Estate, and I am ready to give any Sum or Number.</p>
                        <p>My Lord, This Court being possest of this business, I am now your Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner.</p>

                  <p>This being Read, the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor acquainted the House that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103619:25"/>
His Majesty had received a Third Petition from the E. of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> more submissive in Form than<note place="margin">☞</note> the Two First. But His Majesty understanding that the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> hath endeavoured to free himself from the Censure of this House, by Appealing to the <hi>King's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bench,</hi> to have their Judgments thereupon, during the late Adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth not think fit as yet to signifie his pleasure as to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, until this House hath taken that matter into consideration.</p>
                  <p>So that at that time the House re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to Address to the King for a Discharge for the said Earl, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on a Debate concerning his Appeal from this House to the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> for an <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> which Debate was again resumed the day following, and the Records of the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> produced, by which it did appear that two Rules of Court had been obtained upon the Motion of the E. of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi>'s
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103619:26"/>
Council, <hi>Trin. Term,</hi> 1677. and the Returns thereupon were Read, by which it did appear, that the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> was Committed the 16th of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1676. by this House for a Contempt, and then the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittitur</hi> of the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> to the <hi>Tower</hi> was also Read.</p>
                  <p>After this a Petition from the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> to this House was Read, wherein his Lordship took notice of an Order of this House, of the 20th Instant, for bringing the Records of the Court of <hi>King's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bench</hi> into this House, concerning the Matter of an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> brought by him, that he takes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be greatly concerned, and to have a Right to be present, and heard, when any Debate of any new matter against him is entered upon. That he cannot pretend but that he may have erred, for want of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident to guide him; and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the benefit of Council by reason of his close Confinement, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103619:26"/>
being resolved not to do any thing willingly, that might in the least of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend His Majesty, or their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, he humbly takes this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to give further Evidence thereof by casting himself at their Lordships feet; and as he hath humbly begg'd the Pardon of His Majesty, so he beggs also the Pardon of this House, for having offended them in any thing whatsoever.</p>

                  <head>Die Martis, 26 Feb. 1677.</head>
                  <p>The Lord Treasurer reported to the House, That the Lords with white slaves had waited on his Majesty, according to the Order of this House, To which His Majesty was pleased to give this answer, <hi>That he will give Order for the Earl of</hi> Shaftes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burys <hi>discharge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus was this great heat (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by some of this worthy Peers Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thought then to blast his Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Integrity, and endeavoured to foment the disgusts of the House against him) at last extinguished; and the Earl a little after saw this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament first prorogued, and soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dissolved.</p>
                  <p>Now was that Diabolical Plot of the Jesuits and Papists discovered, by the great care and fidelity of Dr. <hi>Titus Oats,</hi> which convinced both the King, Lords, and Commons, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103619:29"/>
all the Nation in General, of a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, treasonable, popish design to murther our Protestant King, with the chiefest of the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to reduce a Protestant Church to Romish Idolatry, and the State to a Catholick slavery.</p>
                  <p>The seventh of <hi>March</hi> 1678. A Parliament met at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and chose the Honourable <hi>Edward Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> 
                     <abbr>Esq</abbr> their Speaker, who had been Speaker of the last long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This Parliament did like no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble English Patriots, endeavour to give check to the bloody popish Designs on foot, and passed many excellent Votes for that purpose, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Members acquitting themselves in their Speeches like Men of high sense of the Miseries the Nation was like to be involved in. This House carried up the Impeachment to the House of Lords against <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Powis, William</hi> Viscount <hi>Stafford, Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Wandour, William</hi> Lord <hi>Peters,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Lord
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103619:30"/>
                     <hi>Bellasis,</hi> for High Treason, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther high crimes and misdemeanours. But this having been at large pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished to the World, in divers other prints, with divers Instances how this Noble Peer was personally struck at in that hellish Design; I shall refer the Reader for more full satisfaction, to the several Narratives and Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of the popish Plot, printed by Authority. And shall now come to give you an Account of a Speech said to be delivered by this Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable person in the House of Lords, on the 25th of the Instant <hi>March, Anno</hi> 1679.</p>

I do not know how well what I have to say may be received, for I never study either to make my Court vvell, or to be popular; I always speak what I am commanded by the dictates of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103619:30"/>
the Spirit vvithin me. There are some other considerations that concern <hi>England</hi> so nearly, that vvithout them you vvill come far short of Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Quiet at home. VVe have a little Sister and she hath no Breasts, vvhat shall vve do for our Sister in the day vvhen she shall be spoken for? If she be a VVall, vve vvill build on her a Palace of Silver; if she be a Door, vve vvill inclose her vvith Boards of Cedar. VVe have several little Sisters vvithout Breasts, the <hi>French</hi> Protestant Churches, the tvvo Kingdoms of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> the foreign Protestants are a VVall, the only VVall and Defence to <hi>England;</hi> upon it you may build Pallaces of Silver, glorious Pallaces. The protection of the Protestants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, is the greatest povver and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity the Crovvn of <hi>England</hi> can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to, and vvhich can only help us to give check to the grovving Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>France. Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are two doors, either to let in

good or mischief upon us; they are much weakned by the Artifice of our cunning Enemies, and we ought to enclose them with Boards of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar.</p>

                              <p>In <hi>England</hi> Popery was to have brought in Slavery; in <hi>Scotland</hi> Slavery went before, and Popery was to follow. I do not think your Lordships, or the Parliament have Jurisdiction there. It is a Noble and Ancient Kingdom; they have an Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Nobility, a Gallant Gentry, a learned Clergy, and an understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, worthy People; but yet we cannot think of <hi>England</hi> as we ought without reflecting on the condition thereof.

that are Richer expect better usage? For 'tis certain, that in all absolute Governments, the poorest Countries are always most favourably dealt with. When the ancient Nobility there cannot enjoy their Royalties, their Shrievaldoms, and their Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardies, which they and their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors have possessed for several hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that now they are enjoin'd by the Lords of the Council to make deputations of their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities to such as are their known E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, can we expect to enjoy our <hi>Magna Charta</hi> long, under the same persons and Administration of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs? If the Council-Table there can imprison any Nobleman, or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman for several years, without bringing him to Trial, or giving the beast Reason for what they do; can we expect the same Men will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Liberty of the Subject here?</p>
                              <p>My Lords, I will confess that I am not very well vers'd in the particular
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103619:32"/>
Laws of <hi>Scotland;</hi> but this I do know, that all the Northern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries have by their Laws an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inviolable Right to their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and Properties; yet <hi>Scotland</hi> hath out-done all the Eastern and Southern Countries, in having their Lives, Liberties, and Estates sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the Arbitrary Will and Pleasure of those that govern. They have lately plundered and harased the richest and wealthiest Countries of that Kingdom, and brought down the barbarous Highlanders to devour them; and all this almost without a colourable pretence to do it: Nor can there be found a Reason of State for what they have done; but that those wicked Ministers designed to procure a Rebellion at any rate; which as they managed, was only prevented by the miraculous hand of God, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise all the Papists in <hi>England</hi> would have been armed, and the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est opportunity given, in the just time for the execution of that wicked and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103619:32"/>
bloody design the Papists had: and it is not possible for any man that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considers it, to think other, but that those Ministers that acted that, were as guilty of the Plot as any of the Lords that are now in question for it.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, I am forced to speak this the plainer, because till the pressure be fully and clearly taken off from <hi>Scotland,</hi> 'tis not possible for me, or any thinking man to believe that good is meant us here. We must still be upon our guard, apprehending that the Principle is not changed at Court, &amp; that those men that are still in place and Authority, have that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the mind of our excellent Prince, that he is not, nor cannot be that to us, that his own Nature and Goodness would incline him to. I know your Lordships can order nothing in this; but there are those that hear me can put a perfect cure to it: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til that be done, the Scottish Weed is like death in the pot, <hi>Mors in Olla.</hi>
                                 <pb n="66" facs="tcp:103619:33"/>
But there is somthing too, now I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that most immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us, their Act of Twenty two thousand men to be ready to invade us upon all occasions. This I hear, that the Lords of the Council there have treated as they do all other Laws, and expounded it into a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Army of Six Thousand Men. I am sure we have Reason and Right to beseech the King that that Act may be better considered in the next Parliament there. I shall say no more for <hi>Scotland</hi> at this time, I am afraid your Lordships will think I have said too much, having no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern there; but if a <hi>French</hi> Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Man should come to dwell in my House and Family, I should think it concerned me to ask what he did in <hi>France;</hi> for if he were there a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, a Rogue, a Plunderer, I should desire him to live elsewhere; and I hope your Lordships will do the same thing for the Nation, if you find Cause.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="67" facs="tcp:103619:33"/>My Lords, Give me leave to speak two or three words concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our other Sister, <hi>Ireland:</hi> Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I hear is sent <hi>Douglas's</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to secure us against the <hi>French.</hi> Besides, I am credibly informed that the Papists have their Arms restor'd, and the Protestants are not many of them yet recovered from being the suspected Party. The Sea-Towns as well as the <hi>In-land,</hi> are full of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists: That Kingdom cannot long continue in the <hi>English</hi> hands, if some better care be not taken of it. This is in your Power, and there is nothing there but is under your Laws. Therefore I beg, that this Kingdom at least, may be taken into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, together with the State of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> for I am sure there can be no safety here, if these Doors are not shut up and made sure.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> gives a large ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in his Narrative of two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times that he had attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to kill the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and that he had been instigated thereto by the popish Priests, and that the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> particularly had offer'd him Five Hundred pounds to perform it, whereof he received Twenty pounds in part, but that still he had been providentially disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of that barbarous enterprise.</p>
                  <p>One day Dame <hi>Cellier</hi> demanded of him whether he had dispatched the aforesaid Earl, and he replying that he could have no opportunity to come at him; <hi>Give me the Pony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi>

says she, <hi>you shall see what a Woman can do for the Catholick Cause:</hi> And accordingly, by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation of the Devil, and a hellish rage, which the Papists miscall a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Zeal, she addressed her self to the Execution of that execrable Design. She makes a visit to the Earl, under pretence of paying her Thanks for Favours obtain'd through his means; but the consecrated Dagger still lurk'd under the skirt of her Gown, ready to have exprest her Gratitude by opening the Veins of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Peers Heart. He had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be over fond of the conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such cattle, and therefore in short time she was dismist without having an opportunity of putting her philonious and trecherous design in execution.</p>

What base and vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous Arts the Papists used to destroy the Lord <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> is not only evident by their many endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to have stabbed him, as hath been deposed by divers persons, to whom the Parliament as well as the Nation have given belief, but may be further confirmed by their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Letters directed to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; and after they had (in a hand as near the Original as they could counterfeit) inserted Treason in them, they were transmitted to such as would certainly acquaint our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters with it. In short one story of their mischievous practice in this kind is this: There is a Gentleman who was a Commander of a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Horse in the late Kings ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and lost all for his sake, and his present Majesties, writ to this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Peer about relieving him against the Gout, with which he useth be

afflicted: This Letter was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and (the person then living in the <hi>French</hi> King's Dominions) after adding to it an account, That the Writer was able to furnish the Earl with Forty thousand men from <hi>France,</hi> to oppose the D. of <hi>York</hi>'s Interest: It was then conveyed to some of the <hi>French</hi> King's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, who they supposed would send a Copy of it hither; but by a strange providence the Original was returned into the Gentleman's own hands.</p>

and the Assassination of Justice <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold,</hi> were caution sufficient to any discerning Protestant; and now that method had been so shamefully and notoriously detected, and cast such a just <hi>Odium</hi> upon their party, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means must be attempted: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so suitable to their Genius as an Oath; and it is no marvel if those who can't ordinarily discourse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out discharging loud <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103619:44"/>
the said dangers to be as great as we, in the midst of our fears, could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine them; and so pressing, that our Liberties, Religion, Lives, and the whole Kingdom would certainly be lost, if a speedy provision was not made against them.</p>
                           <p>And your Majesty on the <hi>21st</hi> of <hi>April, 1679.</hi> having called unto your Council many Honourable and Worthy Persons, and declared to them, and to the whole Kingdom, That being sensible of the evil effects of a single Ministry, or private Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or foreign Committee, for the general Direction of your Affairs, your Majesty would for the future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all things unto that Council, and by the constant Advice of them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the frequent use of your great Council the Parliament, your Majesty was hereafter resolved to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Kingdom: We began to hope we should see an end of our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series.</p>
                           <p>But, to our unspeakable grief and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103619:45"/>
sorrow, we soon found our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions frustrated; the Parliament then subsisting was prorogued, and dissolved, before it could perfect what was intended for our relief and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: And tho another was thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on called, yet by many prorogations it was put off till the <hi>21st</hi> of <hi>Octob.</hi> past; and notwithstanding your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty was then again pleased to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that neither your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, nor your Kingdom could be safe, till the matter of the Plot was gone through: It was unexpectedly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued on the <hi>10th</hi> of this Month, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any sufficient Order could be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken therein: All their just and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Endeavours to save the Nation were overthrown, the good Bills they had been industriously preparing to Unite your Majesties Protestant Subjects brought to nought: The discovery of the Irish Plots sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled: The Witnesses that came in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more fully to declare that, both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103619:45"/>
Those foreign Kingdoms and States, who by a happy conjunction with us, might give a check to the French Powers, disheartned, even to such a despair of their own security against the growing greatness of that Monarch; as we fear may enduce them to take new Resolutions, and perhaps such as may be fatal to Us: the Strength and Courage of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, both at home and abroad, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, and our selves left in the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

                              </gap>tmost danger of seeing our Country brought into utter desolation.</p>
                           <p>In these extremities we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing under God to comfort us, but the hopes that your Majesty (being touched with the groans of your pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing People) would have suffered your Parliament to meet at the day unto which it was prorogued, and that no further interruption should have been given to their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in order to their saving of the Nation: But that failed us too; so then we heard that your Majesty
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103619:46"/>
had been prevailed with to dissolve it, and to call another to meet at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where neither Lords nor Commons can be in safety, but will be daily exposed to the Swords of the Papists, and their Adherents, of whom too many are crept into your Majesties Guards. The Liberty of speaking according to their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences will be thereby destroyed, and the validity of all their Acts and Proceedings (consisting in it) left disputable. The straitness of the place no way admits of such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of persons as now follows eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Parliament: The Witnesses which are necessary to give Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence against the popish Lords; such Judges, or others, whom the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons have impeached, or had resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to impeach, can neither bear the charge of going thither, nor trust themselves under the protection of a Parliament, that is itself evidently under the power of Guards and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>

               <p>In <hi>October,</hi> during the Session of the last Parliament, it is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that <hi>Francisco de Faria,</hi> Interpreter to the <hi>Portugal</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, amongst other high matters relating to the popish Plot, gave it in his Information at the Bar of the House; He declared that the said Ambassador had tempted him to kill the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103619:47"/>
a Hand-Granado into his Coach, as he was passing the Rode into the Country.</p>
               <p>And about the 20th of <hi>Novemb.</hi> one <hi>Zeal</hi> being called to the Bar of the House delivered his Information at the Bar, the purport whereof was this: That being a Prisoner in the <hi>Marshalsea,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> came di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times to him, and treated with him, not only to be Instrumental him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but to procure others to Assist him to fire His Majesties Ships as they lay in the Harbour; as also to swear against the E of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> such Art<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>To sum up the many various Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods and Waies that were devised, and put in execution to cut off the Life of this Noble Peer, would be Task enough to fill many Volumes. The Jesuites (next to the Attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting His Majesties Life) set all their Inventions and Engines on work, to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103619:48"/>
make away the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury;</hi> he was the Beam in their Eye, the Clog that hindered the motion of their Curst Designs. What have they not attempted that might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him distastful to the King? throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foulness of their own Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons upon him, as appears by the Deposition of <hi>Brian Haines</hi> before the Council in <hi>Octob.</hi> 1681. That <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Fitz Girald</hi> told the said <hi>Brian Haines,</hi> that he the said <hi>Fitz Girald</hi> possessed His Majesty, and had given it under his hand and Seal, that the late Plot was a Presbyterian Plot, and Invented by the Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Anthony</hi> Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> on purpose to Extirpate the Family of the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> and dethrone his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Majesty, and turn <hi>England</hi> into a Common-wealth, or else set the Crown upon the Earls own Head; with more to this purpose, of which we shall have occasion to make far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mention, when we come to the Tryal of the said Earl; and shall

therefore now hasten to the Meeting of the Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where Business of as high nature was agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, as ever came before the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of a Parliament, no less than the preservation of the King's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, the Protestant Religion, and the good people of <hi>England;</hi> all which were now, as much as ever In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded by the Bloody Designs of the Papists.</p>
               <p>This Parliament met the 21th of <hi>March</hi> 1681. in the Convocation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>House at <hi>Oxford.</hi> The House of Lords Sare in the Geometry School, where was a Throne and State Erected for His Majesty, in which His Majesty being Seated in His Royal Robes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himself to both Houses to the Effect following.</p>

That by Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this Parliament so soon, he let them see, that no Irregularities of Parliament should make him out of love with them; by which means he gave them another opportunity to provide for the Publick Security, and had given one Evidence more that he had not neglected his part.</p>
                           <p>That he hoped the ill Success of former Heats, would dispose them to a better Temper. That as for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prosecution of the Plot, Trial of

the Lords, &amp;c. he omitted to press them, as being obvious to considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so necessary for the Publick Safety: But desired them not to lay so much weight upon any One Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient against Popery, as to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that all other were ineffectual.</p>
                           <p>That what he had so often decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red touching the Succession, he should not recede from.

Little beside was done until the 25. when the House considered an Act for Repeal of the Act 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which had passed both Houses in the last Parliament, but had not been ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to His Majesty for his Royal Assent.

               <p>The same day the Examination of <hi>Edward Fitz-Harris,</hi> relating to the popish Plot was read in the House, upon which the said Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was ordered to be Printed, the said <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> to be impeached

               <p>Upon rejecting the Impeachment of Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> giving for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, why it was the undoubted Right of the Commons so to do; because great Offences that influence the Parliament, were most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally determined in Parliament, nor could the complaint be determined any where else: For that if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty should be indicted in the <hi>Kings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bench,</hi> or any other inferiour Court, for the same offence, yet it were not the same suit; an Impeachment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the suit of the People, but an Indictment at the suit of the King.

House of Peers as to Impeachments, proceeding by vertue of their Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, not their Legislative, Power, could not deny any suitor, but more especially the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> no more than the Courts of <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> or any other inferiour Courts, could legally deny any suit or crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cause, regularly brought before them.

               <p>And now to return to what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, for the finishing this Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal story, I shall mention only what is already printed, either in Captain <hi>Wilkinson</hi>'s Information, <hi>Colledg</hi>'s Trial, or else is matter of Fact, or set forth in the Trial of this great Peer himself. Only I cannot omit that on the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>Aug.</hi> 1681. Mrs. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> gave a deposition upon Oath, that her Husband a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Execution, not only told

her what great offers he had made him if he would at first have char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that Infamous and Treasonable Libel, for which he was after exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, on this worthy Peer, and the Lord <hi>Howard;</hi> but that he also ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised her to do it as the only means to save his Life, though he protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the same time that they were wholly innocent. She likewise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth that a certain Gentleman, whose Name shall be for born assured her that she should have what summs of Money she pleased, if she would accuse the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> and Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> as the Authors of the said Libel: But they have tampered with so many on the account of this baffled Design, that it's impossible but their consults should take wind, especially when we consider they were a people, that either to supply their necessities, or feed their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or more probably through an irresistible Fatality, had blab'd and discovered the very <hi>Arcana</hi> of Holy

What security could the Romish Sophisters have, but that these crackt Vessels would prove as leaky again, when under the force of a Temptation? But they had such a Modly of Evidences, as is almost comical to consider. There were the <hi>Mac's</hi> and the <hi>Mounsieur's,</hi> the Midwife, and the Priest, the skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennel, and the Newgate-Birds, the Justice, and the Bog-trotter, the Counte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s and the Kitchin Wench. No discourse was heard among them, But Captains places, Deanries, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, Gratuities, Preferments, and as much Money as you will. They were advanced from Bonny-Clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Clarett, and Frontineack; from Torneps and Oat cakes, to Oysters &amp; Pheasants; from Brogues and Bandle, to Velvet, and Cloath of Silver. They discoursed of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty as if they had been of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and of his great Ministers, as if
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103619:53"/>
had been their Confederates. But there hath been so much said of these, upon Depositions taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore divers of the Magistrates of the Nation; that I shall take no farther notice of them before I proceed to Captain <hi>Wilkinson</hi>'s Information; only insert one passage of <hi>David Fitz-Girald,</hi> and it was given in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Oath, by Mr. <hi>E.

Such was the Impudence of this wretched man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not only to seek the Lives of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and to reflect upon his supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, but to procure and subo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:103619:54"/>Captain <hi>Wilkinson</hi> was a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that had always espoused the Royal Interest, and hazarded his Life and Fortune in the service of his Prince; but having not had that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess that a brave and industrious man might expect, he applied himself to the Proprietors of <hi>Carolina,</hi> to obtain an Employment in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and upon that score had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the Lord <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> (in consideration of his great sufferings for His Majesty) of a considerable and honourable Employment there; but was unfortunately made a Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> for Debt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could enter upon that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; of which he gives a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory account in his Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a breviate of which take as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from the Printed Narrative:</p>
               <p>This person (being known to be under very ill Circumstances, and in some measure acquainted with the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi>) they thought very proper to work over to their
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103619:54"/>
design, for (could they have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it) his Evidence (having been a person of a standing credit) would have struck deeper than all the <hi>Mac's</hi> about the Town: Therefore on the 8th of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1681. one <hi>Walter Bains</hi> came to him at the <hi>Kings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bench</hi> Prison, and after some infinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating discourse, told him, that he could not but know much of the Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi>'s Designs against the King; and that he might do well to discover it to him; that he had an Interest with the Lord <hi>Hyde,</hi> and had lately been with Mr. <hi>Graham,</hi> by which it seems the Captain appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended what was the meaning of his kindness, but constantly asserted that he knew nothing of my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi>'s Designs against His Majesty, but had cause to believe the said Earl loves his Majesty, for that he was always pleased to shew the Captain Respect upon account of his services to the King.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bains</hi> continued his importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103619:55"/>
on the same Subject to the Captain, until near night, and then left him full of great assurance, and promises to see him in few daies; not much questioning the Captains knowledge of the Earls Design.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>W. Narrat.</hi> On the 11th of the same month one <hi>Booth</hi> came to him upon the same design, and after much discourse told the Captain, he had now an opportunity to do himself a greater kindness than ever, for he might have either 10000 <hi>l.</hi> or 500 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> settled on himself or his Heirs, if he would but disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver what he knew of the Lord <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> and his Design, in changing the Government to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and witness against him: He further told him, now was the time to do something that would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance him, for it must now be a King or a Common-wealth; much more was then urged to induce the Captain to it, to which he gave such Answers as might encourage <hi>Booth</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:103619:55"/>
to go on with his Proposals. In the mean time the Captain imparts this Affair to another person in the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> and desired him to put it in writing, (lest he should be tempted with what offers were made) that in such case if he should ever declare that he knew any thing of a Design against the King by the Lord <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> that then this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son should witness the Truth against him, the said Captain; and further, that the Captain would still give the said person a full account of all Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations about that Affair. Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> told him, he must appear at Court, and he should have an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a Reward from some persons of Honour; the Captain told him, he would not trust any Courtier he knew for a Groat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>W. Narrat.</hi> On the 12th of <hi>Octob.</hi> they were at the Captain again, and plied him with Wine and good words, to work upon him to come in a Witness against the L. <hi>Shaftes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:103619:56"/>
telling him, he might be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of what he desired from the E. of <hi>H.</hi> and the L. <hi>H.</hi> He told them, if they would give him 20000 Guinys towards his own, and his friends losses, by Injuries sustained, he would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> discover what he knew; but still said he knew nothing of any Design by my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much more was transacted in this matter, as is more at large set forth in the Captain's Information. But at length they came on the 15th day with a Warrant, which the Marshal shewed him, whereby he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to go to <hi>Whitehall.</hi> In a short time after his coming thither, he was conducted to Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins</hi>'s Office, where was also my Lord <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> who very fairly and honestly interrogated him concerning what he knew about my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> and of any Design against His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; he gave the same Answer to them as he had done to the former Attackers, that he knew nothing;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103619:56"/>
great Arguments were used, but he could give no satisfactory Answer, as (he conceived) was expected. In a little time His Majesty came into the Office, and was pleased to say to the Captain, that His Majesty knew him well, that the Captain had served his Father, and His Majesty faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and he hoped the Captain would not decline his Obedience. To which the Captain answered, that he never deserved to be suspected: His Majesty was pleased further to tell him, he had not had the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to serve his Friends, but hoped he might: His Majesty was pleased to promise to consider him for his sufferings. Then after an excellent Exhortation, in which His Majesty told him that the kindness was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, was not with design to speak a word but Truth it self, and if he knew the Captain, or any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son did, he would never endure them: His Majesty demanded what he knew of a Design against his Person
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103619:57"/>
and Government? he answered, he knew nothing of any Design against His Majesties Person or Government; that he admired why one that had so faithfully served His Majesty, and Royal Father, both in <hi>England,</hi> and beyond Sea, and was so Instrumental to His Majesties Restauration, should be suspected. But some persons had possessed His Majesty, that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was deep in some Design against the Government, and knew much of my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury:</hi> At length af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much pressing, His Majesty told him, if he would say, As he hoped to be saved, he knew nothing of any Design against his Person, that then His Majesty would believe him; which the Captain having said in the very words, His Majesty seemed to be much surprized at it, and left him to the management of the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who used such Arguments as he thought fit: At last the Captain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he knew his Duty to his Soveraign, and would never draw
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:103619:57"/>
his Sword against him, but could freely do it against some of the Court, who were Enemies both to His Majesty and his Friends. So he was taken into another Room, where were His Majesty, Lord Chancellor, Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> Lord <hi>Hide,</hi> two Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries of State, and Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice <hi>Pemberton;</hi> Mr. <hi>Graham, Booth,</hi> and <hi>Baines</hi> were present. My Lord Chancellor would not believe but that he must be guilty of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great things against the Lord <hi>Shaftesbury;</hi> he told them, if he could not be believed on his word there, if they pleased to bring my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> to his Tryal, he should declare in open Court upon his Oath, what his knowledge was, without any hopes of gain or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement; the Lord Chancellor wittily replied, there were two sorts of Advancements, and he was like to come to his own Tryal first, before the Lord <hi>Shaftesbury.</hi> My Lord Chancellor demanded, if he had no
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103619:58"/>
Commission for this New Service a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst His Majesty, to which the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain answered, No. Then the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor told him, he was to have a Troop to consist of Fifty Men; the Capt. said that was a small Troop; he hoped, if ever he had Command of a Troop, it should be a better than that: But the Captain desired to know, who gave that Information. The Lord Chancellor told him, Mr. <hi>Booth,</hi> who was (by, and) Listed under him. Captain <hi>Wilkinson</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired <hi>Booth</hi> to tell him, whether he had given this Information upon Oath, <hi>Booth</hi> answered, Yes, and it was true. At all this the Captain was not concerned: so much doth glorious Innocence triumph over the Forgeries, and Impious Designs of Evil men, and out-braves them even in Death it self.</p>
               <p>That which is very observable in Captain <hi>Wilkinsons</hi> Information, is, That at that very time when <hi>Booth</hi> had sworn he was to have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103619:58"/>
a party of Horse at <hi>Oxford,</hi> his whole Family, Wife, Children, and Servants, making about the number of 37 persons, were all on Board his Ship, bound for <hi>Carolina,</hi> and all lying at his proper charge; but when he thought himself most in readiness for his intended Voyage, he found himself strangely entangled, that he could not stir, some Debts he was bound for for others, and more of his own fell upon him, and he was committed to the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> which put a stop to the designed Voyage; and he hath often since concluded there was a Divine hand in it.</p>
               <p>I have thought it proper to insert in this place the Testimony of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Jervas James,</hi> whose Loyalty and Integrity to his Majesty hath been sufficiently known, having most faithfully, and as a true Subject, served His Majesty both beyond the Sea and at home, and declares is still ready with all chearfulness (when his
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103619:59"/>
Majesty shall please to command him) to serve him to the last drop of his Blood. He acknowledgeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as is it by Law established, and hath without scruple taken the Oaths of Allegiance, and Supremacy. He stiles the acquaintance he hath with so deserving a person as Captain <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinson,</hi> a great Happiness, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth himself obliged to him for so timely entrusting him with so notable a secret, being a stranger to the said Captain, which trust Major <hi>James</hi> lookt upon as a great Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Discovery to endanger the Lives both of the Earl of <hi>Shaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesbury,</hi> and Captain <hi>Wilkinson.</hi> He likewise declares, before God and Man, that he believes all the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Information to contain nothing but the truth of what he had from <hi>Booth, Bains,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Graham:</hi> For he lent him the convenience of his Chamber to write the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, and saw him write it with his
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103619:59"/>
own Hand; as may also be witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Mr. <hi>Robert Bennet,</hi> who is an Officer in <hi>Leaden-Hall-Market,</hi> and transcribed it for the Captain. He hopes his Majesty is, and will be, well satisfied, that those who faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and truly serve His Majesty, and his Subjects, are the persons both to be believed, and relied upon, and desires that this may have credit, according to its Truth and Reality, both in the heart of his Majesty, and all his loyal Subjects.</p>

               <p>This forementioned Information was published by Captain <hi>Henry Wilkinson,</hi> during the time of my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi>'s confinement in the Tower, and was of very great use to satisfie all loyal and honest minded men, of the base and detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble practices of those evil minded persons, against his Life; and in how dreadful a condition would the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have been, if through the means of these, or such like Witnesses, the guilt of shedding Innocent Blood

                  </gap>t the 29th of <hi>July,</hi> 1681. the Right Honourable <hi>Anthony</hi> Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> was apprehended at his own House by a Serjeant at Arms, and carried before the King and Council, and after some Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he was committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> upon a charge of High Treason; the Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> having been committed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, upon an Information that he had assisted in contriving Mr. <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Harris</hi>'s Libel, and <hi>Stephen Colledg,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> having likewise been committed about the 25th of the same Month. It is said, that some days after his Lordships commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that as he was taking the Air in the Tower, meeting accidentally with one of the popish Lords, he was asked by him, what his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship did there, and that they little

                  </gap> during the whole time of his Lordships consinement in the Tower, he appeared to be very chearful, and that many times he assumed a Courage and Vivacity, beyond what could have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, from a person labouring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such violent pains and diseases, as is well known his Lordship is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently troubled withal.</p>
               <p>And now that we may not omit to you with what other Methods and Designs they endeavoured to fasten the black &amp; Hellish figure of a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor on this loyal Peer, it will not be improper to take notice of a passage in the Trial of Mr. <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Harris,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> upon Oath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> had told him; that horrid Libel was to have been fathered upon the Protestant

Nonconformists, and when Collonel <hi>Mansel</hi> had deposed, that Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Waller</hi> had said the design of <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Harris</hi>'s Libel, was against the Protestant Party, Mr. Attorney<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral replied, we believe it, <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Party.</hi> And how far this Peer was to have been concerned in that, will further appear, if we take in what Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the said Trial, that Mr. <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Harris</hi> had told him, there were two Parliament Men which frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi>'s, whom his Lordship did not suspect, that came and sounded him, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the French Ambassadour, and acquainted him with all they could discover.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Thursday</hi> the 24th of <hi>Novem.</hi> 1681. the great Affair for which the Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> was committed to the Tower, was tried at the Sessions House at the <hi>Old Bayly:</hi> It may be excusable if we be the more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and large in this matter, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert

               </p>
               <p>He told them the Intention of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying War, was not Treason, before this Act, unless it had taken Effect, and War had been actually Levyed; and then as to the Designing and Compassing the King's Death, that was not Treason, unless it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by an Overt Act: As to the Imprisoning, or Restraining the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the King, they of themselves were not High Treason; but now by this Law they were made so, during
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103619:64"/>
His Majesties Life; and the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing of them, whether it take Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or no, though it be prevented (before any Overt Act) by the timely Prudence of the King, and his Officers, though it should be timely prevented, that there is no hurt done; yet the very Design, if it be but uttered, and spoken, and any waies signified by any Discourse, that this was made Treason by this Act. Formerly it was said, and said truly, That words alone were not Treason, but that since this Act words that import any Malicious Design against the King's Life, or Government, any Traiterous Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Party, such words are Treason now within this Act.</p>
               <p>Then as to the Indictments that were to be brought before them, he advised them to consider, 1.

He urged pretty much to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and then told them Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or Pity was neither their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, nor his; that there was no room for that in Enquiries of such a nature, that it was reserved to a Higher and Superiour Power, from whence theirs was derived: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he required them to consider such Evidence <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> should be given them; and prayed God to direct them in their Enquiry, that Justice might take place.</p>
               <p>Then a Bill of High <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

                  </hi> moved, that the Evidence might be heard in Court.</p>
               <p>Then the Lord Chief Justice told the Jury that the King's Council de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired (and they could not deny it) that the Evidence might be publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given, and prayed them to take their places, and hear the Evidence that should be given.</p>
               <p>The Jury desired a Copy of their
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103619:66"/>
Oath, which the Court granted, and then withdrew, after some time they returned, and then the Clerk called them by their Names. Then the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man gave the L. C. J. an account, that it was the Opinion of the Jury, that they ought to Examine the Witnesses in private; and it hath been the constant practice of our Predecessors to do it; and they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted upon it as their Right to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine in private, because they were bound to keep the K's Secrets, which could not be done, if the Examination were in Court. Whereupon the L. C. J. told 'em, that perhaps some late usage had brought them into that Errour, that it was their Right, that the Witnesses were alwaies sworn in Court, and surely (he said) Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was alwaies given in Court formerly: That it was for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as well as the King's, that nothing might be done clandestinly; that by their keeping Counsel, was meant keeping secret their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Debates.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:103619:66"/>To which the Foreman replied, That he begg'd his Lordships par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, if he were in a mistake: The Jury apprehend they were bound by the very words of their Oath, to Examine in private; for it says, They shall keep the King's Secrets, and their own Counsels; That there could be no Secret in publick. Then Mr. <hi>Papillion</hi> spoke to this purpose, That they had heard, that what had been the Custom of <hi>England,</hi> had been the Law of <hi>England;</hi> and if it had been the Antient Usage and Custom of <hi>England,</hi> that had never been altered from time to time. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Arguments were used on both sides; but at last the Court denied a private Examination; then the Foreman told the Court, that the Jury desired it might be Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they had insisted upon it as their Right, but if the Court over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled it, they must submit. This was likewise refused by the Court. Then Sheriff <hi>Pilkington</hi> desired that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103619:67"/>
the Witnesses might be put out of Court, and called in one by one, but he was refused it, and told it was not his Duty. And Mr. Attorney General said, he appeared against the King. However, it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward granted to the Jury. Then was Read the Indictment against <hi>Anthony</hi> Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> for High Treason against His Majesty, which being too long here to insert, we are forced to omit.</p>
               <p>The Jury desired a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ist of the Witnesses Names, but they were told, they would have them Endor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on the back of the Indictment, when that was delivered to them. Then the Foreman acquainted the Court, that the Jury desired a Copy of the Warrant, by which the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> was Committed, because there might several Questions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it: But my Lord Chief Justice answered, That was not in the power of the Court to grant, for that it was in the hands of the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103619:67"/>
of the <hi>Tower,</hi> which he kept for his Indemnity, and they could not demand it of him upon any terms. Then Mr. <hi>Papillion</hi> moved that they might hear what the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses had to give in Evidence, one by one, and that after the Jury might withdraw, to consider what proper Questions to ask them, and after might come down again, which the Court granted. Then all the Witnesses were ordered to go out of the Court, and to be called in one by one.</p>

Mr. <hi>Blithwayt</hi> gave account, that that Paper was put into his hands by Mr. <hi>Gwin,</hi> Clerk of the Council, who had seized it amongst others in my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi>'s house; and that he had took that, and others out of a Velvet Bagg, which Mr. <hi>Gwin</hi> had lockt up in the great Trunk. Then Mr. <hi>Gwin</hi> testified that he had the great Hair
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103619:68"/>
Trunk in my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi>'s house, when he was sent there to search for Papers, by Order of the Council the second of <hi>July;</hi> my Lord, as soon as he came there, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him the Keys, and said, He would seal them up with his own Seal; but afterwards sent Mr. <hi>Gwin</hi> word, if he pleased, he might put his own Seal; that he had taken a note how he had parted several par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of Papers, that there were seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sorts of them in the great Hair Trunk; and there was a Velvet Bag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into which he had put some Papers that were loose in my Lord's Closet above Stairs; that he had put his Seal upon the Trunk, and being sent another way, had put it into the Custody of Mr. <hi>Blithwait.</hi> The Lord Chief Justice asked Mr. <hi>Gwin</hi> whether all the Papers in the Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet Bag were in my L. <hi>Shaftesbury</hi>'s Closet, and whether there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in that Bag, but what he had taken in my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi>'s

               <p>Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins</hi> witnessed that that was the Paper he had of Mr. <hi>Blithwayt.</hi> Some things I am forced for brevity to omit. My Lord Chief Justice said, Now it appears this was the Paper taken in my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury's</hi> Closet. And the Paper was Read, which contained the words of that commonly called <hi>The Form of an Association.</hi> When it had been Read, Sir <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

Particularly, that the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> should say, that the Parliament would never grant the King Money, nor satisfie him in those things that he desired, unless he first gave the People satisfaction in those things that they insisted on before; and particularly the Bill of Excluding the Duke of <hi>York</hi> from the Crown.

Evil Advice: That those Lords should by Violence be taken from the King, and the King brought to <hi>London,</hi> where those things should be Establisht which they designed for their Safety in those two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, for the preserving the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion, and likewise for the defending and keeping us safe from Arbitrary Power and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And likewise, that the said <hi>Booth</hi> had provided Arms, and a good Stone-Horse for himself, and Arms for his Man, before the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Sate at <hi>Oxford.</hi> That the <hi>Thursday</hi> before the Parliament was Dissolved, Captain <hi>Wilkinson</hi> told him, he expected that very week to be called up to <hi>Oxford,</hi> with those men that were Listed with him; but <hi>Saturday</hi> bringing News of the Dissolution of the Parliament, it had no further Effects.

sent for by my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> by one Captain <hi>Manly,</hi> his Lordship should tell him, that Mr. <hi>Hethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi> had told him, he was afraid the Irish Witnesses would go over to the Court Party, and retract what they had said formerly, that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised him to persuade them not to go near that Rogue <hi>Fitz-Girald,</hi> that great Villain, that is pamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and maintain'd by the King and the Court party, to stifle the Plot in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that the Earl had further said, That if the King were not as well satisfied with the coming in of Popery, as ever the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was, do you think the Duke of <hi>York</hi> would be so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the bringing in of Popery as he is? That a little before my Lord went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> he should tell the said <hi>Smith,</hi> there were great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations made, and a great many gathered together upon the Rode be tween <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Smith</hi> asking his Lordship what it might
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:103619:72"/>
mean, my Lord should answer, that it was only to terrifie the Parliament to comply with the Kings desire, which he was sure the Parliament would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do: That they were now more resolute than ever: That they clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saw the Kings aim was to bring in Popery: That they had the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for them, and might lawfully oppose him, and he would meet with very strong opposition; for that all that came out of the Country should be well Hors'd, and armed, and so they should all be: That the City had resolved to bear the charge of their Members, and send so many men to wait on them; and that he would be hang'd before he would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bring in Popery, or any thing of that nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bryan Hains</hi> deposed, that among other Discourse with the L. <hi>Shaftes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> the said Earl told him, that the Duke of <hi>Bucks</hi>'s Mother was descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Family of the <hi>Plant agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,</hi> naming some of the <hi>Edwards,</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:103619:72"/>
and that in her Right he should have the Barony of <hi>Ross,</hi> and in her Right had as good a Title to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> as ever any <hi>Stewart</hi> had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Macknamara</hi> deposed, That a little after the Parliament had been dissolved at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> said to him, That the King was Popishly affected, that he took the same methods that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before him took, which brought his Head to the block, and said, <hi>We will also bring his thither;</hi> and that the Earl had said the King deserved to be deposed as much as ever King <hi>Richard</hi> the second did.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Edward Ivey</hi> said, that the Earl
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103619:73"/>
of <hi>Shafton</hi> soon after the Parliament was dissolved at <hi>Oxford,</hi> speaking against the King, said he was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just man, and unfit to reign, that he was a Papist in his heart, and would introduce Popery: That another time he heard him exclaim against the King, and that they designed to depose him, and set another in his stead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bernard Dennis</hi> deposed, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst divers other things the Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> had told him, that they intended to have <hi>England</hi> under a Common-Wealth, and no Crown, to have no supream head, particular Man, or King, nor owe Obedience to a Crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord Chief Justice</hi> told the Jury, they intended to call no more Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses against the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> the Jury being charged only with that.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Papillion</hi> desired to know what S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>atute the Indictment was grounded upon; my Lord Chief Justice said it
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103619:73"/>
was <hi>contra formam Statut</hi>', which might be understood <hi>Statutorum,</hi> or <hi>Statuti,</hi> so they might go upon all Statutes that might be the form o that Indictment. The Jury desired to know whether any of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses stood indicted or no. To which the Lord Chief Justice ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, they were not properly here to examine the credibility of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses; for that would be a matter upon a Tryal before a Petty Jury, where the King would be heard to defend the credibility of his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, if any thing were objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them: That they were to see whether the Statute were satisfied, in having matter that was Treasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and witnessed by Two Men, who are intended <hi>Prima facie</hi> credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unless of their own Knowledg they knew any thing to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Papillion</hi> prayed his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Opinion, whether his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship thought they were within the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:103619:74"/>
compass of their own Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Consciences, to give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for if they were not left to consider the credibility of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, they could not satisfie their Consciences. To which the Lord Chief Justice replied, that they ought to go according to the Evidence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less there were any thing to their own knowledg, and that i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to enter into proofs concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the credit of the Witnesses, it were impossible to do Justice at that rate. The Jury withdrew, and the Court adjourned till Three a Clock. When met the Jury put many questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Witnesses, of which (for brevity) I can but take notice of some.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Gwin</hi> was asked by the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whose writing the Paper was, to which he answered he could not tell: whether it was in the Closet before he came there; he said it was certainly in the closet, for there he found it, he knew not the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103619:74"/>
Paper, but all the Papers in the bag were there.</p>
               <p>They asked whether he knew not of a Discourse of an Association in Parliament. He said he was not of the last Parliament, but had heard an Association talked of. Then the Foreman asked Mr. Secretary <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> whether he knew not of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in Parliament concerning an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation, whether he remembred not that it was read upon occasion of the Bill: The Secretary answered, that he was not present at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; that there was an answer to a Message from the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, had somthing in it which did strongly imply somthing of an Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation; that he heard such a thing spoke of, but was not present at the Reading. Being asked the date of the Warrant for my Lord <hi>Shaftesbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s commitment, he must (he said) refer himself to the Warrant; that he thought it was about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>July.</hi> Being asked whether
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103619:75"/>
all the Witnesses had been examined before the Committee, he answered, they were, and he was present at the Examination. Being asked again whether all, he said he knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all; but he was sure he was at the Examination of several, but could not tell how many.</p>
               <p>Then the Jury examined the rest of the Witnesses, one by one, <hi>Booth</hi> being asked whether he had easie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into my Lords company, said, he ever went with Capt. <hi>Wilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and had easie admittance; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Captain <hi>Wilkinson</hi> were with him every time, he said, no, not every time, not this time; to divers other questions he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered; That he had been in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; that he had not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted for Fellony; that he did not directly know any one man of the Fifty beside himself; that he never was with my Lord but at his own House; that he was never desired to be a Witness against my Lord, until
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103619:75"/>
he had intimated something of it, till he was told of <hi>Brownrigg</hi> the <hi>Yorkshire</hi> Attorney, concerning som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what my Lord had said to <hi>Irish</hi> men, he then said he was sure there was somthing as to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to <hi>English</hi> men; that he thought he had no Commission to offer him a Reward; that he was not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Callaghan,</hi> nor <hi>Downing;</hi> never heard their names, nor was in their company, that he knew of; that he knew not one Mr. <hi>Shelden,</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Marriot,</hi> only had heard of one <hi>Marriot</hi> that belong'd to the D. of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> but never was in his company, nor discoursed with from him, but had heard from <hi>Baines,</hi> about <hi>Brownrigg,</hi> about <hi>Irish</hi> Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. Mr. <hi>Godfrey</hi> asked whether he had never heard of <hi>Irish</hi> Witnesses sent down by Mr. <hi>Marriot</hi> to the Isle of <hi>Ely:</hi> Then the L. Ch. Just. said, We have given you all the Liberty in the World, hoping you would ask pertinent questions, but these are
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103619:76"/>
trifles; he did not expect that any wise men would have asked such questions: Then he asked of Mr. <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> what it was to the purpose, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>Marriot</hi> sent any <hi>Irish</hi> Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses to his Tennant, or no. To which the Foreman told his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, that he had it under the hand of the Clerk of the Council. Mr. <hi>Turbervil</hi> answered to several que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, that he had the Discourse with my Ld. <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> about the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> and about <hi>July</hi> 4. communicated it to Mr. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary <hi>Jenkins.</hi> The Foreman then asking whether he had met with no body about the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> after my Lords Commitment, and when he was challenged, and told he was to be a Witness against him, whether he did not then say, as he was alive he knew no such thing?</p>
               <p>Mr. Attor. Gen. told my Lord, this was not to be allowed, this was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Instruction, which the Ju<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> was not to take. The Foreman replied,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103619:76"/>
no, it was no private Instruction, but asked <hi>Turbervill,</hi> whether he had not spoke such words to Mr. <hi>Herbert.</hi> Then the L. C. J. asked whether they had any Information touching that to Mr. <hi>Herbert;</hi> the Foreman said, he had, a long time ago, that the person told him so, set down the day, and was very angry with <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervill</hi> for it. The L. C. J. told them, that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses taken up at random, at Coffee-houses, were not fit to be brought in, when Treason was in question against the King's Life; that it was not ground to cavil at persons, because they heard such discourse at a Coffee-house.</p>
               <p>The Foreman said, he never was in a Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house with Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> in his life, but had the discourse of him some months ago. The L. C. J. asked whether they thought that groundenough against the Witness; Mr. <hi>Papillion</hi> replied, they only asked the question, whether he had not contradicted, or said the contrary to any body. <hi>Turbervill</hi> said, he did not remember he had said any thing to Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> in his life, and that at that time he was discarded by all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of my Lord's Interest; and if he would then have given under his hand, that he knew nothing against him, he believed he might have been in their favour as before. He was asked, whether he was not one of them that petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Common Council, and declared that he was tempted to witness against his Conscience; <hi>Turbervill</hi> said he did, but that he believed he
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103619:77"/>
never read the Petition, but was drawn to it by the order of Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> by a Scriviner about <hi>Guild-Hall.</hi> That his design in it was, that the City should take care of him; that he was not very poor, nor over full of money; some Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the House of Commons had told them, that the City should advance money for the support of the Witnesses, and that they were to Petition that they would answer the design of the Parliament; being asked what Members they were, he said, it was a Member of the House of Commons that told him so; he would assure them, he said what he spoke, was voluntarily, &amp; that he knew nothing more than what he had here declared; he supposed his Deposition was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in after the Commitment of my L. <hi>Shaftesbu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Smith</hi> being asked, whether he had not used to go by the name of <hi>Barry,</hi> said, he had gone by several names, as all Popish Priests do; he said, he had given in his Information to Secretary <hi>Jenkins;</hi> he thought a little after my L. was committed; but had given notice long before of what he intended to do to other persons. But the Questions put to him being not very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, and his Answers of little moment, for want of room, must be waved; and we come to <hi>Bryan Haines,</hi> who in answer to divers Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions put to him by the Jury, said, That he gave in his Information against my L. <hi>Shaftes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> the day that he the said <hi>Bryan</hi> was taken by a Messenger; that he had before given in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:103619:77"/>
another account to Sir <hi>G. Treby,</hi> of a design a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the L. <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> about <hi>March</hi> last, which was, That <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> had told him, that he had given it under his Hand to the King, that the E. of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> did resolve to set the Crown on his own Head, or turn the Kingdom to a Common-wealth; that he had discourse with my Ld. at several times, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at his own House, somtimes in <hi>Ironmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-Lane;</hi> that there <hi>Hains</hi> had proposed a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in <hi>Ireland;</hi> that the Earl said that was not the best way, they had other means to take, and so the Discourse was waved; being asked whether ever he had bin a Witness for, or against the Lady <hi>Windham,</hi> he said she a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested him, because he had said he lay with her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Macknamara</hi> answered to several questions put to him, that he had discourse with the Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April;</hi> that he could not tell exactly when he gave in his Information, but that it was to Secretary <hi>Jenkins;</hi> that <hi>Ivey</hi> was by when they had the discourse; That he signed the Petition to the Common Council, but did not see it till 'twas brought him to sign; that he did not read it, nor knew the Contents of it. Then Mr. <hi>Papil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> told the Court, that in that Petition they say, they were tempted to swear against their Consciences, and that some of the Witnesses had made Shipwrack of their Consciences; but if we should ask them who tempted them, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103619:78"/>
who those Witnesses were that made shipwrack of their Consciences, it would signifie nothing; for since they do not know what was in the Petition, it is in vain to ask them any more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. Macknamara</hi> said, he heard Mr. <hi>Colledg</hi> that was executed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> was concerned in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Petition by my L. <hi>Shaftsburys</hi> Advice.</p>
               <p>The Answer of <hi>Dennis Macknamara</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers questions put by the Jury, was to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, That he was introduced to my Lord by his Brother, in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April</hi> last, he knows not which; that none but <hi>Ivey</hi> was by; that he gave in his Information to the Secretary of State, long before the Earl was committed. Then Mr. <hi>Papillion</hi> proposed to the Court, whether they might not ask, if he had a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, for it would be satisfaction to them. Ld. Ch. Just. <hi>North</hi> answered, it might be proper when the Prisoner made Exceptions to the Witnesses, but that there were no Exceptions to the Witnesses. Mr. <hi>Papillion</hi> said they made no exceptions, but they must satisfie their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and that was very much as they found the credibility of the Witnesses.</p>
               <p>My L. Ch. J. <hi>North</hi> asked what he should have a Pardon for: Mr. <hi>Papillion</hi> answered for Crimes: My L. C. J. <hi>North</hi> said, They must not ask him to accuse himself. Mr. <hi>Papillion</hi> said, if he had a pardon he was in <hi>Statu quo;</hi> suppose my Ld. some of them have been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Poisoning, some of Felony, some of Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103619:78"/>
on the High way; they did but ask them if they were pardoned. L. C. J. <hi>North</hi> answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a Man must not be impeached, but where he may answer for it. Mr. <hi>Papillion</hi> said, My Lord, if you do not give leave we must for bear then. L. C. J. <hi>N.</hi> said he did not think it proper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward Ivey</hi> gave in answer to several que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions demanded of him, That the discourse he had with my Lord, was some time after the sitting of the Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> about the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> or beginning of <hi>April,</hi> that he could not be positive when he made his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, but it was given to the Secretary of State; that he thinks the two <hi>Macknamara's</hi> were by &amp; no body else; he is sure one of them was: That he gave his Information as soon as he could; that he knew nothing more than he had deposed.</p>
               <p>To Questions asked of <hi>Bernard Dennis,</hi> he answered to this purpose; That he had this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course in <hi>April,</hi> 4 or 5 days after the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was dissolved at <hi>Oxford,</hi> In <hi>March</hi> after the Parliament was dissolved at <hi>Oxford,</hi> that it was at his own House, that Mr. <hi>Shepheard,</hi> a Gentleman of my Lords, was there, and some of his Pages; but he could not tell whether they heard any thing; that my Lord did not whisper, that he made this Information in <hi>June,</hi> before my Lord was committed; that he gave it to Secretary <hi>Jenkins;</hi> that he concealed it so long, because he continued so long in the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103619:79"/>
City; That he had been a Protestant since <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary:</hi> that he had the Discourse with my Ld. in his own Chamber, the great Chamber, he knew not whether it was called the Hall, or the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor; that he knew nothing more but what he had declared; that he could not tell whether all his kindred were Papists, but most were.</p>
               <p>Then the Jury took up the Statute Book; and in short time came down, and returned the Bill <hi>Ignoramus.</hi> At which the People gave a great shout; the Attorney General desired it might be recorded, this hollowing and hooping in a Court of Justice.</p>
               <p>The Witnesses had several times declared they were in danger to be stoned by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, upon which the Sheriffs guarded them with a strong guard as far as <hi>Temple-Bar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nov.</hi> 28. 1681. His Lordship the E. of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> was brought up from the <hi>Tower,</hi> to the Bar of the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> upon <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Honour offering themselves for Bail, his Lordship prayed the Court, that some friends and relations of his own might be accepted; which was accordingly granted. The same time Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> a Gentleman belonging to the E. of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> (who had been committed to the <hi>Gate-house</hi> for Treason, during his Lordships Confinement in the <hi>Tower</hi>) was discharged upon Bail. And a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was Issued out for preventing of Bonfires, it not being thought fit that people should be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in their triumphs on that occasion; tho many considerable Towns and Cities in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, upon the news of the discharge of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> proclaimed their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103619:79"/>
by Bells and Bonfires. During the time of the Earl of <hi>Shaftesburies</hi> Confinement, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny made it their buisiness to detract, and vilipend him, 'twas the mode among some to drink his Health, with a <hi>Pendulum,</hi> at a Hempen string, to call him <hi>Ton<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

After this great Tryal, the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> (as it's said) arrested one <hi>Baines,</hi> one of the Witnesses against him, on a Writ of Conspiracy, and had likewise <hi>Booth,</hi> (a Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi>) with a Writ of the same nature, intending to do the like with other the Aspersours of his Honour, and Loyalty. One Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> of <hi>Staples</hi> Inn, and Mr. <hi>Craddock,</hi> of <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Noster-Row,</hi> were Arrested, about <hi>Decemb.</hi> on an Action of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> at the Suit of the said Earl.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monday, Feb.</hi> 14. 1681. My L. <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> my L. <hi>Howard</hi> appearing in <hi>Westm.</hi> Hall, it being the last day of the Term, and there being nothing to be charged against them, they were discharged, together with Mr. <hi>Wilmore,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Whitaker.</hi>

                  <hi>May</hi> 4. 1682. being the first of the Term, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made by the Council for Mr. <hi>Craddock,</hi> who (we said) had been Arrested by the Right Honourable the E. of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> and a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was delivered, that the E. intended to come to Tryal that Term. Mr. <hi>Craddock</hi>'s Council mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the great Intimacy betwixt his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and the Sheriffs, and Inhabitants of <hi>London,</hi> might influence the Jury; and therefore prayed the Court that the Trial thereof might be order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in another County.

                  <hi>May</hi> 12. The Council for Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> made a motion in Court to the same purport, as Mr. <hi>Crad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock</hi>'s Council had done. After which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship declared, That if he could not have the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of a Subject, to lay his Action in what County he pleased, he would remit it until such time as he had further considered it.
