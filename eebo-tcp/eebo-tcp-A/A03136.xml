         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

times of the one, and of the other Generall together, you shall finde
that there was neuer Towne so strongly fortified, hauing 3000 able

            <head>AN INFORMATION TO THE READER OF the State of BREDA Formerly.</head>
            <p>CVRTEOVS READER, the Cittie of <hi>Breda,</hi> taken in
this yeare by his Highnesse the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> lying in the
Land of <hi>Kempen,</hi> is a part of the Dukedome of great <hi>Brabant,</hi> and
the Head-Towne of a braue Barrony, hauing 16 villages, and a wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Towne vnder the Jurisdiction thereof. Among the which, there
is <hi>Steen-bergen,</hi> a Towne newly fortifyed, with a Strong-Fort, or
two vpon the hauen, <hi>Rosendale</hi> a great, and a very pleasant village, and
<hi>Osterhout</hi> a goodly Lord-ship. This Citty is situated, vpon a riuer
called the <hi>Marck,</hi> whose headspring beginneth some foure English
Miles aboue <hi>Hoogh-strate.</hi> It lyeth one and twentie English miles &amp;
a halfe from <hi>Lier,</hi> one and twenty from <hi>Anwerpe,</hi> 15 from <hi>Bergin op
Zoom,</hi> 15 from <hi>Turnhout,</hi> 9 from <hi>Seuenberke,</hi> and 6 from <hi>Getruyden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Citty, and Barronie fell by marriage to the illustrious house
of <hi>Nassaw</hi> Anno 1404, two hundred three and thirty yeares agoe:
For that yeare <hi>Count Englebert</hi> Eare af <hi>Nassaw,</hi> Espoused the Lady
<hi>Io ane</hi> the onely <hi>Inheritrix</hi> of this Barronie of <hi>Breda,</hi> and the Land of
<hi>Leck:</hi> for a long time it was the Court, and ancient ressidency of the
Earles <hi>of Nassaw,</hi> vntill such time that Duke <hi>D' Alva</hi> by his tirannie,
droue <hi>Prince William</hi> the old Prince of Orange, and Earle of <hi>Nassaw</hi>
(his Highnes Father of famous memorie) out of his ancient inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
It hath in it a goodly Castle double moated, founded by
<hi>Count Henry of Nassaw,</hi> which if it had bene finished, according to the
model thereof, it would haue bene one of the beautisullest, &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
Structures of Brabant. Since the Warres began, it hath bene
strongly fortified with many Bulwarks, Horneworks, Halfe-moons,
<pb facs="tcp:4197:4"/>
Rauelings, and a large moate round about the Towne in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
14. rod, or 180 foote broade, &amp; 9 or 10 foote deepe with a good
Counterskarfe without it. This Towne hath suffered much by the
warres, as by surprises, blocking vp, &amp; Seiges &amp; hath beene subiect to
many changes, some times being lost, and other-wiles regayned on
both sides: For in the yeere of our Lord 1585. <hi>Prince William</hi> of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
memorie enioyed it peaceably &amp; till <hi>Hautpenny,</hi> one of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
Commanders, surprized it that yeare on the 25 of Iune, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
it, and burnt diuerse houses in it, and so it continewed vnder
the power of the King of Spayne, vntill <hi>Prince Maurice</hi> (of famous
Memorie) by a braue <hi>Stratagem,</hi> vnder the conduct of Captaine <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangier,</hi>
who with 70 other vailliant, and resolute men, hid vnder a
Turfe-Schip, comming into the Castle by night, broke out of that
couert <hi>Ambuscado,</hi> cutt of a <hi>Corps degard,</hi> and tooke in the Castle, &amp;
Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> marching with part of the States Army, to second
his dessigne, tooke in both Castle, and Towne on the fourth of march
in the yeare 1590. After this (being an ill neighbour to the Busse)
<hi>Anthony Schtes</hi> the Gouenour thereof, and Lord of <hi>Grubbing donck,</hi>
had an other enterprizce vpon it, and falling on in the night with
4000 foote, and eleuen troupe of horse, those of <hi>Breda</hi> takeiug the
alarme betimes, he finding them in a readenesle to entertaine him,
was beaten off with the losse of a hundred men.</p>
            <p>Againe, Marquesse <hi>Spinola</hi> haueing (Anno 1622) layne long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Bergin op zoom,</hi> and lost, and hurt in the space of twelue weekes
a matter of ten thousand men before it, being so repulsed by my Lord
<hi>Morgan</hi> (then commaunding with the Gouernour, the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Captaines, officers &amp; souldiers of all Nations,) that he could not
get so much as a foote of ground of them, though he attempted and
assaulted oftentimes the outworkes, with the losse of a great many
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who at last by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Prince <hi>Morrice</hi> of happie memorie,

<pb facs="tcp:4197:4"/>
night with a great confusion, leauing be hinde him a great many sick,
and hurt men, amunition, victuals, and other matterials. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse
<hi>Spinola</hi> then being Iealous of his honour, after <hi>Prince Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize</hi>
had putt into <hi>Breda</hi> 6000 choise Souldiers, namely, his owne
Guard, and most of the Coronels Companies, came and satt downe
before it, on the 28 of August. 1624. and hauing sustayned the losse
of a great many braue men before Bergin, feareing to attempt the
same by Approches, (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding a mighty Armie) choose rather to
block it vp on all sides, and so knowing that many mouths, must eate
many victualls, sought rather to famish it out. Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
with the States Armie to the <hi>May,</hi> hauing a greater dessigne
in his head, to witt, an <hi>Enterprize</hi> vpon the Castle of <hi>Antwerpe,</hi>
which would haue fetch the Marquesse from <hi>Breda:</hi> failing for want
of Courage, and falling on (as it is reported) gaue the <hi>Marquesse</hi>
time to fortifie himself the stronger before <hi>Breda,</hi> and to that end,
made a double line of <hi>Circumvalation</hi> about it, with stronge Forts,
Horneworkes, halfemoones, Redoubts, and Spurrs, and cutting the
dike at <hi>Terhey,</hi> drownd all the lower grounds, and made a <hi>Steckado</hi>
ouer the drownd meddowes, to hinder and keepe vs from relieuing
it by water, and sloopes. Howsoeuer, his Highnesse the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> to see if he could possibly relieue yt, gaue command to <hi>Sir
Horace Vere</hi> of worthy Memory, Lord of <hi>Tylbery,</hi> and Coronell Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
of the English, with my <hi>Lord of Oxford,</hi> who commanded the

Sun rising, finding it not feisible, our me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to retreate. Vpon

were slaine, &amp; Capt: <hi>Shippon</hi> shott, so that from that time forward,
this Citty by famine languished away, vntill the fifth of Iune 1625.
On which day it fell againe vnder the power, and obedience of the

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE LORDS THE STATES GENERAL
of the vnited Prouinces, and his highnesse the <hi>Prince of
Orange,</hi> according to their alliance made with France,
desirous to diuert the <hi>Cardinall Infante,</hi> from bending
his whole force, against the King of <hi>France</hi> his Armie, which was
falne into <hi>Henegow,</hi> and had beseiged, and lay engaged before. <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drescy;</hi>
resolued to draw, their Armie also into the feild, &amp; to that end,
made great preparations of all things, necessarie for the warre, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
the <hi>Rende-vous</hi> on the 12. of Iuly, this present yeare at <hi>Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mekens</hi>
in Zealand: the Army conducted by the Prince, consisted of
about one and twenty thowsand foote, and some three thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
horse, which were diuided into three <hi>Brigades,</hi> or <hi>Tercias.</hi> to
wit, the French and the walloons; makeing one and fifty foote
Companies, commanded by Coronell <hi>Hauteriue:</hi> The English
whose meeting was first at <hi>Bergen op Zoom,</hi> makeing with the Lord
of Brederodes Regiment, &amp; Count Solmes his Regiment 55. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
commanded by my Lord <hi>Morgan,</hi> and Count <hi>Wlliams</hi>
Lord Marshall of the feild, consisting of 5 dutch Regiments, and three
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4197:6"/>
Scotch, makeing in all 63 companies, beside the Horse, ordered also
into three <hi>Tercias,</hi> vidz. The Lord of <hi>Stakenbroecks,</hi> Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
of the Horse. The Duke of <hi>Bouillons,</hi> &amp; Count <hi>Stirums</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary
of the Horse, makeing in all some 40 troupes. This Armie
was embarqued in foure, or fiue thowsands Smack-ships, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
they could gett for the horse, with prouisions of Hay, Oats, water
and bridges for them: and assoone as they came to <hi>Rammekins,</hi> the
Army lay betweene that Castle, and <hi>Middleborough head</hi> the
Horse troups next the Head, and the traine of victuals and Amuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
vp towards Armuyde. Those foote companies, which lay in
litle ships, were by order from the prince remoued into greater, and
the Shippers had command, to prouide them selues Cables, Ankors,
and to ballast their ships with sand, the Souldiers likewise haueing
order, to furnish themselues with tenn daies victuals. The Enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
seing, and hearing the noize of these preparations, thought verely
that the prince of Orange his dessigne was for <hi>Flanders,</hi> and therefore
to hinder our landing, they drew a head, and left his garrisons in other
places of horse, and foote, as weake as possibly he could, and getting
a compitent army together, to resist the Prince, put strong garrisons
into <hi>Hulst,</hi> the Land of <hi>Waes,</hi> and all the Townes lying along the
Sea Coast of <hi>Flanders,</hi> euen from <hi>Sluce,</hi> and Dam to Greueling, to
keepe vs from Landing.</p>
            <p>This it seemes the Prince of Orange did in all probability, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muze
the Ennemy, and to harrie, and wearie out his men, his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
designe lying an othes way, or else perhaps the contrarienesse
of the winde. which blew a stiffe gale, and by gusts diuers daies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
might alter his highnesse resolution: for after our Armie had
layne nine dayes betweene <hi>Rammekins,</hi> and <hi>Middleborough head</hi>
with expectation euery day to set Saile for <hi>Flanders:</hi> vpon Sunday
the 19 of Iuly, came order in the afternoone from his highnesse, that
all our men, which were a shoare, at Middleborow, or Flishing,
should presently vpon payne of death, that night repaire to shipboard,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4197:6"/>
and withall Commanded <hi>Monsieur Perceuall</hi> quartermaster Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and all the perticular quartermasters of euery Regiment, with
all expedition that night to set saile for <hi>Bergin op zoom,</hi> to veiw a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
place for the Army, and to draw out quarters for euery Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the fields of Northgeest and Ostgeest, and Commaunded
also, that vpon Munday morning, being the twentith, when the
Princes shipp should set saile from <hi>Rammekins,</hi> and shoote of a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-peece,
that then euery <hi>Tercia,</hi> as they lay, should make readie,
to sayle after him: So then on the 20, about fiue of the Clock in the
Morning, the Prince having a stiff, and a prosperous gale of Winde,
set saile for <hi>Bergin op zoom,</hi> all the army following him, as fast as
they Could get out. And at the same instant, his highnesse Caused
two hundred empty ships, with the shippers onely, and some fewe
drummers in them, to Saile vp the <hi>Scheld,</hi> and along the land <hi>of
Waes,</hi> to make shew of landing there, which gaue the ennemy So
strong an alarme in all those parts, that they neuer thought of his
comming any where else, his highnesse in the interim kept his course
towards Bergin vp zoom, and by twelue a clock came the same day
to the Fort, that lies vpon the creeke, betweene <hi>Bergin</hi> and <hi>Tertole,</hi>
where he cast anker, and seing Sir <hi>Iacob Ashley</hi> Seriant Maior of
the English <hi>tercia</hi> passe by him, gaue him order, that as the shipping
came vp, they should follow two ships, which were to saile into the
creeke, that runns vp towards <hi>Halter,</hi> as far as they could, and there to
finde a fit landing place for the army, and comming to the landing
place should be drawne a shoare, and march along the dike to their
seuerall quarters, which was done accordingly with admirable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
for the shipping comming vp, a great part of the army that
afternone was landed, and drawne into their quarters, the officers, and
souldiers hauing layne longe a board, were willing to refresh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
a shoare, some of them wading vp to the knees in water, and
mudd, till they gott to the dike. The horse troopes had order to run
vp into <hi>Bergen head,</hi> and as farre as they could into the towne, for the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4197:7"/>
more commodious, and the better landing of their troupes,</p>
            <p>The next day being tewsday, and the 21, the rest of the Army
horse and foote were disembarqued, drawne into their quarters,
&amp; receiued order, to prouide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> three, for foure daies victuals, against
the next morning. Now on wensday the 22 at the breake of the
day, all the quarter master receiued waggons from the waggon-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
generall, for the cheife officers &amp; Captaines of their Regiments,
two Captains to a Waggon, which were presently distributed to
the Captaines, and sent away with all expedition to the shipping, with
command so lade their waggons, and to follow the Armie. This mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
about seuen of the clock, the whole army drew into armes, and
the English <hi>Tercia,</hi> hauing the <hi>avantgard</hi> that day, marched to their
old quarter of <hi>Rosendale</hi> (where they had layne a whole winter,
when <hi>Marquesse Spinola</hi> had blocked vp Breda anno 1624) where
they were well quartered, and the Coronels, and chiefe officers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
with houses.</p>
            <p>The next morning being the 23 of Iuly, at the creeke of the day,
the army began to moue againe, and Count Williams tercia hauing
the Auantgard, wee marched that day to the heath, betweene <hi>Ginne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi>
and the mast-wood before <hi>Breda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some daies before wee departed from <hi>Rammekins,</hi> his highnesse
had written to Count <hi>Henry Casimir,</hi> gouernour of <hi>Frizeland,</hi> who to
gard the <hi>Muze,</hi> and the <hi>Rhene,</hi> and to desend those quarters, had an
Army of 90 Companies, horse &amp; foote, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>posed of all nations, as <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
French, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> and gaue him order night and day to
march with his Army, towards <hi>Breda,</hi> who vpon the 21 of Iuly, two
dayes before his highnesse came before it, rounded the towne, and
stopt all <hi>Auenues,</hi> and passages into it. This gaue those of <hi>Breda</hi> a
terible alarme, which made them ring their <hi>alarme Bell,</hi> and made
them shut, and damme vp their ports: the same day as Count <hi>Henry</hi>
came before it, they sallied out of the towne with some 400 men, to
fetch in Cattle, and other prouisions, but our horse beate them in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4197:7"/>
againe with the losre of some men slayne, others hurt, and some taken
prisoners.</p>
            <p>To returne againe to the Prinecs Army, on Thurs-day the 23 of
Iuly new stile, our Army came, and lay in Battaile vpon the Heath,
betweene the princes houses neere <hi>Ginnekins</hi> &amp; the Riuer of <hi>Merch,</hi>
&amp; the <hi>Mastwoed.</hi> In the riuer by the princes house, there lay a new lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
boate, very commodious to make a bridg vpon, his highnesse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
gaue order to the Carpenters, and workemen, to lay plancks
ouer it, and to make two bridges vpon it for his men to passe ouer
it, on the other side of the <hi>Merch</hi> to the Lord of <hi>Bredrods,</hi> Count
<hi>Solmes,</hi> and Count <hi>Henries</hi> quarters, which that afternoone was made
with all expedition, &amp; withall gaue order, that noe quarters should be
made for the Regiments, but all of them to lie in Battaille attending
an ennemy, vntill such time as our line of Circumualation was defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
            <p>On Fryday morning then the 24. at the breake of the day, all the
quartermasters had orders, to fetch matterials from the <hi>Commisse
Martin</hi> for 250. workemen of euery English, and French Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and proportionally of euery Regiment of the whole Army:
so that there were aboue 5000 Commanded men that morning, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
with the quartermasters to goe to worke, euery souldier ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
giuen him by the Inginier, and his quartermaster a rhenish rodd
of ground, that is 12 foote, to cast vp. The Line of <hi>Circumualation</hi>
was began first from the Princes house, by Coronell Colepeppers
Regiment, and then euery Regiment, according to the order of their
march, tooke their ground, the line was cast vp ouer the hills, and
heights, a long through the <hi>Mastwood,</hi> to <hi>Papenmutch,</hi> to the <hi>Hagh,</hi>
where Count Williams quarter was, and so to Monsieur <hi>Buyshuysens</hi>
quarter of 8 Companies, and then to <hi>Terhey,</hi> where Coronell <hi>Varick</hi>
lay with 12 Companies. And ouer the bridge by the Princes house,
it ran a long through the walloons quarter, to the Lord of Bredrods,
to Count Solmes, and so to <hi>Tettering</hi> to Count Henry his quarter,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4197:8"/>
and from thence ouer the feilds to the <hi>Swart dicke,</hi> upon which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts
were made, and so was shutt at <hi>Terhey,</hi> being some 21 English
miles in compasse, hauing upon heights. &amp; places of aduantage strong
Forts, Horneworkes, Halfe moons, &amp; spurs, with diuers batteries
vpon it. And the <hi>merck,</hi> &amp; the other Riuer were stopt, and dam'd vp
in two places, to wit, by the Princes quarter, and betweene Papen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutch
and the Hagh, which ouerflowed, and drownd all the med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
and lower grounds, more then a mans heigth deepe, and lay
like a sea before our Trenches. Three or foure dayes also after the
prince had satt downe with his Army before Breda, there came a
matter of some 3 or 4. thowsand Boores, or hus-bandmen out of
<hi>Holland,</hi> who made an out ditch casting the earth vp (on both sides,
on the out side of the first line) eight foote deepe, 8 foote high on
both sides and sixteene foote broade, to hinder the Ennemes horse
from leaping ouer it, and breaking in vpon vs.</p>
            <p>Vpon Friday, Satterday, and Sunday the 24. the 25. and 26. of
Iuly, we wrought vpon the line with great expedition, while the rest
of our army these three dayes lay in bataille. On Sunday before noon
the quartermaster Generall, &amp; the particular quartermasters of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Regiment, drew out the French quarters vpon the heigths, and the
English quarter vpon the heath neerer the towne. And on
Munday, being the 27 the Regiments, and companies drew into their
quarters, and cast vp a Trench before them, euen from the mast wood
to the riuer side. Tewsday, Wensday, and Thursday were spent in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
our line, raising it, and makeing a foot-banke to yt, and in
finishing the Trenches before the head of our quarters.</p>
            <p>Vpon Friday the 14 of Iuly, there were sent downe in the night
with Monsieur <hi>Perceuall,</hi> the quartermaster Generall 150 English, &amp;
as many French all worke men, to breake ground iust halfe way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene
<hi>Breda</hi> and <hi>Ginnekins,</hi> where they cast vp a small halfemoone &amp;
a redout by the water mill, and the burnt houses, to keepe in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.
Satterday the first of August was spent in repairing, the line.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:4197:8"/>
Upon Sunday about three of the Clock in the morning, the Enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
sallyed out vpon these two small workes, some 150 men, and
discharged a volley of shott vpon them, but hearing our Trumpetter
of the horse gard sound a charge, retreated presently this was onely
to discouer: for vpon Munday the third, about the same hower in the
morning, they Sallied our againe about 200 men with fire-lockes, &amp;
encompassing both the works, offred to giue on, vpon one of the
points of the half moone, giuing fire vpon our men: But Monsieur
<hi>Beringham,</hi> who commands the Princes troupe, came thether with
some horsemen from the Princes gard notfarre of, and sounding a
charge the Ennemy instantly retreated, as fast as they could, into the
outworckes of the Towne, and being come vnder their ordinance,
they shott from of the Bulwarks and walls, about 20 Canon shott
vpon those workes, and vpon the way vp towards <hi>Ginnekens,</hi> leauing
dead behinde them a Sariant, a gallant man, and 5 or 6 others slayne:
and carryed of at least 15 or 16 hurt men. Vpon this seruice Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<hi>Loofe,</hi> (Lieutenant tot Lieut Coronell <hi>Thienen</hi>) was hurt.</p>
            <p>About this time his Highnes the Prince <hi>Elector Palatine,</hi> with his
Bretheren, Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> and a great traine of
English Noblemen, and Gentlemen, came to the siege, who during
the whole time of it, were euery day as frequent, and forward in the
Approaches, as any needy <hi>Cadet</hi> could bee, that sought to make his
fortune that way. And were attended on by <hi>Sir Robart Stone, Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Billing sley, Mr. Karr, Mr. Daniell, Mr. Hamptden, Mr. Grissin,</hi>
their owne followers, accompained also with the Earles of <hi>Warwick</hi>

their gards. And <hi>Mr. Georg, and Mr. Walter Vane,</hi> mounted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vnder the Princes Troupe.</p>
            <p>His Hghnesse the <hi>Cardinall Infante,</hi> hearing now that the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> with our Army was set downe before <hi>Breda,</hi> made all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4197:9"/>
that possibly he could, to gather a head from among his har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
troupes, who had had long and wearisome marches, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
of the coast of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the land of <hi>Waes,</hi> &amp; other places, &amp;
pickt vp a reasonable Army consisting of some 10000 foote and 50
troups of horse (the most of them being imployed against the French
to resist the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; hinder their incursious &amp; progresse into the Prouinces
of <hi>Henegow</hi> and <hi>Artois</hi>) and on the 24. of Iuly new stile, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
with Prince <hi>Tomaso of Sauoy, Count Feria,</hi> &amp; some other <hi>Grands</hi>
came to <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> drawing on the 23. 7 or 8 Canon through it. The
same day came the Regiment of <hi>Bruon</hi> to him, being a matter of
twelue hundred men strong, who had thought to haue put his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into <hi>Breda,</hi> but was preuented &amp; deceiued, baked 80 thousand
loaues of Bread for his army, and gaue them some Money, and drew
out of <hi>Gelders, Gennip</hi> and <hi>Steuensward,</hi> and other forts, and places all
men that might be spared, to see if he could relieue <hi>Breda,</hi> his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
him, that they would either venter for to relieue it, or to dye
before it, but the carefulnesse and industry of his Highnes the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> was such, that it was a thing impossible for them to break
through our line.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cardinall Infante</hi> then the second of August being come to
great &amp; little <hi>Sundert,</hi> &amp; <hi>Rysbergen,</hi> which is an howers going fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
Hagh Count <hi>Williams</hi> quarter, as the mapp of the Barronie of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
showes, quartered in these three villages, hutted &amp; cast vp for their
safegard some <hi>trauerses</hi> vpon the auenues, &amp; passages, and showed a
matter of 17 troups of his Horse vpon the heath, within lesse then a
Canon shot of Count <hi>Williams</hi> quarter, who saluted them from
his Batteries, with our Ordinance, and slew some foure, or fiue of
them, shott of the chaps of a horse, which they left behind them,
&amp; so retreated. Those of <hi>Breda</hi> seing their freinds were come so neare
with hopes of reliefe, did encourage them: and on the third, fourth
and fifth of August, hung out lanternes vpon the topp of their high
steeple, to shew them the way into the Towne by night: but by the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4197:9"/>
vigilencie of his Highnesse, our out-line by that time was made so
stronge, that they durst not venter to breake through it.</p>
            <p>The Ennemy being come so nere vs, now was a time of action, for 10
or 12 nights one after an other, as long as the Cardinalls Armie lay in
these villages aboue named, our whole army horse &amp; foote of all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
euery night drew out after the warning peece went of to besett
the out line, &amp; euery companie to march to their seuerall stations, &amp;
attend the Ennemy, if he durst haue attempted any thing for the
reliefe of <hi>Breda:</hi> once more he showed 14 troupe of his horse, which
were beaten back with our Cannon, as the former were.</p>
            <p>Vpon wensday night the 12 of August 400 of our horse went and
gaue the Ennemy an allarme in the night, and beate vp their horse
gards to a trauerse, which they had cast vp before their quarter, slew
foure or fiue of the Ennemy, and finding there some of their foote,
to second them, our men retreated with the loose also of some foure
or fiue men.</p>
            <p>On Fryday night the 14 of August the <hi>Cardinall Infante;</hi> seing noe
possibilitie to breake through our line and Army, in the night sent
away a part of his forces, who brake vp, and fired their quarters, and
the next morning rose with the grosse of his Army, marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Loone,</hi> &amp; other villages in <hi>Brabant,</hi> hauing a secret plott, and
enterprize vpon the Sconce of the <hi>Vorne,</hi> and <hi>Theil,</hi> and before that
had giuen order to those troupes of his, which were drawneout of
<hi>Gelders, Gennep, and Steuensward,</hi> to march to these two places, who
comming to the <hi>Maze</hi> side, &amp; putting some men in boates to crosle
ouer the riuer, into the Iland of the <hi>Vorne,</hi> were discouered on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday
night the 15 of August. A man of warre, and our men dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
many shot among them, which slew diuerse of their men, and
leauing their Scaling ladders behind the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, were driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to retreate, being
reported, that these two places had warning &amp; intelligence of them
by a Boore, that rann from them, so that if they had falne on, our men
were prouided to entertaine them. In the Interim the <hi>Cardinall
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4197:10"/>
Infante</hi> &amp; his army, who came to second them, buzzed vp &amp; downe
with hopes, that this dessigne of his would take effect, and cause the
Prince of Orange, to rise from his seige of Breda, but his expectation
was frustrate.</p>
            <p>The Ennemy being marched away, his highnesse that euening sent
for <hi>Coronell Wyne-bergen,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sir. Symon Harcourt,</hi> Sariant Maiour to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronell
Gorings</hi> regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to attend the Ennemy, &amp; gaue them the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of 25 corpanies out of euery regiment: among the rest of our

               <hi>Sir. Simons</hi> owne company, Captayne <hi>Ropers,</hi> Captaine <hi>Herles,</hi>
&amp; Captaine <hi>Duncums,</hi> &amp; that night they marched towards <hi>Ghetru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denberke,</hi>
and comming to <hi>Hemersward</hi> by <hi>Heusden,</hi> Coronell <hi>Wyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergen</hi>
marched away with his 14. Companies vp towards the <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tow,</hi>
to desend (with Coronell <hi>Pincen</hi>) the riuer, &amp; those parts, lying
vpon the <hi>Rhene,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Whale. Sir. Simon Harcourt</hi> staying in <hi>Hemers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
with his eleuen companies to gard that place: but on the 18 of
August, receiued order from the Prince, to march with his men to the
<hi>Graue,</hi> for the securing of that Towne, if the Ennemy, who drew
that waies should haue beseiged it. There he stayed some ten, or
twelue daies, untill the Ennemy was marched away to <hi>Venlo</hi> &amp; <hi>Roer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi>
The Ennemy being gone, he receiued order againe to march
from thence to Nemwegen, where he did embarke his eleuen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
for <hi>Wesell:</hi> but before his arriuall there, he receiued a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-command
from the Prince, to returne againe with his men to the
Army, This by the way.</p>
            <p>On Satterday the 15 of August in the night, there were 150. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
and 150 French workemen, commanded to goe downe with
Monsieur <hi>Perceuall,</hi> the quartermaster Generall, to breake ground &amp;
this night aduanced some 300 paces forward, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the two first workes
aboue named towards the hils, vpon which they made the first batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
for foure or fiue peeces of ordinance, to fauour our workemen,
and to keepe the Ennemy from sallying out.</p>
            <p>Vpon Sunday the 16 that nights worke was repaired, and in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4197:10"/>
afternoone the Prince with a great traine, went to view the Enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
quarters, in what forme they lay. Also vpon Sunday at night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
the English from the first battery Northward on the left ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
cast vp a Trench, and gott 76 Rod towards the towne, at the end
whereof they made a good Redoubt: the French doing the like from
the right hand of the batrerie, and gott as much ground, or rather
more, casting vp also an other Redoubt, &amp; there were commaunded
men the next morning sent downe, to repaire that nights worke.</p>
            <p>On Munday the 17, Sundaies nights worke being repayred, the
the first battery of fiue peeces was made, to hinder the Ennemy from
Sallying out vpon our approches, &amp; our trenches was enlarged to 12
foote broade, that ordinance and waggons might be drawne downe,
the day following our trenches were heightned, and some blindes
sett vp.</p>
            <p>On Tewsday night the 18 of August, <hi>My Lord Morgan, and
Monsieur Hauteriue,</hi> as Eldest Coronels went downe to breake
ground, and to aduance the approches. Monsieur Hauteriue from the
first batterie, as eldest Coronell takeing the right hand, and my Lord
Morgan the left, and so the English and French ran their lines, each
Coronell commanding ten companies, to wit, eight English, and
two Dutch, one of the Lord of <hi>Bredroods</hi> Regiment, and an other
of <hi>Count Solms,</hi> and the French Coronell ten Companies of their
owne nation, the <hi>Gards,</hi> and the <hi>Walloons</hi> which garded with them.
There was appointed, to goe downe with these two Coronells, to
breake ground, 250. Commanded men with matterials, and our
English that night, in running an oblique line, gott forward 72. rodd,
or 864. foot, from the left corner of our first batterie, and at the end
thereof, made a large <hi>Corps of Gard</hi> to defend that approach. The
French did the like that night, from the right corner of the batterie,
and hauing 50 men more then the English they gott 80. rodd. The
Ennemie Shott much this night vpon our men, that garded the
workemen, &amp; with some fiue, or sixe of their men, gaue vs an <hi>alarme,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:4197:11"/>
and my Lord <hi>Morgan</hi> shott through his briches, which bullet gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
vpon his buttock, without doing him any further harme. This
night Captaine <hi>Francisco,</hi> who commaunds Captaine <hi>Francis Veres</hi>
Companie, had three of his men mortally wounded, whereof they
all dyed with in two, or three daies after.</p>
            <p>Vpon wensday morning being the 19. there was sent downe into
the approches, a Sariant, and 30. men of euery English, and Dutch
Regiment to repaire, heigthen, and enlarge the approach made that
night.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, about eleuen of the clock that day, the Ennemy sallied
out of their workes, about fifty men upon the French approaches,
thinking to haue cutt of some of those that had the point. But Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>d' Escars,</hi> Lieutenant de <hi>Brett,</hi> and <hi>Monsieur la Terriere,</hi> who
commanded Coronell <hi>Hauteriue</hi> his companie, with some French
Voluntiers, fell out of their trenches, and beate the Ennemy back
againe into their workes. In this sallie the Ennemy lost a Captaine,
a Sariant, and seuen or eight men, and had an other Sariant shott in
his thigh, who had behaued himself so stoutly, that afterwards when
there was a parley, the Prince of Orange being in the approches, sent
him foure double-pistols, as a reward of his courage: So much he
prizeth valour, though in an Ennemy.</p>
            <p>The Ennemy being retreated into his workes, within halfe an
hower after, they beate a <hi>Parley,</hi> desiring that they might fetch off
their dead bodies, especially to seeke for the <hi>Corps</hi> of a Captaine of
theirs that was slaine vpon this seruice. His Highnesse the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> being acquainted therewith, granted them a Parley for an
howers time, &amp; presently after dinner the Prince came downe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into the French approaches, and while the cessation of armes du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
there were appointed Officers on both sides, to meete half way
betwixt the Ennemies workes, and our Trenches, till they had sought
out, &amp; fetcht of their dead. The Prince on our side (with a french
officier) commanded Monsieur <hi>Perceuall,</hi> the quartermaster Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4197:11"/>
and chiefe Inginier for the directing of the French Approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
to take vpon him the habit, and quality of a Sariant, with a hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
in his hand, and to goe out, and entertayning discourse with the
Ennemies Officer, which should come out on their side, should
cast his eye about him now and then, to discouer how the ground
lay, and the Ennemies workes, that he might the better know, which
way to run his approches towards them: neither was the Ennemy
failing herein: for they sent also out of the Towne, their chiefe
Inginier, to espye how our line, and Trenches lay. These two chiefe
Inginers meeting together, the Ennemies men to show their curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,
brought out of their Horneworke good Renish wine, and the
best Bredaes Beere they could gett, and there they dranke two or
three healths, to the <hi>Cardinall Infantes,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Oranges,</hi> and at
last the Ennemies Inginier enquiring how Monsieur <hi>Perceuall</hi> did,
dranck a health vnto him, who vnknowne vnto the Ennemies Ingi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier,
pledged his owne health.</p>
            <p>On Wensday night the 19 <hi>Count Solms</hi> commanding in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
and Dutch Approaches, two Sariants with Sixty workemen
were sent downe into the Trenches, and from the last nights <hi>corps de
guard,</hi> ran a line slooping some sixty rod, and cast vp an other <hi>Corps
de guard</hi> at the end of it, &amp; on the left hand began to make a batterie,
we gott this night almost within two stones cast of the Ennemies
Horne-worke: the French likewise this night gott as much ground
made likewise a <hi>Corps de guard,</hi> and aduanced their Approaches wel.
The next day this nights work was repaired.</p>
            <p>On Thursday night the 20 of August, Coronell <hi>Herbert</hi> went
downe to command in the Approaches, and had a Sariant, and 30
men out of euery Regiment, to aduance the worke: this night they
gott 23 rod towards the Horne-worke, &amp; from the point, braunched
out ten rodd on the right hand, vpon which the great batterie for
twelue halfe Canon was made. This night Captaine <hi>Stanton</hi> was
shott in his legg, and Lieutenaut <hi>Baxter</hi> a liltle beneath his hipp, with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4197:12"/>
seuen others that were shot besides them. The next day that night
worke was repaired, and the Trench heightned, and made broader.</p>
            <p>It was Coronel <hi>Gorings</hi> turne on Friday night the 21, to releiue
Coronell <hi>Herbert,</hi> and to command in the approaches, with whom
<hi>the Earle of North-hampton, my Lord Grandison,</hi> with many other
braue Volunteirs, worthy Officers, and gentlemen of quality, came
downe to accompany him that night, and the next day in the tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
The Ennemy to hinder our men from working, and Sapping
forward shott much: but the Coronell to encourage the workemen,
for the aduancing of the Sapp, went oftentimes into the Sapp this
night, with Captaine <hi>Watkins</hi> cheife Inginier for the guiding of the
English Approches, as likewife to Sariant <hi>Adams,</hi> (master of that
Sapp,) with 27 sappers, which he had taken on, who did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receiue his direction, but also tasted of his liberality, for besides
that which the States gaue them, which was two Rixdallers a peece,
wherely he did not onely encourage them for the present, but wonne
their hearts for any further employment, as did afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in effect. And because the worke, which they had done that
night, might be repaired the next morning: the Coronell sent vp his
quartermaster to the quarter for 15 workemen and a-Sariant out of
euery English Regiment, which he brought vp to his Coronell by
three a clock in the morning, who presently fell to worke, in height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Sapp on both sides, fetch rise-busshes, made blinds, and set
vp a hundred musket-baskets vpon the topp of the Trench, &amp; flanks,
where our Muskettiers might offend the Ennemy most. This mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Sariant <hi>Bagnall,</hi> Coronell <hi>Gorings</hi> Sariant was shott through his
chapps, and some of his teeth strooke out, and one <hi>Abraham Gunly,</hi>
of the Coronels Companie, receiued there his mortall wound, where
of he dyed a day after.</p>
            <p>Satterday night the 22. of August, <hi>Coronell Colepepper,</hi> relieued
Coronell <hi>Goring,</hi> this night the Ennemy shott very much, and cast
diuerse <hi>Handgranadoes</hi> into our Sapp among the Sappers, and yet
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4197:12"/>
thankes be to God, there was but one man slaine. This night our
men gott 6 rod forward towards the Ennemies Horne-worke, and
the next day, that nights worke was heightned, and the Sapp made
broader.</p>
            <p>Vpon Sunday the 23. there was planted sixe halfe Canon vpon
the great Batterie, which was made for 12 peeces. Two other bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
were a makeing ready, for 8 half Cannon, &amp; an other for foure
peeces in the French Approch, as likewise a batterre for two great
morters in the <hi>Corps of gard</hi> on the right hand: These ordinance play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and beate furiously vpon the wall, and Ginnekins <hi>Bulwarke</hi> to
dismount the Ennemies ordinance.</p>
            <p>Vpon Sunday morning also being the 23 of August, Sir <hi>Iames
Sandalien,</hi> Coronell of a Scotch Regiment, commanding then in
<hi>Count Williams</hi> approches, standing vpon a place, that was somewhat
higher the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rest, to show the <hi>Inginier,</hi> which way was best for him
to Sapp towards the palisadoes of the Counter-skarfe, which lay
without the Horneworke, receiued a dangerous shott through his
left hand, which raked along the blade of his arme, vp towards his
elbow, and brake some small bones in his hand.</p>
            <p>This afternoone the Ennemy shott a great <hi>granado,</hi> out of one
of their morters, of the bignesse of a Canon bullet, two French men
running after it, and imagining it to be a Cannon bullet, one of them
stooping to take it vp, it brake in peeces betweene his armes, toore
him all to peeces; and blew his bones and flesh vp into the aire, that
a peece of him could not be found.</p>
            <p>On Sunday night the 23. my Lord <hi>Morgan</hi> relieued Coronell
<hi>Colepepper,</hi> this night our men sapped two or three rod towards the
Ennemies Counterskarse, our men and the Ennemies, this night
gaue fire exceedingly one vpon an other. This night also the line of
Communication, was begun betweene the French and the English,
and the next day being munday, that nights worke was repaired, and
more ordinance planted vpon the batteries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:4197:13"/>
Vpon Munday night the 24 <hi>Count Solmes relieued my Lord
Morgan,</hi> who commanded the approaches. The workmen sapt
forward this night, till they came to a <hi>morras,</hi> which did hinder them
much, so that they were constrayned to turne the line, and sapp along
it, till they were past it: howsoeuer they gott a matter of 30 foot this
night, and set vp blinds of <hi>rize-bushes</hi> to shelter them. The next
day that nights worke was repaired, and more Cannon planted vpon
our batteries.</p>
            <p>This afternoone Monsieur <hi>Perceuall,</hi> the quartermaster Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
who had the direction of the French approaches, as is said before
going to visite the French <hi>Sapp,</hi> was dangerously shott through his
left shoulder, where of he hath layne in great weaknesse a long time:
God in his good time, restore him to his former health.</p>
            <p>This afternoone also towards euening, <hi>Count Henry of Nassau,</hi>
Coronell of the <hi>North-Holland Regiment,</hi> commanding in <hi>Count Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi>
approaches. The Ennemie sallied out of their workes on that
side, a matter of 200, choise men, &amp; comming vp to the very point,
surprized the <hi>Dutches</hi> that had the Gard there, beating them back
through the trenches, where Captaine <hi>Scheur</hi> a worthy man, who
commanded at the point, (in regard his men did abandon him) after
he had defended himself, as long as he could was slaine: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that Count <hi>Harrie</hi> himself, very brauely did what was possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to resist their retreate: and to second him: but could not, till at
length, Lieutenant Coronell <hi>Erskins</hi> his Companie aduancing from
an after guard, charged vp to the Ennemy, with <hi>Count Harrie,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander
Hammilton,</hi> Ensigne to the said Companie, beate back the
Ennemie out of our Trenches, &amp; fell into the vpon feild vpon them,
and comming to push of the pike with them, the Ensigne grapled
hand to hand with one of the Ennemies Ossicers, and kild him, and
afterward tooke an <hi>Italian</hi> prisonner, and so forced the Ennemy to
retyre very sadly, and with a great losse, though but of a few persons:
for one <hi>Cantelmo,</hi> a gallant yongman an Italian, and much favoured
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4197:13"/>
by the <hi>Cardinall Infante,</hi> who had stolne into the towne not long
before in Boores apparell, was vnfortunatly shot vpon this sallie in
the belly, of which hurt he dyed two dayes after.</p>
            <p>Moreouer vpon this day being the 24 of August Bredroode the
Commander of <hi>Venlo</hi> with some other Captaines, gaue ouer this
Towne very vnworthily into the hands of the <hi>Cardinall Infante</hi>
after he had layne with his army a day or two before it, and marched
out of it aboue eleue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hundred able men besides officers, who might
well haue defended it a month, or three weekes at the least, for
which they had their condigne sentence from the high Councill of
Warre of the vnited prouinces, as an example to others.</p>
            <p>On Tewsday night the 25 <hi>Coronell Herbert</hi> marched downe to
commaund in the Approaches, and relieued <hi>Count Solms,</hi> and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Ennemie shott much this night, yet our workemen
sapped forward a matter of some 24 foote, towards the Ennemies
Counterskarfe, and set vp blindes vpon it, and the next day repaired
that nights worke.</p>
            <p>On Wensday night the 26, Coronell <hi>Goring</hi> haueing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in the Aproches relieued Coronell <hi>Herbert,</hi> the Ennemy this
night shot much, especially vpon the French aproaches, and cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
30 <hi>hand-granadoes</hi> towards, and into their sap. The English
aduanced their Sapp this night some two rod. An hower before
day two of the Ennemie, with long firelockes came out of their
<hi>counter-skarfe,</hi> and crept vpon their bellies to the end of our Sapp,
and peeping into it, Seing the light, shot the workemaster therof,
and one of the Sappers stark dead, iust as Coronell <hi>Goring</hi> came
from visiting them. The death of these two, retarted and hindred
the aduancing of the Sapp for a while, till the Coronell perswaded
some expert souldiers of his owne company (notwithstanding this
disaster) to vndertake it againe, causing them towards morning to
make blindes, that the Ennemie might not discouer our Sappers, who
vnder the fauour of our Canon, and musketteiers, which he caused
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4197:14"/>
to play co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually, aduanced the Sap the next day 12 foote forwards,
and vpon wensday morning, there were sent downe into the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
two hundred commanded men with his quartermaster, and a
hundred muskett baskets; to be set vp, to heigthen, and diepen the sap,
and to make a foote-banke vpon the trench, that our muskettiers
might the better giue fire vpon the Ennemy, betweene these musket
basketts. This day, and the daie following, we beate continually
with 12 or 14 peeces of half Canon, vpon <hi>Ginnekins Bulwarke,</hi> and
the Curtaine of the wall, to dis. mount their ordinance. Vpon Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
the 27, the Ennemie about eleuen of the clock, sallyed out of
their <hi>Countersckarfe</hi> with pitch ropes, to fire the Blinds, which were
made vpon the point of the French Sapp, and comming vp cast a
great many <hi>Hand-granads</hi> into the sapp among the workemen.
<hi>Monsieur Charneze</hi> Coronell, had then the command in the French
Approaches, and fell out brauely vpon the Ennemy with a hundred
French, beate them back from the Approaches, to the topp of their
<hi>Counter-skarfe,</hi> and there came to push a pike, and sword to sword
with them, yea he beate them out of their Counter-skarfe, but lying
open to the Horn-worke, and the flankes of the Towne, hauing noe
couuert, nor time to turne it vp in the day, retreated againe into his
Approaches. Vpon this seruice a peece of a <hi>Granado</hi> breakeing
strooke <hi>Monsieur Charnaze</hi> vpon his cheeke, which raized the skin,
and drew a litle blood, and though the Ennemy shott much, and
cast a great many Granadoes into their Sap: yet they aduanced it so
forward, that they came to the foote of the Counterskarfe: and their
digd out one of the Ennemies <hi>Palisadoes,</hi> and sent it to the Prince
for a token, the Prince rewarding him that brought it, (as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed
before) with as much mony, as would buy him a new suit of
cloaths cloake and all.</p>
            <p>On Thursday night the 27. <hi>Coronell Colepepper</hi> relieued <hi>Coronell Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi>
The Sapp this night was aduanced three rod, and the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
sapt to the very foote of the <hi>Countreskarfe</hi> before the <hi>Horne.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4197:14"/>
worke,</hi> and the Sappers digd out three <hi>Palisadoes,</hi> and on Fryday
morning the Inginier, and he that puld them out, presented them to
the Prince, who rewarded him in the same manner, as he did the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the daye before. Without all question the English had bin first
in their <hi>Counterskarfe,</hi> if they had not mett vnfortunately with the
<hi>Morrase</hi> abouesaid, which did hinder them, and cast them Behinde
hand two daies at the least. On fryday the sap was heightned on both
sides, made deeper and broader, and muskets-baskets &amp; blinds
set vp.</p>
            <p>On Friday night the 28 my <hi>Lord Morgan</hi> commaunding the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
being come to the foot of the <hi>Counterskarfe</hi> sapped forward
into it, and notwithstanding, that the Ennemie shott very hard vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our men, both with their small shott and Canon, to hinder our
men from aduancing, yet that night the sappers sapped forwards
12 foote, my <hi>Lord Morgan</hi> commaunding to giue fire from al <hi>Corps
de guard,</hi> and flankes vpon the Ennemies Horne-worke, that vnder
the fauour thereof our men might goe on, The next morning being
Satterday, that nights worke was repaired, and blindes sett vpp.</p>
            <p>Vpon Satterday night the 29 <hi>Count Solmes</hi> releiued my <hi>Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi>
and sapt forward, being now in the Counterskarfe, our men
had elbow roome, to braunch out on both sides vpon the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skarf
&amp; cast vp two <hi>Corps of guards,</hi> one on the right hand, an other
on the left hand, makeing blindes, and setting vp musket-baskets for
our muskettiers to play through, and to annoy the Ennemy, that
gaue fire vpon our men from their Horneworke, and other of their
out-workes, the next day being Sunday, and the 30 the sapp, and
these gards were repaired.</p>
            <p>On Sunday night the 30 of August, it was Coronell <hi>Herberts</hi>
turne to commaund in the approaches, and notwith-standing that
the ennemy, and our men that night shot exceedingly one vpon an
other: yet the English sapped forwards, &amp; heigthned and repaired the
two <hi>Corps a guard</hi> aboue named, and Coronell <hi>Herbert</hi> by encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4197:15"/>
the workemen, sapt this night within 12 foote of the brinke
of the moate of the Ennemies <hi>Horne-worke,</hi> &amp; the next day that nights
worke was repaired. This night also <hi>Coronell Hauteriue,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the French Approches, hauing sapt to the brinke of the
moate, attempted to put a damme ouer it, but after the losse of
some men, found it not fecible.</p>
            <p>The night before (being the 30 of August) <hi>Coronell Hauteriue</hi> had
attempted to lay a Damme of Rize-busshes ouer the moate of the
Horne-worke, in the French Approach.: but sustaying the losse of
about sixeteene persons, besides hurt men, was constrayned to
forbeare, noe others being willing to vndertake it. The Englisst sapp
yet was not quite aduanced to the brinke of the water: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<hi>Coronell Goring,</hi> perceiuing how desirous the Prince was the
worke should be hastned, and hearing him offer fiue and twentie
hunderd gilders to the French, who were in it before, obtayned the
same allowance for his Approaches. And before he marched downe
on Sunday night the 30 of August, sought out the most expert, and
bould workemen of our Nation. Sixe men vndertooke it, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
with some others, whome they would hire should doe it, for
fiueteene hundred gilders, the Coronell reseruing the other thousand
gilders, to pay bringers of Rise-busshes, and to hire others in case
these should be to few, or to reward them aboue their expectation
if they did succeed. After the Sappers had wrought twelue foote
to come to the water, for so much was yet wanting: these sixe men
begann their taske, and proceeded to good effect, but were all slayne,
or hurt in a short space, onely the chiefe of them, being assisted by a
succession of sixteene others, who likewise were all, either slaine, or
dangerously shott, liued &amp; worked forward, till sixe of the clock the
next morning, being the 31, at which time the damme was laid
within 15 foote of the other side. Here this workeman out of a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie,
would needes sound the depth of the moate remayning, and
dis-couering himselfe too carelessly was slaine, by which meanes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4197:15"/>
many men were lost, for that he had neglected to make blindes, as
he went, which made other souldiers timerous, &amp; vnwilling to vnder
take it. In all this time and danger, yow may imagine how paynfull a
part the <hi>Coronell</hi> acted: who did not onely most vigilantly place Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers,
to discharge without intermission, in euery foote of ground
from whence they night annoy the Ennemy, but oftentimes visited
the Rise-bringers, that matterials might not be wanting, and vpon
the failing of any workemen, by his singular dexterity of perswasion,
gott new in their places, himself being an example vnto them, of
singular dilligence and boldnesse. Yet now they were at such a stand,
that for two howers space, the discourse of all was, that it could not
be done, till another night might contribute some shelter to them.
At last the <hi>Coronell,</hi> not being able to satisfie himselfe, with what
was alreadie effected, (though it were enough to haue gained honor
for two nights) besides that he saw the feciblenesse of that litle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynder,
gott first some men to laye blindes of bushes, on that
which was made, and then foure other workemen, to finish the rest,
for the reward of two hundred and fifty gilders a peece, which they
receiued, being not so much as one hurt, and ended their worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
twelue of the clocke at noone. The Prince comming downe,
and seing what was done, so much aboue his expectation, gaue the
Coronell Many thankes, with expressions sutable to his merrit, and
hastned the Miners vnto him, that noe time might be lost.</p>
            <p>One of them was presently sett a mining vnder the Barme of the
Horne-worke: But his feare makeing him willing to finde excuses,
he quickly came back and complaind, that the damne was not easily
passable. Wherevpon the Coronell sent others to perfect it, if any
thing were amisse, and when all was finished the Miner being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to his worke, that noe more neede-lesse excuses should be made,
the Coronell himselfe went quite ouer it, and in his returne, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
a shott with a sling bullet in his left legg, it strock him in the
iuncture, where the foote is fastened to the legg, brake assunder all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4197:16"/>
the vpper Sinnews, toore away a greate deale of his flesh, bruised the
huckle bone, and broke the end of the great shinn-bone, where
it ioynes vnto it.</p>
            <p>At first the resolution of all the Chiurgians was, to cutt of his legg,
but seing the admirable courage, &amp; firmnesse of his minde, wherwith
he boare it, and trusting much to this perfectnesse of health, and
temper of his flesh, they concluded they might deferre it for a time,
without danger of a <hi>Gangrene,</hi> and after two dressings, resolued to
goe on in the cure, without any thoughts of cutting it off. Which
I expresse here, as that which was the matter of ioy, not onely to our
Nation, but also to the whole Army, as his greate wound was, and is
the sorrow of all that loue honour, virtue, and Souldiers. But I must
forbeare, to enlarge my selfe in relating, what a vniuersall dampe of
sadnesse, seized on the hearts of all men, or what praises, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
were payed vnto his incomparable worth, not onely by his
Highnesse the Prince of Orange, but by all others of qualitie: for
I am to remember, I write but a <hi>Diarie:</hi> though indeed in one daies
worke, he hath giuen penns worke for many daies: for if you consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
the space of ground to be sapped through, before he came to
the water, the bredth of the moate about 60 foote, the depth of it
6 foote, and the bredth of the Damne 15 foote, it will appeare a
worke of greater bulke, then euer was done in the seruice of this state
since their warres began. Besides, the difficulty of the action, from
the strength of the Garrison, and encouragement they receiued the
night before, from the ill successe of the French attempt.</p>
            <p>A while after the <hi>Miner,</hi> whom the Coronell had sett to work,
makeing an other passage backe, had his braines shoot out with the
same sling peece. And the rest of that day was sorrowfully spent,
in mending, and perfecting the workes, Captaine <hi>Syden-ham,</hi> whose
actiuity, and vigilancie was not wanting in all this buisinesse remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
there.</p>
            <p>Vpon Tewsday night the first of September, Coronell <hi>Colepepper,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:4197:16"/>
relieued Coronell <hi>Gorings</hi> Regiment, and the <hi>Damme</hi> (as is said) being
layd ouer, that night, our men begann to sap a long the <hi>Barme</hi> of the
Horne-worke, and on the right hand of the Horne of the worke,
began to mine: the Ennemy shott hard vpon the damme that night
from the other horne of the worke, which flankered it, and slew, &amp;
hurt foure, or fiue of our men.</p>
            <p>This night also <hi>Monsieur Charnaze</hi> Ambassador for the King of
France, with the Lords the, States and Coronell of a French Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
commaunding in the French approches receiued a shot in his
head, whereof he presently dyed.</p>
            <p>Vpon wensday night the second, my Lord <hi>Morgan,</hi> relieued
Coronell <hi>Colepepper,</hi> this night our men repaired, and heightned the
<hi>Corps of gard,</hi> on both sides of the damme, and began a left hand sap,
a long the moate side of the Horne-worke, the day following was
spent in repairing the workes, makeing of blinds, and setting vp mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketbasketts,
for the safeguard, and defense of our men.</p>
            <p>Vpon Thursday night the Lord of <hi>Brederoods</hi> Regiment tooke
their turne, and his Lieutenant Coronell <hi>Monsieur Thienen</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the approches, our men sapped forward, notwithstanding
that the Ennemie shott hard vpon our workemen: our muskettiers
also giuing fire from our flankes vpon the Ennemies Horne-worke
as fast as they could, and our Canon playing from our batteries, vpon
the parapett of their Horne-worke, to beate downe their musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baskets,
and sand backes about their Eares, and shott much vpon the
horne of the worke, to make it mountable, that our men might haue
the better accesse to come vp to the topp of it.</p>
            <p>Vpon Fryday night the fourth of September newe still. It was
<hi>Count Solms</hi> his turne to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand in the English, and Dutch approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and Monsieur <hi>Buat,</hi> Lieutenant Coronell in the French. His
Highnesse the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> sent expresse order that night, by <hi>Sir
Iacoh Ashley</hi> Lieutenant Coronell to my Lord <hi>Morgan,</hi> that he
would haue both the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> to sett vp, and mainteyne
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4197:17"/>
musket-baskets vpon the top of the Ennemies Horne-worke, and
this was to be done, both by the French, &amp; the English at one time by
day-light, and according to the Prince his order, was attempted on
our side, by Captaine <hi>Skippon</hi> the next morning, being Satterday in the
sight of all men: betweene sixe and seuen of the clock. He tooke
a long with him about 30 of his owne Companie, who vpon this
seruice carryed themselues all well, the one halfe of them, being slaine
and hurt. Himselfe after a long dispute, and fight with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie,
who tumbled downe our Musket-baskets, as fast as our men
set them vp, comming to push of the pike, and slashing off some
of the heads of their pikes, vpon the top of the worke, besides 4 or 5
shott vpon his armour, &amp; head-peece of proofe, receiued a brush on
his face with a stone (which by Gods especiall preuention did him no
further harme) and after that gott a sore shot, through his necke, with
which he was staggred, &amp; for the present lost the vse of his left arme,
(But God remarkeably strenthning him) he presently recouered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
againe, and betooke himselfe to his former place and worke, and
disputed the businesse a long time afterward with the Ennemie. In
the meane time Noble Count <hi>Solmes,</hi> who had a vigilant eye, and a
carefull regard vpon all that passed, sent his owne Captaine with some
musketteirs, to assist Captaine <hi>Skippon,</hi> which he did very worthily,
and (besides other narrow scapes) receiued a shot through his left
arme, and had ten of his men slaine and hurt presently vpon the place
the Ennemie could not be lesse then two hundred, against our few
number that had climed vp to the topp of their worke, to dispute this
action with vs, haueing besides the aduantage of the place, all necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Instruments of offence and deffence, as stones, flailes, clubs, and
handgranadoes, which some of our men wanted, and gaulled vs most
of all, at their pleasure fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right hand flanke of their worke, though
our men did their vttermost endeauour, to execute what was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded,
but the many and great aduantages the Ennemie had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed,
which moued <hi>Count Solmes</hi> to commaund Captaine Skippon,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4197:17"/>
and his owne Captaine to come off with their men, and so that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
being not fesible at that time ceased, vpon which the spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our mine was resolued, the happie successe whereof, two daies
after you shall heare.</p>
            <p>Vpon Satterday night the fifth of September, Coronell Herbert
commaunded in the English approaches, and aduanced the worke on
the left hand sapp very much. On Sunday that nights worke was
repaired, and in the morning the Ennemy Countermining, our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
mining forward, a little earth fell downe in mining through it, by
which hole they discouered the Ennemies Mine, and seeing their
candle in it, they were driuen to stop our mine, and to begin an
other.</p>
            <p>On Sunday the sixth of September, Coronell <hi>Goring</hi> being shot,
it was his Lieutenant Coronels turne to Commaund that night, and
the next day in the approaches, and Monsieur <hi>Maisonneufve</hi> Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
in the French. Betweene ten and eleuen a clock in the night, the
Ennemie sallied out of their workes a matter of some 150 men, vpon
the English left hand sapp, and came stealing along betweene
their halfe moone, before Ginnekens port, and their Horne-worke:
the sap being not defensible, our workemen had order, if the Enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
fell vpon it, to retreate vnto the next <hi>Corps de guard,</hi> the Enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
then falling vpon it, cast a great many hand-granadoes into the
sapp, and entring it began to slgiht two, or three rodd of it. <hi>Ensigne
Willis,</hi> the Coronels Ensigne with 21 pikes, &amp; muskettiers had then
the vtmost <hi>Corps de guard</hi> on the left hand, next vnto the sap, and had
order from Lieutenant Coronell <hi>Hollis,</hi> the chiefe Commandour
there all this time, to make it good, and if the Ennemy fell into the
sap (as is said) that then the workemen should retire to him. Now
all the Coronels Muskettiers and pikes, with ten muskettiers of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
other Companie, which Captaine <hi>Sydenham</hi> fetcht, and brought
vp, were disposed of some on the right, and others on the left hand
of the two <hi>Corps de guard,</hi> and the flanks on both sides of the <hi>Damme,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:4197:18"/>
so that when the Ennemie fell on, they found vs all ready to giue
them entertainement. The Ennemy falling on &amp; getting into the left
hand sapp, came vp to <hi>Ensigne Willis</hi> his <hi>Corps de guard,</hi> and assaulted
it, who very valiantly continued at push of the pike with the Enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
and from the topp of the worke gaue fire vpon them, though
for a great while, no supply was sent him, the Ennemy striuing to
enter, shoud downe our musket-baskets, and indeed hooked
downe, some two or three of them. Lieutenant <hi>Moyle,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to Captaine <hi>Abrahall</hi> his Companie seing this, that Ensigne
Willis was thus engaged in a fight with the Ennemie, hauing but a
few men with him to resist so many, and fearing that the Ennemy
might either enter, or gett betweene him, and the next <hi>Corps de
guard</hi> to cutt him of, gathered vp some muskettiers and pikes, and
came to second him, and finding him at push of the pike, with the
Ennemy, and that some of his men began to flinge He, <hi>Mr. Oneale
Mr. Predeaux</hi> and some other Gentlemen entring: Lieutenant
<hi>Moyle</hi> drew his sword, and made his men fall vp vnto him againe.
Now from all our other <hi>Corps de guard,</hi> and flanks, our Muskettiers
gaue fire vpon the Ennemie, as fast as euer they could charge, and
discharge, <hi>Captaine Sydenham</hi> commaunding our Muskettiers to
shoote as lowe as euer they could, that they might gaule the Enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
the better. The Ennemy finding it very hott, retreated with the
losse of some 50 men slaine and hurt, leauing some armes behinde
them, as a <hi>Lorrannois</hi> one of their owne men, left wounded in the
sap reported to Lieutenant Coronell <hi>Holles,</hi> and some other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciers,
as he was dressed in our <hi>Corps de guard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon this peece of seruice, and in this <hi>Corps de guard</hi> so worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
defended by Ensigne <hi>Willis,</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Moyle</hi> mett with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable
shott vpon his chin: Besides him, <hi>Mr-Marsh</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronels
Companie, carrying himself very stoutly in this action recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
there his mortall wound, whereof within two, or three daies
after he dyed, and one of our <hi>Hand-Granado-men</hi> was shott through
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4197:18"/>
his right hand, which spoyled the casting of his <hi>Granadoes,</hi> and thus
much in brief for this peece of seruice.</p>
            <p>About two of the clock in the morning, the Ennemy being <hi>pott
Valliant</hi> (for they loue to send there men foxt to Purgatorie) would
needes haue an other bout with vs, and as the Ennemies <hi>Alferus</hi>
Seignour <hi>De Belle,</hi> who the next morning was taken prisouner in
their Horne-worke reporteth, that he himselfe (being shott free)
with some others, makeing a noise and crying <hi>Sa, Sa,</hi> giuing vs war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
long enough of his comming, fell downe with his men from
the topp of the Horne-worke to the bottome, to discouer our mine
for that was their intent, Captaine <hi>Monke</hi> the Coronels Captaine
with four pikes, and a musketteir or two, meeting with them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Barme</hi> of the Horne-worke, encountred them on the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest
side of the Damme at push of the pike, beat them back againe
which spoyled their discouerie: and those men of theirs, which
showed their boddies, in giuing fire from the topp of their Horne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke,
our men from all <hi>Corps de guard.</hi> powred such vollies of shot
vpon them, and by giuing fire from a <hi>Drake</hi> planted vpon the topp
of our right hand <hi>Corps de guard,</hi> which carried two pounds of mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kett
bullets, made them pull downe their Eeads quickly, and keepe
themselues vnder couert.</p>
            <p>The next morning being munday the seuenth of September, the
English, and French mines being made readie, a messenger was sent
to his highnes the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to acquaint him therewith, where
vpon the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> himselfe, the Prince <hi>Electour</hi> with his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren,
and diuerse other men of qualite, came downe into the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
the Prince immediately gaue order, for the springing
of both the mines, and the falling on vpon the breaches, which the
mines should make. The first Officer then of the English, which
was to fall vp the Breach, and to enter it was Captaine <hi>Monke,</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronell
<hi>Gorings</hi> Captaine, with 20 musketteirs, and 10 Pikes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him a workemaster with certaine workeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to cast vp a brest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4197:19"/>
them, that they might lodge our men vpon the top of the <hi>Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke.</hi>
Next vnto him Captaine <hi>Abrahall,</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Broome</hi>
was to fall on vpon the right hand with fortie pikes, and 20 musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.
And Captaine <hi>Hamond</hi> with his Ensigne on the luft hand, to
second Captaine <hi>Monke,</hi> with Captaine <hi>Abrahall,</hi> there fell on these
Noble Volunteirs, worthy Officers, and Cauilleros of the Coronels
Companie, my Lord <hi>Grandisson,</hi> Captaine <hi>Croft,</hi> Captaine <hi>la Meere;</hi>
Lieutenant <hi>Turuill,</hi> Cornet <hi>Lucas,</hi> Ensigne <hi>Pagett,</hi> Mr. <hi>Oneall,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Apsley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Eldrington,</hi> Mr. <hi>Symon Fanchy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Griffin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Postlumus
Kirton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Euers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Morley</hi> Mr. <hi>Daniell,</hi> Mr. <hi>Predeaux,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lenthol</hi>
Mr. <hi>Wilford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baskerfeild,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iyle,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Waston,</hi> with diuerse
other Gentlemen of quality. This Companie of pikes kept allwaies
together. The English mine then being sprung, and takeing good
effect, Captaine <hi>Monke,</hi> ere the smoake was vanished, hastens
vp to the breach, and with his commanded men, fell vp to the very
topp of it, where at first, he was entertained with some musketteires
of the Ennemies: but they instantly gaue back, and he with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
men, of which halfe slunck away, aduanced forward into
the worke, where he found a stand of pikes, of about sixe, or seuen
score readie to receiue him. And falling in <hi>pell mell</hi> vpon them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by order, out of an affection to the Coronell, or for a reuenge vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Ennemy, they gaue the word a <hi>Goring</hi> a <hi>Goring,</hi> and though
the Ennemy were twise their number, yet Captaine <hi>Abrahall,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so brauely followed, with a Companie of gallant men, charged
home vpon them, and came to push of the pike with them, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this aduantage that Captaine <hi>Monke</hi> fell vpon the left flanke of
them, and gaulled them shordly with his Musketteirs, Captaine <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brah
all</hi> pressing hard vpon them, this brought the Ennemie into a
disorder, &amp; made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue back. Vpon this the French also falling on
vpon their right flanke from their side, diuerse of them were slaine,
drownd and wholly routed. Vpon the first charge worthy Captaine
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4197:19"/>
               <hi>Crofts</hi> was slaine, My Lord <hi>Grandison</hi> at push of the pike receiued
a wound in his arme, Maister <hi>One all</hi> in his thigh, and Maister <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock</hi>
of Coronell <hi>Gorings</hi> Compaynie, receiued there his mortall
wound. The Ennemie being beaten out of their Horne-worke, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
<hi>Abrahall</hi> with these Voluntiers and Gentlemen, which held
together, followed them ouer a small bridg made of two plankes
broade, at the end whereof, the Ennemie had planted a brasse peece
charged with muskets-bullets whether they persued them so fast,
that they had no time, to discharge it, fearing that they might kill
some of their owne men! yet he that was to giue fire stayed so long,
till Mr. <hi>Eldrington</hi> clapped his hand vpon the peece, and espying the
Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nier neere vnto the peece, with his linstock in his hand charged
his pike against his brest, whereupon he took him prisoner and gaue
him to a priuate Souldier, vpon this seruice he gott a Spanish blade
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a dead Officer: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence our me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> droue the Ennemie vp to their
half moone before <hi>Ginnekins port</hi> with the losse of 150 of their men
at the least, and comming to the <hi>Counterskarfe</hi> of the moate, there
our workemen turnd vp the Earth against the Ennemy, and cast vp a
Brest-worke vpon it, which we held and maintayned: this seruice
was thus performed, and much more fully, then was expected.
wherevpon his Highnesse sent fresh troupes, to relieue those that
had falne on, and as they came of, he embrased Captaine <hi>Abrahall,</hi>
and Captaine <hi>Hamond,</hi> aud thanked all the Officers, voluntiers, and
Gentlemen, who had performed so braue an action, and as if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced,
that Coronell <hi>Goring</hi> was in some part thus reuenged on the
Ennemy, by the valour of his Companie, those of his Regiment, and
the other Companies that were there, &amp; so returned strait way out of
the Approaches to visit him in his hutt, &amp; did relate what had passed
vnto him, which he did with particular <hi>Characters</hi> of the worth of
those men, who had carryed themselues so brauely vpon this seruice.</p>
            <p>The most of the English that entred the Horne-worke, were not
aboue two hundred in all, and the like number of the French (vnder
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4197:20"/>
the Command of Coronell <hi>Maisonnefue</hi>) carryed themselues very
vailliantly, and brauely vpon this peece of seruice (and turne vp a
Brest-worke also against the Ennemy) so that the Ennemy were as
stronge within their Horne-worke, as those that attempted it. Many
prisoners were taken, amonge the rest <hi>Don Godfredo de Bergerie,</hi> a
Spanish Captaine, who commanded the <hi>Horne-worke</hi> and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes,
was taken prisonner by yong Mr. <hi>Francis Perceuall</hi> Inginier,
who after he had receiued two hurts at push of the pike from him,
yeelded himselfe prisonner to him, next him <hi>Seignor Iuan D' Albe</hi> a
Spanish <hi>Alferus</hi> (or Ensigne) was taken prisoner by <hi>Monsieur Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie,</hi>
a gentleman of Coronell <hi>Maisonefs</hi> Company. And after
the Ennemie had called for a parlie, to fetch of their dead, while they
were a tumbling their carkases into a punt, a <hi>Burgonian</hi> Ensigne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Alfererus de Belle</hi> who acted the deadmans part, rising vp in his
shirt, cryed for quarter to Lieutenant <hi>Windon,</hi> who takeing him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonner.
sent him vp to Coronell <hi>Colepepper,</hi> who intertained him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
kindly, &amp; gaue him a suite of cloaths, &amp; intreated euery Captaine
of the watch of his owne Regiment, to take him into their keeping, to
lodge him well &amp; to giue him frendly entertainment, which they did
all, and Lieutenant <hi>Windon</hi> gaue his ransome, among the priuaet hurt
souldiers that were vpon this seruiae. Besides, these men of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
aboue mentioned, there were about 50 Spanyards, and Burgoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
priuate sonldiers taken prisonners, some of them being dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
hurt, others sound and whole.</p>
            <p>The greatest part of our losse was after the Ennemie had lost their
worke, for at the first of those that fell on with Captiane <hi>Monke,</hi> there
was but one slaine, which was a Corporall of the Coronels compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
shott through both his thighas, &amp; but one more hurt, which was
one Mr. <hi>Apsley</hi> a volunteir, shott (but not mortally) in the face &amp;
both his iawes broken. Of those that fell on with Captaine <hi>Abrahall</hi>
there were but two killed, Captaine <hi>Crofts</hi> a volunteir, shott through
the heart, and much lamented by our whole nation, and Maister
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:4197:20"/>
Connock a gentleman of the Coronels companie, and of hurt as is
said, there was the Lord <hi>Grandison</hi> hurt at push of the pike in the
arme, Master Oneal in the thigh, and Master Daniell shott in his
side, the bullet falling downe into his boote, Master Flood, and
Master Wright in the arme, all these were of Coronell <hi>Gorings</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
slaine and hurt: the rest were of other companies, which had
the guard in the English approaches as followeth, of Leiutenant
Coronell Caries companie, one slaine and 5 hurt, of <hi>Sir Ferdinand
Knightlyes</hi> companie one slaine. and one hurt, of Sariant Maiour
<hi>Corbits</hi> companie two slaine and seuen hurt, of Captaine <hi>Abrahals</hi>
Companie one slaine, and two Gentlemen hurt, of Captaine <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi>
companie his Lieutenant <hi>Treymaine,</hi> his Ensigne <hi>Kirck,</hi> his
Seriant <hi>Raymond,</hi> with one souldier more of his companie slaine,
which stood on the left hand more open to the Ennemy and a sling
peece they discharged often vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Of Captaine <hi>Reads</hi> companie
there were three slaine, and foure hurt, of Captaine <hi>Scubbingers</hi> two
slaine, and fiue hurt: so that vpon this peece of seruice with the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
gentlemen, and souldiers, there were 17 slaine in all, and some
thirty hurt.</p>
            <p>What men the French lost I am not able to say, for want of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
bur sure I am, that <hi>Monsieur D' hautcourt,</hi> a braue volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
was hurt vpon this peece of seruice,</p>
            <p>This loftie Horne-worke then being so happily taken in, it was the
very <hi>Creui-coeur,</hi> or <hi>Break-neck</hi> of the Towne, for it gaue accesse vnto
his Highnesse, to come vnto the maine moate of the Towne, and
there vpon the Counterskarfe, to make <hi>Corps de guards,</hi> batteries, &amp;
flankes vpon it, for the more safe putting ouer of the two Galleries,
which were to be begun.</p>
            <p>About this tim came to the Army, other <hi>Voluntiers,</hi> namely
Lieutenant <hi>Roberts,</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Woodhouse,</hi> Ensigne <hi>Washiugton,</hi> Mast:
<hi>Walker,</hi> and diuerse others, which marched downe with Coronell

            <p>Vpon Tewsday the eight, Coronell <hi>Colepepper</hi> releiuing Coronell
<hi>Gorings</hi> Regiment they turnd vp the earth vpon the top of the Horne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke

and sett vp Musket-baskets, to flancker the wall of the towne

the English with six halfe Canon a peece vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, to fauour our gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries,

            <p>Vpon wensday the 9 of September the English and French galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

vpon condition they must be both made within 14 daies after the
tenth of this month &amp; if he were longer then for euery day he should
haue 200 gilders shortened from him. The French gallery was to
be put ouer to the right face, and the English to the left face of Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nekens

            <p>Vpon Thursday night the 10 of Sept: Lieutenant Coronell <hi>Erskins</hi>
commanding that night in the Scotch &amp; Dutch, Approches receiued
order from Count William about 10 a clock in the night, to prepare
the mines in the Horneworke, and lay ouer the Bies, or Flagg-brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
against the morning, &amp; afterward to spring the mine, to assault
that worke, and beat the Ennemy out of it if it were possible. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was giuen for the assault in this manner following, that first a
Lieutenant, and a Sariant with 50 men fire-locks, and Spring-stocks
accompanied with foure Granadomen, should fall on, after the mine
was sprung, &amp; after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lieutenant Gladstone with 50 men, &amp; a Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iant
with halfe pikes &amp; half muskettiers should giue on, &amp; to second
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4197:21"/>
them Captaine <hi>Iohn</hi> Leueston, commanding a hundred men Pikes, &amp;
Muskettiers with Lieutenant <hi>Duncan,</hi> Ensigne <hi>Niece,</hi> and two Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iants
was to fall on, next after them Captaine <hi>Kilpatrick</hi> with his
owne Ensigne, and two Sariants was to second the former with 80
pikes: in the last place the Lieutenant Coronell abouesaid, was to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
with the body of the troupes, and after him a hundred com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
workemen with matterials: but in regard our mine was
found out by the Ennemie ere morning, things were differed till fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
order from Count <hi>William.</hi> Afterward, it was resolued that the
day following, one of the mines vpon necessity should be made
ready, and at 12 of the clock in the day: notwithstanding the two
daies preparation, the Ennemy made to answere the Assault, our
Flagg-bridges were layd ouer the moate of their Horne-worke, in
the full sight of the Ennemy, and our troupes, while those men came
marching downe out of the quarter, to succour vs in the Approaches
&amp; before all things were prepared, it was six a clock at night, &amp; past
the time of reliefe, ere all things were in areadinesse. The mine then
being ready, orders was giuen for the springing of it, which was done
accordingly, but the mine being sprung, it made not that operation
as was expected, for it sprung backward in the worke to our owne
great disaduantage: for it brake, and spoyled the Flaggbridges,
that laye ouer the moat for the Dutche firelocks to passe ouer,
and so hindred much our passage ouer the Damne, and their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
on vpon the horneworke it selfe, finding much difficulty to clime
vp after the breach was made. Howsoeuer, the order was followed
and the Lieutenant of the Fire-locks, with his Sariant passed the
Damme, and fell vp to the breach, with as many as were able to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:
in regard of the breaking of the flagg-bridge: yet they scram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
vp, &amp; entred, carrying themselues very well, but the Horne worke
being cutt of in diuers places, were driuen to a retreate, for the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
was hurt, &amp; the Sargiant of the fire-locks slaine, with diuerse
of his men, which stood so open to the Ennemies shott. They being
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4197:22"/>
beaten of, and the Ennemy defending the ropp of the breach with
clubbs, flailes, stones, &amp; Handgranadoes, casting in rize-busshes vpon
the topp of it, to make a blinde for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Lieutenant <hi>Gladstone</hi> secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them, and brooke in againe through the breach with diuerse of
his men: but the Ennemy returning with a new furie vpon the breach
kild the Lieutenant, and some that entred with him, and beate of the
rest. Afterward Captaine Iohn <hi>Leuiston</hi> mounted vp to the breach
with a few pikes: the discommodity of this passage was such, that
half his men could not come vp, at length Captaine <hi>Kilpatrick</hi> fell on,
with as many of his pikes, as he could gett ouer, &amp; was seconded with
some muskettiers commaunded by Lieutenant <hi>Blake,</hi> of Coronell
<hi>Gorings</hi> Regiment, with these Lieutenant Coronell <hi>Iames Henderson</hi>
Captaine Balford of Coronell <hi>Sandalins</hi> Regiment, with Captaine
<hi>Williamson,</hi> Ensigne <hi>Hamelton,</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Turuill,</hi> all Voluntiers, and
seeking honour, charging vpon the right hand with a more furious
charge then the former, striuing to enter, entred &amp; beate the Ennemy
to a retreate, from of the topp of the breach, where Captine <hi>William<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
dyed valiantly, and the Ennemy finding themselues ouerprest
with a more furious assault then the former, were forced to retire
from the breach, and turne their backs: insomuch that wee entred
the worke, &amp; beate them vp to their Counterskarfe, out of all the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerses
they had cutt of in their Horneworke, but one which lay vpon
the lest winge of the Horne-worke, being both exceeding high, and
Canon proose with a moate of 16 foote broade, and water in yt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it: from whence they flew our men with musketts and Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granadoes,
hauing no deffense against it, neither were wee able to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them. And our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded men who should haue cast vp a Brest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke
in some kinde for our deffence, could not come vp through
the discommodity of the passage, and though they could haue come
vp, yet our me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had all be slayne, ere they could haue cast vp a place of
defense for our safety, so that the impossibility of the mainteyning of
the worke being such, did cause a retreate with the losse of 150 men
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4197:22"/>
slaine, and hurt, and diuerse Officers, among whom was Licutenant
Coronell <hi>Iames Henderson,</hi> Captayne <hi>Williamson</hi> Ensigne <hi>Hamelton</hi>
Ensigne <hi>Fargeson</hi> all slayne. Captaine <hi>Balford,</hi> Captaine <hi>Kilpatrick,</hi>
Ensigne <hi>Niece,</hi> quarter-master <hi>Egmonds</hi> Inginier hurt, Sariant <hi>Corbitt,</hi>
Sariant <hi>Inglish,</hi> and Sariant <hi>Lindsay</hi> kild, and so returning out of the
Horne-worke, that night the Ennemy sensible of their losse, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
with a feare, that the Dutches and Scocth would haue are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
&amp; fall on with a more furious assault, Monsieur <hi>Puchler</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the next night, they quitted the worke voluntarily, &amp; leau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an number of Armes &amp; bagged behinde them, wee possessed the
the Horne-worke quietly.</p>
            <p>Vpon Fryday night the eleuenth of September Coronell <hi>Herbert</hi>
had the Commaund in the Approaches, vnder whose Companic
these worthy Voluntiers marched downe, namely, <hi>Mr. Herbert</hi>

Captaine of a Troupe of Horse in his Maiestie seruice in Irela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
with <hi>Mr. Bryan</hi> came to the Army and trailed pikes vnder his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie.
This night and the day following the work was well aduanced
and there was sett vp foure posts in the English Gallerie.</p>
            <p>Vpon Satterday the 12 of September, the French Gallerie being

the moate, hauing this day 20 posts, the Ennemy with their Cannon
beate downe 5 posts, kild a work-maister, and some two Souldiers
more, but the next day all was repaired, and the posts sett vp againe.</p>
            <p>On Satterday night the 12 it was Lieutenant Coronell <hi>Holles</hi>

            <p>This night a man was sent out of the Towne from the Gouuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
and taken with a letter written to the <hi>Cardinall Infant</hi> in <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ractars,</hi>
the contents whereof were these, that vnlesse his Highnesse
could relieue the Towne within fiucteene daies, he could not well
hold it out any longer.</p>
            <p>This Euening also the English, and the French Batteries with sixe
halfe Canon were readie, planted vpon the <hi>Counterskarfe,</hi> and the
brink of the moate, which seowred along the moate, and curtaine of

Galleries.</p>
            <p>Vpon Munday night the 14, Lieutenant Coronell <hi>Thienen</hi> relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued

Thursday at night, when he was relieued there was 33 posts sett vp,
so that we were gott 6 rodd into the moate.</p>
            <p>This night <hi>Sir Symon Harcourt</hi> returned with the foure English
Companies, that he had a long with him to the Army.</p>

through it, and went out at the Entrance into the Gallery, and with
the very wind of it kild a man in the Gallerie, this night and the day
following the English Gallerie was aduanced to 36 posts, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

men, that wrought at the end of our Gallerie, three <hi>Drakes</hi> were

            <p>Vpon Thursday night the 17, Coronell <hi>Herbert</hi> commaunded in
the Approaches, and made a good nights worke, for there was
throwne from the ende of the Gallerie into the moate that night 750

the Ennemies Horne-worke on the Castle side, but the bridge break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
our men with the losse of some slaine, and others drownd (the
water being very deepe) were driuen to retire into their workes, his
men gaue fire exceedingly vpon the Ennemy with Cannon, &amp; small

in the Approaches. This night for the aduancing of the
Callerie there were cast into the moate aboue eleuen hundred Rize-busshes,
and many hundred wheele barrowes of earth, so carefull was
the Coronell to aduance the worke, and yet (thanks be to God) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Ennemy shott very much, he had but three men
slaine and hurt.</p>
            <p>The French likewise cast in a great many rize-bushes this night in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the moate, and came with them within three pikes length of the
<hi>barme</hi> of the Bulwarke: which the Ennemie discouering what a great
nights worke they had done, the next morning had sunck two peeces
which shott iust into the mouth of their gallerie, that beate downe
sixe, or seuen of their posts, which disaster cast them a daies worke,
behinde hand, ere they could repaire the Gallerie, &amp; sett vp their posts
againe.</p>
            <p>On Sunday night the twentith <hi>Monsieur Thienen</hi> the Lotd of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derods</hi>

moate) there was cast into it aboue fiue hundred risebushes, &amp; yet had
but three, or foure men slaine and hurt.</p>
            <p>This euening there was some of our Leger boates brought downe
into the Horne-worke, and launched into the moate of the halfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moone,
behind the morter batterie, and the next day there were great
<hi>backs,</hi> or chests built vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with high oake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> boards musket proof
&amp; the chests filled with Rizebushes, and earth with pluggs in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of them, which being puld out vpon any occasion, they
sunck 6, 7, or 8 foote deepe, and had likewise oares on both sides of
them, that the men which rowed them might be vnder, couert and
shott free,</p>
            <p>This Afternoone Monfieur <hi>D'escard</hi> a worthy French Captaine,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4197:24"/>
who had carryed himself very brauely vpon the first sallie, which the
Ennemie made vpon the French Approaches before mentioned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
a dangerous shott into his mouth, and throate, whereof with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
fiue or sixe dayes after he dyed, &amp; was much lamented.</p>
            <p>Vpon Munday night the 21 my Lord <hi>Morgan</hi> went downe to
commaund in the Approaches, two of his owne Companie taking
vpon them to cast Rize-busshes into the moate, for twelue Rixdal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
a hundred were slaine, and the Ennemie hanging out two great
lights ouer the wall, (not witstanding that our Canon and small shott
playd much vpon them) to see what our men did in their moate, yet
they slew, and hurt sixe or seuen men more, howsoeuer towards
morning there were found some resolute Souldiers, which for 14
Rixedallers a hundred, cast in 250 Rize-busshes into the moate,
and gott 4 posts more sett vp, so that wee had in all 49 posts vp,
which reached more then halfe way ouer the moate, and we found
that the moate grew shallower, after wee had passed ouer the midst
of it.</p>
            <p>This day the great chests, and boates aboue mentioued were made
ready musket proofe, with thick oaken plankes, and oares fitte to
them, and the backs, or chests fild vp with rize-bushes and earth, and
lay ready whensoeuer his highnesse should haue occasion to vse
them.</p>
            <p>The 22 being Tewsday night Count <hi>Solmes</hi> relieued my Lord
<hi>Morgan,</hi> and (thanks be to God) had but one man shott. He
gaue fire exceedingly this night vpon the Ennemie, with his musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
from all <hi>Corps de guards,</hi> and flankes, and being moone-light our
Cannon also played vpon them, which kept them from peeping
ouer, and vnder couert. This night there were noe Ris-busshes cast,
neither into the English, nor the French Galleries, but our men cast
in earth to fill vp the moate, and to gett forward: so that this night
wee had one and fiftie posts sett vp in our English Gallery.</p>
            <p>On wenscay night the 23 of September Coronell <hi>Herbert</hi> releiued
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4197:25"/>
Count <hi>Solms,</hi> and aduanced the work very much: for that night and
day there were three posts more got, makeing in all 54 &amp; the French

workemasters order, to cast noe rizebushes this night into the moat,
but should worke out that which was cast into the moate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
and sett vp posts in the French and English Galleries, till they
came to the end of the Rize, which lay in the water.</p>
            <p>The Prince now euery day going downe into the approaches to
view, encourage, and aduance forward the workes, hazarded his
person much, &amp; escaped some dangerous shott, that came neere him:
for Coronell <hi>Wynebergin</hi> this afternoone, being in his Highnesse
traine, receiued a dangerous shott vpon his <hi>Eybrow,</hi> which if the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
had perced a litle deeper, it had slaine him.</p>
            <p>Vpon Thursday night the 24, Lieutenant Coronell <hi>Holles</hi> relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
Coronell <hi>Herbert</hi> this night the work was reasonable well aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
but towards morning the Ennemy hauing sunck new peeces,
shott downe three of our posts sett vp in the English Gallerie, the

            <p>Vpon Satterday towards euening, the Ennemy shott a Granado of
some seuenty pound weight, just into our Horne-worke, and fell
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4197:25"/>
close by our Battetie neere vnto seuen Barrels of Powder, it brake
and toore a Marriners thigh all to peeces.</p>
            <p>The very same day also wee shott a great <hi>Granado</hi> of 180 pound
weight, which flew into the Towne almost as farre as the great
Church, and breaking with a great violence, a peece of the bullet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded,
and flew back againe into our Horne-worke.</p>
            <p>Vpon Sunday the 27, Count <hi>Harrie Gasimir</hi> Gouernour of <hi>Friz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
hauing made a Gallerie of 21 posts ouer the moate of the
Horneworke on his side, attempted to haue taken it in, but finding it
not feisible at that time, leauing the Horneworke, sapped forward
towards the Counterskarfe of the maine moate before the Castle,
and there to lodge himselfe in it, and so to begin a gallerie ouer the
moate.</p>
            <p>Vpon Sunday night towards euening, when Lieuetenant Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
<hi>Thienen</hi> was relieued, the English gallerie had 68 posts sett vp,

commaund in the approaches, our men shott exceedingly this night,
and my Lord <hi>Morgan</hi> aduanced the worke so much, that this night
and the day following, there was sett vp fiue posts more, so that there
was in the English Gallerie 73 posts, in the French 55, and in Count
Williams gallerie 59.</p>
            <p>On Munday night the 28 Count <hi>Solmes</hi> releiued my Lord <hi>Morgan:</hi>
this night the Ennemie, and our men shott much, yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,

            <p>Vpon Tewsday night the 29 Coronell <hi>Herbert</hi> relieued Count

pouder, which was in the muskettiers bandeliers, and the pouder
bagges they brought downe, our muskettiers shott away that night
and the next day eleuen hundred pound of powder extraordinarie,
as appeared by the Coronels hand. Towards morning the Ennemie
hauing sunck two halfe Canon vpon the wall, lower then ordinarie,
hoising vp the briches of their Canon with an Instrument, and great
cables, they shott so low, that they shot, and brake downe sixe, or 7

much to dismount theirs, yet they could not find them in the night.</p>
            <p>This hindred the aduancement of the English Gallerie much, and
cast vs behinde hand, but the carefulnes and the vigilencie of his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
was such, that comming downe into the Approaches, the next
morning, he gaue order that the Gallerie should be repaired with all
expedition, and new posts sett vp in their places: which was done
with all speede by ten a clock on wensday night following.</p>
            <p>Vpon wensday also his highnes gaue order for the makeing of two
new batteries, for the finding and dismounting of the Ennemies Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
which played vpon our gallerie. The one was made vpon the top
of the Horneworke, not farre from the place where our English mine
was sprung. The other where the Coronels Companies held their
<hi>grand Corps de guard.</hi> These being planted beate vpon the Enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
port holes, and put one of their halfe Canon presently to
silence.</p>
            <p>Vpon wensday night the last of September, it was Lieutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronell
<hi>Holles</hi> his turne to commaund in the Approaches. This night
the worke was so advanced, that their was diuerse Rize-busshes cast
into the moate, and three posts more sett vp. This night, also there
was one <hi>Iohn Trotter</hi> of Coronell <hi>Gorings</hi> Companie, that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
the pyling of the moate from the ende of our Gallerie, to the
barme of the Bulwark, and hauing stript himself naked hauing a long
match bound about his Armeholes, he was lett out at a hole on the
right side of the Gallerie, and being come to the end of our Rize-busshes,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4197:26"/>
found the water to be betweene fiue and sixe foote, &amp; swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two or three stroakes further felt ground, and came to foure foote
deepe, and wading a litle further came to three foote water, and so
gott vp vpon the barme of the Bulwarke, and vp to the quick sett
hedg, or <hi>Pallissado</hi> vpon it. And then being puld back by those that
were within the Gallerie, which held the end of the match came
safely back againe, and found by the markes vpon the match, that
wee wanted yet a matter of some 40 foote, from the end of our Rize-busshes
to the foundation of the Bulwarke, this Souldier for his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couuerie
was rewarded with twentie Rix-Dallers.</p>
            <p>On Thursday morning the next day Captaine <hi>Willmot</hi> my Lord
<hi>Wilmots</hi> Sonne, Captaine of a Troupe of Horse, going downe into
the Approaches, and looking too long through our Muskett-bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketts,
receiued a dangerous shott, which grazed along his right Jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,
and so by his throat, whereof he is now recouuered.</p>
            <p>This day also <hi>Iohu Williams,</hi> a Work-master of Gurcum, in giving
some direction about our Gallerie, was slaine with a muskett-bullet.</p>
            <p>Vpon Thursday night the first of October, Coronell <hi>Colepepper</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued
Lieutenant <hi>Coronell Holles,</hi> the worke was well advanced, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that the Ennemie shott much this night, both with their
Canon, and small shott to hinder vs. This night also there was a planck
bridge, on Count <hi>Harries</hi> side layd ouer the moate of the Horne-worke,
before the Castle, which twise had ben attempted before,
in makeing a Dam, but was then not found fesible.</p>
            <p>Vpon Fryday night the second, Lieutenant Coronell <hi>Thienen</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued
Coronell <hi>Colepepper,</hi> and aduanced the worke much, and this
night there was a mine a preparing on Count <hi>Harries</hi> side in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the <hi>Horne-worke,</hi> where the Ennemie had cut it of.</p>
            <p>Vpon Satterday the third, betweene eleuen and twelue of the
clock Count <hi>Harries</hi> mine on the Castle side being readie, his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
gaue commaund, that this mine should be sprung, and that
Count <hi>Harrie,</hi> hauing sapt a long the Horne-worke towards the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4197:27"/>
Raueling, which lay before the Castle, should assault both the Horn-worke,
and the Raueling at once, and withall to giue the Ennemy
worke on all sides, gaue order also that the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch this day being come
within two pikes length of the Bulwarke, should fill vp the moate
with Rize-busshes from the end of their Gallerie, to the barme of the
Bulworke. These two peeces of seruice were to be done at one time.
Count <hi>Harries</hi> mine being then sprung at the time appointed, fell on
brauely with his men vpon the Horne-worke, and the Raueling,
which lay vpon the side of it, &amp; gaue fire by whole volleys vpon the
Ennemie for the space of an hower, beate the Ennemie out of their
Horne-work, and tooke in the Raueling, notwithstanding the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie
shott, exceedingly from of the Castlewall, both with ordinance
and small shott to hinder them, so that they droue the Ennemie into
the Towne, turnd vp the Raueling, and so had accesse to the Castle
moate, to begin a Gallerie ouer it. Vpon this seruice Captaine <hi>Roussell</hi>
was slaine. While this was a doing, on Count <hi>Williams</hi> side, Coronell
<hi>Balford</hi> hauing the commaund in the Dutch, and Scotch Approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
commaunded there the Cannoniers, and muskettiers, to giue
fire vpon the Ennemie, and into the Towne as fast as euer they could
charge and discharge, and in the French and English Approaches,
while the French was a filling, and damming vp the moate from the
end of their Gallerie all the Cannon being some two and twenty on
our side, and all our muskettiers both from the French, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Approaches, gaue fire by whole volleys vpon the Ennemie, that
vnder the fauour thereof they might with the more safety fill vp the
moate with Rize-busshes, which with much valour, and courage
was performed with good Successe &amp; layd them ouer, now on Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday
night following, plancks was layd ouer the Rize-busshes for
the better comming to the Bulwarke and blindes sett vp before the
mouth of the Mine, and so began their mine that night.</p>
            <p>Vpon Satterday night it was my Lord <hi>Morgans</hi> turne to command
in the Approaches: this night the English Gallerie was aduanced, as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4197:27"/>
farre as it could be, so that the next morning, our Rizebushes lay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
two pikes length of the foote of the Bulwarke, &amp; on Sunday mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
about eight of the clock, his highnesse gaue order to my Lord
<hi>Morgan,</hi> to attempt the laying ouer of our rize-bushes to the foote of
the Bulwarke, sixe resolute men were found out, which vndertooke
it for 20 Rixdallers a peece, and others to bring Rizebushes, as fast as
they could to fill vp the moate. The end of the Gallerie being ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
it was attempted, and my Lord <hi>Morgan</hi> commanded that our
Canon, and the musketteirs from all gardes, (especialy his owne,)
should giue fire as fast as they could, to fauour our men that were a
laying ouer the rize-bushes, but lying so open to the Ennemies view,
ordinance, the curtaine and Fanks of the Towne, the most of the
vndertakers being all slaine and hurt, it was not found feisible at that
time, till the obscurity of the night might afford more shelter to our
men.</p>
            <p>Vpon Sunday night the fourth of October, Count <hi>Solms</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
in the Approaches, and this night while our men gaue fire
from all sides, our Rize-busshes were luckely layd ouer to the very
foote and barme of the Bulwark, and blinds sett vp on the left
hand of the Rize-busshes, as a shelter for the Miners to come to the
Bulwarke, where they made also a blinde of thick-oaken plankes
Muskett proof, &amp; there began a mine in the bowels of the Bulwarke.
The day following Monsieur <hi>Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meler,</hi> Count <hi>Solms</hi> his Ensigne was
slaine. This night also Count <hi>William</hi> on his side had layd ouer the
Rize-busshes, and began to mine.</p>
            <p>Vpon Munday night the fifth, Coronell <hi>Herbert</hi> marched downe
to commaund in the Approaches, and gaue encouragement for the
hastning of the worke, and the mine. The Ennemie and our men
shott exceedingly this night, and about three a clock in the morning
the Ennemy lett fly three, or foure peeces of Canon vpon our Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and workes, which rowsedvp out Cannoniers, who till morning
payd them with their owne coine, as fast as euer they could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4197:28"/>
and that our muskettiers could giue fire, so that the Ennemie
feareing his Highnesses mines to be readie, and that he might be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
vpon two or three breaches at once, notwithstanding he had
cutt of Ginnekens and Anwerps Bulwarks most dangerously against
vs, and had begun a Countermine, but (as it is reported) wanted
powder to lay in them, feareing the worst, and not daring to stand
out an Assault, our Gallerie being advanced to 81 posts, and the
French Mine 18 and the English 12 foote into the Bulwarke.</p>
            <p>On Tewsday Morning about seuen of the clock, the Ennemie cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for a parley, the Drum beate first towards the English, and had
commaund to doe foe from the Gouernour, but being shott through
his hatt by an vnexpert musketteir in the English Approaches, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with such a buysinesse, turned to the French, and was puld
downe by a Sariant into the French Gallerie. This Morning Mr.
<hi>Herbert</hi> Kinsman to the Coronell, &amp; sonne to my Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> who
was shott before through his arme, receiued a second shot tearing his
boote, &amp; raizing the flesh of his right toe along the bone. About ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
of the clock that day <hi>Hostages</hi> came out of the towne to his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and ours went in, what followed vpon it, the Articles of Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
hereuuto annexed, will giue the Reader to vnderstand the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.
And thus as truely, and as briefly as I can, I haue related
vnto you by what degrees it pleased the Lord of hosts by his Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
hand, and outstreched Arme through soe many dangers, to leade
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> into his citty and ancient inheritance againe, to

            <p>About eleuen of the clock the Ennemy began to march out of the

their Avantguard 42 rankes of musketteirs fiue in ranke, consisting of
<hi>Burgonians, Walloons</hi> and some other nations, all ranged under 16
<hi>Burgonian Coullours,</hi> which marched altogether, &amp; this was their first
diuision, next vnto them followed 50 rankes more of pikes, and mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4197:34"/>
of all sorts of nations vnder three coullours, these two diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
made the <hi>Auantgard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After them followed a number of waggons, laden with Officiers
wiues, gentlewomen, women, children, and baggage.</p>
            <p>Their Battaill consisted of 15 coullours, which marched altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vnder which they had ranked 53 rankes of <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> pikes,
&amp; firelocks, among which there were some, boyes, &amp; sick souldiers.</p>
            <p>After them also followed many waggons, and Karrs loaded with
piks, and musketteirs, Casks, and other instruments &amp; materialls
of warre, haueing also some Clergie men sitting vpon them, and
some others as <hi>Gray friers,</hi> &amp; Preaching priests which went a foote.</p>
            <p>Next vnto them followed three Coullors makeing 77 rankes, of
Pikes and musketteires.</p>
            <p>After them came fiue Coullours, more makeing 89 rankes of
pikes and Musketteirs</p>
            <p>After these came a great number of Waggons, and six good
peeces of <hi>ordinance</hi> foure of them were halfe Canon, and 2 Culue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
the two greatest had 29 horses to draw them, and the two other
demy Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had 17 horses a peece to draw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the two lesser peeces

twelue Barrels of powder for their ordinance, with other necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

            <p>After these followed <hi>Monsieur Gomer Fourdine the Gouernour</hi>
who was taken prisoner by vs, when Count John of Nassaw say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
from Antwerp with his fleete in Sept. Anno 1631. (Who also
was turnd out of Skincksconce the last of Aprill 1636, and now out
of <hi>Breda</hi> this yeere 1637,) in a closse coach hauing bin sick of a feuer,
but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming into the feild neere the prince, he came out of his coach
and gott a horse back, and comming nigh vnto his highnesse he
light from his horse, and two persons that was with him, the Prince
seing him coming towards him, lighted likewise from his horse, and
after some salutations, and curtesies showed one to an other, hauing
had some short speeches one to an other, he tooke his leaue of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4197:35"/>
Prince in most frendly manner: But the Drossard of the citty had
longer conference with his highnesse.</p>
            <p>After him followed a great many waggons, vpon the formost of
them sat 10 or 12 Iesuits, who did not so much as once moue their
hats to the Prince: so much they stood vpon their <hi>pontificalibus,</hi> after
them followed 30 rankes of Souldiers vnder foure Coullours, which
marched together: then came a good many of waggons againe, &amp;
after them <hi>a procession of 16 Capuchian Fryers,</hi> marching with great
deuotion, the formost of them bearing a redd <hi>wooden crosse</hi> in signe
of the passion, hauing hanging vpon yt, a rodd, a hamer, a paire of
tongs, nailes, a spunge, and a crowne of thornes, and these brought
vp their battaile.</p>
            <p>Lastly, their, Arriergard consisted of 150 <hi>Spanyards,</hi> and <hi>Nepoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
ranged into 27 rankes vnder sixe Coullours, which as before
marched betweene the two middle rankes, of the pikes. <hi>Alferus
de Belle,</hi> that had acted the dead mans part, and was taken prisoner
in the Horne-worke, for the kinde curtesie and humanity, he had
found from the English, especially, from <hi>Coronell Colepeper</hi> and the
Captaynes and officers of his Regiment, showed himself a gratefull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
saluted all the officers, and thanked them all for the kind vsage
he had receiued from them, saying, that if euer it was his fortune to
take any of them prisoners, they should finde the like vsage from him</p>
            <p>The number of Coullours and men, which the Ennemy marched
out of the towne were counted to be 51 Coullours with <hi>Dirick the
Conestables</hi> making 1470 able men in ranke and file, besides officers,
and betweene 5 or 6 hundred men that attended the waggons, stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers,
sick, &amp; hurt men that satt vpon waggons, besides diuerse others
that stayed in the towne all night, &amp; a great many sick and hurt men
that were left behinde them in the Towne and Gesthouse, till they
had recouered their health: so that it is supposed the Ennemy that
day marched out of the Towne about 22 hundred, able, sick, and
hurt men besides officers. Many of the Officers and souldiers were
very souldierlike men with sterne countenances &amp; all the officers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
redd skarfes about them, and the souldiers redd and blew rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4197:35"/>
and thus thee <hi>Reere</hi> being past, they marched towards a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
called <hi>Gilsen,</hi> but the night ouertaking them (for it was foure a
clock in the afternoone ere the last of their reere marched out of the
Towne) they were saint to quarter that night vpon the heath, vnder
the <hi>heauens canopie,</hi> &amp; on the morrow being the Sabboth day at the
creeke of the day sett forward their march towards <hi>Machline,</hi> the
Towne they desired to goe vnto.</p>
            <p>It resteth now that somthing be spoaken in what state wee found
the Towne, assone as the Ennemy had drawne off their men, from
<hi>Ginnekens Bulwarke,</hi> in the bowels whereof his highnes had intended
to haue sprung to mines, and to haue made two breaches, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
which had the gard in the approches, had order from the
Prince euery company according to their antiquity, to aduance and
and mount vp to the topp of that Bulwarke, &amp; to draw the formost
companyes into the Market place. The Bulwarke was cut of twise,
and they had made a Countermine in it, to haue met with ours, but
haueing not powder enough to chamber in it, being reported they
had but 24 Barrels left in all, the whole towne, they durst not venter
any powder in their myne, nor stand out the springing of ours, there
was found vpon the wals 43 peeces most of them brasse, six vpon
the Castle wall, and three vpon the plaine before the Castle.</p>
            <p>The two streets which lyes next Ginnekins port, and Antwerps
port towards the Hagh, the howses are miserably battered &amp; beaten
downe and torne with our ordinances, and great granadoes of 170
and 180 pounds. The next day that the Ennemie marched out being
Sunday, there was a sermon preached in the great Church about 10
of the Clock in the morning by D. N. preacher of <hi>Wick to Duer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stadt</hi>
he tooke his text out of of the 40 Psalme and fifth verse,
<hi>Many o Lord my God, are thy wonderfull workes, which thou hast done
&amp; thy thoughts which are to vs-ward they cannot be reckoned vp in order
vnto thee, if I would declare, and speake of them, they are more then can
be numbred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before the sermon was sung the second part of the 66 Psalme, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4197:36"/>
after the Sermon the second part of the 118 Psalme, and foure chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were Baptized. In the after noone sermon his text was out of
the 118 Psalme, and the 15 verse, to witt. <hi>The voice of reioycing,
and saluation is in the tabernacle of the Righteous: the right hand of the
Lorddoth valiantly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before the afternons sermon was sung the second part of the
119 Psalme, and after the sermon the 100 Psalme. The Church
was as full as euer it could throng, the poore haueing giuen them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
these two sermons aboue 4000 gilders.</p>

            <p>The day before the Ennemie marched out off the Towne, they
puld downe all their Images, and cleered the Church off them, and
packt them vp in fats, and Caskes, and assoone as the Ennemy was
gone out of the towne, a saylor climed vp to the topp of the weather
Cock, off that high steeple, and set vp a great <hi>Orang-flagg</hi> aboue the

            <p>Before this strong, and mighty Citty <hi>Marquis Spinola</hi> lay eleuen
