         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Mendoza, Marques</hi> of
<hi>Santilliana,</hi> &amp; Earle of
the Realme of <hi>Manca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nares,</hi>
Lorde of <hi>Vega,</hi>
ſonne of the Admirall
<hi>Don Diego de Hurtado,</hi> and nephewe to
<hi>Peter Goncales de Mendoza,</hi> Lord of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua,</hi>
was a man of a meane ſtature, verie well
limmed and proporcioned, and of a gracious
countenance, diſcended of great parentage, a
<hi>Caſtilian</hi> and verie ancient. He was a man
of a quicke iudgement, and diſcrete, and of ſo
great a minde, that neither could the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt
matters that were diſmay him, nor the
dealing in matters of ſmal moment any whit
delight him. In the ſtaiedneſſe of his perſon,
and the grauitie of his ſpeach, he ſhewed him
ſelfe to be a Gentleman, and of a noble mind.
He was a man, as they vſe to ſay, verie well
ſpoken, ſo as hee was ſeldome heard to ſpeake
any thing that was not woorth the noting:
whether it were in matters of learning, or of
<pb facs="tcp:9300:4"/>
diſport. He was courteous and of great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteinment
to all ſuch as came vnto him,
ſpecially learned men. After the deceaſe
of the Admirall his father, and the Ladie
<hi>Eleanor</hi> of <hi>Vega</hi> his mother, being left ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
yong and within age, he was diſſeiſed of
the <hi>Aſturies</hi> of <hi>Santilliana</hi> and a greate
peece of his liuing beſide. But comming to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
yeares, &amp; perceiuing himſelf to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
abuſed, verie want and neceſsitie, which
many times awaketh a good wit, &amp; his great
mind that could not abide to be conſined, made
him to vſe ſuch diligence, as partly by lawe,
partly by ſwoorde, hee did ſhortly recouer his
owne. Hee was both in his meate and his
drinke verie temperate, hauing herein a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
and ſpeciall grace. Touching his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
he gaue himſelfe in his life time vnto
two notable exerciſes, the one the feates of
armes, the other ſtudie and learning, neither
did his warlike exerciſes anie whit hinder his
ſtudie, nor his ſtudie was anie impediment to
the conference which he had with the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours
and Gentlemen of his houſe: about the
trampe &amp; faſhion of their armour &amp; Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of defence, howe to offend the enimie,
how to order his battails, &amp; how to encampe,
<pb facs="tcp:9300:5"/>
how to aſſault, and how to defend fortreſſes,
and other like actions belonging to martiall
affaires, wherin hee tooke a great deale the
more pleaſure, becauſe he had therwith been
brought vp from his youth. And to the ende
that ſuch as ſerued vnder him might haue
experience of ſuch things as they had hearde
him ſpeake off, hee had alwayes in his houſe,
Tilt, Turney, and Barriers, with ſundry other
exerciſes belonging to the fielde, to the ende
that his people being alwayes accuſtomed to
ſuch martiall exerciſes, might better away
with the paines of a ſouldier, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they came
to it. Hee was a gentleman of great nobility
and valour, beeing in his determinations ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
wiſe and temperate, and in his execution
ſpeedy and reſolute: ſo as there could neither
be founde any raſhneſſe in his courage, or any
iot of cowardiſe in his deuiſes. He had been
Generall in many fought Battailes betwixt
the Chriſtians and the Sarazens, wherein he
both wan and loſt. But the greateſt and of
moſt account, was a battaile that was fought
with the <hi>Aragoneſes,</hi> and one other at the
riuer of <hi>Torotto.</hi> And theſe two Battailes
were indeed every hot and blooddy. For figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
without any retire on either ſide, there
<pb facs="tcp:9300:5"/>
were ſlaine an infinite number on both ſides:
at which ſeruices, becauſe this worthy ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
happened to be preſent, though hee ſawe
his owne forces all to weake, and very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete
to match with the enimie, yet becauſe
the enemie was in ſight, he thought it a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhame and reproche to turne his backe
without Battaile, then to looſe his life or the
fielde in fighting. Wherevpon he determined
to try the battaile, wherein hee fought with
ſuch egerneſſe and courage, that although
he was his ſelfe ſore hurt, and all his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
defeated, yet for his own perſon he gained
the name and reputation of a worthy &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
Captaine. The ſufficiencie of this noble
gentleman beeing thorowly knowen to King
<hi>Iohn,</hi> he was ſent Lieutena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t general againſt
the <hi>Sarazens,</hi> which charge he toke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him
with a verye glad and willing minde, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
a long time vpon the frontiers. During
which ſeaſon he fought diuers battailes, and
had many ſharpe encounters, both with the
king of <hi>Granada</hi> &amp; others of his captaines,
wherin he had alwayes the better. He made
many roades into the Country, where he wan
by fine force the towne of <hi>Huelma,</hi> &amp; draue
the <hi>Moores</hi> to ſuch a ſtreigt, that hee
<pb facs="tcp:9300:6"/>
he woulde haue wonne a number of townes
more, &amp; haue done diuerſe worthie exploites
had not the king (being by matters of more
importance at home enforced) commaunded
him to make an ende of the warres, and to
conclude a peece vpon the receyt of which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
he bare ſuch a hand vpon them as he
brought them in ſubiection, and cauſed them
to pay for yearely tribute a great quantitie of
golde, ſuch as neither the king did euer looke
to receyue, nor the Sarazens did euer thinke
to haue payed. And beſide this yearely tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
he compelled them to ſet at libertie all
ſuch Chriſtian priſoners as remained in their
cuſtodie, all which this good Marques re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
out of captiuitie, and brought them
home to their Countrey. He gouerned with
great wiſedome all ſuch ſouldiours as were
vnder his regiment, behauing himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them both as a captaine and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
being neither inſolent in authoritie, nor
baſe minded in his familiaritie. For he was
alwayes in heart of ſuch humilitie and
mildneſſe, as made him to be beloued of God,
and outwardly of ſuch grauitie and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
as cauſed him to be reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced of men.
He bountifully beſtowed vpon his ſouldiers,
<pb facs="tcp:9300:6"/>
what ſo euer belonged vnto him in right of
his generallſhip of al ſuch ſpoyles and booties
as were taken, beſides that which he gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in their neceſſities out of his owne purſe: and
to ſuch as ſhewed themſelues thankefull for
his bountie, he vſed to ſay, that if we wiſh wel
to him that doth well vnto vs, wee ought to
giue well to him that wiſheth well vnto vs.
and thus maintayning his credite by the
meanes of his great liberality, he was of all
his ſouldiours greatly beloued, who fearing to
offend him dyd alwayes obſerue a perfect diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
in the fielde. His rare and ſingular
vertues beeing knowen to the king, and how
woorthy he was of honor &amp; dignity, he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
aduaunced him to the Marqueſhip of
<hi>Santilliana</hi> &amp; created, him Erle of the <hi>Real</hi>
of <hi>Mancenares,</hi> addorning him with great
lands &amp; reuenues. Sometimes he committed
vnto him the charge of his owne perſon, and
many times the gouernment of al his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Who had ſuch a ſpecial grace in his gouer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning,
as the Poets of that age accounted him
for his noble behauiour in court, an other <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo:</hi>
&amp; for his great valour in the field a 2
<hi>Hanibal.</hi> He was a great obſeruer of al ſuch
things as belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged to perfit ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hood, &amp; ſo great
<pb facs="tcp:9300:7"/>
a reprehender of cowardiſe and faintneſſe of
heart, that ſeeing on a time a Gentleman to
weepe, for the great miſhappes that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
vnto him, breaking foorth into ſome
choler, he ſayd vnto him: Oh what a ſhame
is it to ſee a Gentleman to ſhedde teares for
anie thing, howe grieuous ſoeuer it be, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
onely for his offences towardes GOD?
He was a man of a great minde, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe
of minde was an ornament &amp; beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to all other his vertues. A couetous
worldling comming vnto him, and telling
him that hee let his landes farre vnder the
value, and promiſing to make him a much
greater reuenew, as one not willing to giue
eare to any ſuch matter, hee made him this
aunſwere: My friend I doe not vnderſtand
thy language, goe ſpeake it, I pray thee, to

He vſed alwayes to ſay to thoſe that ſought
to liue in pleaſure and delight, that much
more delightfull ought to bee vnto vs a
vertuous trauaile, then a life without
vertue, howe pleaſaunt ſoeuer it ſeeme. He
was of ſuch a pitifull minde, that whoſoeuer
came to him in his extremitie, being either
perſecuted, or any wayes troubled, ſhoulde
<pb facs="tcp:9300:7"/>
finde reliefe and defence in his houſe, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
any daunger that might happen him
for ſo dooing. Hee did euermore meaſure
bothe the partyes, and the cauſe according
as in deede they were, and not as they were
ſuppoſed to bee: and in this thing hee had a
moſte ſingular and almoſte heauenly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
for he was neuer knowen to make any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of perſons, nor to regarde the riches,
the wealth, or mightineſſe of any man, but to
regarde euery man according to the equitie
of his cauſethe wrote in verſe the Prouerbs
that begin, <hi>My Sonne whom I doe deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
loue. &amp;c.</hi> In which Prouerbes are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
almoſt all the precepts of Morall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
whatſoeuer appertaineth to a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
life. He had a very great Library, and
gaue himſelfe chiefly to the ſtudy of Moral
Philoſophy, Hiſtories, and Antiquities, hee
kept alwaies about him Doctours and men
of great learning, with whom he vſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
of ſuch thinges as he read. Hee wrote
beſides diuerſe other treatiſes, aſwel in verſe
as proſe, tending all to the aduauncing of
vertue, and aboliſhing of vice, &amp; in ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
he ſpent the moſt parte of his leaſure.
He was of great fame &amp; renowme in many
<pb facs="tcp:9300:8"/>
other Countryes beſide Spaine, but alwayes
made more account of the eſtimation of a
fewe wiſemen, rather then the praiſe of the
multitude, nd becauſe that for the moſte
parte wee ſee that the conditions of men are
anſwearable to their complexions and that
they are moſt times euill dyſoſed that are
euyll complexioned, wee neede not to
doubt but that this Gentleman was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in fauour with GOD, who gaue him
ſo good a teacher as hee was of ability to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
euery kinde of vertue, and to reſiſt
without any greate paine, euery euill moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſinne. I will not deny but that hee was
touched with ſuch temptations, as our fraile
fleſh doth many times aſſail the ſpirit withal,
and that he was ſundry times ouertaken, as
well with anger as with the delight of
the fleſh, and that he did ſometimes offend
aſwel in doing more then was mete, as in fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to do that which he ought to haue done,
For being as he was continually co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſant in
the warres &amp; dayly employed in ſundry ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
matters. It ſhould haue beene a matter
of greate difficultie liuing among ſuche a
number of errours, to carry him ſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:9300:8"/>
cleane without any errour. But if it be true,
that vertues doe make a mery hearte, as
on the other ſide vices breede heauineſſe and
ſorrowe, ſeeing that this gentleman was the
moſt parte of his time diſpoſed to pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
it is a greate deale more likely that
he was rather accompanyed with vertues
that bring forth pleaſure, then ſubdued with
vices, that continually doe vexe men with
griefe. And notwithſtanding that he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
many miſfortunes in the warres, and
that hee ſuſtained diuers griefes, as well for
the death of his Children, as of others
his neere kinſemen, yet he did alwayes beare
them with ſuch a noble minde, as he ſerued
for an example to all others how to behaue
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in the like caſes. He ended his life
with great honour &amp; proſperitie, at the age of
lxv. yeers. And if it may be thought that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
may after their departure haue any felicitie
in this world (as ſome ſuppoſe they may) we
may aſſuredly thinke that this gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had
it: for he left behinde him vi. ſonnes, wherof
the eldeſt increaſed his inheritance with the

as <hi>Tullie</hi> in his booke
<hi>de Oratore</hi> teacheth,
ought principally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in
whatſoeuer matter he
dealeth, to conſider
three things: That is,
to make all thoſe that ſhall eyther heare
his ſpeach, or reade his workes, to be well
willing, vnderſtanding, and mindefull.
The ſpeaker ſhall make his audience well
willing, when he laboureth to obteyne their
<pb facs="tcp:9300:10"/>
fauour and good wil towardes him. For no
man wil gladly geue eare to ſuch a man, as
he is afore euil perſwaded of: he maketh
his hearers to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, when he declareth
the matter, that hee meaneth to entreate off,
in ſhewing that it ſhal be profitable &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious,
he cauſeth them to be attentiue, or
mindeful, when he mooueth or ſtirreth them
vp by good meanes &amp; inductions to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to heare, not hauing their minds caried
away with anie other matters. All theſe
points hath this learned gentleman (folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this inſcription) obſerued in al his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
But eſpecially in this firſt Prouerbe
he hath obſerued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt, in making him that
ſhal reade him, wel minded towardes him,
procuring his fauour &amp; goodwil, in calling
him by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne &amp; beloued. For as
the Ciuil law ſayth, we can name no man by
a more ſweet or better name, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to call him
our ſonne. He maketh him to vnderſtand, in
ſhewing him howe to direct or order his life
amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the people: he maketh him atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiue,
in theſe wordes, where he ſaith, <hi>Geue eare.</hi>
And the meaning and matter of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe,
is the moſt ſweet &amp; gracious behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
that men of all degrees ought to vſe in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:9300:10"/>
their conuerſation. And if ſo be, that men of
gret eſtate &amp; calling, ought to vſe this ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle
behauiour, much more ought they that are
of meane degree to do it. And therfore <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
in the ſpeach that he hath with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Nero</hi> (as he bringeth in, in his 9.
Tragedie) when the Emperour did ſtriue
to gouerne rather by feare then by loue, and
commaunded ſundrie things to be done by
force and diſorder, to the ende the people
ſhould feare him: becauſe <hi>Seneca</hi> did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
greately blame him, the Emperour
tolde him, that whatſoeuer he did, he ought
by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for to do, for the ſword was it that
defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the Prince. <hi>Seneca</hi> anſweared, that
the faith and true allegiance of his ſubiects
would better defend him.<note place="margin">The prince that is feared, is neuer beloued</note> The Emperour
replied, That it is good that the Prince bee
feared. <hi>Seneca</hi> anſweareth: it is better that
he be beloued. The naked ſword (ſaith <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro)</hi>
ſhal make them doe what I wil haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Beware, ſaieth <hi>Seneca,</hi> you neuer fall into
ſuche an errour. The Emperour anſwereth,
I wil force the people to feare mee. Surely
ſaith <hi>Seneca,</hi> that which you force and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
the people to doe, they will verie hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuffer. And therefore it is not meete
<pb facs="tcp:9300:11"/>
that anie perſon (as is ſayde) eſpecially
ſuche gouernours as are vertuous and
iuſt, ſhould vrge or force any thing agaynſt
the good will of the people, much leſſe that
priuat perſons ſhould in their conuerſation
one with an other doe it. For (as <hi>Seneca</hi> in
his thirde Epiſtle ſayeth, whereas hee
ſheweth the deliberation that a man ought
to haue in the getting and keeping of his
friende) If thou wilt be beloued, loue, or
as the Prouerbe ſayeth, <hi>By loue thou
ſhalt doe, that hated thou ſhalt neuer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
vnto.</hi> For there is nothing in the
world that is ſought w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> loue, either by the
prince of his ſubiecte, the Lorde of his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
or the friend of his familiar, but it is
eaſily obteined. For as <hi>Virgill</hi> ſaith in his
<hi>Bucolikes. Loue ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth al thinges,</hi>
inſomuch is for the great loue that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
bare vnto mankinde, <hi>hee ſent his
only begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſonne, to take our fleſh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
him, and to die for vs, that he might
beare our faults and infirmities</hi> (as <hi>Eſai</hi>
ſaith,) <hi>and ſuffer for our offences.</hi> And
therefore if loue coulde cauſe God to abaſe
himſelfe to be conuerſant with man, and to
doe that, which might chiefly auayle vs,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9300:11"/>
being euerlaſting and moſt perfect, and we
mortall, and imperfecte: what ſhall it not
doe in the companie and conuerſation of
one man with an other? Whereuppon
<hi>Valerius</hi> in his thirde booke in the title of
<hi>Loue and delight,</hi> writeth that <hi>Damon</hi> and
<hi>Pithias,</hi> two of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his ſchollers,
bare ſo great loue and affection one to the
other, as when <hi>Dioniſius</hi> of <hi>Sarragos</hi>
would haue put one of them to death, he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
that there was no remedie but needes
he muſt dye, required that hee might haue
libertie to goe home to diſpoſe &amp; ſet in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſuche thinges as hee had, promiſing to
put in ſureties for his returne, at what day
ſoeuer he woulde appoint him. <hi>Dioniſius</hi>
ſuppoſing that none ſo faithfull a frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d could
be found, that in ſuch a caſe woulde become
ſuretie, to the hazard of his life, and all that
he had, aunſweared, that he was content to
giue him leaue &amp; time to goe to his houſe, ſo
that he put in ſuch ſuretie as hee promiſed:
whereuppon he left him for ſuretie his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
friende. And as the laſt day was now
come, wherein the condemned perſon was
bound to returne, &amp; to ſuffer his determined
death, all thoſe that were preſent did count
<pb facs="tcp:9300:12"/>
a great follie in him that woulde in ſuche a
caſe become ſuretie, &amp; hazard his life for an
other, how great ſoeuer the friendſhip was
betwixt them. But the partie that was
ſuretie did no whitte diſtruſt the fidelitie of
his friende, nor repent him any whitte of
his ſuretyſhippe. Nowe as they were all
gaping and gaſing to ſee the ende of the
matter, at the laſt day, and euen in the laſt
houre, commeth the condemned man, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
<hi>Dioniſius</hi> was greatly aſtoniſhed, and
for the great faithfulnes &amp; loue, that he ſaw
betweene them, pardoned the partie that
he had condemned, and deſired them both,
that they woulde vouchſafe him for a third
into their friendſhip. Wherby it is euident,
that loue is of ſo greate a force, that it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
ſuch men as be true friends, to venter &amp;
giue their liues the one for the other. So
that very well ſaith the Prouerbe: <hi>Loue,
and thou ſhalte beloued bee.</hi> For <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>
in his thirde Epiſtle affirmeth,
that nothing doeth more trouble a man
in his proſperitie and wealth, then to
thinke that they can neuer bee to him good
and faithfull friendes, to whom he himſelfe
hath neuer been good. Howe manie
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9300:12"/>
kindes of Friendſhippes there bee, and
howe ſome bee friendes for Commoditie
ſake, others for pleaſure and delight, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for vertue and honeſtie, howe ſome
bee ſworne friendes, and what difference
there is betweene Loue and Friendſhip,
becauſe I will make no long proceſſe, I
leaue here to ſpeake of. Of all which both

                  <p>IN this prouerbe the Marques his minde
is, to prooue by natural reaſon, that which
he hath written in the former prouerbe, that
is, that men ought to be ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle and eurteous
in their conuerſations, and that they ought
not to doe anie thing by force or feare, but
rather by loue and gentlenes. He alſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
down the inconuenience that foloweth
to him that had rather be feared then loued,
ſaying: <hi>Who can aſſoyle the man that is
dread from care and deadly feare, &amp;c.</hi>
For if he that feareth, haue not altogether
loſt his diſcretion and vnderſtanding, he wil
not feare him that he feareth: For he may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
vnderſtand, that he, that liueth in dread,
will ſeeke by all the meanes to be deliuered
of him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he feareth. For feare (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
ſaith in the 3. booke of his <hi>Ethiks)</hi> is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
looking for the harme that ſhal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.
According to which, ſuch as feare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
do continually looke to receiue harme
at the handes of thoſe whom they feare, or
to eſcape the euill that they looke for. They
imagine how they may preuent, in doing of
euill, them of whom they thinke to receiue
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9300:13"/>
euill: And therefore in the ſpeache that
<hi>Thyeſtes</hi> the Sonne of King <hi>Pelops</hi> hath
with his ſonne <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> where his ſonne
requireth him to forſake the place of his
baniſhment, and to come and gouerne and
liue together with his brother <hi>Araeus</hi> (as
<hi>Seneca</hi> ſheweth in his ſeconde Tragidie)
where <hi>Thyeſtes</hi> doth ſhew the reaſons, that
moueth him rather to liue in a poore eſtate,
then to be a man of greate place &amp; authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ſaying, While I liued in princely ſtate
and maieſtie, I was neuer free from fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of thoſe that feared me, yea and many
times I was afraide of the very ſword that
hung by mine owne ſide, leaſt in the ende I
ſhould come to be ſlayne with it. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,
Oh what a great happines is it, not
to be feared of anie, to ſleepe ſoundly vpon
the grounde, and to eate in ſafety the meate
that is prouided. Poiſon is preſented in
golden cuppes: meaning, that it is not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to the poore labourer that drinketh in
earth or wood, but to great eſtates, that
drinke in golde geuen by thoſe that feare
them, and by ſuch as they haue good cauſe
to feare. And therefore <hi>Tullie</hi> ſaieth, in his
booke of Friendſhip, that in the life of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes,
<pb facs="tcp:9300:14"/>
which be ſuch as gouerne by force
and feare, more then by loue, there can be
neither faith, loue, nor ſtedfaſt friendſhippe.
To the Tyrant all thinges are ſuſpicious,
and euerie thing miniſtreth, vnto him occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſorrowe and care. And it followeth:
Who can loue him whom he feareth, or him
of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he knoweth he is feared? With this
agreeth that, which <hi>Boetius</hi> in his third
booke of <hi>Comfort</hi> writeth, that ſuch as are
guarded with men of warre, ſtand in dread
of thoſe, whom they ſeeme to make affraide.
And therfore wel ſayth the Prouerbe, <hi>That
feare is a deadly griefe vnto the ſenſe.</hi>
Which is verified as well in the perſon
that feareth, as in him that is feared. It
is written of <hi>Dioniſius,</hi> as <hi>Boetius</hi> in his
3. booke of <hi>Comforte</hi> witneſſeth, that hee
was a great Tyrant, and ſuch a one as by ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
and crueltie ſubdued many countries,
and did manie harmes and miſchiefes, who
as he ſought to gouerne by tyrannie and
force, it is moſt like hee was rather feared
then beloued. It is written, that a ſpecial
friende of his comming to ſee him, told him,
that he had great cauſe to thinke him ſelfe
happie, in that he had atteyned to ſo greate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9300:14"/>
and ſo hygh eſtate as hee was in: <hi>Dioniſius</hi>
made no anſwere at all, but bad him to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
where ouer the chaire where his gheſt
ſhould ſit, he cauſed to be hanged, by a verie
ſmal thred, a weightie and a ſharp pointed
ſword, in ſuch ſort as his friend being ſet, the
ſword hung directly ouer the crowne of his
head, ſo as if the thred brake, it was ſure to
run thorow him, &amp; thus cauſed him to ſitte
down to dinner: who al the while that he ſat,
ſweat for feare, leaſt the thread breaking, the
ſword ſhould fal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him &amp; deſtroy him. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oniſius</hi>
cauſed him with ſundrie diſhes to
be deintily and delicately ſerued: the borde
being taken vp, he aſked his gheſt if hee
had not pleaſantly dined? Who anſweared
him: what pleaſure coulde I haue at my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meate,
ſeeing the ſwoorde by ſo ſmall a ſtay
hanging ouer my head, and ſtill looking
for the loſſe of my life, whenſoeuer the thred
ſhould breake? Loe ſaith <hi>Dioniſius,</hi> ſuch
is the life of all tyrantes, who for the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes
and tyrannies that they have doon,
and for feare of thoſe whom they haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended

the Citizens, that they coulde by no

conſpired to kill him, which treaſon of

                  <head>The Paraphraſe of the doctour.</head>
                  <p>IN this Prouerbe the Marques proueth
by familiar example, that which hee hath
ſhewed in the Prouerbe before by naturall
reaſon. For as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith in the ſecond
of his <hi>Rhethorikes:</hi> In the workes and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of men, that which commeth after,
doeth commonly reſemble that, which hath
been done before, &amp; therfore it is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
vſe with writers, when they woulde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
or haue their doinges well thought
of, to bring in examples of thinges that
in the like caſe haue happened. And for the
ſame cauſe the Marques hath in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe
made mention of that which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> whoſe doinges are
largely ſet out by <hi>Lucan,</hi> in his booke that
hee wrote of the ciuill warres. This <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Caeſar</hi> by force and tyrannie ſought
to aſpire (which nothing appertained vnto
him) to the gouernement of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
ſubdued and ouercame both <hi>Pompey,</hi> and
all his fauourers, who fought for the lawes
and liberties of their countrie. In the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
whereof <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſlue manie, diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited
a great ſorte, and iniuried a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9300:16"/>
And for the mainteining of this his
tyrannicall iuriſdiction, hee was forced to
make himſelfe to be feared, to the intent hee
might keepe them from rebelling. But for
al that euer he could doe, two gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of Rome, whoſe names were <hi>Brutus</hi>
and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> conſpired againſt him, and
in the Parliament houſe where he miſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
no ſuch thing, ſette vpon him, and ſiue
him, giuing him, as it is written, foure
and twentie woundes, whereof he preſently
died: and therefore the Prouerbe ſayeth.
<hi>Great Caeſar as the ſtories tell:</hi> and ſo ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>Lucan, moſt cruelly was ſlayne.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
hee was a mightie Prince, and
had a ſtrong and a puyſant garde: yet at
the time that <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
murdered him, they found him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
anie of his friendes or ſeruantes all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
It followeth. <hi>Who on the earth
ſo mightie is, that when hee is alone,
can of him ſelfe doe anie more, then
can a ſeelie one?</hi> That is to ſay, though a
man be neuer ſo mightie, yea, though he be
a king of many landes and countries, yet
is he but a man, and for his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
can doe no more then a man maie
<pb facs="tcp:9300:17"/>
doe. And although we reade in the ſecond
booke of the Kinges, that the perſon of a
King in an armie, is of more value then a
thouſand ſouldiers: and that the death of
a Prince or a Captaine, is more hurtfull to
an armie, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of a thouſand others,
becauſe of the worthineſſe of the Prince or
Captaine: yet, as S. <hi>Hierom</hi> in one of his
Epiſtles affirmeth, though in the ordering
of a battaile, the worthineſſe of a Prince or
a Captaine is chiefly conſidered, when
it comes to the fight, not the degree, but
the dooinges of euerie partie, is reſpected:
for when it commeth to the ſhout, the force
and proweſſe of euerie one is his ſafegarde,
be he King or Emperour: If he fight not
as he ought to doe, he is of none account.
And though he be neuer ſo valiant, being
but one man, he can, as the Prouerb is, do
no more then an other man.</p>

                  <p>FOr the proofe and confirmation of that
which goeth before, the Marques affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
that he hath ſeene in his time great
numbers aduaunced and ſet vp by loue, and
manie ouerthrowne and tumbled downe,
that haue ſought to rule by feare, which
proofe in hauing had the experience, is the
trueſt and certaineſt that may be. For eaſier
ſhall we be deceiued by olde recordes, or
ſooner erre in truſting our owne naturall
reaſon, then faile in knowledge of the truth,
in a thing that we haue had experience of.
And therefore is it commonly ſayd, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
is the mother and miſtreſſe of all
things: and as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the firſt of his
<hi>Phiſickes</hi> ſayeth, If any that be wiſe doe
erre, touching their opinions in learning,
they may well be called backe againe, and
brought to the knowledge of the truth, by
natural reaſon and perſwaſion. But he that
<pb facs="tcp:9300:18"/>
denieth that which he ſeeth with his eyes,
heareth with his eares, and knoweth by
the triall of his other ſenſes, with ſuche a
one we ought not to diſpute: For he that
denieth his ſenſes, is altogeather without
ſenſe. And therfore the proofe that is made
by experience, is moſt ſtrong and aſſured.
The Marques ſaieth, that in his time he
hath ſeene many aduaunced by loue. Loue
bringeth with it, vnitie, Peace, &amp; concorde:
where feare alwaies cauſeth hatred, as is
witneſſed afore by the teſtimonie of <hi>Tullie,</hi>
in his booke of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> howe great the
force of friendſhippe and concorde is, may
eaſily be knowne, by the harmes that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe

our Sauiour in the Goſpel expreſly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
where he ſaith, <hi>That euery kingdome

and come to nothing:</hi> &amp; ſuche as liue in

And <hi>Saluſt</hi> in the conſpiracie of <hi>Cateline</hi>
ſaith, <hi>that by loue and concord the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
thinges that be, encreaſe, and growe
to be great,</hi> where by diſcorde, great and
mightie thinges decay, &amp; come to nothing.
For <hi>vertuous minds in bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage brought,
will ſlacke no time to trie by al the force
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:9300:18"/>
and meanes they can, to come to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi>
It is lawful for euery man by the lawe
of nature to defend his life, his goodes and
his good name, by al the meanes &amp; waies
that he may: Inſomuch as if any man will
kill me, it is lawful for me for the ſafegard
of my lyfe, to kill the partie, that doth ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
me, neither ought I to forbeare (as
the lawiers ſaie) till I be ſtricken or hurt,
for it is yenough for me the feare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am in
to be murthered, and that yf I kill him not,
I am ſure to be ſlaine my ſelfe. In ſo much
that it hath been the opinion of ſome Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.
That if I ſtande in feare of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
man then my ſelfe: and knowe that
wherſoeuer he meete mee, he will kill me,
and am not able to ſtand vppon my guard,
nor to bande with him, in this caſe I am
not bounde to forbeare, but may kill him,
at the beſt aduantage that I can take him.
The lyke opinion is of ſome Doctors that
yf I be wrongfully deteyned in priſon,
and ſtande in feare of ſome violence
or vniuſtice, that in this caſe I may
lawefully breake priſon, and if a
iudge ſhall wrongfullie condemne me,
<pb facs="tcp:9300:19"/>
whereby I ſhall greatly bee damnified in
my perſon, and that the execution be out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me, it ſhall be lawfull for me to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
my friendes and my kinſmen, and
to reſiſt the officer, vſing all the meanes
I maye to ſaue my bodie and my goodes:
yea, I may hurt the other in the defence of
my goodes, and the ſauing of my credite.
For as the Doctours ſaye, if I remaine
in anie place, and knowe that mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
is comming to doe me ſome miſchiefe,
and that it ſhall bee greatly hurtfull and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
my credite, to go from the place, that
I neede not to depart, but maye well ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
there: and if the other aſſault mee, if
I kill him, I am not to bee puniſhed. And
the reaſon is, that for the greate feare
that I am in, it is lawfull for mee to ſaue
my ſelfe, and my credite, as well as I
may. And this is it, that the Prouerbe
meaneth, <hi>that vertuous mindes in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage

Vertuous or good men: becauſe the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
is not ſo great that is done to a raſkall,
or a lewde perſon, as that which is done to
a vertuous or a godly man. And though
ſuch a man of a vertuous minde, will

vniuſtly wronged, and euill dealt withall,

cloſe to the wall of a towne, that he ment to
beſiege: and as the poore men, beeing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerladen,
went rayling and curſſing of the
King, becauſe hee had made them to take
ſuch an vnreaſonable iournie, and after had
cauſed them to marche with ſo extreame
burdens, not ſuffering them any whitte to
reſt: the King perceiuing it, chaunged
<pb facs="tcp:9300:22"/>
his apparell, and keepeing company with
thoſe that were ſcarſe laden, and thoſe that

in bearing part of your burdens, this

anſwering him gently again, and ſmiling,
ſaide vnto him: my countrey is a ſhame to

all the vertues and vices that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
doeth entreate of in the fourth Booke of
<pb facs="tcp:9300:23"/>
his <hi>Ethycks,</hi> he ſpeaketh of the vertue of
Magnanimitie, whiche is for a man to
ſtand vpon his honour that he knoweth, for
his vertues and qualities he deſerueth, and
to keepe his eſtimation, in ſuch ſorte as it
decay not: and to this ende ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>My honor and my glory will I giue
to no other.</hi> This vertue hath two extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and vices, the one is, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
ſaith, for a man to be vaineglorious, proude
and diſdainfull: which is, when hee taketh
vpon him, more then of right to him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth.
In the other extremitie and vice,
are thought to offend all ſuch, as by reaſon
of their baſe minde are nothing accounted
of, nor eſteemed: and if they happen to
come to any honor or preferment, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
them ſelues like ſheepe or mecockes.
Of this vertue and the vices, the <hi>Marques</hi>
ſpeaketh in the Prouerbe where hee ſaith,
<hi>Let not vnwoorthy honors pleaſe thee.</hi>
For, thoſe that are therewith all delighted,
are vaunters, vainglorious, and fooliſh, as
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, where he ſheweth the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces
that follow to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that make more
of them ſelues, then there is cauſe why, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that ſuch honor commeth quickly to the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:9300:23"/>
ground. So that the man that taketh more
vppon him then hee may, is of others by
great good reaſon ſoone put from it. Of
theſe proude and vaine vaunters ſpeaketh
Iob. <hi>The vaine man exalteth him ſelfe in
his pride, and thinketh that he is borne
free from ſubiection, as the Colte of a
wilde Aſſe.</hi> And before hee ſaith, <hi>I would
not haue thee ſo to throwe downe thy
ſelf, as to be counted an outcaſt.</hi> For this
is not humilitie, but baſeneſſe and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of minde, and this is it that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
prooueth in the authoritie aforeſaide. And
the Apoſtle ſaieth, that foraſmuch as hee
was ordained the Apoſtle of the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Humilitie ſpringeth of Nobilitie.</note>
hee would honor and eſteeme his dignitie
and office, and yet for all that he left not to
be humble and meeke: for humilitie ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not of baſeneſſe and feebleneſſe of mind,
but of vertue and nobleneſſe of nature. And
that which the <hi>Marques</hi> doeth heere diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe,
is onely the baſeneſſe and vileneſſe of
the minde, in what ſort the conuerſation of
men ought to be. <hi>Iſocrates</hi> in his Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
writeth in this ſort, <hi>Be not hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
nor diſdainefull to thoſe that bee in
thy company, for euen the very ſeruants</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:9300:24"/>
will hardly away with their maiſters that
are proude and diſdainful. The modeſt and
temperate behauiour, is that which al men
delight in, &amp; that is neither to be to hautie
nor to baſe, to hie minded nor to abiect.</p>

the eare to be temperate in hearing, for
ſuch as are wiſe and vertuous ought not to
giue eare to euery worde that they heare,
but only to ſuche as are good and honeſt.
For as <hi>Salomon</hi> in his Prouerbe ſaith,
<hi>The Prince that is contented to heare
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:9300:24"/>

<pb facs="tcp:9300:25"/>
hauing great enuy, and ſeeking to ſet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde

ſince you ſweare that my freend hath

it was ſomething, that hee thought ſhould

was cleane out of countenance, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
that the partie, whom he would haue

greately againſt them, but eſpecially
againſt <hi>Mardocheus,</hi> ſo as hee appointed

of an hundred and xxvii. Prouinces, who
toke to wife <hi>Heſter,</hi> a Iewiſh woman, and

authors of new ſects and Ceremonyes, and

which was a thing not before

<pb facs="tcp:9300:28"/>
humble requeſt to the King, that hee might
haue licence and authoritie from him, to
deſtroy them, promiſing thereby, to bring
to the Kings cofers, an infinite maſſe of
treaſure. The King anſweared him, that he
freely gaue him the treaſure that he ſpake
off, and for the people, hee bad him doe with
them what he thought good, and gaue him
his ring from his finger, that he might ſend
out letters, for the execution of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.
Whervpon <hi>Haman</hi> in great

Notwithſtanding, at the earneſt requeſt of
<hi>Mardocheus,</hi> after that ſhe &amp; al the Iewes

What haue you to ſay to mee? Demaunde

to come to a Banquet that ſhe had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

been farre more tollerable, and with my
ſorrowe I ſhoulde haue ſatiſfied my ſelfe.
<pb facs="tcp:9300:29"/>
when the King had hearde her, hee was
greately diſquieted, and aſked who it was
that durſt preſume to attempte ſo great a
matter, and what authoritie he had. The
Queene aunſwered this great enemye. Of
me and my nation, is this <hi>Haman</hi> that is
heere preſent. Which when <hi>Haman</hi> heard,
he was ſuddainely nipped in the head, and
as the King flang foorth in a fury, towards
the garden, <hi>Haman</hi> came to the bed where
the Queene ſat, to beſeech her to haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
vpon him, becauſe he perceiued that the
King was determined that hee ſhould dye.
The King returning from the Garden, and
finding <hi>Haman</hi> vppon the bed, where the
Queene ſat, ſuppoſing that he had been too
familiar with her, began to conceaue a
great hatred againſt him, and then ſome
that were aboute him, tolde him that <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
had made a paire of Gallowes for

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9300:30"/>
is brought, is to ſay, that he was not willed
to appeare. And therefore when <hi>Adam</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
and God was to condemne him for
his diſobedience, and contempt: the Text
ſayeth, that the Lord called and ſommoned
him to anſwere (if any anſwere hee coulde
make) for himſelfe, when he ſayde, <hi>Adam,
where art thou?</hi> For the Lorde knew well
enough, in what place he was, but becauſe
he ſhould not ſay, that God had proceded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, without hearing him, or calling
him, being abſent, &amp; not contemptuous, he
both called for him, &amp; heard what he coulde
ſay, and finding his anſwere not ſufficient,
condemned him, although he ſought to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
his fault as much as he could, when he
ſaid, <hi>The woman, that thou gaueſt me,
gaue me the apple that I ate.</hi> Vpon this
ground alſo ſtood <hi>Medea, (as</hi> Seneca <hi>in his</hi>
vii. Tragedie ſheweth) in the ſpeach that
ſhe had with king <hi>Creon,</hi> the father in law
of <hi>Iaſon,</hi> that would haue baniſhed her his
realme: when ſhe aſked, for what cauſe and
fault ſhe ſhould be baniſhed? And that they
ought not to proceede againſt her, without
hearing her cauſe, affirming that ſhee
was readie to proue her innocencie, and to
<pb facs="tcp:9300:31"/>
purge hereſelfe of any crime, that coulde be
layde againſt her. And becauſe <hi>Creon</hi> ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
at her, ſayde: The poore innocent
woman requireth to knowe the cauſe of her
baniſhment, meaning that ſhe was ſo lewde
and ſo wicked, that her lewdneſſe, and her
naughtineſſe beeing ſo openly knowne, it
was not needefull to arraigne her, becauſe
ſhe was knowne to all men to bee guiltie.
She anſwered:<note place="margin">A notable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere of a woman.</note> If thou, being a King, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
vpon thee to be a Iudge, thou oughteſt
to heare me: If thou take vpon thee to be
a tyrant, and an vniuſt man, thou mayeſt at
thy pleaſure take my life from mee. And
when the King would by no meanes be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated,
but that ſhe muſt depart his realme,
ſhe made this notable concluſion: that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
he be, that commaundeth any thing
without hearing of the partie, though the
thing be iuſt that he commaundeth, yet he
himſelf is vniuſt in the commaunding of it.
And the reaſon of this notable ſaying of
<hi>Medea,</hi> is that which is before ſayde, That
according to the lawes both of God, of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and of man, no Iudge ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
againſt any man, without hearing the
partie: and the Prouerbe ſayeth, <hi>You muſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:9300:31"/>
heare the partie, and giue no iudgement,
till you haue well weyed the matter.</hi> For
there muſt information be had, and proofe,
whether it be trueth, that the contrarie part
alledgeth, and the proofe and the witneſſe
well examined by good foreſight and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe:
and this is it that of right ought to be
done in a caſe of iudgement, and one of the
greateſt defeatings, or auoydings, as the
Lawyers ſay, of any proces, is, if iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
haue been prooued or done without delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
And therefore the Prouerbe ſayth,
<hi>See that you take good deliberation in
iudgement.</hi>

                  <p>THe Marques in this Proueth conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
two things. The firſt is, the effect
<pb facs="tcp:9300:32"/>
that followeth, when a thing is done with
good deliberation, and brought to paſſe by
good aduiſe and counſaile: the ſeconde is,
whoſe aduiſe and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſaile in our doings we
ought to follow. Touching the firſt, <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
in his <hi>Prouerbes</hi> ſaith, <hi>The determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of a man neuer come to good,
where counſaile is not afore had. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes
that are executed by good aduiſe,
are alwayes perfect &amp; good.</hi> And <hi>Seneca</hi>
ſaith, <hi>Do al thy things by good aduiſe, &amp;
thou ſhalt neuer repent them.</hi> For a man
not taking cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſaile nor aduiſe in that which
he intendeth, it is not poſſible for him, that
he ſhould foreſee the errours that he ſhal fal
in. And falling therein, for want of good
foreſight &amp; counſaile, it muſt needes be, that
he muſt repent himſelfe, and ſay, I had not
thought ſo great a miſchiefe woulde haue
folowed. And as <hi>Valerius</hi> writeth, that
<hi>Scipio</hi> of <hi>Affrica</hi> was wont to ſay. <hi>It was
an euill fauoured, &amp; a ſhameful thing, for
a man in any matter (eſpecially in ſuch as
belong to a man of warre) to ſay, I would
not haue thought it.</hi> For ſuch things as
are to be done with the ſword, ought well to
be thought of before. For the errours that in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:9300:32"/>
warres are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, can neuer, as <hi>Scipio</hi>
ſaith, be amended. And as <hi>Vegetius in</hi> his
booke that he made <hi>Of the knowledge of the
Warres</hi> affirmeth, There is no other reaſon
to be yeelded why the <hi>Romanes</hi> did ſubdue
the whole worlde, &amp; conquered whereſoeuer
they came, but becauſe they did al that they
did by great deliberation &amp; aduiſe, being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ſkilfull &amp; well trained in ſuch things as
belonged to the warres. For what (ſaith he)
was a handful of poore <hi>Romanes</hi> to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
numbers of the <hi>Frenchmen?</hi> or what
could ſo ſle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der a power preuaile againſt the
great forces &amp; puiſſance of the <hi>Germanes?</hi>
Certaine it is, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Spaniards</hi> were more
in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, and of greater ſtrength &amp; force, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
were the <hi>Romanes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The ſkill of the ſouldier the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Rome.</note> They were alwayes
behind the <hi>Affricanes,</hi> both in wealth &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies.
And no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doubteth, but the <hi>Greeks</hi>
were farre beyond them in grauitie &amp; wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Yet alwayes did the ſouldier of <hi>Rome</hi>
preuaile, becauſe of his ſkill, being continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
trained &amp; daily exerciſed in the warres.
For there could nothing hap in any ſkirmiſh
or battel, wherew<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had not long time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
been acquainted. Certaine it is, as the
Prouerb ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that which is done by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation,
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not to craue amendment
<pb facs="tcp:9300:33"/>
at the ſecond hande, and that from this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile
and aduiſe, the olde ſtager ought neuer
to be ſhut out. For as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth in the
firſt of his <hi>Ethickes, <hi>The yong man by
reaſon of his ſmall experience, can haue
no great knowledge in anie matter, and
therfore not able to giue anie good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile.</hi>
                     </hi>
And beſide in his booke of <hi>Rethorike,
<hi>In mans affaires and actions, the thinges
that haue paſſed, be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly like to the
thinges that after happen: and as the
young man hath had no experience of
ſuch thinges as haue happened before, ſo
can hee neuer bee able to iudge of the
things that ſhall after fal out, &amp; therefore
the auncient me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are alwayes able to giue
better counſaile.</hi>
                     </hi> And therefore <hi>Roboam</hi>
the ſonne of <hi>Solomon,</hi> for taking the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe
of yong men, and refuſing the olde and
expert fellowes, did verire worthily forgoe
tenne partes of twelue, of his kingdome,
as ſhal hereafter be more at large declared.
And though young men are by reaſon of
ſtrength and luſtineſſe, more able and fitte
for the fight, than are the olde men: yet as
<hi>Tullie</hi> in his booke of <hi>Age</hi> ſaith, <hi>The great
and notable exploites are neuer done by
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9300:33"/>
force nor agilitie of body, but by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile,
aucthoritie, &amp; ſecreſie,</hi> And among
the principal cauſes that we reade, why
<hi>Alexander</hi> had alwaies the victory and the
better hand, it was the chiefe, that he went
alwaies accompanied with graue &amp; aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
counſellours. For as <hi>Trogus Pompei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
in his eleuenth booke writeth, <hi>That A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander
whenſoeuer he was in any iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of great daunger, he neuer called to
counſel, nor made priuie to his doinges
the young and luſty Gallantes, but the
olde expert ſouldiers, that had folowed
the warres with his father, and with his
vncle, whom he vſed not ſo muche for
ſouldiers, as for gouernours.</hi> And it is
ſaide that thoſe whom he put in his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes,
were commonly of the age of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
yeeres &amp; vpwarde, to the entent that
none of them ſhould thinke to run away,
but to ouercome, and truſting more to their
handes then their feete, ſhoulde ſet their
whole mindes vpon the victory. And when
diuers of his old ſouldiours deſired him,
that they might depart, to reſt and refreſhe
them ſelues, offering him their ſonnes, that
were young and luſtie to ſerue in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<pb facs="tcp:9300:34"/>
It is ſaide that he anſwered, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to haue about me the well experienced
grauitie of aged men, then the frowarde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and vnaduiſed raſhneſſe of young
men. And thus did <hi>Alexander</hi> attaine to
whatſoeuer he deſired, and was in all his
doinges, honourable and vertuous, becauſe
he neuer ſuffered, as the Prouerbe ſayeth,
<hi>The olde man to depart from his ſide.</hi>

and prooueth by good example and
greate experience of thinges before paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
That which before he declared, that
as long as the Romanes gaue credit to the
aduiſe and counſaile of their aged Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:9300:34"/>
ſo long they proſpered, and did
well: and when they once ceaſſed ſo to doe,
their honour preſently ceaſſed and came
to nought. They were gouerned in thoſe
dayes by a certaine companie of men
called <hi>Senators,</hi> which woorde and name
commeth of the Latine woorde <hi>Senex,</hi>
which ſignifieth aged. In what ſorte and by
what meanes the <hi>Romanes</hi> proſpered,
is plainely declared by <hi>Iudas Machabee,</hi>
in the firſt boke of the <hi>Machabees:</hi> where
he ſaith, The <hi>Romanes</hi> by their wiſedome
and ſober behauiour poſſeſſed the whole
worlde, and ouerthrewe the Princes that
rebelled againſt them, and made Tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<hi>Galacia,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſubdued and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame
the king of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi>
the king of <hi>Aſia,</hi> hauing in his
company a hundred and thirtie Elephants,
ſacked al their cities, and made Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
vnto them all their Dominions, and
brought into ſubiection al the countries
rounde about them, as wel farre as neare:
So that their very name was a terrour to
all that hearde of it. And the only cauſe of
this their proſperitie, was the great wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and foreſight, the which they had,
<pb facs="tcp:9300:35"/>
and the great loue that they bare to their
countrey, they were gouerned by three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and thirtie Senatours, which euery
yere elected one to haue the chiefe auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?
amongeſt them there was neither enuy
nor ielouſie, and therefore ſaith the booke,
<hi>Iudas</hi> the <hi>Machabee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Romanes prefer the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon profite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their own.</note> 
                     <hi>did enter frendſhip,
and make a perfect league with them.</hi>
For al their ſtudie &amp; care was to maintaine
their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth, not hauing any regard
of any priuate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie: For as <hi>Tullie</hi> ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<hi>Two things they ought to doe, that
wil profite their countrey. The firſt is,
that leauing apart al priuate commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
they beſtowe all that that they do vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. The ſecond, that
they be not forward in ſome one thing,
and backward in an other.</hi> And whileſt
the <hi>Romanes</hi> obſerued this order, their
common wealth increaſed ſtill greater and
greater, according to the ſaying of <hi>Cato,</hi>
whoſe wordes are witneſſed by <hi>Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi>
in the ſeuenth booke of the <hi>citie of
God,</hi> the .ix. Chap. <hi>Doe not think:</hi> (ſaith
<hi>Cato) that our forefathers brought the
common wealth of <hi>Rome</hi> from a ſmall
thing to be greate, only by the ſworde.</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:9300:35"/>
For if that were the matter, our company
at this time is greater, our ſouldiers more
in number, and our furniture a great deale
better. No, it was other matters that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced
our aunceſtours, whereof wee be
cleane without:<note place="margin">What made the Romanes to flooriſhe.</note> they being at home, were
alwaies careful for matters abrode, and
gouerned vprightly and iuſtly, their hartes
were alwaies free, and were continually
faithful counſellours, they were neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
with riot nor vices, but we by our
diſordred luſtes, haue brought our common
wealth to be poore, &amp; our ſelues to be riche.
The offices and rewardes that were to be
giuen, as recompenſes, and the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of vertue, are ſolde for money, or
geuen for fauour. Our anceſtours to enrich
the common wealth; dyd make themſelues

&amp; rich, which is a thing moſt monſtruous,

whereby we may knowe GOD, and what

how he hath giuen vs lawes and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes,
by the which we may ſerue and
obey him, &amp; that though a man haue of long
<pb facs="tcp:9300:38"/>

as the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> from the

therein ſee that all the race and poſteritie

<hi>Adam,</hi> are adiudged and condemned to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting

for the great loue that he bare to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
hath ſent his only begotten ſonne
Ieſus Chriſt, to take our fleſh vpon him, &amp;
to ſuffer moſt cruel death for our ſaluation:
And to pay, as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, <hi>The price of our

hath doone for vs. Beſide, the ſcripture tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs how we ought to loue God with al
our hart, with all our minde, &amp; with all

<hi>The dreame is forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quite that ſoone

to a ſleepe, which we ſhal leaue before

thou finde in theſe worldly delights? What
doeth thy glory profite thee? What doeth
thy pleaſures auaile thee? Theſe be not
they that can deliuer thee from death, nor
defend thee from the wormes: For he that
late was luſtie and glorious in his Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
lieth nowe dead and ſtinking in his
Sepulchre: he that late was tickled with
the delightes of the bed, lyeth nowe torne
a ſunder with the wormes in his graue
What meaneſt thou to be proude, being
but wormes meate and aſhes? Why moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt

                  <p>IN this Prouerbe the Marques ſheweth
that one of the principall cauſes of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and knowledge, is to feare God, as
<hi>Salomon</hi> in his prouerbes ſaith, <hi>The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of wiſdome, is the feare of God,

wiſedome is more woorth then the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
of the mightie, of greater value then
precious ſtones, &amp; more fine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pure gold.
For by wiſedome we are able to diſcerne
betwixt good and euill, betwixt vertue
<pb facs="tcp:9300:41"/>
and vice, to which ende leauing to ſpeake
of the doctrine and rules of the holy
Scripture, whereby we are taught to flee
from all ſinne and wickedneſſe and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
and followe vertuouſneſſe) <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
hath written three bookes: In the one of
them he entreateth of the rules and orders
that are requiſite for the guiding of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
and citie, which booke is called the
<hi>Politiques:</hi> In the other he ſheweth howe a
man ought to gouerne his houſe, his wife,
and his children, &amp; this booke is called the
<hi>Aeconomikes.</hi> The thirde, teacheth how a
man ſhoulde gouerne him ſelfe, wherein
there is a medlie of rules &amp; obſeruations,
by which a man may knowe the vertuous,
and diſcerne and ſeuere them from the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
And ſpecially in this booke he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that all maner of vertues are gotten
by vſe and cuſtome, and that a man
by vſing a long time to liue vertuouſly, it
commeth at length to bee naturall vnto
him, and although a man be naturally
enclined to vice, yet yf he accuſtome
him ſelfe to vertue, he ſhall leaue his
euill inclination and become vertuous.
And this is it that the Prouerbe ſayeth,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:9300:41"/>
                     <hi>Who ſo beginneth to liue well in his
youth, it is a ſigne that he ſhall not doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe
in his age.</hi> But it is not one vertuous
act alone, that can be called a beginning, as
<hi>Ariſtot.</hi> ſaith, no more then can one ſwallow
ſhew a ſpring. <hi>And the greateſt preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by which we may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture</hi> (as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>
in the ſecond of his <hi>Ethickes</hi> ſayeth)
<hi>whether a man ſhall proue vertuous or
no, is the pleaſure or the heauineſſe that
he taketh in his well doing.</hi> For if he be
ioyfull, &amp; take delight in the vertuous actes
that he doeth, it is a token that he wil proue
well in his age, and be verie vertuous. But
if he goe about them, with an euill will, and
ſeeme to take no delight therein, it is a
ſigne that his vertues will not long endure.

to offer ſacrifices to the Lord. And
that night the Lorde appeared to him in

ſayd. Thou haſt ſhewed vnto thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
<hi>Dauid</hi> my father great mercie, in

an vnderſtanding hart, to iugde thy

ſaid vnto him, Becauſe thou haſt aſked this

that although it be a goodly thing for a man
to be eloquent, and to haue a good tongue,
yet it is a great deale more worthie praiſe,
to be wiſe. Eloquence is a fine and ſweete

And if this eloquence be ioyned with wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

intreateth of, is the moſt principall vertue,
or rather, as he ſaith, the onely vertue, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that all the vertues are chained and

he muſt needes haue wiſedome thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he that hath wiſdome thorowly, hath all

may be counted wiſe, and a ſeruant obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

the hurtes &amp; inconueniences that follow to
ſuch as offende him according to the dayly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9300:45"/>
leſſons of the church. The ſoueraign power
of God is ſhewed, in caſting downe the
mightie out of their ſeate, which are thoſe
that heape to them ſelues his diſpleaſure,
and in exalting the humble and the meeke,
which are thoſe that feare him. For as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid

he ſayth, <hi>I haue not ſeene the iuſt forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,

And of thoſe that offende, and fall into his
diſpleaſure, he ſaith, <hi>I haue ſeene the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

And vpon this is the whole Scripture in a

promiſeth euerlaſting ioy, &amp; ſufficiencie of

was <hi>Achis,</hi> becauſe they ſhould not detaine

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:9300:46"/>
mad, and wryed his mouth, as one that had
been poſſeſſed with a ſpirite, and fomed at
the mouth: &amp; this was counted for a great
wiſedome and diſcretion in <hi>Dauid,</hi> becauſe
he framed him ſelfe according to the time

At ſome time againe it ſhall behooue him

Amongſt all other things, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
wiſely deuiſed, this was one, That
whenſoeuer any of their Captaines retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with victory to Roome, leaſt he ſhoulde
be puft vp with pride and vainglory, for the
worthyneſſe of his perſon, or brought into
a fooles paradiſe, forgetting himſelfe, for
the great honor and triumph that was done
vnto him, they thought good, that as they
honoured him three maner wayes, for the
ouerthrowe that hee wan: ſo the ſelfe ſame
day, to make him remember him ſelfe, and
to let fall his Pecockes taile, they likewiſe
diſhonored him with thre notable diſpights.
The honor (which was doone to all conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours)
that they did vnto him was in three
manners: The firſt was, that all the people
of the Citie, came out to meete and receiue
him, with great ioy and gladneſſe: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde,
all the Priſoners that he had taken,
went before his Chariot, with their hands
bound behinde them. The third, they put vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him a ſhert of the God <hi>Iupiters,</hi> and ſet
him in a Chariot of Golde, which was
drawen with foure white Horſes, in which
ſorte they caried him to the Capitoll, with
great honor, ioy, and ſhowtes of the people.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:9300:47"/>
And with theſe three ſortes of honor, they
ioyned theſe three reproches, to the end hee
ſhoulde not wax proude nor inſolent. The
firſte was, they placed by him cheeke to
cheeke, a ragged and an vnſeemely knaue:
and thus they did to ſignifie, that any man
though his ſtate were neuer ſo baſe nor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,
might by vertue attaine to the like
honour: The ſecond, this beggerly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
did nowe and then buffet him, to the
ende, he ſhould not be too proude of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and euer as he ſtrake him, badde him
to remember that hee was a man, and
ſhould dye: The thirde diſhonour was, that
it was lawfull for euery man to giue him
the ſhamefulleſt woordes they coulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe.
And this the Romaines did as I
ſaide before, to the ende the Conquerour
ſhould abhorre preſumption, which is the
aduerſarie of the Knowledge, that clere and

that maketh him ſo to ſay, is, that as a

in an other time vndone &amp; deſtroied. For as

for when it pleaſeth Fortune, ſuch things as
ſeeme diſpleaſant vnto vs; ſhall redound to

wherof, we muſt conſider what is the
true ſignification of this word (Fortune) of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:9300:48"/>
which there be many &amp; ſundry opinions. For
ſome, thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be heathen people, as <hi>Boetius</hi>
in his firſt booke <hi>Of Conſolation</hi> ſaith, will
needs haue this Fortune to be a Lady, and
a great goddeſſe, vnder whoſe gouernment
and at whoſe diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are all the treaſures
and riches of the world: &amp; farther they ſay,
that ſhee hath all maner of perſons in the,
worlde vpon a wheele, &amp; that her condition
and nature (for ſhe is a woman) is, neuer to
be long of one minde, but ſomtime of great
and honourable perſonages, to make poore
and miſerable creatures, &amp; againe of poore
&amp; miſerable caitiues, to make hye &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
Princes, ſtil whirling about her vnſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt
wheele, as pleaſeth her. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath
alſo the like maner of ſpeach in his Booke
<hi>Of good Fortune,</hi> where he affirmeth, that
there are diuerſe and ſundry opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute
Fortune. But all their opinions are
farre differing from our Chriſtian faith.
For as <hi>Boetius</hi> in his firſte Booke <hi>Of
Conſolation,</hi> And Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the
fourth Booke <hi>Of the Citie of God,</hi> doe
vnite, this Fortune &amp; deſtinie, are no other
things, then the prouidence of God, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to ſpeake like a good Chriſtian, that
<pb facs="tcp:9300:49"/>
which the Prouerbe heere ſaith: <hi>When as
it pleaſeth Fortune, &amp;c.</hi> is as much to
ſay, as when it pleaſeth the prouidence of
God, the thinges that bee hurtfull vnto vs,
ſhall turne to our profit, and ſuch things as
are profitable, to our hurt and deſtruction.
Whereof there is a very good example in
the holie Scriptures, in the firſt Booke of
Moſes, where it is written, that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Iacob,</hi> for the malice that they
bare to <hi>Ioſeph</hi> their brother, threw him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a deepe pitte, and after ſolde him to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Merchants, who ſolde him to an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
of King <hi>Pharaoes,</hi> that vpon the vnfull
accuſation of his wife, kepte him a long
time in Priſon, from whence hee was ſent
for by King <hi>Pharao,</hi> and after that hee
had declared the meaning of his dreame
and foreſhewed the comming of the deare
and the barren yeares, he was made the
greateſt man aboute him, which was the
cauſe that the patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> with all his
houſe eſcaped the great famine, &amp; came to
liue honourably in <hi>Aegypt</hi> and thus did it
pleaſe fortune, that is to ſay, God, that the
hurtfull things, that is, the impriſonment
of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and all the other harmes and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9300:49"/>
that he ſuſtained, ſhould turne to the
profite of himſelf, his father, and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
So likewiſe doe the things that
appeare good and profitable, many times
fall out to bee hurtfull and euill vnto vs, as
to haue great ſtore of monie, is a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing, and yet it often falleth, that their
throates are cut for it, that haue it: and ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

rather to leaue the greate negligence and

how men ought to behaue themſelues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſuch as haue offended, and are ſorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for it. For according to the ſaying of
the Prophet, <hi>God deſireth not the death
of a ſinner, but to haue him to turne and
be ſaued.</hi> And the chiefeſt leſſon that olde
<hi>Anchiſes</hi> (as <hi>Virgil</hi> in the ſixth book of his
<hi>Eneados</hi> writeth) did will his ſonne to take
heede vnto, was to ſeeke in all his exploites
to mainteine peace, as much as he might, to
pardon ſuch as were ſorrowful for that they
had done, and to vſe the ſwoorde againſt
proude and diſdainfull tyrants. And to ſay
true, it is not the part of a man, to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9300:56"/>
any man that is in miſerie, to followe
him that flieth, nor to ſtriue with ſuch as
are weake and vnable. And therefore <hi>Iob</hi>
ſayth vnto God, <hi>Wilt thou ſhew thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
againſt a leafe, that trembleth with the
winde? And perſecute a ſtraw that is drie
and withered?</hi> Meaning, that it was not
a thing beſeeming the maieſtie of God, who
was almightie, to perſecute ſo miſerable a
creature, as he was. And the Prouerbe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<hi>That it is a point of manhood, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile
him, that mindeth to doe miſchiefe,</hi>
And to inuade with the ſworde, as <hi>Anchiſes</hi>
ſayeth to <hi>Enaeas,</hi> the proude and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
perſons, not ſuffring them to vſe their
tyrannous minde in doing of euil, as the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
lawe teacheth, touching the duetie and
behauiour of a Conquerour or gouernour,
that they ought to take ſuch order in euerie
Prouince, that the wealthie &amp; the mightie
oppreſſe not the poore &amp; the needie, and that
they hinder not ſuch as go about to defende
and cheariſh them. And this is the verie

grace of this vertue is, that ſuch as
haue it, can not bee touched with anie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie

vnto them, a noble minde maketh
no accompt of it, but rather diſdaines
him that offereth it, as a vile and an

noble a hart, that where hee was verie
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9300:57"/>
mindefull of all other thinges, hee neuer
would remember any iniurie doone vnto

minde, and a noble and gentlemanly heart,
doeth not onely, not beare in memorie, an
iniurie doone vnto him, but alſo denieth,
that he receiued anie iniurie. And <hi>Seneca</hi>
in one of his Epiſtles ſayth, that if a man
of a noble and valiant minde, be at anie
time iniured, he ought to behaue himſelfe
as <hi>Plato</hi> did, who when one had giuen him

For ſuch as ought to forgeue, are either
priuate perſons or officers, in the common

bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to releaſe the extremity, but not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie,
for they may require a recompence
at the law: But if they doe not, their reward
<pb facs="tcp:9300:60"/>

of our Sauiour in his Goſpel, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue,
and you ſhall be forgiuen.</hi> And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the examples that are in the prouerbs
that goe before: if they be officers and in
authoritie, they cannot pardon an offence
that is doone againſt a common wealth, nor
treſpaſſe, that is done betwixt neighbours:
But they may vſe a moderation and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
according to the circumſtances of the
matter, as if the partie grieued be a ſlaue, or
free born, if he be a gentleman, or a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
perſon, if the offence were in words, or vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
propoſed malice, or ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, &amp; not wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done, if he murdered with poyſon, or with

thoſe that be in authoritie are woont to haue
great conſideration: for he that killeth with

more horrible the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his that killeth by cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medlie.

offended more by exceſſe in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
&amp; drinking, then for any other offence.
For example ſake, let vs looke vppon our
firſt Father <hi>Adam,</hi> who for a gluttonous
deſire of eating, brought both himſelfe and
al his poſterity to deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Lot, the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Abraham,</hi> by too much drinking,
as it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> ſhamed not to lye
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:9300:62"/>
with two of his daughters. And therfore is
Temperance &amp; ſobrietie worthie of greate
honour, being a vertue of greateſt comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The maides of <hi>Rome</hi> that were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to attend vpon their Gods, to the
ende they ſhoulde be ſober &amp; temperate, did
neuer eat more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> three meales in a weeke:
and <hi>Valerius</hi> writeth in his firſt booke, that
the women of <hi>Rome,</hi> to keepe themſelues
chaſt and ſober, did neuer drinke wine. Of
ſuch ſobernes &amp; temperance was the greate
<hi>Alexander</hi> (as <hi>Vegetius</hi> writeth in his
booke <hi>Of the art of warres)</hi> that he was ſo
farre from ſetting his delight in eating &amp;
drinking, that he neuer vſed to eate but as
he trauailed. We likewiſe reade, that hard
by the campe of <hi>Hanniball,</hi> there grew an
appletree, being as ful of apples as it might
hang: And ſo great was the continence and
temperance of the ſouldiers, that the tree
after their departure remained as full of
fruite, as it was when they firſte en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped.
For they counted it a greate
ſhame and diſhonour, to eate any thing
that was deyntie, while they were in
the fielde. And of <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> the
Emperour, wee reade that his dyet
<pb facs="tcp:9300:63"/>
was groſſe and common, as herringes,
ſprattes, cheeſe, and greene figges, &amp; that
he did eate at all times, and in all places,
whenſoeuer he was hungry, and with this
temperance and modeſtie, he bridled the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and diſorder that followeth of to much
eating and drinking.<note place="margin">Gluttonie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh Leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> For the bellie, being
ſtuffed with good meates and wines, doeth
preſently yeeld to the rage of riot and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie.
And therefore ſayeth <hi>Solomon</hi> in
his Prouerbes, <hi>That wine ought not to
be geuen to Princes: For where drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
hath place, no ſecrete can bee kept,</hi>
And therefore the Prouerbe ſayeth, <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
ſtayeth the raging luſt of youth,</hi>
and of ſmall and temperate feeding, there
ariſeth neither diſordinate luſt, nor other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.
Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did euer vſe to ſaie,
<hi>that he liued not to eate, but did eate

&amp; al a fire with the flames of beaſtly deſire,
perceiuing that they were all faſt a ſleepe

yf thou makeſt any noiſe, thou ſhalt die for

great feare awaked, and ſeeing no ſuccour

<hi>Tarquinius</hi> beginneth to diſcloſe vnto her
his great affection, and ſomtime with faire
woordes, intreating her, and ſometime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
terribly threatning her, aſſaieth all
the waies that he can deuiſe to bryng her
to graunt to his deſire: But when he ſaw
that ſhe was by no waies to be remooued

the terrour of death coulde nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
he caſteth about againe, and thinke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

And with this feare he ouercame

when her friendes began to ſalute her, and

where there was no conſent, there coulde

THE faultes that we heere committe
are of two ſortes, either they are
doone by chaunce, and vnwittingly, or they
are doone vppon knowledge, which cannot
be without imagination: Alſo our thoughts
and imaginations are, as the Doccours
ſay, of two ſortes. One is the firſt motion
that we haue to offende, and this becauſe
it is not in our power, being, as we be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,
inclined to deadly ſinne, is not to
be reckoned for ſinne: But if wee take
pleaſure in our euill thoughtes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
in them, determine to put them in
execution as ſoone as wee may haue time
and place, this is as great an offence as
yf we had alredy doone it, according to

<hi>Whoſoeuer looketh vppon a Woman,

haue perfourmed the deede. And therefore
<hi>Seneca</hi> in his fourth <hi>Tragedie,</hi> bringing in

<pb facs="tcp:9300:73"/>
of her huſbande like a Slaue, but as his

according to the doctrine of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
<hi>Is bounde to vſe her wel, and to
loue her, and ſhee to honour and feare

one is called a ſeruile feare, the other a
ſonnely feare. The ſeruile is that, which
is hadde for feare of puniſhment, and not
for any loue: and this is the feare that the
Slaue hath of his maiſter, who as hee
ſerueth againſt his owne will and by force,
hee doeth it more for feare, then for loue.
The Sonnely feare, is a meddlie of feare
and loue togeather: And this is the feare
that the ſonne hath of his father, and that
the wife ought to haue of her huſband, for if
the wife feare her huſband, and doeth what
ſoeuer he commaundeth her, ſhe ought not
to doo it for feare of any puniſhment that
ſhee ſhoulde haue yf ſhee did it not, but
for feare of diſpleaſing &amp; offending her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and to the end her huſband ſhould

                     <hi>A godly ornament to man, I do accompt
the wife, where as ſhe is obedient to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
all her life.</hi> That is, when ſhe ſhall loue
and reuerence her huſband, and while ſhee
keepe her ſelfe honeſt and chaſte, looking
carefully to ſuch thinges as bee aboute the

fanſie.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The choiſe of a wife.</note> Wherein there are two things to be
vnderſtoode. The firſt, that he take a wife of
a good &amp; vertuous kindred, according as a
Philoſopher once anſwered, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
of him, what maner of wife were beſt to
be choſen. Marie, quoth he, ſuch a one whoſe
mother &amp; grandmother thou kneweſt to be
honeſt &amp; chaſt: for as the parents haue been,
ſuch will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly the daughter be. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in marying, a man ought to chooſe a
wife of like degree &amp; ſtate to him ſelf, &amp; ſuch
a one as is anſwerable to his yeeres, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the olde Prouerbe, <hi>Like good, like
blood, like age, maketh a good mariage.</hi>
And as <hi>Ouid</hi> ſayeth, <hi>The Oxen that are
<pb facs="tcp:9300:74"/>
vnequally matched, will neuer draw well
together.</hi> And therfore the Prouerbe ſaith,
<hi>Chooſe thy wife with heed, and great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</hi>

                  <p>IT is generally agreed vpon amongſt the
Philoſophers, that good is deuided into
two kindes, the one of them profitable and
commodious, the other honeſt. And where
profite on the one ſide, and honeſtie on the
other ſide meeteth, we ought alwaies to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
honeſtie before profite. And as their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
is, the vertues are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined vnder the
kind of honeſt goodes, and worldly goodes,
vnder the kinde of profitable goods. And he
that refuſeth a vertuous wife for her want
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:9300:74"/>
of worldly wealth, and taketh a wife for ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
not regarding her vertues, treſpaſſeth
againſt reaſon, and ſeeketh his owne diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe
and harme; that will neuer be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.
For the goodes that hee hath, ſhall
quickly be conſumed, &amp; he ſhall be plagued
at home with a froward foole. For as the
wiſe man in his Prouerbs ſaith, A wiſe and
a vertuous wife, raiſeth and ſetteth vp the
houſe, but a fooliſh woman bringeth it to
ruine: for ſhee will waſte and conſume the
goods that ſhe brought with her, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
her huſbande beſides by his traualle
getteth: neither is it good to take a wife of
greater pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage then he himſelf is, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to regard, that ſhe be vertuous, and equal
in degree to himſelfe. For as it is written
in the Chronicle of the Philoſophers, <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolus</hi>
one of the ſeuen wiſe men of <hi>Athens,</hi>
did euer ſay, that the wife ought to bee of no
greater blood than her huſbande. For if
thou takeſt a wife of hier degree then thy
ſelfe, thou ſhalt alwayes bee ſure to haue
thy wiues kindred to bee as Lordes ouer
thee. And therefore the Prouerbe ſayeth,
<hi>My ſonne, beware thou neuer commit
ſuch a follie.</hi>

                  <p>MOſt certain it is, that the more good
things do meete together, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it is. As to haue a wife that is honeſt,
beautifull, and wiſe, is farre better then to
haue one that is honeſt, and neither wiſe nor
well fauoured. But becauſe they ſeldome
happen togither, nor are not farre diſtant
from looſeneſſe, you ſhall verie hardly ſee
a verie faire woman to be verie wiſe, and as
<hi>Ouid</hi> ſaith, hautineſſe, and diſdaine, is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
incident to faire women. Pride is
alwayes the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion of beautie. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is verified that which the Poets in their
fables haue written, and alſo <hi>Seneca</hi> in his
ſeuenth booke declareth, that the Goddeſſe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:9300:75"/>
                     <hi>Venus</hi> the better to hide her whordome, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
herſelfe and her mate within a verie
darke houſe, and yet not ſo cloſe, but the iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Sunne was peping in with his bright
beames at the ſmall cranies &amp; holes, where
he diſcouered all. Whereat the good Ladie
taking greate diſpleaſure with the Sunne,
becauſe he had ſo vncurteouſly handled her,
laide her heauie curſſe vppon him, cauſing
that all the womankinde that were diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the Sunne, ſhould be as good as
euer twigged. Now of the linage and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of the Sunne, are all welfauoured and
beautifull Dames, and therefore, becauſe
you ſhall hardly find a faire woman, that is
not fooliſh and diſhoneſt, it is ſaid, that the
curſe of <hi>Venus</hi> did light vpon them. And
this is the ſignification of this tale. And
<hi>Solomon</hi> ſaieth in his Prouerbes, <hi>That
beautie in a woman without wiſedome,
is like vnto a ring of golde in the ſnoute
of a ſowe.</hi> And this is it, <hi>That beautie
and wiſedome ſeldome meete, nor are
farre diſtant from lightneſſe.</hi>

                     <hi>PYthagoras,</hi> and his followers, were of
opinion, that there were two chiefe
heades, the one the authour of all goodneſſe,
the other the authour of euill. And vnto theſe
two they referred al things y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were wrought
in the worlde, and ſayd, that of the God of
goodneſſe, proceeded and came the light,
and all things that were good and perfect:
of which number they accounted Man. Of
the God of euill, ſprang darkneſſe, and all
vnperfect things: amongſt which they rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
the woman. And in verie deede, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
reſpect to man, the woman is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
creature, although not ſo vnperfect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but by teaching ſhee may bee brought to
ſome perfection, and to be profitable in her
kind. For as <hi>Ariſtot.</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mikes,</hi>
and they be alſo the wordes of ſaint
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:9300:76"/>
                     <hi>Iſidore, that to bring things to a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it behoueth to haue the man, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
&amp; the oxe that ploweth.</hi> And in the
name of the woorking oxe, hee includeth all
maner of Inſtrumentes that are neceſſarie
about an houſe. And further, he ſayth, that
it proceeded of the great wiſedome and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of nature, that man was made of
more perfection then the woman, becauſe he
was to commaund, and ſhe to obey, and that
man was of more actiuitie and abilitie then
the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe his office was to trauail
in matters abroad, &amp; without doores, &amp; hers
only to ſit at home, and to keepe that which
is brought in. And therefore the Prouerbe
ſaieth, that the woman is not vnprofitable,
nor vnperfect. Neither ought we to thinke,
that becauſe ſome women haue been to
blame, therefore they are all to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
For as the nurſe ſayth to <hi>Hippolytus,</hi>
as <hi>Seneca</hi> in his fourth <hi>Tragedie</hi> ſheweth,
where <hi>Hippolitus</hi> ſaith, that if there had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

wife of <hi>Aegeus,</hi> her onely villanies were
ſufficient to cauſe all other women to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred.
Wherto the nurſe anſwereth, that it
were greatly againſt reaſon, that the offence
<pb facs="tcp:9300:77"/>
of one or two ſhould be the blame of all the
reſt: And therefore ſayeth the Prouerbe,
that notwithſtanding the faultes of a fewe,

I haue writen thereof before in the ſtory

                  <p>ACcording to the true opinion of both
the Aſtronomers and the Catholike
diuines, we are not in ſuch ſort conſtrained
by the ſtarres to doe any thing, as we bee
thereby depriued of our owne will, to doe of
neceſſitie that which they foreſhowe, but by
inclining vs to doe certaine actions, they
moue al our bodyly forces to do ſuch things
as they ſignifie. Which doth not ſo farre
inforce vs, but that as <hi>Ptolomy</hi> ſaith in his
<hi>Centiloquium, <hi>A wiſe and a vertuous
man, may rule &amp; reigne ouer the ſtarres.</hi>
                     </hi>
That is, though the ſtarres doe ſtirre and
moue a man to doe euill, yet the partie him
ſelfe hath ſufficient power, if he will, to doe
wel. But the olde people, beeing ignorant
of this vertue, and ſeeing the Planet <hi>Mars</hi>
did mooue men to be venterers and ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
held opinion, that he was the onely god
of battailes, and that hee aduaunced and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
all ſuch as were valiant and vente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous:
which olde maner of ſpeaking, is here
by the Marques at this time followed. And
moſt certaine it is, that ſuch as make much
of them ſelues, doe ſhunne as much as they
<pb facs="tcp:9300:84"/>
may, the comming into any perill or daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Of which ſort of people <hi>Seneca</hi> in his
firſt tragidie ſpeaketh, where he ſaith, <hi>That
great yeeres and gray heares, happeneth
to faintharted, and ſuch as loue to ſleepe
in a whole ſkin.</hi> For ſuch manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
will be ſure to commit themſelues to
no haſard nor danger, wherby they are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of any vertue or honor. For <hi>Honor</hi>
as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the fourth of his <hi>Ethicks</hi>
ſaith, <hi>is a reuerence, that is giuen to men
in rewarde and recompence of their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</hi>
And therefore the Marques ſaith, <hi>That
whoſoeuer is ſo valiant, as not to regarde
his life in any vertuous attempt, ſhal be
ſure to receiue the crowne of Mars:</hi> that
is, the renowme &amp; rewarde of a vertuous
minde, which he ſhall quickly attaine vnto
if he repreſſe feare. And where as there are
in the vertue of Fortitude two extreames
or vices, the one in ventering to farre, the
other in fearing to much: the Marques
hath not here ſaid, If thou reſtraineſt bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
as hee ſayeth, <hi>If thou abandoneſt
feare:</hi> becauſe as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the thirde
of his <hi>Ethicks</hi> affirmeth, and as dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9300:84"/>
teacheth, the nature of man is
more inclined to fearfulneſſe then to bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and therefore thoſe that ſeeke to bee
valiaunt and vertuous, ought more to trauel
in the repreſſing and abandoning of feare,
then in the reſtraint or temperaunce of
boldeneſſe. And therefore to good purpoſe
ſayeth the Marques in this Prouerbe, <hi>If
thou abandoneſt or forceſt feare,</hi> and not
corrage, and becauſe as it is ſayde abooue,
it is in euery mans power and will to bee
vertuous, it is heere well ſaide of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerb,

                  <p>THE Emperours did in their lawes
carefully prouide for the behoofe and
good eſtate of their Subiectes, to ſette
downe rewardes and encouragements, for
ſuch as were honeſt and vertuous, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe
puniſhments and corrections, for ſuche
as were wicked and euill diſpoſed. And it
is very wel thought, as hath been ſaide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that ſuch as valiantly loſt their liues,
either in defence of their faith, or for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
of their countrie, are rewarded with
euerlaſting life: or if any man dye in the
defence of his owne honeſty, he ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
be well thought of, and commended.
But ſuch as cowardly forſake the feelde,
and run away from the warres, the lawes
haue appointed to dye, and are accounted
for wretches and villaines, whether they
dye or liue, and their ſhameful and reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
life, is more griefe to them then any
death that can bee deuiſed, eſpecially an
honeſt death, &amp; this is the meaning of the
Prouerbe, <hi>Deteſt an euill life &amp;c.</hi> For as
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the 3. of his <hi>Ethicks</hi> ſaith, <hi>A
man is borne to honor &amp; libertie,</hi> which
two things, we ought alwaies to keepe and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:9300:85"/>
maintaine, and to couet by all meanes we
can, to diehoneſtly, &amp; to liue vertuouſly. The
Prouerb ſaith further, <hi>that life can not be
borrowed.</hi> For as <hi>Iob</hi> ſayeth, <hi>The Lord
hath rated the dayes of our life, which
can not bee lengthened:</hi> And therefore
no man may ſhunne the appointed houre
that God hath determined. And herevpon
ariſeth the tale among the Poets, of the
three ſiſters of deſtinie, whereof the one of
them called <hi>Clotho,</hi> carieth the diſtaffe, the
other named <hi>Lacheſis,</hi> ſpinneth, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out the threede, which the thirde ſiſter,
<hi>Atropos,</hi> windeth vppe vpon the reele. And
as <hi>Seneca</hi> in his firſt <hi>Tragedie</hi> ſayth, Theſe
three ſiſters are ſo cruell and hard, that it
was neuer ſeene, that the threede which
they had once wounde vppe, could euer bee
got backe againe. Theſe ſiſters of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinie
doe ſignifie in deede the poſting time
of our tranſitorie life, whereof the day once
paſt, can neuer be called backe againe. And
therefore ſayeth <hi>Seneca,</hi> theſe three vnlibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Ladies doe rule by aſſured order, and
may neither ſhorten nor lengthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, otherwiſe

<pb facs="tcp:9300:87"/>
reaſon is, that praiſes and commendations
before the face, doth rather ſeeme a kinde of
flattering and clawing, then a praiſe. The
Prouerbe ſaith further, <hi>That if thou doeſt
reprochfull wordes of any man ſuſtaine,
It is no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation, to report the ſame
againe.</hi> The meaning of it is, that no man
that is of great minde or courage, ought to
ſpeake of the iniurious and euill words that
hath been offered him, but ſhall rather bee
counted both wiſer and valianter, if he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
them, and ſeeme not to wey them, as

                  <p>AS <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayeth in his booke of <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites,</hi>
wee are not borne to liue onely to
our ſelues, but to benefite and profite our
kinſmen, our friendes, our neighbours, yea,
and euerie other perſon that we can. Sith
nature, as the ciuill law ſaith, hath linked all
men in a conſanguinitie and duetie eche to
other. And therefore we are bound being of
abilitie, to be liberall and bountifull to ſuch
as liue in wante and neceſſitie, though as
the Doctours ſay, it ought to bee done
<pb facs="tcp:9300:89"/>
by order and degrees, as firſt to conſider our
parents, next our children, then our kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and after them our friends, and ſo tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout
as they be in degree. And if ſo bee
we haue ſome of our kindred that be of the
houſeholde of fayth, and others that be not,
the Apoſtle willeth vs (if our power be not
ſufficient to ſerue them both) rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
thoſe that be of the fayth, then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and this great vertue, Liberalitie
hath, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writeth in the fourth of
his <hi>Ethickes,</hi> certaine circumſtances: As
that hee that giueth ought, to conſider to
whom he giueth, and to what end he giueth,
and to looke that the things which hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
be not of the baſeſt of his ſubſtance, as
<hi>Caine</hi> did, who offered vnto God the verie
worſt and vileſt of his flocke, whereas <hi>Abel</hi>
offring the beſt that hee had, his Sacrifice
was accepted, &amp; <hi>Caines</hi> refuſed. Likewiſe,
he is to conſider, to whom he giueth. For to
giue to ſuch as haue no neede, is to caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
that, which is giuen. It muſt alſo
be knowne, whether the partie to whom we
giue, be able to woorke, and can by his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
ſufficiently maintaine himſelfe. For to
giue to ſuch a one, were to rob another, that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:9300:89"/>
is not able to labour, nor hath any meane
to gette his liuing, and yet, as the lawiers
ſay, if a man be well borne and deſcended of
a good houſe, ſo as he cannot, conſidering
his parentage, without great ſhame &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement,
giue himſelf to anie baſe trade
of life, although he be of abilitie for bodie
to trauell and labour, yet is it a good turne
to relieue him, becauſe he is in the ſame caſe
with him that can neither labour nor hath
means to get his liuing,<note place="margin">A right Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſtomacke.</note> for with his honeſty
he cannot abaſe himſelfe to any vile occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and therfore is to be conſidered. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
we ought to regard the manner and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of our liberalitie, which ought not to
beſtowed for anie vaunt or vayneglorie,
as appeareth by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple in the Goſpel,
where our Sauiour, beeing preſent in the
temple, there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in together, to offer,
a proude wealthy Phariſey, and a poore ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
widdowe. The riche Miſer offereth
of his great ſubſtance, great and precious
preſentes: the poore widowe turneth out of
the bottome her purſe, and her hart, a poore
ſillie Farthing. Our Lord demaundeth,
which of the twayne had offered moſt, and
gaue ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tence with the poore widow, becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:9300:90"/>
the mind of the giuer, who onely gaue it in
reſpect of the ſeruice of God, &amp; not for anie
vaunt, or vaineglory, as the riche man did.
Beſide al this, we ought to geue that, which
we geue, with a willing &amp; a cheerful minde,
as the Apoſtle ſaieth, <hi>For the Lorde doeth
loue a cheerfull giuer, and ſuch a one, as is
not ſlacke nor ſlowe in the beſtowing of
his benefites.</hi> For he giueth double, as the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prouerb is, that giueth ſoone: &amp; as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
ſaith in his prouerbs, <hi>Say not vnto
the pore man, go, &amp; come againe to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
when it is in thy hand to helpe him
preſently.</hi> For as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the fourth of
his <hi>Ethicks</hi> ſaith, Liberality ſtandeth not in
the giuing of many &amp; ſumptuous gifts, but
in the habit of him that giueth, whatſoeuer
it be that is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that is to ſay, in the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

came vnto him, &amp; beſeeched him to beſtowe

what was ſeemely for ſo greate a Prince

of greate liberalitie, who as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported

that beyng ſet at Supper, and calling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance

                  <p>THE Prodigall man, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
in the fourth booke of his <hi>Ethikes</hi>
ſayth, is he that ſpendeth more then
is needefull, &amp; where it is needeleſſe.
Who, perceyuing the vertues of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall
man, that ſpendeth that which is
meete, and where it behoueth, and that
the couetuous miſer is condemned, for not
ſpending that, which hee ought: taketh
himſelfe ſtraightwayes for a liberall and
a vertuous Gentleman: and ſayeth, that
hee vſeth monie, as it ought to bee vſed.
And this is a vice greatly to bee auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
for the meane betwixte theſe two
extremes of Prodigalitie, and Couetuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
is the vertue Liberalitie. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
true it is, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayeth, the
leſſer vice of the twayne, and more to bee
borne withall, is Prodigalitie. For the
prodigall man profiteth thoſe to whom
hee geueth, although hee hurteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
But the Churle and the miſer nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
profiteth himſelfe, nor anie man els.
<pb facs="tcp:9300:93"/>
Beſides hee that is prodigall, will ſooner
come to be vertuous, and liberal, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous,
for two reaſons. The one is, that by
reaſon of his greate expenſes falling in to
neede and want, he will quickely ſee what
hurt he receiueth by too much ſpending, and
will from that time forwarde learne to bee
wiſer, and to keepe his money the better.
The ſeconde is, that with the time of his
ſpending, hee waxeth aged, and people in
their olde yeeres be more ſparing and thrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
then in their youth, becauſe the hope of
gaming is nowe taken from them, whiche
in youth doeth alwayes encourage them.
But, the couetous perſon ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be brought
to the vertue, by neither of theſe reaſons.
For the older he waxeth, the more miſer he
waxeth, and therefore if wee miſlike a man,
that by reaſon of his prodigalitie commeth
to be poore, we ought a great deale more to
deteſt a Miſar that by couetouſnes groweth
to be rich. For as <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſaith in his booke of

both faith and honeſtie, and
cleane deſtroyed all artes and knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi>
                     </hi>

The one, called vayne boaſting,
which is when men brag of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, more
then they are able to performe: the other is
named <hi>Ironia,</hi> when men publiſhe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
that which is not in them. Men
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:9300:95"/>
ought to loue and honour the trueth after
one of theſe two manners, eyther where it
concerneth onely them, and therein men
ought to beware, that they neither exceede,
nor doe leſſe then that which is reaſon. The
other is, when it toucheth an other, &amp; in this
caſe, to reuerence the trueth, is as much to
ſay, as to performe whatſoeuer is promiſed,
and to bee true of our worde, as well to our
enimies, as to our friends, as we are bound
by the Ciuill lawe: for there is no greater
duetie betwixt man and man, then to keepe
their faith and promiſe iuſtly one with the
other, without the which, all trafficke and
dealing amongſt men muſt of neceſſitie
ceaſe. And therefore the Prouerbe ſayeth,
<hi>Truth honour thou, and alwayes loue,
ſteppe not from her aſide.</hi> And farther,
<hi>that we ought to frame our friendſhippe
after truth.</hi> Friendſhippe, according to the
minde of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Ethickes,</hi> is in one
of theſe three ſortes, eyther for profite, for
pleaſure, or for honeſtie. Friendſhippe for
profite, as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayeth, is Merchantes
friendſhippe, which neuer endureth longer
than there is hope of gayne. Friendſhippe
for pleaſure, laſteth as long as delight and
<pb facs="tcp:9300:96"/>
pleaſure laſteth, and as delightes doe alter
with yeeres, and ſuche thinges as ſeemed
pleaſant at ſome age, are thought diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
in an other: Therefore this Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe
can neuer long continue. Friendſhip
for honeſtie, is that which is grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
truth and vertue: and as vertue, truth, &amp;
honeſtie, are thinges euerlaſting &amp; vnchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable,
ſo the friendſhip that is grounded
vppon them, cannot but continue for euer.
This friendſhippe flooriſheth in the time of
proſperitie, and continueth and remayneth
in the time of miſfortune and aduerſitie,
and therefore hee ſaieth: <hi>That ſhee is the
daughter of holineſſe, &amp; that honeſtie is
the faithfull ſiſter vnto the moſt ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne

this queſtion, What quantitie of the

pouertie, and yet to be not farre from it:
And this is it that preſerueth a man from

his <hi>Ethikes,</hi> ſayeth, and as hath been
ſayde afore vpon one of the Prouerbes, is
of three ſortes, for delight, for profite, and
for honeſtie. Friendſhip of delight, is the
friendſhippe of flatterers, and ieſters
which endureth but a ſmall while: for when
the pleaſure ceaſſeth (as teſters are not at
all times, nor of all men liked) this friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe
ſtraight wayes endeth. An other
friendſhippe there is, grounded vpon profit,
and is, as <hi>Seneca</hi> termeth it, merchaunt
friendſhippe, for it endureth no longer then
there is hope of profite: And thoſe that
vſe this kinde of friendſhippe, doe it, as
<hi>Seneca</hi> ſayeth, more vpon the profite, then
in reſpect of the perſon. The Flye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
attendeth vppon the honie, and the
Woolfe vpon the Carion. Which kinde of
people are more in loue with the praye,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:9300:109"/>
and the ſpoyle, then with the man. The
third kinde of friendſhip ſetieth it ſelfe only
vpon honeſtie, and groundeth her ſelfe vpon
vertue, and this endureth as wel in aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as in proſperitie. This is the allonely
true friendſhip, which the Prouerbe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelleth
vs to chooſe, and this is that which
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayeth cauſeth in friendes but one
hart and one minde: and this friend, whoſe
friendſhip is grounded vpon honeſtie, is he,
that wel reprehendeth, and is no flatterer,
nor will conſent to any wickedneſſe nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
but giueth counſaile with out affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

before ſilence: the one is, in ſpeaking
that, which is to a publike commoditie: the
other, in vttering that, which neceſſitie
forceth. In all other thinges hee ſayeth:
<pb facs="tcp:9300:111"/>
that ſilence is farre to bee preferred before

howbeit as it is no newe thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men, to haue their good deedes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited
with vnthankfulneſſe, he was moſte
vnkindely &amp; vniuſtly baniſhed by his owne

apparant, for malice neuer mindeth reaſon,
neither doth euill will at any time regarde

beeing thus baniſhed, goeth

that time were in armes againſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes:</hi>
and as vertue in all places getteth
eſtimation, ſo was he receiued and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
with great honour amongſt them,
and for his valour, within a very ſmall time
choſen to be their general. Wherby it came
to paſſe (as <hi>Valerius</hi> writeth) that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him,
whoſe profit and good turnes his Citizens
could not away with, nowe were they, the
caſe beeing altered, driuen to dreade as
their mortall enemy, and beſieger of their
towne: And beeing thus by the ſiege ſore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed
(which is alwayes more grieuous
to great and populous Cities, then to ſmall
townes) they were conſtrayned to ſend vnto
<hi>Coriolanus,</hi> moſte humbly requiring him
to leaue his ſiege, and to departe from the
Citie, and whereas their Embaſſadors, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the chiefe and principall men of the
Citie and of the Capitoll, with colde enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
were neither heard nor anſwered,
they continued their ſute, and with humble
ſubmiſſion ſent out their prieſtes and cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
beeing araied in their deuouteſt veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
but as the other were returned, ſo
were theſe ſent back, with very harde ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and euel entertainment, whervpon the
<pb facs="tcp:9300:114"/>
whole Citie bewayling their miſerable
caſe, and crying out for the cruel aunſwere,
that (iuſtly deſerued) they had receued. <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turia</hi>
the mother of this <hi>Coriolanus</hi> ſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

goeth directly to the Campe of the <hi>Volſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
whom when <hi>Coriolanus</hi> a farre of
perceiueth, hauing in his company a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
company of Gentlemen, he commeth
foorth to meete her, though not a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted,
becauſe his minde gaue him that
their comming was onely to mooue him for
the rayſing of his ſiege, and as ſoone as he
came neere vnto them, alighting from
his horſe, hee came towardes his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to embrace her. But ſhee, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him a little backe from her with her
hand, with a heauie countenaunce ſaide
vnto him theſe woordes, Before thou
commeſt neare mee, and before I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
thine embracinges, let mee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande
whether I bee come vnto my
ſonne, or to my enemie? or whether I
ſhall enter into thy tent as a mother, or
as a ſorrowfull captiue? Alas, to what
extremitie is my wretched Age come, to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:9300:114"/>
ſee thee firſte banniſhed and expulſed thy
Cittie, and nowe a cruell enemie and
ſpoyler of thy Countrie that nouriſhed
thee? howe couldeſt thou come into theſe
partes with ſo deadely and reuengefull
a minde? howe couldeſt thou enter into
theſe territories, and not let fall thy fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
diſpleaſure and threatnings? Howe
happened it, that at the ſight of Rome
thou ſaydeſt not vnto thy ſelfe, Loe heare
within theſe walles is encloſed my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
ſoyle; my patrimonie, my mother,
my wife, and my children? Vnhappie
woman that I am, who am well aſſured,
that if I had neuer borne thee, Rome
had neuer by thee been beſieged: And
if I had neuer beene deliuered of a ſonne,
I had happily dyed both free and at home
in mine owne countrie. I ſpeake not
theſe woordes, becauſe I am not able to
ſuffer anie thing that ſhall be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochfull
to thee, nor for the griefe of
myne owne captiuitie, whoſe miſerie can
not be long by reaſon of my age, but
onely for theſe, that be heere preſent, thy
miſerable wife &amp; poore diſtreſſed infants.
<pb facs="tcp:9300:115"/>
When <hi>Ventruria</hi> had thus ended her ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull
complaint, <hi>Coriolanus</hi> imbracing
her w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> teares in his eyes, ſaid theſe wordes:
Mine owne ſweete Mother, my rage and
fury is conquered &amp; appeaſed, and is turned
at your requeſt from this mine vnnatural &amp;
vnthankful countrie: wherwith he preſently
diſcamped, &amp; brake vp his ſiege. Wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Valerius</hi> in the ſame Chapter ſayeth,
That the hart, that was full of wrath &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
for the iniurie that he had ſuſtained,
and was now in aſſured hope of preſent vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
vpon the onely ſight of his mother, and
vpon his vertuous compaſſion, chaunged
his intent of bloody warres, into a ſweete
and healthfull peace. Long were it to
write, how greatly vertuous children haue
alwayes beene gouerned by duetie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
to their parents. Touching <hi>Nero</hi>
of whom mention is made in this prouerb,
where hee ſayeth, <hi>The beaſtly luſt of that
ſame monſter vile &amp;c.</hi> Howe lothſome
and horrible the lecheryes of this ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
tyrant was, and what, and howe greate
his diſobedience was to his owne natural
mother, is to bee ſeene in the ſtory of his
life, where who ſo liſte may reade it. And
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:9300:115"/>
therefore I meane to ſtand no longer vpon
this prouerb, but to conclud, affirming that
reuerence ought of bounden deutie to bee
giuen to the Parents, for which the Lorde
hath promiſed in the fourth of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements,
a long and bleſſed life vpon
the earth. I could heere bring in, if I were
diſpoſed, a great number of teſtimonies, as

the olde ſaying is, <hi>The tedious tale
offends the eare, and briefeſt words wee

of <hi>Ioab,</hi> who was a ſpeciall friende to
<hi>Abſalon,</hi> he pardoned him. But <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
whether it were becauſe he found not

withdrue himſelfe (as if he wont with

as long as wee liue in this worlde,
we are Pilgrimes and ſtraungers
to the Lorde, meaning that our true
and naturall countrie is that, of which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>

The land of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liuing is the glory of
Paradiſe, where who ſoeuer remaineth doe
liue without any dread or daunger of death.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:9300:117"/>
And as the Apoſtle ſayeth, all the while
that we are abſent from that place, wee are
aptly here called ſtraungers and pilgrims,
meaning, that as the pilgrim wandreth
here and there forth of his Countrey. So
we are alwayes abſent and out of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
as long as wee liue in this tranſitorie
life. And becauſe that by the meanes of age
we draw neare to our owne countrey, when
we drawe neare to death: by which death,
as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaieth in his <hi>Phedro,</hi> the ſoule at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth
vnto libertie, and breaking out from
the Gaole of the bodie, being deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſorrow and miſerie, commeth to her owne
quietneſſe, ioy and ſolace. And therefore we
ought not to be diſpleaſed at our olde age,
ſince that <hi>it is the race of goodneſſe,</hi> that is
to ſay, the plaine path &amp; way, by which wee
paſſe from ſorrow and trouble to quietneſſe,
and to reſt. And this is onely to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of the modeſt and well gouerned age,
for that is ſhee that abateth the luſtes and
outrages of youth. For there is an age, as
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayeth in the firſt of his <hi>Ethikes,</hi>
that being deſtitute of all vertue and good
behauiour, is altogether doting and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh:
For there is no difference, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:9300:118"/>
ſayth, betwixt him that is yong of yeeres,
and him that is young in behauiour, ſo that
the age which ſhall not be diſpleaſant, muſt
be modeſt and furniſhed with good behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and vertuous exerciſes, and that is the
age, <hi>that doeth abate the fire of vicious
youth, and doeth reſtraine eche lewde
and fonde deſire.</hi> This age (as <hi>Tullie</hi> in
his booke <hi>de Senectute</hi> writeth) doeth alay
both luſt, pride, &amp; preſumption, and doeth
ſo enfeeble the force of the fleſh, as it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
a man to bee lowly, milde, and modeſt.
Of this kinde of age alſo ſpeaketh the
Pſalme, where it ſayth, When the time of
meeknes &amp; mildnes ſhal come, then ſhal we
be reformed, which time of mildnes is from
the age of threeſcore, to threeſcore and ten,
which ſeaſon ſuffreth not a man to be prowd

                  <p>IT is commanded in the lawe of God, that
whenſoeuer we ſee an old ancient man, we
ſhould riſe and reuerence him. And we finde
in the Ciuil law, that in the Citie of <hi>Rome</hi>
in the olde time, they vſed to worſhip and
reuerence their aged perſons, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of thoſe dayes did yeelde the ſame ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to ſuche as were olde, as they did
to their Iudges and Magiſtrates: and this
onely they did in reſpecte of the honour
that their olde yeeres doeth giue them, for
no young man, though his wit be neuer ſo
pregnant or quicke, is able to attaine to
that vnderſtanding, that the olde man
by his experience hath gotten. For as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi>
in the firſt and ſixteenth of his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thikes</hi>
witneſſeth, the number of yeeres is
it that giueth knowledge &amp; experience. And
therefore he ſayeth, that the yong man can
<pb facs="tcp:9300:119"/>
neuer giue anie perfect iudgement of anie
thing, becauſe he neuer hath had anie great
experience. And although that in naturall
Philoſophie, and in the liberal artes &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
there needeth nought elſe but a ſharp
and quicke conceite and vnderſtanding: yet
in morall Philoſophie, which is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
by which we learne to liue vprightly
and honeſtly, it is not onely enough to haue
a good wit &amp; capacitie to, but alſo to haue
the experience and knowledge of time: and
ſuch thinges as are done by men of ripe
yeares, we alwayes preſume that they bee
done vppon great aduiſe and deliberation,
which is nothing ſo with yong men. And
therefore vppon great conſideration, our
Sauiour being perfect God and man, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in the verie inſtant that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
he was perfect in all knowledge &amp;
vnderſtanding, &amp; did not grow with ſpace of
time to more ripe knowledge &amp; ſkill, would
neither preach nor publiſhe his doctrine in
his yong yeares, but at ſuch time as he was
come to his perfect age, neither doeth the
Church receiue for trueth and certaintie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
other things, then thoſe, which we read
to bee done at his full age. Wherevpon
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:9300:119"/>
all ſuch Bookes as are written of ſuche
thinges as hee did in his childehoode, and
youngeſt yeares, the Church doeth take
for Apocripha, and counteth them not in
the Canon of holy Scriptures. And it is
good reaſon that the thinges that are done
in vnripe yeares ſhould be of no authoritie,
ſince our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe woulde

but olde men that were of experience,
ſuch as had ſerued his Father, and his
Grandfather in their warres, to the end hee
might haue in his companie, not onelie

that, when his old Souldiours had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of him leaue to goe home to reſt,
and refreſh their olde and weeried bodies,
and that they woulde ſende in their places
their ſonnes that were yong and luſtie, and

of the wiſe and ſkilfull grauitie and
authoritie of ſuch auncient men, then he did

age is onely it that maketh a man wiſe,

                     <hi>SEneca,</hi> as hath bene ſaid before, ſayth
in his ſecond <hi>Tragedie,</hi> that no man
could euer yet haue the Goddes ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable,
that they might be able to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
themſelues, to liue till the next day. For
although we bee moſt aſſured, that we ſhall
die, yet is neither the houre nor the time of
our death certaine, but rather, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the great daungers and caſualties that
our wretched life is ſubiect vnto, wee ought
euerie houre, yea euery moment to looke
for it, according to the warning of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
who willeth vs to watch and pray,
for we knowe not the day, nor the houre of
our viſitation. And therefore as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe
ſayeth, it is a great follie, to thinke
that Death is not alwayes at hande, &amp; that
he ſhall not, as he came into the world, goe
out of it. For as the Apoſtle ſayeth, there is
a lawe ouer all fleſh, that they ſhal once die.

                     <hi>Valerius</hi> telleth vs in his fifth booke, that
when there was woorde brought to <hi>Anaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi>
that his ſonne was dead: Hee anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the meſſenger, that it was neither
newes, nor a ſtrange thing, that hee tolde
him, but that it was ſuch as he alwayes lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for. For hee knewe that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could come from him, that ſhould liue
for euer, and that it was a generall matter,
that whatſoeuer receiued the ſpirite of life,
muſt agayne reſtore it, and that as no man
died, but that firſt he liued, ſo no man liued,
but at laſt he died: And therefore well ſaieth
here the Prouerbe, <hi>Greate madneſſe were
it for a man to thinke this fooliſh life. &amp;c.</hi>

our life became ſtraight to bee ſubiecte to

Adam, wee are all borne the children of
wrath.</hi> And neuer ſhall we be without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

<hi>I deſire to be looſed and to be with Ieſus
Chriſt.</hi> For the Apoſtle, being vexed with

                     <hi>ARiſtotle</hi> in the ſeconde of his <hi>Ethickes</hi>
ſayeth, that in all ſciences, the woorke
is brought to perfection, by hauing reſpect
vnto the meane, neither adding nor taking
from it more then is reaſon: meaning that
the ouerplus and the defect, doe marre the
whole matter, and that the meane doeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaue and preſerue it, which ſuche as are
ſkilfull maiſters doe chiefly conſider. For
ſeeing that vertue is the moſt certeine and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:9300:123"/>
beſt of all other artes, and that hir woorke
and actions differ not from the actions of
nature, it were greatly againſt reaſon, that
ſhe ſhould not (as wel as al other arts) ſerch
and finde out the meane: and further hee
ſayth, that the vertue morall conſiſteth as
well in paſſion as in action, and that in all
thinges that be, there is an extremitie of too
much, and an extremitie of too little, and
a meane betwixt both: As for example, in
feare, in boldeneſſe, in coueting, in cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
in pittie, and of all thinges that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
either pleaſure or ſorrowe, the meane,
as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth, is to be commended, and
the extreames doe alwaies bring ſhame and
diſhonour. And like as it happeneth, that to
the perfection of any thing, there are a great
number of thinges required, as likewiſe to
make an imperfection, ſuffiſeth that anie
one of thoſe thinges be wanting: euen ſo
for a man to atteine vnto the very meane of
vertue, there are a great number of thinges
required, but to the not attaining therevnto,
ſuffiſeth the want of anie ſuche thing as is
needefull. And hereof <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> putteth a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
familiar example of ſuch as be Archers,
that to hitte the white, is a matter of greate
<pb facs="tcp:9300:124"/>
cunning and hardneſſe, and none is able to
ſay that hee can doe it but hee that is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Archer: but to miſſe it, is a very eaſie
matter, and euerie man that will, can doe
it. So likewiſe is it of the vertuous meane,
for euerie man that liſt, may auoyde it. And
therefore is the number a greate deale more
of the wicked, then of thoſe that bee good,
neither doth it followe, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaieth,
that of euerie thing the meane is alwayes
beſt. For ſome things there are, that aſſoone
as they bee named, they are mingled and
wrapped in miſchiefe. As for example, for
a man to reioyce in an other mans harme,
not to be aſhamed of anie euill that he hath
committed, to beare a repining ſpite at an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans good happe, to commit adultery,
to murder, to ſteale: of theſe things, and ſuch
like, there is no meane that may bee called
vertuous. For howſoeuer a man doe them,
they carrie with them miſchiefe and offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
but in all other thinges that may bee well
done &amp; euil done, there are both extreames,
and a meane. And of ſuche meaneth the
Prouerbe, where it ſayth, <hi>The onely reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
in all extreames is, for to keepe the
perfect meane with thee, which if thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:9300:124"/>
for thy friende,</hi> (that is: if ſo be a man
in the order of his life ioyne himſelfe with
vertue, which is the meane:) <hi>A long &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
life, thou ſhalt be ſure to leade, and liue
without offence and ſtrife.</hi> In what ſorte
we ought to ſeeke out this meane, and how
we ought to order our ſelues for the obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> at large declareth
in the ſeconde of his <hi>Ethickes,</hi>
whyther for auoyding of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſſe,
