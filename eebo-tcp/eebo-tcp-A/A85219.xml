            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>With what fatherly care ever ſince wee begun to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Royall Government, we have continually ſtrived, that this our here before much afflicted Kingdome of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> as a wall and Bullwark to Chriſtendome in theſe moderne heavy troubles and diſtractions, might be preſerved in a good conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, peace and tranquillity, is not unknown to any of our loyall Subjects of the ſaid Kingdome: to which end alſo in theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:155133:3"/>
yeares we have of ſet purpoſe entred into peaceable treaties with the Turke, and admitted nothing that hath been advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous and ſerviceable to the preſervation of a firm peace, ſafety or tranquility of the Kingdome. But in the meane time the Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania, George Ragoczii,</hi> unknowne to Us, what hath cauſed and moved Him hereunto, hath ſuffered Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be ſeduced, that, though We for our part have given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him not any cauſe or occaſion hereunto, He notwithſtanding hath entred into a moſt dangerous and moſt pernitious league with Our enemies the Swedes and French, that He thereby alſo might highly endanger this Our Kingdom of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> which hitherto through Gods mercy hath ſate in peace and quietneſſe, and draw, and involve the ſame in this heavy warre, wherewith diverſe Countries in Chriſtendome are now overwhelmed, yea ſo farre alſo, that preſently in the beginning of the aforeſaid league He did not ſtick upon it to pawne by way of promiſe His two ſonnes, that all the dayes of His life He would further and advance with all his ſtrength and power the profit, wellfare and benefit of the Confederates; whereof the letters and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that paſſed betwixt Them by Gods ſpeciall mercy and providence are come to Our hands and are ſtill with Us in originall: By which principally and moſt clearly appeareth, with what earneſtneſſe, as alſo with what high promiſes, and preſents, as well alſo through perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Ambaſſadours of Our publick enemies and Rebells, He hath ſollicited the Turke for His aſſent and approbation, that He firſt of all might invade <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and then afterwards ſome other of Our Countries, ſubdue Our loyall Subjects in a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like manner, extreamely afflict them, and thereby diſturbe and deſtroy the common peace and tranquillity: He hath tied and bound Himſelf alſo ſo faſt to His Fellow Confederates, that neither He, nor His Succeſſours, neither the States and Peeres of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> nor alſo the Inhabitants of <hi>Hungary,</hi> that take His part, ſhall have any power to enter into any treaty with Us or conclude any Peace or ceſſation of Armes without the knowledge and conſent of all the Confederates, promiſing withall, not onely to introduce into <hi>Hungary</hi> the Swedes, and their hoſtile Army, but alſo to deliver over into their hands cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:155133:3"/>
places, eſpecially our Cities of <hi>Tirna</hi> and <hi>Presburg,</hi> which places are ordained for the preſervation of the Crown of the Kingdom, inſomuch that highly is to be feared, that thereby the glorious and precious treaſure of that Crowne, which hitherto hath been preſerved and protected with ſo much blood of the Hungarians may fall into ſtrangers hands and be tranſported o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſea into a ſtrange Country. That He alſo may involve this Kingdome, and Himſelf yet deeper into this heavy fire of war, He did not ſtick alſo upon it to promiſe, that as often as Our enemies ſhould be invaded in a warlike manner, as often He together with His Confederates ſhould be bound to take up armes, and faithfully to aſſiſt them, as neceſſity ſhould require: He declares Himſelfe thereby further, that His principall deſire is to fall upon Us and Our loyall Subjects in a warlike manner, and to joyne with His forces to the enemies forces in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome it ſelf. All which and yet much more largely appeareth, as well by the Articles of the league, (the acceptation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation whereof the ſaid Prince with much opportunity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of both the Crownes <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi>) as by the Princes, Maſter <hi>Biſterfields,</hi> and other our enemies letters. Whereby the moſt pernitious deſigne of the ſaid Prince is come to light how He namely forgetting all duty to the Native Country intends to kindle a fire to the ruine of the Country, to diſturbe the Common peace and tranquillity of Our loyall Subjects, to ſet the Tranſylvanians and Hungarians by the eares together for to deſtroy one another themſelves with their own ſwords, and thus to draw the Hungarian Nation, which in former overthrowes hath already been weakened very much, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Civill Warre, and to the ſhedding of their own blood and of their own kindred. Hereby appeareth alſo the great ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the aforeſaid Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> to Us and Our Illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> from which His Predeceſſours have received great benefits and priviledges, whereas they were not onely raiſed from a low condition to Honour and Dignity, but alſo his Father <hi>Sigismund Ragoczii</hi> was richly rewarded, and had beſtowed upon him large dominions and lands, yea this Prince himſelf had beſtowed upon him the moſt rich and faire Dominion of <hi>Monchatz,</hi> and other preſents: But to paſſe by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:155133:4"/>
all theſe things, yet contrary to all Divine and Humane right, his faith, troth, corporall oath, and his own bonds and obligations (wherein He more then once bound Himſelfe to Us and Our Crowne) He hath entred with others in an agreement and league, as well to the great prejudice and dammage to His own Countrymen and Hungarian Nation, as to Our and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, yea alſo the Countries of <hi>Tranſylvania:</hi> And firſt againſt Our ſelves, whereas He hath promiſed to invade in a hoſtile manner not onely Our Kingdome of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> but alſo others of Our hereditary Countries and Kingdomes, and to conquer them: And then alſo againſt the Hungarian Nation it ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the riſing of an Inlandiſh Prince and the taking up of armes will produce nothing elſe but their utter ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: Further alſo againſt the Kingdomes Rights, and Priviledges, whereas He hath ſought to include the inhabitants without their knowledge and conſent in his ſecret league and confederacy, and under a pretenſe of their names to make agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: No leſſe alſo to the prejudice of the Country of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania</hi> it ſelf, which by theſe ſecret treaties and agreements with Our and the Crownes enemies He purpoſeth to make it wholy ſubject and hereditary unto Himſelf. For He hath brought the two Crownes <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi> ſo farre, that they have promiſed to protect by force all his Heires and Succeſſours in the Principality of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> albeit long agoe a free ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was promiſed to the <hi>Tranſylvanians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herewith not yet being ſatisfied, the ſaid Prince hath labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all his ſtrength, and conſiderable preſents and ſummes of mony to annull and to make void the peace with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Turkie,</hi> (which hath been hitherto obtained with ſo great charges, paines and ſo much blood, and hitherto alſo with much adoe preſerved) and to move the Turkes to the breaking thereof to the hazard and great dammage of the Kingdome of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and his own Nation. Of all which calamitie, as alſo ſhedding of Chriſtian blood, ruine of the Countrie, hazard of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and other inconveniences, which uſe to riſe and ſpring out of the like inſurrections, there is no other cauſe but the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate affections and the Princes untimely pride and haughtineſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:155133:4"/>As for Us, We proteſt before God and the whole world, that to theſe troubles We have given no cauſe to the Prince, but that We ſeek and deſire nothing elſe, but the preſervation and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of Our Royall Right, (which We have received from God) and protection of Our loyall Subjects, which God hath put to Our truſt, and that to all theſe things We are provoked and forced. Declaring further, and withall aſſuring all Our loving and loyall Subjects and Inhabitants of the Kingdome, that by this taking up of armes, and introduction of a ſuccour of German forces We aime at nothing elſe, but that after dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out of all Our enemies, and laying down of armes, yee be reduced, your former peace and tranquillity, and thereby all States and Peeres of the Kingdome may continue without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution in the enjoying of the Rights and Priviledges.</p>
            <p>And hereupon We graciouſly admoniſh and exhort all our ſaid Kingdomes, Prelates, Earles, Barons, Knights, Gentlemen, Cities, Provinces and Frontier Townes, as alſo the Heyducks and Souldiers, that they will continue firme and ſtedfaſt in the loyalty and obedience which next unto God they owe unto Us and the Kingdome of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and not take part under any title or pretenſe with the ſaid Prince, much leſſe yeeld to his obeyſance, but rather valiantly take armes in hand, oppoſe Him in all places and times, beate Him back, and thereby ſhew unto Us with unwearyed care and with undaunted courage all due obedience. But if there be ſome, that hitherto being compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by force or feare have been fickle in their loyalty, and adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſaid Prince, thoſe we will receive in favour again, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them of no diſloyalty, if they do turne but in time, come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the adverſary party, yeeld again to Our due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſervice, and loyalty, and preſent themſelves to our truſty and well beloved the Right Honourable Count <hi>Nicalao, Eſterhaſi</hi> of <hi>Galantha</hi> Palatine of our above named Kingdome of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> or to our Military Generalls. But thoſe that will not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve neither the Divine Juſtice nor the due obedience towards their King, but go on in their obſtinacy, and boldneſſe, adhere yet further to the Prince not depart from Him, and thus neglect their obedience towards Us, thoſe ſhall be Proclaimed publick
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:155133:5"/>
enemies to their native Country, and that they ſhall fall into our Imperiall diſgrace, and by force of our armes be ſeverely puniſhed according to their demerits. But the States and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Members of the Country of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> with whom We and Our Kingdome of <hi>Hungary</hi> by many treaties of peace and firme leagues are tied faſt one to another, We admoniſh of their faith and troth, and obligations in writing moſt graciouſly, that they will wholly abſtaine from all hoſtility againſt the Kingdome and our loyall ſubjects, and in no way undertake to invade our Countries, but rather keep firme the agreements, and thus not draw upon themſelves a ruinous war, and involve themſelves perhaps meerely in regard of their privat profit, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or hate into the moſt dangerous tempeſt of war, which ſtormes as yet heavily at Chriſtendome. For we perceive, that principally in regard of force and feare of their Prince they are fallen into theſe troubles out of which they may eaſily eſcape a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, if they do turne but without delay, and by laying down of armes returne home to their own and betake themſelves to peace and quietneſſe, and then all their tranſgreſſion and fault ſhall rather be aſcribed to the oppreſſion of their Prince, then to their ſeverall contrary opinions and inclinations.</p>
