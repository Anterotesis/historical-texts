            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere's none I can ſo ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come unto for Shelter to my firſt Labours as Your ſelf, in whoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Juſtice and Equity, are ſo firmly eſtabliſhed, that your
<pb facs="tcp:62234:3"/>
Name prefixed to this Book, is not only able to defend it from Calumny, but alſo to cover a great many Faults may be found in it.</p>
            <p>If I ſhould declare my Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to lay this Work at your Feet, this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> would ſwell to a greater Bulk than the Book it ſelf: For who could enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate all your Endowments, or my own particular Ties in leſs ſpace? Who can ſufficiently declare that profuſeneſs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who, ordinarily, giveth ſome Excellency to one, ſome to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but has Concentrated all in You: Who did ever ſee <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> ſuch <hi>a debonaire Countenance,</hi> ſuch <hi>exact</hi> and <hi>divine proportion</hi> of <hi>Body, Politeneſs</hi> of <hi>Mind,</hi> and <hi>Pleaſantneſs</hi> in <hi>Converſation,</hi> ſo blended and mixed in a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?

ſo that I'm at a ſtand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhould ſay, That they are the Attendants of your Birth, or much rather, ſince they are not to be found in your Equals, I could almoſt think that Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Riches are but the Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of the Reward of ſo great Vertues. Madam, I am hardly reſtrain'd from breaking in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Them, but I fear I ſhould wander in this vaſt <hi>Field</hi> and inextricable <hi>Labyrinth.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I do truly value my ſelf, that I have reſiſted ſo great a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in not launching out into this Ocean, in improving the Subject before me in <hi>Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick.</hi> Yet I cannot ſo entirely moderate my Paſſion, but I muſt ſay, That the great Prudence whereby you have managed and improved That Eſtate, in the Minority of your moſt Noble

Son, is a moſt plain Declaration of the moſt of the other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
            <p>But that I may not offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your Modeſty, I muſt keep off, and tell you in ſhort, That this <hi>Dedication</hi> is the <hi>Basket of Flowers</hi> the poor Man preſenteth his Rich Neighbour with. Yet, worthleſs things receive a value, when they are made the Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Reſpect, Eſteem, and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: Theſe I have in the higheſt degree for You; ſo that if they can add a Price to what they go along with, proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to their own Greatneſs, I can with confidence brag, I here make your Ladyſhip the greateſt Preſent you ever received. This I am ſure, I am under the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt obligation to ſeek all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to acknowledge; and I

               <hi>I</hi> Here preſent you with a <hi>Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the beſt, if not the firſt and only Book yet extant upon the Subject; which, however rational, is rejected by a great many, otherways Learned, Phyſitians, as Empyrical. Neither, is that ſtrange Humour of decrying what we do not uſe, ſtayed there; but the malice of ſome has led them into a great many Perſonal Reflections upon the Learned Author himſelf, as a moſt unlearned Innovator. This imputation
<pb facs="tcp:62234:6"/>
of Novelty, is a terrible Charge amongſt thoſe who judge of Mens Heads, as they do of their Perukes, by the faſhion; and can allow none to be right, but the receiv'd Doctrines. Truth ſcarce yet carried it by Vote any where, at its firſt appearance; new Opinions are always ſuſpected, and uſually oppoſed, without any other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but becauſe they are not already common; and its Detectors diſclaimed againſt, as the greateſt Enemies of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. This way of Calumniating is no newer than the World it ſelf: This has been the Fate of ſuch as have deſerved beſt in all Ages, and never more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than in the laſt; for, tho' there have been a great many things diſcovered in it, ſo eſſential and neceſſary for the uſe of Medicine, that it may be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how it had ſubſiſted before that time; yet, were not the <hi>Engliſh Oracles, Harvey,</hi> viz. <hi>Willis, Lower, Syden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, &amp;c.</hi> freed from the Scourge of an unruly Tongue, and Pens dipt in blackeſt Satyr. So, we may the leſs admire that Libels, as unjuſt, are brought againſt this firſt, tho' moſt exact Eſſay of curing Infants Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62234:6"/>As the Trial and Examination of Truth, and not any Antick Faſhion, muſt give it price, though it be not yet current by the Publick Stamp: So ſhall this Treatiſe be found intirely rational, if they will but adjuſt it to their own Rule. For are not there here, <hi>Cauſes Procatartick, Antecedent,</hi> and <hi>Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi> deſcribed from the ſureſt Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations? Has not he begun with Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the firſt <hi>Motion</hi> in the <hi>Ovum,</hi> and obſerved the Nature and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its very Spring? Neither has he left in diſguiſe, but clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, what external Injuries they can ſuſtain; yea, he hath moſt accuratly enquired into the <hi>Nature</hi> of their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> it ſelf, and hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced all the Maladies that can be ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thereupon, from the moſt ſolid and firm Principles of the beſt Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>And, therefore, that Calumny is moſt malicious, when they traduce him as a Rejecter of the uſe of Philoſophy, h. e. beſt informed Reaſon, in Medicine; and that he ſhould teach how to become Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians by practiſing. This indeed, is the way of ſome impudent Murtherers;
<pb facs="tcp:62234:7"/>
yet all that he ſays, is, <hi>That Practice is the Standard of our right Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> while, in the mean time, he doth very well know it to be ſimply impoſſible, that one juſt Obſervation can be made, when the underſtanding is not ſufficiently poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by neceſſary Philoſophy; <hi>Experience</hi> being very <hi>deceitful.</hi> So when in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places of his Book, he doth inveigh againſt, and declare the uſeleſneſs of that, which was ordinarily brought for the Introducing, and handing in, of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine; he doth poſitively ſpeak of thoſe which are fitted to the frisking Spirits of Young Men, but which never had place but in the Brains of their Inventers.</p>
            <p>Yea, he doth almoſt in plain Terms aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, what that is he thinketh abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requiſite for poliſhing and preparing the Minds of Men, for becoming faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful obſervers of the Effects of Natural O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations? by the ſeveral Appeals he doth make, through the whole book, unto Experiment. As if he had moſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared the great uſe of the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Philoſophy for explaining <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena's</hi> in Medicine; which, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, ſhould be no hard task to prove,
<pb facs="tcp:62234:7"/>
if the Ingenious and immortal Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi> had loft any thing debatable upon this ſubject, and the world were not utterly ſatisfied of the great advances Philoſophy hath made in that School more than in any other.</p>
            <p>Whatever be the truth of this: It is moſt certain that the contrivers of theſe <hi>fanciful Philoſophies</hi> have got their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and knowledge this way, whatever be the dreſs they have put theirs into. This might moſt eaſily be demonſtrated from the great uſe <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> made of the Works of his Anceſtors, eſpecially of thoſe of <hi>Ocellus Lucanus,</hi> though he handed them down unto Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as his own. So, he and his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in this Reformation, fixing their Thoughts only on Words, and the end of their Contemplations and Reaſonings, about little more than Sounds; the reſult of all, was nothing but Noiſe and wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling about Sounds, without convincing or bettering a Man's <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding: Which the Ingenious and moſt Famous <hi>Des Cartes</hi> has exerciſed in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and ſtoutly aſſerted our liberty in Diſquiſition, againſt that Tyrant of Men's
<pb facs="tcp:62234:8"/>
Minds; for which no Generation ſhall ever mention him without due Praiſe.</p>
            <p>Yet, his Followers have very much endeavoured to bring the World back into that Slavery and Bondage, their Maſter had but lately freed it from; whilſt they ſet up a clear Deduction of all Truths from their Maſters <hi>Principle;</hi> as if all that boundleſs Extent were the natural and undoubted Poſſeſſion of their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, wherein there is nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from its Deciſion, or that eſcapes its Comprehenſion. They do not remember how much their Maſter was, and they are, obliged to <hi>Experimental Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</hi> His <hi>Meditations</hi> are a new dreſs of the moſt Learned Lord <hi>Verulam,</hi> his <hi>Novum Organum;</hi> being his <hi>Dubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is to be read in the <hi>31ſt. Aphor.</hi> of that Book, where he ſaith, <hi>That a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs is to be made from the firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; becauſe,</hi> as he ſaith in the diſtribution of that Work, <hi>there is a twofold fault of our Senſes, they,</hi> ſc. <hi>either altogether forſake, or deceive us: for there are a great many things, which our Senſes,</hi> &amp;c. His <hi>Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> were before that time termed <hi>Idols,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62234:8"/>
by the Learned <hi>Bacon;</hi> and the Advice of <hi>fixing upon ſome general Truth,</hi> by which we may more clearly make Diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition into her more retired Receſſes, given by that moſt ingenious <hi>Gentleman;</hi> who, tho well knowing the Infinity of ſuch <hi>Maxims,</hi> upon the ground of Aſſent, at firſt hearing and underſtanding the <hi>Terms;</hi> yet could never ſuſpect that any could carry the Matter ſo high, as to fix upon any one as the firſt; neither is the Proof of <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> becauſe of <hi>Thought,</hi> at all ſuch; except we alſo know the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and relation of <hi>Thinking,</hi> and <hi>Being,</hi> which he perhaps had cleared, if he had not been afraid of falling into that other general Truth and innate Idea (if there be any ſuch) that it is impoſſible for the ſame thing to be, and not to be.</p>
            <p>This, then, being the whole <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Spring</hi> of his Meditations; we may moſt juſtly ſay, That they are nothing elſe but Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> reviv'd. And that his natural Philoſophy is nothing but a dexterous Application of his inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Principles to the common and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Operations of Nature, will be moſt clear; if we do recollect, where, in the

Fourth Book of his Principles of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, being now deſtitute and run out in his own Learning, he doth ingenuouſly confeſs, <hi>That he can aſſert nothing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively of theſe Phaenomena's</hi> not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had <hi>ſufficient Trial and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And as the Ancients did caſt ſuch things as they could not explain by their beloved <hi>Four Qualities,</hi> into that vaſt Catalogue of ſuch as are <hi>Occult;</hi> ſo the ingenious <hi>Des Cartes</hi> did diſpatch a great many Difficulties with his as unconceivable <hi>Diſpoſitions and certain ways of Doing.</hi> Neither has <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> and his Followers been more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in ſuppreſſing thoſe Ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, that, as the moſt Learned Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> ſaith in the <hi>282</hi> p. of his <hi>3d.</hi> Book, about the encreaſe of <hi>Sciences, After the faſhion of the</hi> Ottoman <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, they thought they could not ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reign, unleſs their Brethren were Aſſaſſinated;</hi> than the Followers of that Famous Man to ſuppreſs, contrary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to their Master's firſt Deſign, every way of explaining <hi>Phaenomena's</hi> but their own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62234:9"/>This Contagion ſtoppeth not here, but has diffuſed it ſelf ſo much into Medicine, that now, there can be no Learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, <hi>but who doth reaſon his Diſeaſes from theſe three Principles, h. e.</hi> from the <hi>different Efforts and Operations of the Matter of the firſt, Globules of the ſecond, and that of the third Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But whether my moſt Learned Author has juſt reaſon to ſubſcribe to thoſe, or keep by his own Philoſophy, ſhall appear from the following Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: As,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> From this uſeleſs and general way of explaining <hi>Phaenomena's,</hi> wherein there's nothing to be found <hi>but empty Sounds, and moſt abſtract Notions.</hi> They call all Diſeaſes <hi>a Confuſed or ill mixture of the Humours,</hi> which in the main is true; but how to ſettle the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinds of Diſeaſes, is ſomewhat hard; and their Cauſe an <hi>obſtruction of Pores,</hi> and ſo (with them) muſt always be thruſt out by Diaphoretick and Sweating Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines: And ſo there is never any uſe for cooling and temperate Medicaments, theſe ſilly and naughty parts of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are ordain'd without any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
<pb facs="tcp:62234:10"/>
and are of no uſe to Man, as the ſtandard of our Religion would inform us: So either there muſt be no ſuch thing in nature as theſe <hi>Remedies,</hi> or the <hi>Scriptures</hi> do cheat us, when they inform us, That <hi>all on this Earth was created for the uſe of Man.</hi> Yea, it might much be doubted (that I may pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their fancy) whither the parts of Matter, arreſted by Pores of a different Figure; theſe Cauſes of Obſtructions, are to be driven. Surely, not outward, leſt they produce a too great extenſion of <hi>Fibres,</hi> and ſo communicate Irregular Motions unto their beloved <hi>Glandula,</hi> and ſo, <hi>create ſome grievous Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Soul,</hi> h. e. <hi>Pain.</hi> Neither inward, being they have not yet ſeen the neceſſity for theſe Wedges, to force their Return, which, elſe, they could eaſily have ſupplied us with.

            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> From the bad Succeſs their greateſt Authors have had in practice, not to name any, being it is well known to any that have been in their Country; yea, whatever Parade they make in their <hi>Theory,</hi> their Practice is nothing diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that of the Ancients; and
<pb facs="tcp:62234:10"/>
their Preſcriptions are moſt implicitely tranſcribed, yea ſometime when they do flatly oppoſe thoſe Views they eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their <hi>Theory.</hi>

            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> From the ſmall Progreſs <hi>Phyſick</hi> has made under its Conqueſt. For what Advances have they made merely, or for the moſt part, by their <hi>Philoſophy?</hi> Is not the ſpacious Field of the <hi>Materia Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica</hi> the ſame, for them, as it was left by <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> and <hi>Bauhinus;</hi> though the Riſe and Beginning of this Philoſophy has been in a time when the great <hi>Secrets</hi> in Anatomy have been diſcloſed; which ſome, moſt ridiculouſly apply to the great Advantages that have accrued to the World by this; as if it had been the <hi>Clew</hi> of <hi>Ariadne,</hi> that led into the vaſt <hi>Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> of <hi>Anatomy,</hi> and of a great many more that did then appear, by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſcrutiny of Men at that time.</p>
            <p>So that he may ſay of Medicine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering its growth under the <hi>Carteſian,</hi> or other <hi>fanciful Philoſophy,</hi> what the Learned <hi>Verulam</hi> ſaid, upon another occaſion, of the Mechanicks in his days, <hi>That they were come to a greater heighth in the Shops, where Men were
<pb facs="tcp:62234:11"/>
Armed with Tools, than they had come in the Schools of Mathematicians.</hi> That Medicine has made better advances in the School of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> than in all the reſt; and it may juſtly have the Character, being the Conſequences are as diſmal, that the moſt Famous <hi>Bacon</hi> giveth of the <hi>Peripatetick Philoſophy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might demonſtrate here, for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Defence, the great Advantages <hi>Phyſick</hi> hath, being treated after this manner, and ſo run through all the paſt Ages until <hi>Hiſtory</hi> ſhould give us no more help; if the treating of this particular would not ſwell this <hi>Preface</hi> into a big <hi>Volume.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> ſhall not for-eſtall you with any Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the moſt conſiderable Remarks of this Book, leſt I ſhould be obliged to range it into this Epiſtle; and a very little patience will be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer them all.</p>
            <p>And now having anſwered, at as great length as this place will allow, the ſeveral Cavils that have been brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Book: 'Tis now fallen to my own ſhare, that I give ſome account
<pb facs="tcp:62234:11"/>
of my ſelf in this <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> and that I who have been Vindicating another, may need ſome excuſe for my ſelf. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this pitiful Humour of excuſing is large worſe than the fault, and maketh a Man become unpardonable for doing any thing, they are ſenſible doth need Vindication, when at the ſame time they may leave undone, that which they make Apology for. Yet, that I may not flatter my ſelf that I can eſcape Cenſure more than better Writers, and my moſt Learned Author; <hi>I</hi> ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my Deſign, that, at leaſt, they may not be utterly unmannerly, and give us the lie in Things I poſitively o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>And. <hi>1.</hi> 'Tis no affectation to be in Print, which no Man, that would keep free of Publick Malice, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; beſide how mean a thing it is to be a Tranſlator, though a work only ſuitable to my Years.</p>
            <p>All my Ambition is, that I have catch'd held of this occaſion, to defend Truth,
<pb facs="tcp:62234:12"/>
and my Learned Author from unjuſt Calumnies.</p>
            <p>I have put it in an Engliſh Dreſs, not only that the rude and unlearned may ſee in this Mirrour (my Author's Book) what the <hi>Art of Phyſick</hi> is, and how unfit it is to be practiſed by the Ignorant and unskilful, who preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly venture on the Lives of others; and turn <hi>Mountebanks</hi> with a few Receipts, without the leaſt conſidering the moſt profound Principles of this Art; or ſearching into the Nature of Diſeaſes their ſeveral Motions, and different Symptoms. But eſpecially, that Women and Illiterate People, with whom theſe <hi>Phyſicians</hi> have interpoſed their Scandalizing Authority, may be taught, from the ſolid Reaſonings and the Anſwerableneſs to the Standard he hath ſet up, to be more afraid of ſuch, as of <hi>Hogboblins,</hi> as do moſt endeavour the preſervation of their and their Infants health, by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of the moſt Famous and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Sydenham,</hi> and of my Author, put in practice as the different Exigences, which are only known to the Skilful, do require.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62234:12"/>But, alſo, the Learned may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that the World had very much advanced in knowledge, if the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of ingenious and induſtrious Men had not been much cumbred with the Learned, but Frivolous uſe of uncouth, affected, or unintelligible Terms, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into Sciences, and there made an Art of, to that degree, that the Art of Medicine, has not been able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a ſatisfying Tryal, until the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Labours of ſome late Authors have broke in upon this <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and <hi>Ignorance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>I</hi> hope our thus diſcovering this and other parts of <hi>Phyſick</hi> in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of every Goſſip it ſo far from putting edged Tools into the Hands of Children, and teaching Men to play too much with their own and others Healths, that it may be a way to put a ſtop to the Infinite Miſchiefs and frequent Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are daily committed.</p>
            <p>Only, now, I muſt make Apology to my Author, though unacquainted,
<pb facs="tcp:62234:13"/>
for making uſe of his Book upon that Deſign; to whom only <hi>I</hi> can anſwer, that it is the fitteſt, upon many accounts, for ſo Publick a Service. And as he, in the cloſe of this Book, leaveth allways to others the ſame power of judging he aſſumed to himſelf: ſo I hope he doth not, either, reſtrict this Maxim in <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> for I take him to be ſo candid and juſt a Man, that he doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Publick but what he allowes in others; and, therefore, I preſume, he cannot be diſſatisfied, being he did travel in the ſame kind of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, h. e. he Tranſlated <hi>Monſieur de Bleyny de la verole,</hi> upon the ſame Deſign, I do his <hi>de morbis.</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <head>An Exact ENQUIRY Into, and Cure of the Acute Diſeaſes OF INFANTS.</head>
            <p>WHEN but laſt <hi>Summer</hi> I had diſcourſed the moſt skilful and accompliſhed Phyſician, Mr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> about the frequent Succeſs I have had in the Cure of the moſt dangerous Diſeaſes of Infants:</p>
            <p>That very Learned Man did ſeriouſly inquire what method I did take in ſo lame (that I may ſay no more) and ſo defective an Affair, of which the moſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62234:16"/>
famed Phyſicians have had ſo ſmall knowledge. Before him, then, did I moſt willingly expoſe that way, which of all pleaſed me moſt, and which he, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tryal, did not only not diſprove, but confirming it by his own experience, and declaring it moſt uſeful to others, did moſt earneſtly deſire me, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to the World. By the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion then of ſo Learned a Man, I take my Pen, and to my power, do conſult the Health of my Country.</p>
            <p>I know in how unfrequented, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known a Path I am to walk, ſince Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and eſpecially ſick Infants offer nothing for a clear Diagnoſtick, but what we can collect from their moaning Complaints, &amp; their uncertain Idiom of frowardneſs; wherefore, very many Phyſicians of the beſt Vogue, have often declared to my ſelf, what unwilling Viſits they made to Sick, but eſpecially New born Children; hoping little from theſe Notices for the unridling of their Maladies. No doubt, we ſhould as diligently inquire after a perfect Cure of Childrens Diſeaſes, as of any other thing that may ſeem wanting in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62234:16"/>
neither do rich men, who do deſire, or would preſerve the Health of the Heirs of their vaſt Properties and Poſſeſſions, truſt much to this; but all Parents who with an invincible Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do as eagerly maintain the Health of their Young ones as their own. Wherefore, if I ſhall give ſome ſmall light, which advanced by the poliſhed wit of other men, that may render this rude and imperfect Work more abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and exact, I ſhall not repent me of my Undertaking, but ſhall take it in very good part.</p>
            <p>Who therefore will diligently pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Symptoms of the Youngeſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, which are moſt evident, or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall ſeriouſly reflect upon their delicate Conſtitution, and moſt ſimple Diet, ſhall find this not ſo difficult a Task, as he formerly conceived. For I do not doubt to aſſert the Diſeaſes of that Age generally to be but very few, and only to differ in degree; yea, that the Cure of Infants is far more eaſie and ſafe, than that of Men and Women.</p>
            <p>As of all Ages, that of old People is with very much ado changed to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62234:17"/>
becauſe of the dryneſs and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and almoſt flinty temper of all their Solid Parts; ſo without doubt, the Younger, becauſe of their delicate and mucilaginous Tenderneſs, are apt to receive any alteration imaginable. For theſe Parts of an Old Man are dry and wither'd, which in Infants are moſt humid, <hi>viz.</hi> their Bones, Membranes, Ligaments, Arteries, Veins, Nerves, and the very muſculous Fleſh: Sith that even the Bones of Infants may be more properly termed Cartilages; and now being they do abound with ſo much natural and acquired moiſture, that their Bodies are perfectly ſoft and flexible, that temperament and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is very juſtly ſaid to be the moſt humid.</p>
            <p>And as the conſtitution of Children is moſt humid, ſo I dare not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all their Diſeaſes to be of one kind, and to be produced from one and the ſame cauſe; and that the Maladies of the however different parts of the Body, whether they be the uppermoſt or nethermoſt, as the Stomach, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, Lungs, Head or Nerves, are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62234:17"/>
variouſly and moſt affected, are of the ſame Nature, under divers and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Names.</p>
            <p>In which aſſertion, that I may not ſeem raſhly to maintain a Paradox, you may hear <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelf in his Book of Winds or Vapours, ſpeaking of one and the ſame Univerſal Cauſe of Diſeaſes. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>The Riſe of all Diſeaſes is one and the ſame. The place only maketh the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. VVherefore, Diſeaſes ſeem to have nothing of Relation, becauſe of the diverſity of their places; when, tho, there is but one Species, and the ſame Cauſe of all Diſeaſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, if we ſhall conſider the nature of the Moiſture of Children, we ſhall not find it poſſible to degenerate into any defect or putridneſs, but that which is acid. For with whatſoever Diſeaſe they are affected, however named by the Authors; ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could I find wanting Excrements of a very ſour ſmell, and an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of tart and acid Belchings, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the beginning. But alſo, almoſt all Liquors that do tend to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62234:18"/>
do naturally contract an acor or ſharpneſs. Yea, Milk it ſelf, the proper Food of that tender Age, if keeped for ſome time, becometh ſour, and doth, coagulate upon the Fire, without the addition of any other Acid. Moreover, all the Symptoms of Childrens Diſeaſes do juſtly reckon their beginning from an Acid.</p>
            <p>With all which, let us conſider the weak temperament and the infirm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of their Blood, ſo that the Spirits that lodge therein, have not yet attained ſo great maſtery as to diſcharge their Functions and Offices, or to ſettle by their own Force or Activity, any Irregular Motions of the Humours proceeding from any inward or external Cauſe. For that Vital Liquor, as Stum, before it be duly fermented, doth eaſily contract a preternatural Acor and Tartneſs; tho it may eaſily be redreſſed by timeous and artificial Help.</p>
            <p>By an Infant I do not only in a more ſtrict ſenſe underſtand, with <hi>Galen,</hi> a Child of one, two or three months, but in a larger (as commonly) a Child
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62234:18"/>
more advanced in Age, even to four Years; from which to 14 he is a Boy. And being confirmed by multiplyed experience, and Reaſon it ſelf ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no leſs, I do firmly aſſert, that the younger the ſick Child or Boy is, that his cure is ſo much the more eaſie. For any Impreſſion whether good or bad, is ſooner received by a ſoft than a hard Body; though it be more laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if once it be impreſſed upon the hard: So Children, do eaſily fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Diſeaſes, and are very eaſily reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their Health, if they be not ignorantly and unskilfully treated.</p>
            <p>The Diagnoſtick of Childrens Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, cannot ſo much be collected from their own Relation, neither from the touching of their Pulſe, or from a more curious Tryal of their Urine, as from the Anſwers of the Nurſes and Women that are their conſtant At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants. The Women know, if they have been troubled with Loathings, and Vomitings, and how long; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Food or Milk that was caſt up, was curdled; whether untimeous Weeping, Watching, and Diſquiet,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62234:19"/>
give any Notices of Colick Pains; whether they be affected with acid Belchings, or the Hick up, or a Cough doth appear; whether their Belly hath kept a due courſe, and if their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements be white, green, or filled with Bile. They know, if their Infants have had extraordinary drouth, and ſo be Feveriſh, or if their mouths be full of Thruſhes, which do much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their Sucking. Being enquired, they can inform you, if epileptick Spaſms have ſeized their ender Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, with the ſeveral Concomitants of time and ſeverity, or whether their preſent Sickneſs be treiſted with their breeding of Teeth; or laſtly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any thing conſiderable, whether that be a ſwelling of their Belly, or of any other part, either Wheels or Puſhes, or the Jaundice, or Roſe do appear. The other Symptoms, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, do more belong and apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to ſubtil Speculation than Practice.</p>
            <p>But the frequent Complaint of an uncertain Diagnoſtick, has more its riſe from the prepoſterous and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62234:19"/>
way of curing, than from any want of Symptoms. For under this Mask and Vail Phyſicians do willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloak and conceal their Ignorance and Miſtakes. Neither can I conceive upon what account Almighty God who governeth and provideth for all things, who diſpoſeth of every thing in ſo good order, and who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the very Beaſts, and to Inſects, of all theſe the moſt vile, an innate and ſufficient ſagacity for preſerving themſelves; ſhould reſtrain his bounty from communicating it ſelf in that manner to the Children of Men.</p>
            <p>But the Pulſes of Children are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, or upon every little Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do become ſo ſwift and frequent, that they always ſeem ſomewhat Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh. Moreover, they are for the moſt part, ſo chagreen and froward, that not keeping their Wreſt one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſame poſture, do not ſuffer their Pulſe to be touched. Laſtly, there are ſo many things that do accelerate or otherways change their Pulſes, that Sentiments taken thence
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62234:20"/>
ſhould prove very uncertain, if no altogether falſe.</p>
            <p>Their Urine, when in perfect Health, is moſt thick; ſo that any too curious Perſon, unacquainted with this, could pronounce them labouring under ſome grievous Diſtemper, though at that minute, they do enjoy moſt proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Health. The Urine of Infants is always mixed with their Excrements in their Cloaths, ſo that it doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerve for the ſcalding and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coriating of their Thighs, than for the profound and deep enquiry of the Diviner.</p>
            <p>But that we may the better ſearch into their Diſeaſes, we muſt not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely neglect the Notices that may be gotten from the foregoing or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catarctick Cauſe; which are to be taken from the conſideration of the Diſpoſition of their Parents about the time of Conception; or from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon that Nouriſhment which was then tranſmitted into them, either by the Navel, Pores of the Fleſh, or of the Skin, which are then moſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, while they are in the Womb,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62234:20"/>
and but yet beginning to be, and exiſt.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denyed that there are ſuch diſeaſes as are derived from one or both of the Parents unto their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: Who can doubt, but that the <hi>Gout, Epilepſie, Stone, Conſumption,</hi> &amp;c. Have deſcended from Father to Son, when whole Families of the ſame Blood have ended their lives in the ſame kind of Diſeaſe. The prolifick Seed doth ſo firmly communicate to the <hi>Foetus</hi> a diſpoſition to Diſeaſes, which is ſo natural, and groweth ſo much with their years, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be rooted out with any pains or induſtry. And I think that hereditary Diſeaſes are never more frequently communicated, than from the Mother in the time of her big Belly. For <hi>Teeming Women</hi> are obnoxious to a thouſand Faults and Errors in their Diet; they are expoſed to a thouſand Accidents, with which either being affrighted or otherways wronged, do derive indelible and uneffaceable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries upon their Children. For how abſurd are the longings of Women
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62234:21"/>
with Child! One cheweth Coals, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Lime, a third Aſhes, and each with the greateſt pleaſure; one eateth raw Fleſhes, the other crude Fiſhes; yea the Appetite of ſome hath been ſo depraved, that it could not be ſatisfyed but by ſome Callous and ſolid part from the Body of Man. Moreover, it is daily moſt obvoius, how great the force of their Fancy and Imagination is? How great Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters it hath produced! and what taches of all kinds it hath commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to Infants. And now, if I ſhould reſolve to ſcartle together, from all hands, the wonderful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts and Hiſtories of <hi>Teeming Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> or in plain Engliſh, if under a pretence of vaſt Learning, I ſhould give out my ſelf for a great Reader, I have here a very fair opportunity of digreſſing and expatiating into a very large Field, however beſide the purpoſe; but I chooſe rather to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute my deſign, and endeavour Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, than by idle circumlocutions, and the vain and empty Citations of Authors, to boaſt of learning falſely
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62234:21"/>
ſo called: Always eſteeming that Man more learned, who can produce ſomething that is true, from his own knowledge and Experience, than him, who being very well acquainted with the Tables and Regiſters of Books, can collect and quote, upon occaſions, the Opinions and Sentiments of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, quibling and contending among themſelves.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Mothers who are moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to theſe depraved Appetites, do impreſs and communicate unto their Children ſuch diſeaſes as can only be cured by time And poor Women whoſe beſt Divertiſement and only Antidote againſt Melancholy, is hard labour and conſtant working, whoſe Food is moſt ſlender and ſimple, are ſeldomeſt eſſayed and proved with theſe depravations. But above all, ſuch as are Hyſterick (with whom we may juſtly reckon a great part of your delicate Women, who ſpend the moſt of their time in Dreſſing and Deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and do languiſh and decay with idleneſs, whoſe lazy and torpid Blood waxeth Acid and Tart, after the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62234:22"/>
ſame manner that ſtanding Waters do corrupt) do moſt certainly Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to their Infants ſuch Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Diſeaſes with their firſt life. <hi>Being an ill Raven</hi> (as the Proverb is) <hi>an ill Egg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongſt the reſt of the Creatures the innate goodneſs of the <hi>Kind,</hi> is moſt ſurely derived upon their young, partly becauſe of their ſimple Dyet, and partly, but more eſpecially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Male ſacredly obſerving the Laws of Nature, never copulateth with his Female, when his inſtinct (however informed) inditeth her teeming. But Man (whoſe lofty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath taught him to deſpiſe the Brutes) almoſt more ſalacious than a <hi>Buck-Goat,</hi> not knowing how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain and bridle his Luſt, importun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Mate from her firſt Conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing until the hour of Birth. Hence it is that ſtrong and Healthy Men do ſo frequently beget weak and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letudinary Children. This is the Reaſon why Old Men having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed (by the benign favour and help of Nature) the Stage and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62234:22"/>
of their immoderate Embraces, do beget of their Decayed and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Seed, more plump and healthy Children than the ſtrongeſt and moſt keen Youth.</p>
            <p>Thus having conſidered the proca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarctick cauſe of their Diſeaſes, which do moſtly depend upon the condition of the Parents whilſt they are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; eſpecially of the Mother, in the time of her Big Belly: We will now come nigher, and inquire into the more immediate Cauſes of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies, which may be reduced to theſe four Articles.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To their catching Cold.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To the too thick Milk of the Nurſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To their over ſoon eating Fleſhes.</p>
            <p>And 4. To the mad and impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent fondneſs of Mothers, and many Nurſes who do often permit their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to ſip up Wine and other ſtrong and Spirituous Liquors.</p>
            <p>And, 1. Cold, eſpecially from the night Air, to which they are moſt ſubject, doth very often make
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62234:23"/>
way for theſe Fevers, with which Infants are ſo frequently affected. Sith that they come naked from the Womb, not being cloathed by Nature as all other creatures are; Reaſon or, rather, Nature, deſtitute of her own help, doth inſtantly ſuggeſt the neceſſity of wrapping them up into warm Cloaths. Moreover, the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of the Air, and the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al viciſſitudes of Heat and Cold, do plainly advertiſe us, how great our care ſhould be in the warding off its Injuries. For the more tender and delicate the Temperament and Conſtitution of any, even of the moſt adult is, the more are they ſubject unto impreſſes and inconveniences from the Air. But the ſtrength and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Infants are of all the moſt tender and infirm; and unleſs there be great care taken for warm and convenient, not fine, ſplendid and ſumptuous Cloaths eſpecially for ſuch as are deſcended of honeſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, they cannot long eſchew theſe Diſeaſes, which are the ordinary attendants and conſequents of night
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62234:23"/>
Air. Yea, an exact care for conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Apparel (whatever ſome ſtrong men may deny) is ſo abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary for every age, that ordinarily the moſt weak and valetudinary Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (for as much as I could ever obſerve) do live longer, than the moſt robuſt and ſtrong Men; which can be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to nothing elſe, than the great care of the one, and ſupine negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the other for convenient and warm Cloathing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The too thick Milk of the Nurſe. For if ſhe be a lover of Wine or any other ſtrong and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Liquors, her Milk is ſo warm'd and on a ſudden inflamed, that fire it ſelf only paſſeth her Breaſts, for her ſucking Infant; but if ſhe more wantonly entertain the untimely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of her Husband, her month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Viſits are renewed by their Coppula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ſo her Milk Corrupteth and groweth ſoure and the matter for the Milk being otherwiſe diverted; the Milk it ſelf doth gradually diminiſh, and the lean Child for ſome time
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62234:24"/>
troubled with unconvenient Food, is ſo often killed.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, If ſhe be hyſterick <hi>h. e.</hi> of a more tender and delicate Conſtitution, however Chaſte and ſober ſhe may be, yet her Milk doth degenerate and Naturally turneth thick. In how great danger then are Sucking In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants! upon how Inconſtant and Slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery a plan doth the Health of theſe Innocent Children Siſt! It's this, and ſome other Cauſes, which I ſhall juſt now recount, that are the frequent occaſions why we hear ſo often the ſound of the Paſſing Bells of the Villages about <hi>London,</hi> for ſome one Child that is undeſervedly Atoning and Expiating the faults and miſtakes of its Nurſe; and now ending it<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſcarce well begun Life, having met with ſome unchaſt Intemperate or froward, and diſhoneſt Nurſe.</p>
            <p>But alſo from the foregoing Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes doth depend, a remark which a <hi>Divine</hi> of very good Credit and intire Fame, Rector of the Pariſh of <hi>Haies,</hi> twelve miles from <hi>London,</hi> did make, when he told me with great
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62234:24"/>
Grief, how his Pariſh which is very large, and of great extent, well Peopled, and ſeated in a moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and wholſom Air was upon his coming to that place filled with Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infants; yet in the ſpace of one year he was aſſiſtant at the burying of them all (if you do except two, and his own only Son; whom, being yet very weak, he did not unadviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly commit unto my Care, from his Birth.) Yea, he was witneſs that ſame Year to the Interring of the ſame Number which had been twice ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in a City, perhaps amongſt the greateſt in the World, yet brought to an untimely end by the fault of the Mercenary Nurſes.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the thickneſs of Milk, whatever be its cauſe, cannot but produce a great many inconveniences of ſundry kinds; being that the Bodies of Infants, ſhould, of all, be the moſt fluid, and theſe ſmalleſt conduits which are ordained for tranſmitting of the Chyle, ſhould always be kept open: and laſtly, being that this moſt unnatural thickneſs of Food is moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62234:25"/>
to that moſt fluid Conſtitution of Infants, and doth give occaſion to all kinds of Obſtructions in the firſt Paſſages.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To their over ſoon eating, if not more properly, devouring and ſwallowing down, of fleſhes. For it's moſt admirable that Mothers are not in a fear of killing their Infants, with ſo diſagreeing and improper Food; whom, though they love ſo exceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they ſeem mad in that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For who could ſeriouſly think that fleſh, ſo ſolid and compact a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, can be at all agreeable with theſe tender Infants, who as yet have got no teeth, at leaſt not ſtrong and firm enough, for the chewing of fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. What man of the leaſt judgment can aſſert the Riot and exceſs of the moſt manly and robuſt Age any way convenient with one, that is ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and moſt ſimple, and whoſe ſtrength is moſt infirm.</p>
            <p>It's certain, that convenient Diet is not to be neglected in any part of our time, but becauſe the Temperament and Conſtitution of Young Ones do th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:62234:25"/>
ſo eaſily ſuſtain Injuries upon that ſcore; neither have they force e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ward off Diſeaſes from that hand: therefore there ſhould be greater care taken for the preventing theſe errours and miſtakes. For a cropful of fleſhes too early and untimely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, is a moſt fruitful mother of Crudities, which are almoſt inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from this gormandizing Age. Crude and indigeſted food doth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily produce that corruption of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; from which not only worms are bred, but alſo theſe various, moſt grievous, and moſt irregular Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, whereby Infants are waſted and do decay, do proceed and have their riſe.</p>
            <p>By the way, I muſt obſerve, that the Crudities of Infants are, over and above, daily encreaſed and accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted becauſe that almoſt all Nurſes do repoſe their Infants for ſleep pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after Meat of whatever kind.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To their ſipping up of Wine and other ſtrong and ſpirituous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors imprudently permitted and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. And this cauſe, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62234:26"/>
is only referrible to the fooliſh indulgency of Mothers. Doubtleſs, they do ſuppoſe, that theſe things, which they reckon good and pleaſant to themſelves, and which do free their hearts from care, cannot be diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their Infants. As if for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth one Shoe were fitting for every Foot! Truly, theſe very good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do not conſider, how hard and firm their Hides, and how ſoft and tender the thin Skin of theſe young ones are; they do not remember that one man's Meat (as people ſpeak) is another's Poyſon. Laſtly, they entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forget how their craving Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite is ſcarcely quieted with the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Meats, and how hardly their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants do digeſt Milk and Panado.</p>
            <p>But the nigher that any come to Old Age the more do Wines become agreeable with them. Being, the languiſhing Heat of Old Men doth want a ſupply from volatile Spirits, which may be had in great abundance from Wine, both for the encreaſe, as alſo for the preſervation of their natural Warmth. Wherefore Wine
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62234:26"/>
is moſt hurtful and inconvenient for the Nature and Conſtitution of Infants, being it is the moſt different and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from that of old men; for their very weak Nerves are moſt eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed with it, and their tender Bodies are either colliquated by degrees, or ſuddenly caſt into Fevers with the ſubtile flame and heat of Wine.</p>
            <p>There are ſome who would allow Wine to Infants, becauſe of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely eating of fleſh. For that they think, that Wine, even in that Age, doth much advance and further the Concoction and Fermentation of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, to which, no doubt, theſe young Ravens are very ſubject. But I ſhall not ſo much here debate, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one miſtake ſhould cure another, or both be eſchewed, as I ſhall offer to the impartial conſideration of any man, who may compare the Children of poorer People who have a ſimple and ſober Diet, and thoſe of the rich who have all things in plenty and exceſs.</p>
            <p>Truly, all kinds of Wine and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous Liquors more liberally
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62234:27"/>
drunk, do not only deſtroy the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Ferment of the Stomach of Children, debauch the Appetite, burn up its Coats and wrinkle them as Parchment over much dried by the fire; but alſo (which is moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in this caſe) do exceedingly injure the Nervous Coat, by which all the Nerves of the Body are weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and the Animal Spirits driven into confuſion. The Wine which of all leaſt wrongeth that tender Age, is that which is White; in as much as it was reputed cold by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, though not abſolutely ſo, but in reſpect of all other Wines, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be red, yellow or of a Fallow colour. Yet <hi>Galen</hi> ſtrictly diſcharged Children the uſe of every Wine.</p>
            <p>All the Cauſes antecedent or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate of Children's Diſeaſes, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver many they really are, or be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may juſtly be reſolved into this one immediate cauſe, <hi>ſcil.</hi> a very active and prevailing Acid.</p>
            <p>The Hiſtory, then, of the more grievous Diſeaſes, wherewith Infants
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62234:27"/>
are moſtly affected, is, as followeth.</p>
            <p>Their ſtomach whatever be the firſt Cauſe, is always affected with an Acid Diſtemper, whence, their Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is reduced, not into that homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous Subſtance of Chyle, but into a Poſſet. This inequal condition of the Chyle and Nouriſhment, begot likewiſe from too much Acidity, doth chiefly produce Loathing, Vomiting and ſour Belchings. But if this Diſtemper be protracted, and of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er continuance, they turn pale by degrees, and their diſcolour'd Face is tinged with ſomewhat of a yellow or green Colour. Then doth their Belly ſwell with Wind, and Flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Eruptions are carried upward. In the mean while one or two red puſtles (a moſt certain ſign of too much Acidity) do appear upon their skin, upon ſome upper part of their body, ſometimes, <hi>ſc.</hi> upon both cheeks ſometimes upon their chin, ſometimes upon their Fore-head, or upon their Neck, though ſometimes lower, and the Infant becometh daily worſe. But he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo breatheth high, and that with a kind
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62234:28"/>
of ſhoring; with which ſymptom he is always affected (eſpecially if the Child be plump) when his Diſeaſe has got into the Category of ſuch as are Acute.</p>
            <p>Moreover, he is often troubled with a flight, dry Cough, though ſometimes it is ſtrangling and ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative: with a dry Cough, becauſe of the ſharpneſs and Acrimony of the Humours that continually prickle the moſt ſenſible Branches of the Wind-pipe; but the choaking doth proceed from the abundance of Serous and Watry Humours, that ſo fill up and burthen the ſmall Veſicles of the lungs, that it cannot be caſt off and diſcharged. But alſo, they being endued with a great debility and weakneſs of Nerves, and a ſuperlative ſoftneſs and delicacy of Conſtitution, they are not able to ſubſiſt with that violent trouble of Coughing, but do ſuccumb under that unnatural and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive motion of their Breaſt, and their face is blackiſh as that of ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led people.</p>
            <p>But, if this coagulated or poſſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Food, doth fall from their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62234:28"/>
into the Inteſtines (as frequently it doth) then Gripes or Colick-pains, greeniſh Excrements, and very often, moſt dangerous Flixes do enſue. And while this Tragedy is in acting in the lower Ventricle, theſe great Pains muſt be attended with more Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, and therefore, do introduce Fevers, which, it not kindly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd and dexterouſly managed do cut ſhort the days of a great many Infants; or if the pains being not ſo violent, but, perhaps, ſurrendring to whatſoever an unſkilful Cure, yet doth it terminate into a Bigg belly, the moſt convenient thing in Nature for producing the Rickets or Kings-evil. A certain ſort of tremulous Mucilage or Gelly (the immediate Origine of Worms) which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times whitiſh, though ſometimes of a grey and yellow Colour mixed with Green, is naturally, but oftner by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments dexterouſly and skilfully adminiſtred, purged off with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements. They often rub their Noſe, not only when they are troubled with Worms (as Women commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive)
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62234:29"/>
but in every Fever which hath its riſe from a corruption of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; for any ſharp Humours carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upward, do affect the thin and ſenſible Membranes of the Noſtrils, either of young or old, in Acute or Chronick Diſeaſes. The afore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gripes do continually produce watching, diſquiet and moaning, which the Nurſe doth as often endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to allay, by giving it her Breaſt, that there may be ſome ſhort delay or Truce ſtruck up, for her trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome buſineſs and employ. But if the Nurſe be oppreſſed with Poverty at home, and therefore be ſometimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to leave her Infant diſcharging his Complaints in the ſenſeleſs Air; or being merely mercenary (as moſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſhe is) and not compaſſionating her weeping Infant, it is frequently troubled with ſome one kind of rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for many years. Moreover, its Milk or Food (while theſe Pains do continue) never duly digeſting but turning Acid, is poſſeted, ſo by little and little it becometh Feveriſh; his drougth is intended, his Joynts turn
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62234:29"/>
flaccid, and ſo the tender Infant grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth daily weak and infirm. Upon the cloſe of all this ſickneſs, Convulſive motions and Spaſms do ſeize upon the Members of the Feeble Infant; and when there is no more force and ſtrength in their Nerves for actuating the Muſcles of the Heart, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding the Blood (by the Laws of Circulation) into the Arteries, doth caſt up the White of its Eyes to the Heavens, the proper Seat of unvio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Innocency, and endeth untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly its ſhort life, before it hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the miſeries of living.</p>
            <p>If they become ſick about the time of their breeding Teeth; they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with a great many of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Symptoms, and Thruſhes; Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Mouth, of a firy hotneſs (a ſort of white Scurf) which do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten begin immediately after their Birth, and before the growing of their Teeth, though now and then later, yet about this time do moſt prevail, and do ſometimes ſo bliſter their Mouth, that being overſpread, and every where Ulcerated, it cannot let in the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62234:30"/>
Breaſts themſelves, nor a Spoon without the greateſt trouble and aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
            <p>Further, the Mouths of Infants are very often ſo hurt and wounded with Thruſhes, that they cannot weep nor let Tears fall from their Eyes for ſome days; altho' they be tormented with exceeding tenderneſs and intenſe heat of Mouth, with a great many other ſickneſſes that are the ordinary Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of Fevers. And therefore I account that change from their being dumb unto their echoing the Houſe with Cries a very good ſign.</p>
            <p>Boys of greater Age tainted with Feveriſh Symptoms; do for the moſt part complain of their head; which pain is no Diſeaſe of it ſelf, but ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetick and derived from the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and lower parts of the Body.</p>
            <p>That all theſe and the like Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms do immediately proceed from the poſſeting and thickneſs of their Food, eſpecially being greater than can be at all agreeable with the Conſtitution and Nature of Infants, whoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62234:30"/>
and Paſſages ſhould neceſſarily be moſt fluid; and that this poſſeting is oftner produced from ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Acidity than any other cauſe, is moſt evident from our Senſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the way of Cure (which is excellently effectuated by ſuch things as obtund Acidity, and deop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilate or diſſolve Coagulations.)</p>
            <p>The frequent Vomiting of that thick Gelly, and that viſcid and coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Phlegm ſomewhat green, when the ſickneſs has advanced; and their breath which hath a very ſour ſmell, are things moſt evident to our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>That the green Colour of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements is meerly from Acidity mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Bile, will be moſt evident to any who take pleaſure in changing of colours into green with Vinegar and Acid Spirits. Moreover, the ſmell of their green Excrements being always deſigned Acid by the very Nurſes, doth clearly demonſtrate the ſame.</p>
            <p>The exceſſive Gripes and pains in their Belly and Paleneſs of Face do confirm the abundance of Acidity; for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62234:31"/>
ſo ſoon as they are troubled with theſe Pains, they turn pale, though never ſo high colour'd before they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with this Diſtemper; except that ſometimes their Cheeks are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with a pleaſant bluſh, which doth eaſily evaniſh into the wonted paleneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>En paſſant,</hi> I ſhall obſerve that I do by no means hunt or ſue for the honour (if there be any ſuch) of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Author of a new Hypotheſis; neither think I my ſelf obliged, if I have either excogitated or eſtabliſhed one, to collect all ſorts of arguments (as is cuſtomary) though againſt my inclination, for gaining credit to the foreſaid Hypotheſis. Being, the chief thing in Medicine, and which can only be ſerviceable to the health of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, is ſuch a knowledge of Diſeaſes as is both founded upon, and confirmed by Experience and Practice. For the other ways of explaining Phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's however learn'd and ſubtile they may be thought, do rather make a ſhew of an acute Sophiſter, or Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, improperly ſo called, or very
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62234:31"/>
often of a moſt ready wit; but ſhall never proclaim him a truely skilled Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, and a Man excelling in his own Trade. For all theſe gay ſpeculations, which are ſo admir<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d (as Poetical Flaſhes) by the frisking Spirits of young Men, are ſeldom or never to be found but in the Brain and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their <hi>Inventor;</hi> and are never ſo often contrived as by thoſe, who are the moſt unſucceſsful Practitioners. But the ſolid and genuine Ideas of Diſeaſes are never to be acquired, or their truth juſtly to be judged or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of, but by <hi>practice</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p>I know how obnoxious, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not undeſervedly, this my Notion of an Acid, which I ſuppoſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in the moſt remarkable Diſeaſes of Children is to the Cenſure of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent conſiderers Yet neither ſhall I too ſtifly, debate whether all the ſigns of Acidity, which ſubtile Men free of buſineſs and given to quibling an ſtrife can remember, do quadrate and exactly agree with that Notion of an Acid, which I maintain does ſo much abound in the Stomachs of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62234:32"/>
My expectation ſhall be a abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfied (albeit take no great pains in poliſhing and diſplaying that Notion) if I ſhall be ſo happy as at length to demonſtrate a more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and a more certain Method of Curing than hath been hitherto in uſe, and which I freely leave to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of ſuch, as ſhall try the truth of my aſſertions.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, I ſhall not paſs over what <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> without all perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, chief of all Phyſicians, doth declare at large, in his book concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the old Medicine, about the Cauſes of Diſeaſes: that, <hi>viz.</hi> he may more throughly demonſtrate that all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes have not their riſe from the firſt, but ſecond Qualities. His words then <hi>are theſe:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>They (for the moſt famous of the Old Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians) did not think that man was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther injured with what is dry, or moiſt, hot or cold, and that he had no want of any of thoſe. But they eſteemed that moſt apt to injure which was moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in its kind, and was above the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62234:32"/>
Conſtitution of Man, ſo that Nature could not overcome it, and this they endeavour'd to extirpate and remove. But the thing that is ſweeteſt is the moſt potent amongſt things that are ſweet, the bittereſt amongſt bitters, the ſoureſt amongſt things that are ſour, and that of every thing, which is in the higheſt degree. For they did clearly ſee that theſe things were in Man, and that it was theſe that did moſt annoy him. For there is in man both Bitter, and Salt, and Sweet, and Acid, and Auſtere, and Inſipid, and a great many more which have different Faculties according to their ſtrength and abundance: And that they are neither perceived, nor do they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend any Man, when they are duly mixed and adjuſted amongſt themſelves: But ſo ſoon as any of them are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or do appear apart, then are they conſpicuous and do trouble and harm Man. For all theſe meats, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being eaten, do not agree with us, and do deſtroy our health, are either Bitter and not well mixed, on Salt or Acid, or ſome other way intemperate and exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; and therefore do create trouble
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62234:33"/>
and diſorder in the Body. And thereafter <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For it is not as it is Hot, that it hath ſo great power, but as it is Auſtere and Inſipid or othereways doth more or leſs participate of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Qualities. Again, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: men are not Feveriſh meerly becauſe of Heat, neither is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone the cauſe of the Diſeaſe; for Bitter and Hot, and Hot and Acid, and Salt and Hot, and a great many more are one and the ſame; and again, Cold joyn'd with other Powers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>From theſe words, and a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the ſame ſenſe fully explained in the afore-mentioned Book, it is moſt evident, that our heavenly Old Man, that Star of the firſt magnitude, hath ratified, that theſe ſecond Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, <hi>ſc.</hi> Acidity, Bitterneſs, Saltneſs, and the like, are to be conſidered, as the chief Cauſes of Diſeaſes. And therefore I do not doubt to add, that it moſt naturally followeth, that the Cure ſhould mainly be carried on, not ſo much by deſtroying Heat with Cold, as by obtunding and blunting
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62234:33"/>
the Acidity, altering the Bitter, allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Salt, by inciding tough Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and rendring more compact ſuch as are thin, by mitigating thoſe that are harſh, and laſtly, by opening the obſtructed paſſages of the Body, and freeing them of their Stuffing.</p>
            <p>But perhaps, it may be neceſſary, that I do premiſe ſomething in the place of a Prognoſtick (as is uſual) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we do attempt their Cure.</p>
            <p>And truly, the <hi>Prognoſtick,</hi> in my Opinion, doth rather depend upon the method of Cure it ſelf, as that is right, or wrong; as alſo upon the Behaviour of the Nurſe, whether <hi>ſc.</hi> ſhe over-much ſtudieth her own fancy, and be the only wiſe (which, alas! is a moſt ſad conſideration) or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhe be obedient, and doth faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully perform and execute what is commanded her, than from the Diſeaſes of Infants and Children. For their Fevers are very ſlight, neither doth their feveriſh Heat ſo much burn, as it is more properly a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree and advancement of Heat; except when too too curious Art
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62234:34"/>
which truſteth to, and relyeth over much upon theſe fiery and ſpirituous Cordials, is moſt unluckily brought in to their Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Corpulent and fat Infants troubled with Defluxions, and having an open Mould, are moſt ſubject to the Rickets, Chin-Cough, Kings-Evil, and almoſt incurable Thruſhes.</p>
            <p>Lean and Scraggy Children are, of all, the moſt tender and very ſubject to the worſt Fevers, <hi>h. e.</hi> to ſuch as are hotteſt and moſt in cenſed, and moſt inimical to the Nervous Kind.</p>
            <p>Children which are born by Hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, tender and valetudinary Mothers, which delight much in, and do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually devour unripe Fruits, and Sallads while they are with Child; or at that time do long after ſuch things as are Sour and Auſtere; or by thoſe who are Belly-Gods, and meer Slaves to their Stomach; and laſtly, have their Appetite depraved from whatever Cauſes: Theſe, I ſay, do with great difficulty amend of any great Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:62234:34"/>Children that keep open in their Belly, have their Health better than ſuch as are conſtipate.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Summer</hi> are the beſt times for curing of Fevers; but the Harveſt and Winter are not ſo.</p>
            <p>From the middle of <hi>July</hi> to the middle of <hi>September,</hi> theſe epidemick Gripes of Infants are ſo common, (being the annual Heat of the Seaſon, doth entirely exhauſt their ſtrength) that more Infants, affected with theſe, do die in one month, than in other three that are more gentle.</p>
            <p>Convulſions, or at leaſt ſtarting of their Nerves, coming upon Children weakned by ſome one Diſeaſe, or ſomewhat burn'd up with not Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, do bring, all their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and troubles, wherewith they are tormented, unto an end.</p>
            <p>But as to what may appertain to the <hi>Cure of Infants Diſeaſes,</hi> none of theſe Authors (for as much as I know) who have ordinarily publiſhed Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes about thoſe, and a great many more things that belong to the curing of Diſeaſes, do ſeem to have accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62234:35"/>
enough inquired into it. Truly, they have not neglected to deſcribe very diligently a great many Diſeaſes, to rehearſe learnedly their Cauſes and to deliver as well their Diagnoſtick as Prognoſtick Signs. They have all trod the ſame path, and the more Modern (for the moſt part) have moſt implicitely and without further exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation embraced the Aſſertions of their Predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sylvius de le Boe</hi> has wrote the beſt Treatiſe of any that ever I did read on the Diſeaſes of Infants, for he did valiantly maintain an Acid to be their true and general Cauſe, yet he, partly becauſe of his great kindneſs for ſome very Volatile Chymical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, and therefore over warm and ſpirituous, and partly becauſe of his almoſt conſtant uſe of Opiates, which he ordered for the youngeſt Infants (ſo that he was characteriz'd and diſtinguiſhed by the name of the Opiate Doctor) did ſhake, if not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally deſtroy by his Practice, what he had in a great deal, muſt learnedly eſtabliſhed in his Theory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:62234:35"/>If we therefore, do deſire to lay any ſure Foundation for the curing of Infants Diſeaſes; we ſhould chiefly eye their natural tenderneſs and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And we ſhould make ſuch a choice of Medicaments as may be moſt convenient for theſe tender ones. For the more gentle and ſafe theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies are which we adminiſter, the event ſhall the more certainly anſwer our expectation. And truly, the uſe of great and generous Medicaments (commonly ſo call'd) hath never any place in the curing the Diſeaſes of Infants. What avails the continual burning of Fires, for the extracting the Powers and ſtrength of Minerals, when their Bodies are ſo eaſily alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? Prithee, what natural Harmony can there be betwixt th' almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable hardneſs of Metals and the waxy Softneſs of the Conſtitution of Infants? Or how can their weak Ap<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62234:36"/>
Truly, even as their food is moſt ſimple, ſo, in all reaſon, ought their Medicaments to be: not much recede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from their Natural State, and very free of too too laborious Art.</p>
            <p>Being, then, that Acidity is the chief cauſe of all theſe Diſeaſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with this tender age is affected, the whole Artifice of the Cure is hinged upon the defeating of the Acid.

who deſignedly did expoſe in his <hi>Monitory Schedule,</hi> that was Printed three years ago, his Method for ſtaving off and driving away that Epidemick Fever, which ſo much rageth at this time. And therefore, he has merited ſo much by this, as I think, no Age (ſo long as the art of Medicine ſhall flouriſh) can paſs by his Name in ſilence: Who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe did not doubt to detect with a ſublime and Maſculine Spirit the hurtful and deadly miſchief of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreticks over-thwartly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly uſed not only in Forreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, but amongſt our ſelves. He hath inculcated before, in his Works Printed long ago, the great uſe of Purgatives for the Baſtard Inflammation of the Lungs (a Diſeaſe very riſe and frequent amongſt us) and a great many more; and, in the Poſtſcript, added to the end of all his Works he did place the cure of that which he called the <hi>Winter Fever</hi> entirely in Purging. Truly the ardent Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of that Man, now almoſt ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and being moſt ſickly and valetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,

            <p>It hath been my conſtant cuſtom, theſe laſt ſeven Years to enjoyn Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Fevers of Children and the youngeſt Infants, according to the preſcript of that commended Method, altho; I did ſet it at nought for theſe People of full Age: And neither can I expreſs how much it did anſwer my expectation and deſign.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, when at firſt I did ſeriouſly read th' afore mentioned <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule, I had as great joy and gladneſs of Spirit, as if I had received ſome ſignal favour from God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I was eaſily perſwaded moſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesfully to try that method of Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of People of full Age, who had found before the moſt deſired event of it in the Feavers of young ones.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:62234:38"/>But the <hi>firſt Indication</hi> in the Cure of the Fevers of Infants, is to <hi>prepare</hi> the <hi>Acid</hi> aright. And it ſhall become moſt evident, that Acids muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be prepared, before they can be purged off with advantage, if we will but a little conſider the nature of an Acid: If <hi>viz.</hi> we ſhall reflect upon its great power of Coagulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Poſſeting; if, as the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſe of Obſtructions, which do ariſe from it; if the natural tendency of all Liquors, if you do except the moſt Spirituous, into an Acid; if the great trouble that Phyſicians meet with in the Curing of theſe people, whoſe Bodies do abound with Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; and, above all, if we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thoſe <hi>Gripes</hi> which attend the purging of theſe Bodies, that abound with Acidity, without preparation.</p>
            <p>I know that this ſaying, <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humours,</hi> may be read amongſt <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> great many Authors. And their deſign was, that the enſuing Purgative might have the better event. They did intend to attenuate groſs humors, mitigate hot ones, to open the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62234:39"/>
Paſſages, or to force theſe by Diaphoreticks through the Pores of the Skin. But they muſtered up againſt theſe, I know not what great train of Syrups, Simple diſtill'd Waters and a great many ſuch trifles, which were of no uſe for the deſigned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring or altering of the Body. And the time which ſhould have been ſpent, in ſubjugating the acute Diſeaſe, was ſquander'd away in idleneſs, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, if not worſe.</p>
            <p>But, I think, this whatever <hi>preparation</hi> had its riſe, from that common, but not throughly underſtood Aphoriſme of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> §. 1. N. 12. <hi>Things Concocted, not Crude, are to be medicated.</hi> And I do believe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the continual wreſting of this great Canon into Senſes very ſtrange and forreign to the purpoſe, is the Cauſe, why ſo many famous Phyſicians in the by-paſt Ages have ſo little drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the benefit and advantage of purging in continued Fevers. For indeed the firſt beginnings of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers (and eſpecially after the ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are confin'd to a warm Bed)
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62234:39"/>
do very often give moſt evident ſigns, of Crudity; the aſſiſtant Phyſicians, however happy Practitioners they be upon other occaſions, for the moſt part do inſtantly betake themſelves to Diaphoreticks as their only refuge, and they are as much affrightned at the very naming and mentioning of Purging, as the <hi>Fooliſh Nurſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither am I ignorant, that ſome Authors have had long Diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Purging in Feavers, as almoſt in all other Diſeaſes; but if I may ſpeak my mind in few words, they have rather deſigned, with many words, to fill up volumes, to amuſe the Minds of their Readers, and to ſhew their great Learning, than ei the to illuſtrate or determine the Truth. <hi>Sydenham</hi> the great Ornament and Blazing Star of this Age, having a more than ordinary Maſculine Spirit, and a moſt ſublime Underſtanding, hath made good, <hi>h. e.</hi> hath more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compleated by his Practice and manifold Reaſonings that Affair, in which the other Authors have truly cheated and couzen'd the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:62234:40"/>The preparation of Humours by Alexipharmacks and Sudorificks in Fevers, did more further their Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, than Concoction. Truly, if at any rate they muſt be ſaid to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, yet no other thing, but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Death, while they do moſt certainly procure Frenzies, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and a great many moſt deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Symptoms, by forcing up theſe Crudities from the loweſt parts of the Body into the Head.</p>
            <p>If in the beginning of Feavers (whether they be Eſſential or Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomatick) we ſhall delay, and put off till to morrow, theſe neceſſary Evacuations in the expectation of the lingring Concoction, how ſoon doth that too irrrevocable and golden opportunity paſs away? The only time, wherein the beginning of the enſuing Cure was to be made, wherein there was ſufficient ſtrength, and in which alone there can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by Evacuations, yet is ſpent in the Adminiſtration of Cordials and the vain and uncertain trial of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62234:40"/>
Fever-vanquiſhing Medicaments of the Chymiſts; and the Patient juſt now ſtrong, endeth his days furious and mad. Moreover, I aſſert, that notwithſtanding the blind prejudice of men, Evacuations duly made, do more reduce crude Urine to their deſired Concoction, and the Patient unto his Health, than any thing yet known to man.</p>
            <p>The preparation then (of which I ſpeak, is not to be eſſayed with ſweating Medicaments, properly ſo called, <hi>h. e.</hi> ſuch as warm the Body, which upon no account are agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with tender Infants, or Children, but on the contrary, are moſt hurtful. Sith, the moſt temperate things ſhall moſt ſecurely abſorbe the prevailing Acidity, by little and little they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate Ebullitions, and become the moſt ſafe and powerful Anodynes. Theſe are Crabs Eyes and Claws, Oyſter ſhells, of Wilks, Cuttle-bone, Egg-ſhells, Chalk, Coral, Coraline, Pearls, the Mother of Pearls, both the Bezoars, burn'd Harts-horn,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62234:41"/>
burn'd Ivory, the Bone of a Hart's-heart, the Shavings of Hart-horn, of the Unicorn's-horn, Bole Armenick, ſealed Earth, Blood-ſtone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Compounds, the Powder of Crabs Claws compounded, the Goack-ſtone, and the Powders for making the Confection of Hyacinth, take place.</p>
            <p>Before all, I muſt obſerve, leſt the moſt neceſſary liberality of Phyſicians to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the poor ſhould be interrupted, that theſe precious Medicaments brought from afar out of the <hi>Indies</hi> (for as much as I could obſerve) have no more pleaſant and benign effect, than thoſe of a leſſer value, and which the wiſe Providence of God hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſupplyed for the manifold uſes of mankind.</p>
            <p>And therefore I cannot recommend the Magiſteries of any precious Stone, however they be praiſed by a great many. Surely, they have changed their, whatever, native Power, into ſuch as is very Foreign. And which,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62234:41"/>
before were moſt convenient for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbing the Acid, but being now neither ſweet nor ſour, are only made uſeleſs by too curious Art.</p>
            <p>Of deſign, have I not mention'd the boaſting Accounts of Volatile Salts, whether they be Spirituous or Oleous, not of the Bezoard Mineral, lunar or ſolar; nor of the Spirit of Sal-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack or Hart's-horn; yet the uſe of theſe Spirits is not to be intirely laid aſide, even for theſe young ones: Becauſe, they do excellently abſorb Acidity, but are moſt dexterouſly to be adminiſtred, becauſe of the great Heat that attendeth them. Upon this ſcore, your lixivial Salts, the hot Cordial Waters, as the Compound-Paeony-Water, the Plague-Water, Aqua Coeleſtis, Mirabilis, the ſtrong Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon-Water, and the like, do fall much ſhort of their wonted Fame, unleſs they be mixed with others, that are more temperate, in ſo very ſmall a Quantity, that their burning Heat doth become altogether unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible to the Taſte. For theſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62234:42"/>
Medicaments that overheat the Body; whatever be their Fame or Ineſtimable Value, though they ſhould moſt impudently promiſe immortality it ſelf; yet will they eaſily conſume the Bodies of young ones, and by degrees diſperſe their natural Heat, or turn it to that which is Feaveriſh, and laſtly become as uſeleſs for that tender Age, as Milk and Panadoe, for quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the craving Stomach of a Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. For which Reaſons, <hi>Galen</hi> did moſt ſtraitly bar Children from the uſe of his Treacle, however juſtly prepar'd, which tho' he ſo highly eſteemed, that he thought it an All-heal and Univerſal Remedy.</p>
            <p>That the foregoing temperate Powders do abſorbe Acidity, is a thing ſo well known, that it doth need no proof. And that they are the moſt ſafe, moſt certain and never-failing Anodynes in the Gripes of Children, ſhall be evinced by giving them in a more liberal than the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Doſe, <hi>h. e.</hi> in a ſufficient quantity for attaining the deſigned
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62234:42"/>
end. Moreover, I do boldly aſſert, that the mentioned Powders dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly adminiſtred, do, with the ſame certainty that we know that the effects of Rhubarb are purgative, allay and aſſuage all the Pain, and Diſquiet of Infants from whatever Cauſe, except there be no hope leſt from whatever Remedies, becauſe of ſome great Defect of the chief parts.</p>
            <p>If in any violent Inflammation, we ſhould let ſix Ounces of Blood, and if twenty, at leaſt, were requiſite, why ſhould we accuſe Blood-letting as uſeleſs in that Diſeaſe, when the too ſpare Adminiſtration of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is only to be blamed. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if one or two Ounces of the foregoing Powders, were requiſite for the allaying of theſe paint, wherewith Infants are affected, what great ſucceſs could we expect from the imperfect uſe of one or two Drams, when at the ſame time, in Ounce is neceſſary? An exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Medicaments is the ſlender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, if not the meaneſt accompliſhment of a good and skilful Phyſitian.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:62234:43"/>The right uſe of Medicaments for ſatisfying the deſigns of curing, the adjuſting both the kind and quantity of Medicaments to the particular Conſtitution of the Patient, from a quaint Reflection upon the nature of the preſent Diſeaſe; the exquiſite knowledg of the Conſtitution, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of people of full Age, <hi>h. e.</hi> whether it be Sanguine or Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; and whether the Feaver doth moſtly affect the Blood, or whether Spirits be wanting and their ſtrength weakned by that buſtle and trouble; and laſtly, the right knowledge of appointing Diet, are all more requiſite to make a good Phyſician, than the moſt numerous Proviſion of Medicinal Receipts, whence ever Collected. And if that be not true, the Apothecary being moſt Learned in Receipts will eaſily excel the moſt Learned Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, and his pratling Servant be equal to his Maſter; and alſo a Nurſe, or at leaſt, the babling and Cup. Goſſip Women being enriched with Books
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62234:43"/>
of Receipts preſerved from Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhall carry the Prize and Glory from the moſt Learned Phyſitian and the Apothecary, howſoever converſant in the Preſcriptions of Phyſitians.</p>
            <p>But that we may to our purpoſe, I uſe to help an Infant of a Year old, that is feaveriſh or tormented with Gripes (as it is for the moſt part) with theſe ſorts of Medicaments.</p>
            <p>℞ of the compound Powder of Crabs-Claws, of Pearls prepared, of each <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i. mix all, and make a Powder to be divided into ſix equal parts.</p>

Let the Powders be given in a ſpoonful of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Julep, drinking another After all.</p>

            <p>But if the Infant be troubled with a Cough, the mentioned Powders are to be taken more ſparingly; in lieu of which, he may take half a ſpoonful of a thin Lohoch or Electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</p>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62234:45"/>
The Oyl of ſweet Almonds, is alſo very proper, if it doth agree with the taſte of the Infant. Likewiſe vive Sulphur, or the Flowers of Brimſtone (having a wonderful virtue in drying, penetrating, and diſcuſſing Humours ſtuff'd up in any part of the Body) mixed with ſuch things as abſorbe Acidity, are very uſeful for groſs and phlegmatick Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Neither hath Sulphur any hurtful or deleterious Faculty (as <hi>Crato</hi> and ſome other Learned Men did unjuſtly ſuſpect) but is of a moſt preſervative and expulſory Virtue, which is moſt oppoſite to Corruption of Humours.</p>
            <p>The frequency of the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of theſe Powders cannot be determin'd, but are to be reiterated accordingly as the Symptoms are more gentle or violent. This only I ſhall reſume, that all the Pains, Diſquiet, and Watchings of Infants, are as certainly aſſuaged with teſtaceous Medicaments, as the Pains and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of older people are eaſed and allayed by Narcoticks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:62234:45"/>But here, any who hath but the leaſt ſmack of Phyſick may object, that the giving of theſe Powders is no new thing. To whom I only do reply, that indeed, the fooliſh, ſpare and niggardly uſe of theſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hath been known too long, and to too too many; but that never any did inculcate either ſo reiterated, or ſo great Doſes of them, nor yet the enſuing neceſſity of purging. There's a known Story (and any man may draw the parallel with ours) of a certain merry Man, who when he had boaſtingly defyed the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders, to fix an Egg upon either of its ends, neither any of them, after a great deal of Trial, could ſee through, or unriddle the Myſtery, he himſelf, breaking a little both ends of the Egg, in a trice removed all their Aſtoniſhment, and at the ſame time made them break forth into laughter. For when it was known, it did become moſt eaſy to the whole Company.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:62234:46"/>I order them to be purged upon the third day, after I am called, unleſs the Small-Pox, Meaſles or Scarlet Feaver do appear, and Infants of one Year after this manner.</p>

            <p>If the ſick Infant be three or four years old, or hath paſſed the hazard of breeding Teeth, and eſpecially if there be any conſiderable ſuſpicion of Worms or Putrefaction of Humours for ſome time contracted, there is nothing better than a Bole of that Powder laſt mentioned, and it may be made with Marmalade of Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or confected Orange Peel, pulpod through a Hair-Scarce.</p>

            <p>I do ſometimes alſo order the following Plaiſter, or the like, to be applyed upon the Navel.</p>
            <p>℞ of the beſt Aloes from <hi>Socotr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i. of the leaves of Savine, of the tops of the leſſer Centaury, of the Flowers of Chamomile made into a Powder ana ℈i. of Venice Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine as much as is ſufficient to make all into a Plaiſter. Spread a little of the Plaiſter <hi>de Cymino</hi> upon its Margine, that it may ſtick faſter to that place.</p>
            <p>Of all Purgatives there are none more innocent, and that are more agreeing with Infants, that the well known and very much uſed Rhubarb, which pleaſantly and ſafely doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Subject matter of the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of theſe tender ones, which doth eaſily purge and ſtrengthen their Stomach and whole Body loaden'd and oppreſſed with vitious Humours, and which, upon that account, doth beſt agree with Infants, Boys, teem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Women, old People and ſuch
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62234:47"/>
as are weak through any Diſeaſe. Truly, Rhubarb doth more juſtly merit the Title of a Hiera or ſacred Medicament, than Aloes, ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly commended by the Ancients and more Modern, which has got the firſt place, and kept for the Baſis of all the Shop Pills; which indeed doth ſometimes deſerve very great Praiſe, upon the account of its remarkable bitterneſs, yet it doth not unjuſtly undergo ſome Tache and Diſhonour, becauſe of its Acrimony, Sharpneſs, and its exceſſive Heat, which it doth communicate to the Body.</p>
            <p>A Powder like the former is, after the operation of ſome gentle Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to be given at night; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after are to be reiterated three or four times, at a convenient ſeaſon, for two days more; and upon the third the Purgative is to be given, the quantity of which may, now, be known by the operation of the former.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being done aright, the moſt grievous Symptoms do ordinarily diſappear; or at leaſt, are
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62234:48"/>
ſo much allayed, that the Patient, who was juſt now in great danger, is exeemed from the leaſt ſuſpition, by better Health.</p>
            <p>The ſame method (under what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Form) of preparing and purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the Humours, may be taken with Children of more years, only Doſes and Quantities of Medicaments are to be diſcreetly changed.</p>
            <p>You muſt obſerve, that the firſt Purge we give to Children in Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, be not only gentle, but alſo of a leſſer Doſe than uſual; and that ſometimes, in caſe of a bound Belly, a very mild Clyſter made of ℥iv. of Cows Milk ſweetned with Sugar, and to which is added a little Salt, is to be injected on the night that immediately precedeth the firſt Purgative.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if the Purgative ſhall prove too weak, it may be ſharpned with ℈i. or two of the Cryſtal <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o Tartar, diſſolved in ſome ſpoonfuls of weak Oat-broth, or the like.</p>
            <p>But you muſt eſpecially take care, that you only uſe pure and well-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62234:48"/>
Cryſtal of Tartar, and not that which is adulterated, and is commonly ſold, and which is little better than crude Tartar it ſelf.</p>
            <p>If any great Sickneſs doth betake an Infant that is fat, plump, and of a very moiſt Conſtitution, which eaſily doth degenerate into an Acid (and eſpecially in Winter) ſo that the ſour Corruption cannot entirely be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by twice Purging after the foregoing manner; then, you muſt perſiſt in the ſame method, until the Sickneſs doth quite evaniſh: But that the ſpace of one or two days muſt be allowed for the taking of theſe Powders, that alter Acidity.</p>
            <p>Neither could I ever obſerve any inconveniency or bad conſequence attend ſo frequent Purging; but the ſtrength that was formerly loſt, did ſeem to be renewed.</p>
            <p>Only, you muſt beware, that in the purging of Infants, upon no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion whatever, you give any Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative that may maſter its ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, I cannot paſs by what <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the greateſt maſter of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62234:49"/>
Phyſick, doth learnedly declare, in his Book about Purging Medicines; but not ſo well underſtood. <hi>Whoever, then, are ſeized with ſtrong Fevers, are not to be purged until the Fever doth remit. If otherwiſe, yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in fourteen days. For their Fleſh and Stomachs, being they are hot, do receive the Medicament, and are not purged; the Feaver encreaſeth, their Colour is ruined, and they have a ſort of Kings-Evil. For when the Bile is chafed and put in motion, the ſick Perſon will neither ſup nor drink, but loaths every thing, and very often dieth. But, if he ſurvive that time, and his Fever doth remit together with the operation of the Purgative, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth. Wherefore, we ought not to give purging Medicines in violent Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. But if any do want them, you may give an infuſion by Clyſter, as often as you liſt. For in that, there is leſs hazard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may obſerve from theſe word of our Maſter: 1. That he doth ſpeak concerning the Fevers of thoſe of full Age, which are uſually great
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62234:49"/>
and moſt ardent, but are not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood of thoſe of Infants and Children, which are naturally gentle, and not ſo eaſily inflam'd. 2. That the purging Medicines in his time were moſt violent, ſtrong and poyſonous, an <hi>Elaterium, Colocynth, Hellebor,</hi> and the like, but the great part of our Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitives that are moſt gentle, yea moſt temperate, if ſome of them be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualy cold, were as unknown to the wiſe men of that Age, as the Antipodes, the new world, or laſtly the art of printing. 3. That <hi>Hippocrates</hi> doth ſpeak of Feavers in their natural ſtate and condition, and as they are left to themſelves, even as his Deſcriptions of epidemick Diſeaſes truly and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately contain it; neither muſt he be underſtood, after what manner the art of the following, eſpecially of the preſent Ages (however things preſent be ill ſpoken of by the Envious) being promoted and made more perfect (which our Poſterity, if I be not in a huge miſtake, will moſt thankfully bring into remembrance) at length hath taught, how to prepare aright,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62234:50"/>
that they may be purged off, and very much allay or totally to overcome their Fury, by liberally blooding ſuch, as are of full Age, upon the day that preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Purging. 4. You muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> doth teach in this place, that if he who is affected with a Fever hath taken a purgative, and, perhaps, doth eſcape the hazard of that day; ſhall inſtantly, <hi>h.e.</hi> at that ſame very time be reſtored to his Health. Which I have often obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be true, and that Feaveriſh Boys have ſhaken off all the Symptoms of their Feavers, after the firſt Purgative hath ended its operation, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the ſpring time or Summer.</p>
            <p>Theſe things then being premiſed. I ſay that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> did judge aright of the deadly effects of Purging Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, as thoſe of his Age, being very ſtrong, were unskilfully given in hot Fevers, not having let blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand: But, we take a ſoone<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and more ſecure method for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them to health, if blood be li<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>berally let of thoſe of full Age, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62234:50"/>
eſpecially if they be of a Sanguine or robuſt conſtitution, upon the day that preceedeth the purging; or if the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of young ones be prepared with teſtaceous Medicaments and ſuch as do blunt the Acid, that the chief cauſe of the Feaver may the better be utterly purged off, than can be, by whatever Cordials or Diaphoreticks.</p>
            <p>But the true and chief reaſon, why purging in Acute Diſeaſes hath been ſo ill thought of, by very learned Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, ſeement to me (quietly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thumb) to be this: becauſe <hi>viz.</hi> they did drive, as people ſpeak, <hi>the plough before the Oxen, h.e.</hi> they did purge before blooding, or at leaſt having no thought of it, where it was moſt requiſite, did raſhly give ſome one of the ſtrongeſt Purgatives.</p>
            <p>Albeit, that any notable Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſubject matter of the Fever <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nto the Lungs, and Chin-coughs, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o adviſe Blood-letting for the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Infants, yet it is moſt evident; that it is not a Remedy naturally conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62234:51"/>
for them, neither is it more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory and unfitting for this moſt tender, then decrepit Old Age. And therefore its help is not to be invoked for all the Diſeaſes of Infants, except in the Chin-coughs, or any other Coughs that do attend and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants of Fevers that do ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begin; and unleſs for grievous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſions, which do ſometime occur. For it is not ſuppoſible that Infants being nouriſhed with thin and ſlender Food, ſhould be affected with a true Plethory, however florid they be They do all abound with Humidity, which is eaſily changed into a Praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Acid, the cauſe of all their Diſeaſes. Neither can I be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that blood-letting can alter and correct an humid Conſtitution, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when it hath already degenerated into Acidity.</p>
            <p>There are ſome who, through a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> obſtinate itch of contradicting, o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> blame and accuſe the uſe of Blood-let<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting even for people of full Age. And theſe are the Through-followers and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62234:51"/>
Diſciples of peaceable <hi>Helmont,</hi> that moſt truſty Friend of the Old Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; theſe happy and fortunate Heirs to ſo great Secrets, of which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Phyſick or the Common-Wealth have been worthy. It's they, <hi>viz.</hi> who have ſucceeded to a not common ſort of Chymiſtry, unknown to all skilled Phyſicians, but which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth wonderful Effects to theſe Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers by the fire.</p>
            <p>All teſtaceous Medicaments do wonderfully dry, and, therefore, are very proper for the curing of theſe Diſeaſes which proceed from too much Humidity, and for theſe Conſtitutions which ſo much abound with it. But the Conſtitution of boys is moſt humid, becauſe it is of all the moſt delicate and ſoft. But they are alſo ſomewhat adſtringent, which is loſt by burning, yet thereby do they aſſume a good deal of Acrimony and Hotneſs, which are moſt evident in Quick-lime, and a great many more Chymical Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But they do alſo moſt power, fully blunt and defeat Acidity, which as naturally attendeth the corruption
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62234:52"/>
of Aqueous Humidity, as Heat doth Fire. Moreover, teſtaceous Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do not at all warm their tender bodies; which conſideration doth ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily induce me top prefer them to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the cure of Infants Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>But there are other things for which I recommend the uſe of Teſtaceous Medicaments for Children. Their Stomach is endued with a devouring and inſatiable ſort of Ferment, which delicate and liquid Food cannot ſtill &amp; quiet for any time: Being it muſt be blunted with Butter which ſwimmeth long upon the upper Orifice of the Stomach, or be nouriſhed with Panado or Pudding, which are not eaſily caſt out of the Ventricle. And I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obſerved ſick children feeble and dull, only becauſe they were nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with too thin and liquid Food. Wherefore, teſtaceous Medicaments are, upon many Accounts, very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the Nature and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Children; neither doth doth that change or alteration made by them, in the Stomach, wear off ſo ſoon as that which is made by Liquid Medicines.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:62234:52"/>That I may ſay nothing of very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fowls, which, when drooping by a Pica or depraved Appetite, have been recovered by Sand caſt amongſt, and ſwallowed down with their Food, as the Poultrey-women do very well know.</p>
            <p>By teſtaceous Medicines, I do not only mean ſtrictly thoſe made of Shells, but Coral alſo, Corallin, both the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoars, and the like, which are known to abſorbe Acidity, and are of the ſame nature, although they be quite of another Origine.</p>
            <p>Theſe Medicaments have been much uſed by Phyſicians, but their uſe, as adjuſted to Children's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, was either altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, or was of very ſmall help and advantage. For their too too ſpare Doſe, wag truly the cauſe, why Phyſicians, in the Watchings and Pains of Infants, fled from theſe ſure and ſafe Remedies, unto Opiats, which are by far the more dangerous, if not hurtful and diametrically oppoſite to their Nature and Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:62234:53"/>And I cannot but relate, how I was once mocked by a very famous Phyſician upon this account: When <hi>viz.</hi> at my deſire he was called for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the cure of a Noble Child, the Heir of very great Poſſeſſions, who was ordinarily entruſted to my care, and at that time was ſick of a moſt dangerous Feaver, and when, he propoſing a Narcotick inſtantly to be given, unexpectedly found me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory to his deſign; <hi>You,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if ſo you be reſolved, do ſeem to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe after a way that's obſolet and out of faſhion;</hi> to whom I replyed; <hi>That I did not, neither would I ever practiſe for Children as is now the cuſtom.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I do as ſurely, yea more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly (unleſs I be entirely decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) and, at leaſt, more ſafely allay all their Gripes, leſſen their Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and aſſwage their Pains, by the fore-going Medicaments, than any can do (however they eſteem Narcoticks) by theſe kind of Remedies, given with the greateſt hazard of their life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:62234:53"/>I know no ſuch mad admirers of Opiats that ever recommended their uſe for the weakeſt Conſtitutions; though ſome, even in this caſe, have covertly tryed their ſtrength, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering, perhaps, the proverb, <hi>that dead Men tell no Tales.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pulſe of Infants is of all the moſt weak, their Conſtitution naturally the moſt tender, and their ſtrength very infirm, I cannot conceive, why any ſhould make choice of uncertain and dangerous Medicaments for the curing of Infants Diſeaſes, when ſafer, yea the moſt ſafe may be as eaſily pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed.</p>
            <p>This alſo I ſhall add, that ſcarce any of their Maladies however tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, did require the leaſt taſting of Narcoticks, properly ſo called, ever ſince I had ſufficient knowledge of the moſt anodyne, yea ſo poriferous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for Infants, of theſe teſtaceous Medicaments; providing, they be given in quantity ſufficient for attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Deſign.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:62234:54"/>But as no Opiats are to be approved of, for Infants Diſeaſes, ſo neither can I recommend any liberal uſe of theſe hot Medicaments, however ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutiferous and cordial they be in their Name. For the word Cordial hath been curiouſly and with abundance of artifice contrived for the ſoothing of all the Gay-women, for the taking of Country-women, who, very often, dwell far from skilful Phyſicians; for good Matrons who, with ſo great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, uſe theſe Cordials for all Diſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in their Eleemoſynary Practice; and laſtly, for pleaſing the ignorant upon all occaſions. For who could expect any evil by the taking of a Cordial? Yet it may be a queſtion amongſt Learned Phyſicians, whether of thoſe who have ended their days by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Death, more have truly died by Diſeaſes or by theſe Cordials. It is moſt certain, that whatever things do encreaſe the Symptoms of the Diſeaſe, augment Drought, make the Tongue dry, or intend the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh Heat, are of all, leaſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62234:54"/>
for, and agreeing with that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Age, that can give no reſiſtance to any Injury that is offer'd unto it. And truly, I have always found ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, that I ſay not deadly, miſtakes attend that hot guiding of Infants, when I could never obſerve the leaſt inconveniency from the frequent uſe of theſe temperate Medicaments.</p>
            <p>But any may object, that Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt of neceſſity be produced by the uſe of theſe hard and almoſt flinty Medicaments, and that theſe things ſhould render their moſt tender Conſtitution, and the moſt ſmall paſſages of their Body very ſubject thereunto.</p>
            <p>But that we may the better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate this Objection, you muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that the genuine Parent of all Obſtructions is an Acid Diſtemper, which Infants do frequently contract from the coldneſs of the Air and the the tenderneſs of their Conſtitution, however delicate and pure their Food be. And therefore, whatever things
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62234:55"/>
do correct, mitigate or blunt this Acid Indiſpoſition, or can diſſolve Coagulations (all which, theſe do without the leaſt addition of Heat) are moſt fit to remove Obſtructions and the great Train of Symptoms, which proceed from that Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Others perhaps will accuſe me, that I do too eaſily paſs by the moſt famous Doctrine of the Criſis; and that I may ſeem to forget the computation of critical Days, ſo nicely inſtituted by the Ancients, and much commended to this day, by ſuch as admire only things that are paſt underſtanding. Therefore, I ſay, being the Criſis is only a ſudden change in the Diſeaſe, either to Health or Death, it doth entirely depend, for as much as I can obſerve, upon the method of Cure (eſpecially in theſe tender ones, of which we ſpeak) and is haſtned or produced by the induſtry or unskilfulneſs of Art. For, being he Cure is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtayed upon general Evacuations duly made, theſe Crudities which are
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62234:55"/>
the cauſe of Fevers, are ſooner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted than at any other time, part of the Morbifick Matter is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately eliminated, and the reſt exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the natural ſtrength, giveth way to Medicaments dexterouſly adminiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But, when the Humours are exagitated, and the Spirits driven to greater confuſion by Diaphoreticks and Cordials ſo called, and the whole ſtreſs left upon Clyſters, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver paſs the groſs Tripes in perfect ſtrength, as the Concoction ſo the Criſis, is too late, if ever to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, after ſo learned and ſo ſolemn a Train of Medicines.</p>
            <p>But laſtly, a Criſis, methinks, is nothing elſe than the laſt effort of Nature, to evacuate with all its power the morbifick Matter by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Paſſages. And that hapneth very often with us by ſweating, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Croſs uſe of warm Guiding. Though very often by <hi>blooding at Noſe, by Stool, by Vomit, and ſometime by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine.</hi> All which, do ſufficiently prove, that Nature her
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62234:56"/>
ſelf, the beſt and wiſeſt Phyſitian, did never deſign or endeavour any other way of judging Fevers, than by timely <hi>Evacuations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are many things variouſly written and maintained by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this Learned Age, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the uſe of Precipitating Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Phyſick, as that all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes wherewith man is affected, might eaſily be over-come, and caſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> off, if we had a perfect knowledge of the proper and ſpecifick Precipitating Medicine fitted to every Diſeaſe. But you muſt obſerve, that we are ſpeaking of the Acute and Feaveriſh Diſtempers of Children, which do quickly determine of their life; and not of thoſe that are laſting, which give greater delay to the Curer, and do more ſafely allow of a curious Tryal of the new Powers of things Again, Precipitation is the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the groſſer parts, which by the ſtrength of a diſſolving Acid do hang imperceptible in any clea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62234:56"/>
being freed of their Bonds, by the help of ſuch things as defeat the Acid. Moreover, the <hi>Crudity,</hi> which we conſtantly ſee in Fevers, is, methinks, the genuine off-ſpring of prevailing Acidity; and the concoction a ſign of its being defeated, and overcome by Nature. And therefore artificial <hi>Purging</hi> bringeth to the ground of the Body theſe Crudities which were carried upward, and ſeemeth more properly than all other Medicaments to precipitate, that at length they may be caſt out by Urine or Stool. But alſo, whatever other kind of Medicaments (tho ſome airy meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical Brains, Philoſophers, as they call themſelves, do think quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) is endued with a Precipitating Faculty, yet ſcarce doth it, in any meaſure, produce that effect, but as it is <hi>Cathartick.</hi> For neither muſt it he thought that Precipitation can ſo eaſily be performed in a Body of divers parts, various Juices and Humours, and of ſo many Paſſages and Windings, as a Juggling Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, by pouring in Liquors of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

ſorts, doth wonderfully change their Colours, or ſo ſoon as he doth make his Precipitations, called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſteries. Being, then, that <hi>Fevers</hi> do aſſault the vital and upper parts, and ſo leave no time for uncertain and dangerous Trials, it becometh <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

by the every cure is (if at all) rendred <hi>Malignant.</hi> For when the Serum, the common Vehicle for carrying the Blood through the Veins and Arteries, is conſumed by untimely Sudorificks, it is no wonder that the groſſer parts of the Blood are interrupted in their motion, and do a little Stagnate; and that thereby, the Pulſe be weakned, and doth become unequal, ſurging, tremulous, crawling, and intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and upon the ſame Account, the Urine be but little &amp; very crude; and laſtly, that <hi>Freckles, Purple Spots,</hi> and ſometime <hi>Peſtilential Blemiſhes,</hi> (the ſundry degrees of a forming or form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Gangreen</hi>) the chief marks of <hi>Malignity</hi> do appear. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, which a little before, was endued with much moiſture and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign warmth, is now dried, burn'd up, and altogether parched, with the exceſſive heat of this warm guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo that thereby, there doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remain a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Lympha,</hi> which is deſigned to bedew the parts, neither can the Blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now thick, and ſtagnating every
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62234:58"/>
where, flow or move longer through the Veſſels to continue the courſe of Circulation for preſerving Life.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall only offer to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of theſe, who will retain and are blindly in love with that unhappy notion of <hi>Malignity</hi> (conſidering that it is a word that ſafely cloaketh the deadly conſequences of their daily ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance) the common practice amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> as I was informed by very honeſt Merchants, unlearned indeed, but truly rational, and moſt natural for the cure of the Plague it ſelf, the greateſt of all <hi>Malignant</hi> Fevers, by the Juice of <hi>Limons</hi> largely drunk in Broath, by conſtant eating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected <hi>Limon Peel,</hi> and by a Drink much uſed amontg hem, called <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,</hi> and in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by nothing elſe than a cool Diet; in as much as <hi>Mithridate,</hi> the Treacle of <hi>Andromac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hus,</hi> the Root of the <hi>Virginia Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonwort,</hi> and the great Train of our hot <hi>Medicaments,</hi> are moſt luckily, all together unknown to, or in very ſmall eſteem with them. Neither then,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62234:58"/>
is it any wonder that that the <hi>Plague</hi> (ſo terrible to an Engliſh Man) doth make no ſo great havock among them, as a gentle Fever in Learned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
            <p>How ſilly and childiſh is it for Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians to call Fevers <hi>Malignant,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>ſmittle</hi> and <hi>contagious.</hi> For, if <hi>Contagion</hi> did neceſſarily indicate or prove the exiſtence of <hi>Malignity,</hi> how evidently ſhould we read the Itch, in the <hi>Category</hi> of <hi>Malign Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</hi> In which, tho neither ſtrength doth fail, is the Appetite loſt, or the Urine or Pulſe differ in any thing from theſe in healthy People; and laſtly, in which the Animal and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Functions are intire. Surely, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which have any great <hi>Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> are not altogether free of <hi>Contagion;</hi> as the <hi>Plague</hi> it ſelf, of which I ſpeak, as the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> as the <hi>Meaſles,</hi> as the <hi>Chin-Cough</hi> of Infants, and other Diſeaſes of that kind, which reckon their Being from intenſe Inflammation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:62234:59"/>But as to what may be ſaid of <hi>Sudorificks</hi> for Fevers. I do not deny, but that either natural or artificial <hi>Sweating</hi> may be of very great uſe in the beginning of Fevers, when the Pores of the Skin are only a cloſing, and when the ſenſible or inſenſible Perſpiration are interrupted. But the <hi>Sudorificks</hi> you are to uſe, ſhould be <hi>temperate,</hi> and not ſuch as create inward Burning. Neither ſhould they be <hi>dry</hi> or ſo ſpirituous as to add Fire to the Flame, but <hi>Liquid</hi> and Culinary, which may ſupply an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of matter for forcing out the Sweat, and may provoke it, not with its eſſential, but outward heat.</p>
            <p>There is one thing very well worth our notice, neither at all beſide the purpoſe, which I cannot paſs by. That <hi>Fever, viz.</hi> which raged laſt year, and whoſe Hiſtory I ſhall juſt now give in few words, was alſo called <hi>Malignant</hi> by ſome Phyſicians, who are very well known by their great uſe of Diaphoreticks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:62234:59"/>A ſort of Fever (with which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever were effected, did moſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of ſlight pains which ſeized all their Joints by courſe, of a pain of their Head, eſpecially of the fore-part, and laſtly of a kind of Giddineſs) was ſo Epidemick from the middle of <hi>May</hi> of this laſt year, for ſome weeks, that I did never obſerve any ſuch, upon whatever account, or in any ſeaſon of the Year. A great many whole Families were affected with that Fever at the ſame time, that ſcarce one of many could eſchew that general Calamity. But the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this ſo Epidemick Fever, did truly ſeem to me to have its Riſe, from the changeableneſs of the ſeaſon of that Year, the ſenſible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the Body, being then ſtopped, and the Pores which were very open, being ſhut up on a ſudden by the exceſſive Heat of ſome days haſtily changed into Cold. This one thing we may obſerve, that never were there ſo many Sick at one time, and never ſo few died. All indeed, that were ſick of this Fever
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62234:60"/>
did recover Health, as well by wrong as right ways of Curing, by Blood-letting, <hi>viz.</hi> by Purging, by <hi>Sudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificks,</hi> by all the Womens Cures, whether they were Culinary or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal, by ſtaying at home for ſome time, by going abroad, by riding or any other Exerciſe, in time of any trouble, and when free of all care, and laſtly, by doing any thing, or not doing. But if any died in this moſt gentle Diſeaſe, they were young men of very hot Conſtitutions, and abus'd with theſe Spirituous Sudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks. The only thing we may yet obſerve upon this Head, is, that we ſhould fear, that the nature of this Fever which was ſo gentle and benign, and which was ſo eaſily defeated as well by improper as healthful Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſhall, perchance, have cruel and deadly effect: Truly, theſe Gay Women and Common Quacks, may expect in vain that deſired Succeſs from their Cordials, and I know not what ſweating Medicines (when another ſeaſon of the year ſhall be very oppoſite to their Cure, and any
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62234:60"/>
Feaver ſhall appear attended with very terrible Symptoms) they ſeem'd to have approved in a moſt gentle Fever and in the Spring, a time much favouring whatever ways of Curing.</p>
            <p>Before we do bring ſome Examples of Cures performed by the benefits of my method, I will adjoyn ſome things that do belong to the moſt ordinary Symptoms of Infants; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the curious, ſuch as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to be found among the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
            <p>Among the many Diſeaſes that do threaten ſore the life of Infants, there is none that produceth ſo many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Symptoms as their laborious and difficult breeding of <hi>Teeth.</hi> The Sickneſs of nine months (which may more juſtly be thought the <hi>Source</hi> of innumerable <hi>Miſeries,</hi> than the womb) doth not expoſe Mothers to greater hazard, than <hi>Breeding-Teeth</hi> doth their Off-ſpring. For, being the Gums of theſe tender Ones are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently inflamed, after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62234:61"/>
as the other parts of the Body of ſuch as are of full Age (whence come theſe moſt ardent Fevers) becauſe the Teeth cannot ariſe from their ſmall holes, we need not wonder, that their tender Bodies are ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted with ſo many moſt grievous Feveriſh Symptoms. From the ſame Fountain do ariſe their <hi>Colick-pains, Watchings, Diſquiet, Flux</hi> or <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation</hi> of the <hi>Belly,</hi> their <hi>Green Vomit</hi> and <hi>Excrements,</hi> the <hi>Thruſhes, Fevers, Convulſions,</hi> and the like; all which do eaſily yield and ſurrender to, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, the ſame method (having always reſpect to their Age and the violence of the Symptoms) of allaying and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperating the Acid, and afterward purging it off; except, that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe ſhall change its nature from one, which by its continuance, giveth time to the cure, into ſuch as is Acute, be very complicat'd and hath takes ſure footing in the beſt parts of the Body, that it cannot be cured; o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> with the firſt Life of the miſerable Infant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:62234:61"/>There is a <hi>Twofold time,</hi> trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to Infants in the <hi>Breeding of Teeth:</hi> the firſt is, when the Tooth eſſayeth to break out of the Jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone; and in which, the outward part of the Gum is circumſcribed with a ſort of white Circle without any Smelling. The other is, when the Tooth becometh bigger and larger continually ſwelleth the Gum, maketh Inflammation, and doth endeavour to break through with all its force. The Chyrurgeons do unskilfully cut the Gums of the Infant, in this firſt effort of <hi>breeding Teeth,</hi> as well as in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that, <hi>viz.</hi> the Teeth may more eaſily break through, ſo the Wound is promiſcuouſly inflicted without any neceſſity, and very often with as little help, when upon the ſecond occaſion (which ſhould be diligently obſerved) it is only requiſite.</p>
            <p>There is ſomething elſe to the ſame purpoſe not unworthy our obſerving. That, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome <hi>Chyrurgions,</hi> when they are ordered to lay open the Swelling Gum, do it with a common
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62234:62"/>
Lancet; which hath ruined a great many. For being a Cicatrix is ſo eaſily induced upon a Wound made by this thin Inſtrument, neither doth there any hole abide, through which the Tooth may break, ſo this opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is altogether uſeleſs, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Remedies are neglected for the time. Phyſitians, therefore, ſhould take care, that this <hi>Inciſion</hi> be made with a more convenient Inſtrument, whether that be a <hi>Pen knife,</hi> or any other, which riſeth in the back like a <hi>Razor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being <hi>Thruſhes</hi> do proceed from the ſharp Vapour of that inward Flame, which doth fret and pinch the tender Skin of their mouth, even as the other inward parts of the Body; we ſhould only make choice of theſe things that do moſt powerfully defeat and blunt this Acrimony. But Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gariſms and Medicines for waſhing the Mouth are of no uſe in this caſe. For Infants can, by no means, waſh their Mouth, unleſs it may be thought to be done accidentally in the ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62234:62"/>
down; becauſe every thing that's given them to waſh with, muſt go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yea, that every Humour which by Coughing, is caſt into their Throat, immediately falleth into their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, if it be not attended with Vomiting. Neither is that ſtuff, whereof Gargariſms are made, ſo intirely innocent, that they can ſafely be given to Children. It's certain, that theſe <hi>Thruſhes</hi> (however they diſturb or hinder their Sucking) ſhall be removed by Teſtaceous and gently purging Medicaments; neither do I ſee, why we ſhould too learnedly uſe ſo great Art for the attaining of that Deſign, when fewer and more ſimple Remedies may have theſe moſt ſafe and excellent Effects.</p>
            <p>But the reaſon, why the ſuperfice of the mouth is ſo convenient for the producing of <hi>Thruſhes,</hi> when no parts elſe of the Body are bliſtred, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame Skin which cloatheth the mouth, is communicated by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Series by the Gullet unto the Stomach. Wherefore, theſe ſharp
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62234:63"/>
Vapours, which do proceed from a preternatural Efferveſcency of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy about the Hypochondres, are carried upward, as from a Caldron, by the vent of the mouth; and do very eaſily communicate their ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh to the membrane of that part. Therefore doth the delicate taſte of the tongue ſo readily diſtinguiſh all reliſhes. Laſtly, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, are Phyſicians, by their look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the <hi>Tongue,</hi> able to judge of the prevailing temperament of the Body.</p>
            <p>The Flux of Infants proceeding from a mixture of Humours falling down into the Inteſtines, or from a ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Bile with an Acid, which is in great abundance in that place, is neither to be arreſted by Aſtringents properly ſo called, or <hi>Narcoticks.</hi> For <hi>Aſtringents,</hi> do cauſe a reflux of theſe ſharp Humours upon the more noble parts; which doth caſt ſuch, as are of the moſt humid and fluid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, into the greateſt danger of their life. <hi>Narcoticks</hi> indeed do allay, for ſome time, the furios
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62234:63"/>
ſwelling of the Humours, that, as often, they may afterward break out, with greater force. Moreover, the delicate ſtrength of theſe young Children, and which is much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Diſeaſe, is ſeldom able to endure the mighty operation of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piats,</hi> but with the greateſt hazard. But ſuch Medicines as do appeaſe that ſharpneſs, the great ſpring of all their trouble, are given with greater ſafety, &amp; are more agreeing with their Conſtitution. Though the uſe of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcordium</hi> and the like, which do conſiſt of both theſe ſorts of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, be in ſuch caſes (where there is no <hi>Fever</hi>) of very great uſe and advantage; yet it is well known, that theſe do not want their danger in the Fevers of Infants: and that <hi>Chalk, Corall, Pearls,</hi> and others of that kind which mitigate theſe unruly Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, without the kindling of new heat, that at length they may be purged off with Rhubarb, are of wonderful uſe for the overcoming of theſe Symptoms, and bringing a more ſafe Relief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:62234:64"/>It is moſt evident, that they are of as great uſe in Vomiting as Fluxes. For ſo long as that which is the trouble lodgeth in the Region of the Stomach, and Acidity doth moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert its power in the firſt Paſſages; theſe Medicines do impart what ſtrength they have, pure and intire unto the Ventricle. Vomits, as the Salt of <hi>Vitriol, Vomiting wine, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick Tartar,</hi> &amp;c. ſeem to ſome, by far, preferable to all other Medicines; but if conſiderations from their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Age, and great feebleneſs have any place in giving of Vomits, and if the eaſie ſolution and purging off of Coagulations can be procured ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually enough, yea, more ſafely by things that offer no violence to Nature, and bring the like into no danger, than by <hi>Vomiting</hi> or <hi>Stupify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicines;</hi> truly a prudent Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician will abſtain from, and abhor all ſuch.</p>
            <p>Neither do they only avail in all <hi>Fluxes,</hi> but for the <hi>Gripes</hi> of Infants, from whatever cauſe; for which,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62234:64"/>
they are not only excellent, but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and <hi>Specifick,</hi> If there be any ſuch; I do not think the <hi>Jeſuits Bark</hi> (the beſt of all the Medicaments of this Age) more <hi>Specifick</hi> for Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Fevers, neither <hi>Opium</hi> (that other famous Medicine) more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to allay <hi>Watching</hi> and <hi>Pains,</hi> that theſe afore-mention'd <hi>Teſtaceous Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines</hi> do the <hi>Gripes</hi> of Infants. For albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, any curious perſon may perhaps find among th'almoſt innumerable Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that do happen, by ſo many Infirmities borrowed from Mothers, in the great variety of Conſtitutions, ſome ſingle inſtance here and there, that may impugn my Hypotheſis, yet, that is to be intirely attributed to the Conſtitution very much depraved, and not to any defect of the ſtrength of the Medicine. It is moſt certain that the <hi>Barks it ſelf,</hi> commended all the World over for a <hi>Specifick,</hi> is not altogether convenient for <hi>Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick</hi> people either affected with an Intermitting or remitting Fever. Yet it is moſt deſervedly eſteemed the beſt of <hi>Specificks</hi> for Diſeaſes of that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62234:65"/>
kind, and eſpecially for thoſe of the firſt.</p>
            <p>Yea, our <hi>Teſtaceous</hi> Medicines, to which if you add a little Caſtoreum, ſhall be found of more innocent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and to have greater force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Convulſions (or Epilepſies, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often improperly, ſo called) either from the decay of ſtrength, or from the ſharpneſs of the morbifick Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, extimulating the Nerves (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have hitherto been thought trifles, and of no value by ſome) than either the <hi>Antepileptick Waters</hi> which warm, very much, theſe tender ones, or the <hi>Volatile Spirits</hi> which, like fire, break through all the parts of their Body, and which very often do produce moſt ardent Heat from a very ſmall beginning. For being, the inward coat of the Stomach is wholly Nervous, and, therefore, the fitter to tranſmit the vertue of the Food and Medicaments into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts of the Body, and being, the Spirits of this, as theſe of the other parts of the Body are irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62234:65"/>
and ſet on irregular motions, I think it moſt neceſſary, that the cure be performed with theſe Remedies, which abſorbe the Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that offends the Nerves, and truly allay the tumult of the Spirits, and induce ſleep without ſtupefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not with ſuch, as make great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Confuſion and encreaſe that Heat which ſo much aboundeth.</p>
            <p>Very many things eſteem'd <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks for Convulſions</hi> (whoſe Names I conceal, being they are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the mouths of all) have been commended as well by the greateſt Authors, as the moſt famous Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners. Yet their Vertues (for as much as I could obſerve) did never anſwer my expectation. In the Convulſive Paroxyſms of Infants, ſeeing they do conſtantly ariſe from the ſharp Matter of the preceding Gripes, that doth vellicate the Nerves, thoſe things which obtund, allay or blunt the Acid without any new heat or warm'th of Body, one thoſe which carry off the Acidity, thus De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62234:66"/>
and deſpoiled of all its Angles, ſhall at length, after all other things tried in vain, be found only of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient force for vanquiſhing this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Symptom.</p>
            <p>I had a great confirmation of this aſſertion, in the Daughter of <hi>James Lowry,</hi> a Girl ſcarce a year old, who was ſeized with the greateſt, the moſt violent, and moſt frequent Convulſions that ever I did ſee, which had diſquieted her Lips, Eyes, Joints, yea and all her Body with very ſmall intermiſſion for many days before I viſited her. She was very pale and of a moſt formidable aſpect, her Belly was conſtipate, and the little that was caſt out was very green. She howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a high voice, for as much as her ſtrength ſeem'd to be caſt down, ſo that ſhe raiſed the compaſſion of the Neighbourhood. During all theſe <hi>Convulſions</hi> and <hi>Colick-pains,</hi> ſhe ſcarce conſumed a ſpoonful of Food, but was ſuſtained by ſome ſort of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial.</hi> I aſſiſted and happily cured this miſerable Infant with no other
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62234:66"/>
Medicaments, but ſome Ounces of <hi>Crabs-eyes,</hi> mixed with <hi>Cryſtal</hi> of <hi>Tartar.</hi> She was conſtrained to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low down a ſcruple or more of this moſt ſimple powder, every hour, in Pennyroyal Water, or the like; after the frequent giving of them, ſhe fell upon ſleep, and had theſe Convulſions much leſſened. I ordered a Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of ſugared and ſalted Milk to be frequently injected; until at length, the <hi>Cryſtal</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> (which doth not only purge very gently, but is alſo, very aperient, if it be taken in ſufficient quantity) had made way for it ſelf down ward. By theſe few and no greater Train of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, was this Infant, ſeemings devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Death, unexpectedly indeed, recovered to perfect Health. But I do not underſtand (that I may quietly ſay ſo) why we ſhould further tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment theſe tender Ones vexed with Convulſions, and deſtroyed with Watching and Diſquiet, with Veſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories applied to their Neck or other Parts, being that kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy ſeemeth more proper and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62234:67"/>
to rouze from ſtupefaction thoſe that are affected with a <hi>Coma.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why may not I add that, ſince I firſt uſed this commended method for the curing of Infants, at my firſt entry I have ſeen many ſeized with Convulſions, and ſome ſo weakn'd with them, that they had no ſtrength to ſwallow down any kind of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament, but that I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of any of theſe tender ones, that, being perfectly cured by the uſe of theſe Powders, ever ſuffered a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Small Pox</hi> and <hi>Maeſles</hi> of Infants, being, very often, a gentle and calm efferveſcency of the Blood, they are not ſo ſick, when neither the aſſiſtance of Phyſitians is deſired, nor the great Skill of the Nurſes, who think ſo well of themſelves, is craved. But when the unruly force of the Blood doth juſtly require the help of the Phyſitian, the <hi>Teſtaceous</hi> Medicaments, ſo frequently ſpoken of, have the ſame effects with <hi>Children,</hi> that Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coticks have with <hi>People</hi> of full Age.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62234:67"/>
But theſe Volatile Spirits, which are, ſo much uſed, the Cordial Waters-<hi>Mithridate,</hi> the Treacle of <hi>Androma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> and the reſt of theſe hot Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Diaphoretick <hi>Remedies,</hi> are chiefly to be eſchewed, which are deſigned to thruſt out, with more haſte than good ſpeed, theſe Puſhes; but which inſtead of being Cordial and Expulſory, as is pretended, do very often change the naturally gentle <hi>Small Pox,</hi> into ſuch as are more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; and do move, diſturb, and turn inward the <hi>Meaſles,</hi> otherwiſe eaſily diſappearing from upon the Superfice of the Skin, introducing deadly Difficulties of breathing and thoaking <hi>Catarrhs;</hi> and laſtly, they ſeem moſt deſigned to inflame the Blood, which is yet but moderately and ſlightly warmed.</p>
            <p>Reflecting upon the nature of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> I have frequently admired, how this hot kind of guiding hath ſo much prevailed, not only among the fooliſh Nurſes, but Phyſitians, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, very learned; being this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is ſo very hot; and, being
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62234:68"/>
all <hi>Suppurating</hi> Medicines, properly ſo called, which are ordinarily applied to any one or more ſwelled parts of the Body, that tend to Suppuration, ſhould be, <hi>by the general conſent of all Phyſitians and Chyrurgeons, very tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; as are the Roots of Marſh-mallows and Lillies, the Leaves of Mallows, Althaea, Bear-foot, the Meals of Lin-ſeed, Foenugreek-ſeed, Wheat; Butter, Fat, Oyl, the Yolk</hi> of an <hi>Egg, Muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, Marrow,</hi> and the like, which are not hot. For hot Remedies either taken inwardly or outwardly applied, are truly diſcuſſing and ratifying, and of a quite contrary nature to the former.

            <p>I could maintain, at more length, this Cauſe, and ſo, extend the limits of this Work beyond meaſure. But I will not longer detain the Reader with Scholaſtick Impertinencies, which are altogether uſeleſs in Practice. I will not not hunt after an Umbrage and Shadow, of more than ordinary Learning by the ſpecious Citations of Authors, cavilling among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and laſtly, I will not ſubtilly undermine the Opinions of other men, that I may triumph over their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and that, upon any account, I may eſtabliſh my own. For I know very well, how hard a task it is to enquire narrowly into the verity and truth of things. I know that he hath come nigheſt to the Truth of any thing, who ſhall be found to have erred leaſt, however men do upon any trifling occaſion let up their Creſts, and aſſume a degree of <hi>perfect Knowledge</hi> in this or another Science, when Men can make no progreſs beyond the natural Limits of their
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62234:69"/>
Weakneſs and Frailty. And truly, the more knowing any Man is than another, the more humbly and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſively doth he demean himſelf. But there ſeemeth to me, to be a certain moderate comprehenſion of things, and bounded with the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Knowledge, diffuſed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees upon every Age, that, <hi>viz.</hi> none may unjuſtly upbraid the other of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. Truly, we have loſt, by the great changes of humane Affairs, very many things which might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate the Memory of ſome former Age. Neither are there wanting in the preſent Age (whatever th'envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous may deny) Diſcoveries that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the beſt Praiſes, which ſhall <hi>Nobilitate</hi> the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> while an <hi>Art,</hi> and hand it down ſo refined, to be ſacredly preſerved by Poſterity.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall give ſome <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of <hi>Infants,</hi> cured by this our method; but not with that deſign that theſe my ſmall and pitiful Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſhould be preferred to all other more learned Methods; for I cannot determine what others of better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

In the mean while, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was affected with a grievous
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62234:70"/>
difficulty of Breathing, which, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, in his ſleep, was moſt ſenſible to By-ſtanders, A Paleneſs did ſeize his Beautiful Face, Drought eſpecially, and violent and burning Heat of Skin, with Tumbling, and continual Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, did oppreſs him.</p>

And by our common Advice, were taken four Ounces of Blood from his Right Arm: Truly, I did propoſe, a more liberal uſe of Pearls, and ſuch things, which allay too much Acidity; and in the mean while a ſpoonful of the Juice of Pennyroyal ſweetned with
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62234:70"/>
Sugar Candy, to be given twice or thrice in one day, and every third day to be gently purged with <hi>Manna;</hi> to which method, as both the moſt ſafe, and as approved by me upon other occaſions, this Gentleman, of ſingular Sincerity, and excelling not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the knowledge of his Profeſſion, but alſo in his good Humor, did eaſily aſſent. And ſo that moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Infant next Heir after his Father, to the moſt Splendid and Auguſt, next to the Royal, Family, of the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> recovered Health (as I did publickly foretell at that time) in ten days time, who, in the Opinion of the other moſt famous Phyſitian, ſeem'd not poſſible to be cured in the ſpace of three Months.</p>
               <p>Moreover (by the Bleſſing of God) I did reſtore to former Health, the ſame moſt Noble Infant, now five Years, old when ſick of a continued Fever, and chiefly complaining of his Head and Belly by courſe, but next being tormented with moſt violent Gripes upon the Region of the <hi>Ilium</hi> (ſo that they were very like to the

After which, a ſtrengthning Julep, deſigned for carrying off the Remains of his Cough, did ſo perfectly cure that weak Infant, that daily he became more healthy, until he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at its Perfection, which he enjoyeth at this time.</p>

I continued in giving theſe Powders thrice every day until the third, upon which I did renew the ſame Purge. After theſe, ſhe was perfectly cured.</p>
               <p>Moreover, I ſhall add here: That as I do eaſily adjudge the Victory to <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> as a <hi>Purgative,</hi> of all, the moſt agreeing with <hi>Infants</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with <hi>Fevers</hi> or any other <hi>Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> ſo neither can there be any thing found that is naturally more unſafe and dangerous than <hi>Aloes,</hi> which is ſo much commended, and which is moſt hurtful (however <hi>Sacred its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi>

And I, if it were my Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, could confirm the truth of this aſſertion, by a very incredible Account of a moſt <hi>Noble Infant</hi> ſcarce yet 4 years old, being affected with a <hi>Lent-fever,</hi> who, in the ſpace of two days, was brought to that paſs, eſpecially by the uſe of <hi>Hiera Picra</hi> in a hot Vehicle as is cuſtomary, that the Taches of his Inteſtines ſuddenly made by it, which <hi>Anatomical Inſpection</hi> did make known, did far exceed all belief.

               <p>THE Daughter of a certain Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, but four years old, was affected in the Summer of the Year 1687. with the moſt violent Fever
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62234:78"/>
that ever I did ſee upon any of that Age; her habit of Body was very lean, her drought inſatiable, the Heat of her skin was ſharper than any of theſe years, ſo that any that touched it, were ſcarce able to endure this inward burning for any time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the mean while the Parotid Glands did torment her, and were a little ſwelled, her cheeks, for the moſt part, were very red; and ſhe did decay in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual anguiſh and diſquiet. It was evening when I did firſt ſee her in this condition. I did inſtantly order for her <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs. of our Powders made a little Expulſory, to be renewed, a little after, in a ſpoonful of Penniroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Water. The ſame thing were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated next Morning, but about two hours after her Mornings Draught, a good deal of blood did run from her Noſe, and her whole Fore-head was livid and ſomewhat ſwoln with much Redneſs here and there, as ſhe had been newly banged with cudgels: A round crimſon colour'd ſpot of two inches breadth did appear under her left Temple; At which being No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62234:78"/>
diſcouraged, but thinking it a very good Omen, I did order her the uſe of thoſe Powders that blunt Acidity for that day, only, they were made leſs expulſory, but upon the next, <hi>h e.</hi> upon the third, after I was called, I did not doubt to give her the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Powder, well ſharpned with the Cryſtal of <hi>Tartar,</hi> altho her Fever, Heat, and Drought were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing abated; by theſe ſhe had five or ſix Stools. Laſtly, this very day did her Fever evaniſh, by the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe had no drought, and the Heat of her Skin was as temperate to the touch, as it is in her beſt health, ſo that the ſmall Infant, aboute even, did cry out, <hi>How well am I now?</hi>

                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:62234:79"/>
her drought was Inſatiable, her Face very pale, only there was ſomewhat of a Green mixed with the wanneſs, ſo often as, being to ſuck, ſhe put her Mouth to the Breſts, as often was ſhe forced to give over, becauſe of a violent <hi>Cough</hi> which did begin at that time; by which Symptom being advertiſed, I did ſuſpect that her <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula</hi> was ſwelled and inflam'd. Moreover, her mouth was very much hurt with <hi>Thruſhes,</hi> that ſhe could never be induced to open it unleſs ſhe was ſome time forced, by ſtopping her noſtrils, to breath, and by that means to receive Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments.

Moreover ſhe could not weep till, after a week, by the conſtant uſe of theſe Medicaments the ſickneſs was much quelled, and the ordinary crying of Infants <hi>did return.</hi> All the ſymptoms did evidently remit after

the operation of the <hi>Second Purgative;</hi> and by the third, the brisk Colour with a moſt pure white did by degrees return to her Face, her Eyes became lively, and at laſt ſhe did enjoy moſt perfect health.</p>

                  <hi>ISaac Pope</hi> being thirteen years of age, was ſo pined away with a Conſumption, by worms (as it proved) that he was much liker a Skeleton than a live Boy: His Face was like that of one raiſed from the Grave, his Eyes hollow; his Noſe ſharp, and his bones only covered with skin: By this Diſeaſe he became ſenſeleſs, and altogether void of reaſon; and ſcarcely could his ratling joynts carry him from one end of the room to another with the ſwiftneſs of a Snail: All his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, whether by Urine, or by
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62234:80"/>
Stool, fell involuntarily in the day time into his Breeches, and in the Night upon the bed; I gave him from 25 grains to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs. of my black Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which I much uſe, Morning and Evening, purging him gently every fourth day. By which he voided a great many worms, and a little after became very plump.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall not grudge to deſcribe the preparation of my Black Mineral, becauſe not to be found in any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that I know, and may be of very god Uſe.</p>
               <p>℞ of Quickſilver four parts, of Flower of Brimſtone three; ſtir all well in a glaſs mortar, until all the globules of the Mercury do utterly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaniſh and the maſs be reduced to a grey Colour, which turneth very black after that 'tis kept ſome time.</p>
               <p>The ordinary way of making the black Mineral is by mixing equal parts of Mercury and flower of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and Burning, until a kind of uſeleſs Earth doth remain, after the Combuſtion, in ofrm of a Powder,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62234:80"/>
which is but half the quantity of the Maſs: whoſe genuine and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vertue is loſt by the fire, or if not, it cannot ſurely enough be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd what its ſtrength is which may be ſaid of a great many other Preparations made by Fire.</p>
               <p>I prefer this way of preparing it, to all other, both becauſe tho given in however ſo great a quantity, and however often, it never exciteth <hi>Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> which cannot be convenient for that tender Age, and is moſt formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to by-ſtanders; as alſo, becauſe it is made up after a <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural way,</hi> without any help from too too curious <hi>Art,</hi> which putteth no value upon any Medicaments, but ſuch as have paſſed the Fire, that thereby they may become purer and more freed from their, I know not what, natural filth; when tho they are very often changed from their beſt ſtate and their excellent natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Vertues, into ſuch as are worſe, more unſafe, and intirely new.

               </p>
               <p>I might adduce a great many more Examples, if I could diſcreetly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon the patience of my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by dwelling longer upon the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>I might renew and deſervedly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of that good and old cuſtom of eaſily preventing a great many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of Infants and Children, by ſafe and known Remedies, which do much reſiſt the corrupting of Humours, and were given every month. Seeing, <hi>viz.</hi> the moſt tender nature of Infants is moſt ſubject to all impreſſions, as well external as internal, and ſeeing Crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Indigeſtion do ſo abound with theſe tender ones, a prudent Phyſician ſhould correct and amend theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and Diſeaſes, which cannot be altogether removed in ſo delicate and weak a Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>I could, at length, debate, whether it were <hi>ſafer</hi> that new-born <hi>Infaents</hi> ſhould raſhly be reſigned, as is cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, to the care of a <hi>Hired Nurſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:62234:81"/>
that Parents, <hi>viz.</hi> at the laſt may hear of the great hazard of their Infants, when they have already ended their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent life through the careleſneſs and fault of Nurſes, or whether they ſhould rather be weaned when firſt born; whether mothers themſelves ſhould become nurſes; or laſtly, whether the nurſe, when neceſſity doth require one, ſhould be maintained at the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Houſes, and by their care be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently kept up from the Embraces of her Husband.</p>
               <p>But it is now high time to remove an Objection as well of ſome Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which are happy Practitioners, as of all thoſe who have moſt diligently enquired into the nature of <hi>ſimples</hi> for the uſe of <hi>Phyſick:</hi> they <hi>ſc.</hi> will blame my <hi>Method</hi> as too ſimple, and not equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with things commonly known, and much wanting that <hi>Variety</hi> of <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criptions</hi> which is ſo very requiſite for a learned Phyſician, and which often over aboundeth amongſt Authors, yea, they will accuſe me, that I am either altogether ignorant of, or have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly ſlighted, the <hi>Chymical Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:62234:82"/>
long ago commended in the Works of almoſt all the Authors.</p>
               <p>Let them, then, remember, that a <hi>Phyſitian</hi> is the <hi>Servant</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and that <hi>Nature</hi> cureth Diſeaſes. Let them complain, that they came naked into the World, that <hi>Nature</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with a few things, and that <hi>Art</hi> ſhould imitate, or rather adumbrate <hi>Nature</hi> as much as is poſſible. They may know, that I think him, who <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth too long or too many Forms of Remedies,</hi> to offend through <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>deceit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> I do more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to underſtand it, than to lay any great ſtreſs upon its Promiſes. I ſhall not mention hong long I lodged with the moſt Famous <hi>Lemery,</hi> the great Honour and Ornament of the <hi>Spagyrick Art,</hi> and of this Age (as to <hi>Chymiſtry</hi>) in his Houſe at <hi>Paris.</hi> And if <hi>Phyſick</hi> not very much abounded with genuine and natural Ways of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, when Chymiſtry not long ago pretended to the chief place in <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,</hi> I doubt it would have afterward ſwoln ſo much with <hi>Chymical Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:62234:82"/>For what end ſhould <hi>Phyſitians</hi> have betaken themſelves unto unknown, unſure, and moſt dangerous things, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thoſe Sanctuaries of Ignorance; unleſs that ſome notable jealouſie had ariſen from things ſo well known, and tried by many? Surely they had not ſnatch'd ſo greedily at the Shadow, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the ſubſtance, if no Charm had appeared in the trembling Light. But I would not raſhly deſpiſe <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> as confined within the bounds of <hi>Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> neither would I have any to extol it un awares as diffuſed beyond the limits of <hi>Phyſick</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very obſervable in how great Poverty, theſe great favourers of <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Preparations,</hi> and the zealous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the old way of curing (that I may ſay nothing of the comon <hi>Chymiſts</hi> &amp; <hi>Quacks,</hi> who adulterate every thing, and make great promiſes without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance) if you except very few, do live, though they do not doubt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe Golden Mountains (as people ſpeak) to the too credulous, ignorant, and covetous. But though it be true, that Riches and Power are not given,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62234:83"/>
to wiſe and knowing Men, and ſuch as are beſt skilled in every Trade, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to their Demerit; yet I think it moſt probable, that <hi>Their</hi> great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty hath moſt its riſe from the hurt and great Bane of their <hi>Medicaments</hi> or famous ſecrets: &amp; that a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them (becauſe of their deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>partaking</hi> or <hi>incorporating</hi> with the <hi>Fire</hi>) are moſt unuſeful for, if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together contrary to the Health of Mankind. For if for the moſt part, they were of any uſe for Men, or if their ſtrength were anſwerable to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, altho they could not enrich this, or the other <hi>Chymiſt;</hi> yet, its moſt ſedulous Artificers (even as an ordinary gain doth always attend the great part of all other careful Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who make profeſſion of any thing for public uſe) could not be ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fruſtrated, in their hopes of getting Riches. If I intended to <hi>adviſe my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Son,</hi> what method he ſhould take to ſcrape together a great abundance, or, at leaſt, a ſufficient Portion of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; by my perſwaſion he ſhould be of great integrity of life, that he ſhould
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62234:83"/>
circumveen no man deceitfully, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he ſhould take pains in coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lyes, whatever kind of Life, or whatſoever ſort of Trade he did deſignedly lead, for encreaſing Riches. And I would no leſs inculcate to him, that this is, of all, the beſt way to live in miſerable Poverty (however the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenings of ſome Crafty Knaves, who have long practiſed falſhood, may ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed for ſome time) not to perfidiouſly over-reach others, to tell lies for truth, and at any rate to act the part of a wicked Impoſtor, or unthrifty Man.</p>
               <p>But that we may return to <hi>Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Preparations:</hi> I cannot but eſteem the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> far more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than thoſe of <hi>Art;</hi> yea, with <hi>Galen,</hi> that they are greater, and do exceed all Commendation; however, they be deſpiſed by ſome, and <hi>Nature</hi> her ſelf accuſed as unactive by <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus.</hi> Wherefore, our moſt divine Old Man doth juſtly ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>That Medicine is beſt practiſed according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that we may come to a cloſe, I would not have ſuch, as do ſo much
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62234:84"/>
eſteem and are delighted with the <hi>Art</hi> we ſpeak of, ſtill ignorant, that ſcarce any <hi>Chymical Preparations</hi> (as its true Sons, if there be any ſuch, have often complained to my ſelf) are to be ſold at this time, which are not fictitious, and adulterated upon the baſe account of Gain.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſome may object, that <hi>Blood-letting</hi> can never be convenient for that tender Age, much leſs to become <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> upon ſome <hi>occaſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I reply, that <hi>Blooding,</hi> even of the Youngeſt Infants, was appointed of old by the command of the <hi>Supream God,</hi> the <hi>Greateſt Phyſitian,</hi> in the Decree of the <hi>Circumciſion;</hi> that great <hi>Hemorrhagies</hi> did often attend it, and which were very difficultly ſtopped, unleſs by exquiſite Remedies prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that end; and yet the <hi>Jewiſh Writers,</hi> which is very obſervable, did boldly aver, That not one Infant of a thouſand was a-miſſing or died untimely, only becauſe that <hi>Blood</hi> was let this way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May the greateſt and beſt God, from whom, as from an unexhauſtible Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62234:84"/>
every good and propitious thing doth flow, upon whoſe favour the happy Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the</hi> Art <hi>of</hi> Phyſick, <hi>more than any other, doth continually depend, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance with his wonted Goodneſs, theſe things which I have written with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Mind, that they may tend to the Publick, which is always to be prefer'd to any private advantage.</hi>
