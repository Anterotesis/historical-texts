            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ABout fourscore Years ago, in a time when there were such Apprehensions of the Papists as now there are, (and howsoever they are now, surely<note place="margin">V. Cambdeni Annales. Anno 1586. <hi>concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> Babing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's <hi>Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.</hi>
               </note> then they were not without cause) some of your Predecessors, to palliate the matter, and to make their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors more secure of them; writ a Book to this effect, that Catholicks are to imploy <hi>no other Arms against their Prince but the Arms of Christians,</hi> viz. <hi>Tears,</hi> and Spiritual Means, daily <hi>Prayers,</hi> and Watchings and Fastings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>. So you begin,</p>
            <q>[My Lords and Gentlemen, The Arms which Christians can use against lawful Powers in their severity are only Prayers and Tears.]</q>
            <p>We cannot say that you writ your Book for the same End as they did. But we do not like it, that you jump so toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the same Beginning.</p>
            <q>[Now since nothing can equal the infinity of those we have shed, but the cause, <hi>viz.</hi> to see our dearest Friends forsake us, we hope it will not offend you, if (after we have a little wip'd our eyes) we sigh out our Complaints to you.]</q>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:47021:3"/>Of the <hi>Cause</hi> of your Tears, we shall say more anon. Of the <hi>Quantity</hi> of them, you say very extravagantly, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can equal the infinity of those we have shed.</hi> For you might have excepted those of the Protestants in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, or of them that suffered in the late Irish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. You ought to have excepted the Fears of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Purgatory: and yet those are said to be short of <hi>Infinity.</hi> But you Jesuites love to be Hyperbolical, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ranting or whining; as if that Religion which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges you to damn all other Christians, had likewise forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den you to speak like other Men.</p>
            <q>[We had spoke much sooner, had we not been silent through Consterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to see you inflamed, whom with reverence we honor) and also to shew our submissive patience, which used no slights nor tricks to divert the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates of Parliament: for no body can imagine where so many of the great Nobility and Gentry are concerned, but something might have been done; when as in all Ages we see things of publick advantage by the managers dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity nipt in the bud, even in the very Houses them selves. Far be it from Catholicks to perplex Parliaments, who have been the Founders of their I riviledges, and all Antient Laws: Nay <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it self had its rise from us, which we do the less boast of, since it was not at first obtained in so submiss and humble a manner.</q>
            <p>In the same Roman Style you commend your owne <hi>silence</hi> and <hi>patience.</hi> You <hi>boast</hi> that you <hi>have been the Founders of the Parliaments Priviledges, and all Antient Laws.</hi> Of the first, let every man believe as he sees cause. But the second we cannot allow, in either sense, whether you mean it of your selves, or of your Predecessors.</p>
            <p>For as now in your Church, men are of two sorts, even so they were heretofore in this Realm. There were some that wholly minded the common interests of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Civil Government. Others were <hi>Papalini,</hi> asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and promoters of the Popes usurpations. They which acted in those first capacities were not more your Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors than Ours. They which acted in the other were truly and only Yours. You say,</p>
            <q>[We sung our <hi>Nunc Dimittis</hi> when we saw our Master in his Throne, and you in your deserved Authority and Rule.]</q>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:47021:3"/>'Tis very well. And yet <note n="*" place="margin">Answer to <hi>Philanax,</hi> p. 85</note> some of you sung your <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Exultemus</hi> when you saw his Blessed Father upon the Scaffold. But what of that? since the Son is King, who is not glad <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>So</hi> Argyle <hi>said</hi> Let them take all, since my Lord the King is come home in peace.</note> that he is King? or whom would it not <hi>grieve to have his Loyalty called in Question?</hi>
            </p>
            <q>[Nor could any thing have ever grieved us more, but to have our Loyalty called into question by you even at the instigation of our greatest Adversaries.</q>
            <q>[If we must suffer let it be by you alone; for that's a double Death to men of Honor, to have their Enemies not only accusers, but for their insult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judges also.]</q>
            <p>Sir, he that is <hi>Loyal,</hi> and a <hi>man of Honor,</hi> has no cause to fear <hi>Death, double</hi> or single. For our Kings have alwayes Declared <note n="*" place="margin">K <hi>James</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, p. 336. of his Works.</note> that they put no man to death for Religion. Therefore if you Truly fear Death, it is for Treason. If you only pretend this, it is a Calumny. Either way you are no friend to the Government, for all your pretences to <hi>Honor</hi> and <hi>Loyalty.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>[These are they that by beginning with us, murthered their Prince, and wounded you: and shall the same method continue by your Approbation? We are sure you mean well; though their design be wicked: but never let it be recorded in story, that you forgot your often Vows to us, in joyning with them that have been the cause of so great Calamity to the Nation.]</q>
            <p>How far it is true, that the <hi>Kings Murtherers began with you,</hi> we shall consider anon. But it seems you take the Liberty of bestowing that Character upon whom you please; that no man hereafter may dare move for the Execution of any Law against you, for fear of being said to <hi>continue the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi> of the Kings Murtherers.</p>
            <p>As for any <hi>Vows</hi> that we have made to you, whatsoever they are, you are more sure of them than we can be of any that you make to us; for we have no Pope to dispense with them. Neither is it <hi>recorded in Story,</hi>

            <q>[Of all Calumnies against Catholicks, we have admired at none so much as that their Principles are said to be inconsistent with Government, and they themselves thought ever proue to Rebellion.]</q>
            <p>'Tis a Calumny of yours to call those things <hi>Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:47021:4"/>
which are true, and which you cannot Deny without such a Presumption as we should much <hi>admire</hi> in you if it were not so very Ordinary. Concerning your <hi>Principles,</hi> where should we look for them, but in your Councils, your Decretals, and the Books of your Divines? In each of these we are taught, that the Pope has a Power to depose Kings, and to discharge Subjects from their Allegiance: which Doctrines are utterly <hi>inconsistent with Government:</hi> for whosoever believes them, no Prince can be secure of him. But whosoever is a Papist, is bound to believe them. And he that has imbib'd this Faith, may well be <hi>thought ever prone to Rebellion.</hi>

We do not tell you this as news, for your Clergy-men know it already; but that your Laity may not be ignorant of it, we shall quote them some few of the greatest Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of your Church in this Age. And we shall leave it upon you to shew them, when and where they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, what Justice has been executed on the Persons, what <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> has censur'd the Writings of these Authors. Nay, if you deal honestly, you cannot but confess, that their Works are generally approved, and that their Persons are had in admiration among you that are the guides of the Lay-mens Consciences.</p>
            <p>We pass over the gross things of <hi>Mariana</hi>'s Book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, they which once licens'd it for love of the Doctrine; have since condemned it, for fear of their King's heavy Displeasure.</p>
            <p>But pray Sir, who condemned your Cardinals, <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bell. de Rom. Pont. <hi>l 5. c. 8.</hi> Baron. Anno <hi>800. Sect. 10.</hi>
               </note> and <hi>Baronius?</hi> who teach you, that the <hi>Pope</hi> may do with any <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>Jehoiada</hi> did with <hi>Athalia;</hi> that is, he may <hi>deprive him first of his Kingdom, and then of his Life. Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> indeed elsewhere expresses it more like a Jesuite, and a

            <p>Again, who condemn'd your great School-Men, <hi>Suarez</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Nay, who has condemned our Country-man <hi>Parsons,</hi> or <hi>Cresswel?</hi> (for the high-fliers of Popery have been those of our own Nation) by whom this is laid down as a <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the whole School of Divines and Canonists,</hi> and declar'd to be <hi>Certain, and of Faith; that any Christian Prince what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, that shall manifestly swerve from the Catholick Religion, and endeavour to draw off others, does immediately fall from all Power and Dignity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that, even before any Sentence of the Pope is pronounced against him; and that all his Subjects whatsoever are free from all obligation of any Oath of Obedience which they have made to him as their lawful Prince; and that they may and ought (if they be strong enough) to eject such a one from the Government of Christians, as an Apostate, an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, a deserter of Christ, and an enemy of his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> went not altogether so high; but yet he held to the Roman Catholick Principle, that <hi>Kings may be deposed by the Pope when he sees cause.</hi> He seemed to be of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other opinion while <hi>Henry</hi> IV. was alive: but when He was dead, and a Child was in the Throne, then he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd to declare this publickly in his Oration <note n="*" place="margin">Jan. 15. 1615</note> on behalf of the whole Clergy of <hi>France.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">Note that the Pope sent him thanks for it; &amp; King <hi>James</hi> writ in answer to it, that solid <hi>Defence of the Right of Kings</hi>

that rather then yield to it, he and his fellow-Bishops would chuse to burn at a Stake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how has this Doctrine taken among the <hi>Papists</hi> in our Kings Dominions? it has not taken with some of them: either because you have not thought it seasonable for you to instruct them in it (for Doctrines of this sort are then only proper to be Inculcated, when they may do Execution) or else because your Instruction has been over rul'd by some better Principle; as we doubt not there have always been some of your Church, in whose generous breasts the <hi>English</hi> man has been too strong for the <hi>Papist.</hi> But yet this Doctrine has taken with others; and many of them have practised according to it, as we shall shew you hereafter; and many more would have been practising, if there had not been something to hinder them or deterr them.

            <q>[My Lords and Gentlemen, had this been a new Sect not known before, something perchance might have been doubted; but to lay this at their doors that have govern'd the civilliz'd world, is the miracle of miracles to us]</q>

            <p>But pray Sir, when was it that you <hi>govern'd the civiliz'd World?</hi> For the Eastern and Southern Churches never own'd your Government; nor yet the Western, while Learning flourished: But when Barbarity had over-run it, then Popery grew up by degrees, and made it more Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous both in Ignorance and in Cruelty. Then came in those Doctrines of Transubstantiation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then came in those Papal Usurpations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the <hi>Wo<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ld,</hi> being again <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd,</hi> hath partly thrown off, and partly reduced into more tolerable terms.</p>
            <q>[Did <hi>Richard</hi> the First, or <hi>Edward</hi> Long-shanks, suspect his Catholicks that served in <hi>Palestine,</hi> and make our Countryes Fame big in the Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of all Ages? or did they mistrust (in their dangerous absence) their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects at home, because they were of the same profession? could <hi>Edward</hi> the Third imagine those to be traiterous in their Doctrine, that had that care and duty for their Prince, as to make them (by Statute) guilty of Death in the highest Degree, that had the least thought of ill against the King? be pleased that <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth be remembred also, who did those Wonders, of which the whole World does yet resound; and certainly all History will agree in this, that 'twas <hi>Oldcastle</hi> he feared, and not those that believed the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be Head of the Church.]</q>
            <p>The Reigns of those Kings whom you speak of, were in those dark times; when all Goodness declin'd, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions were daily growing upon us. <hi>Richard</hi> the First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Daniel's <hi>Hist.</hi> Ric.

               </note> them to do it. And both those other Princes whom you mention, made Laws against his Usurpations. <hi>Edward</hi> the Third made a notable one of this kind, by advice of<note place="margin">25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Vide</hi> Statute of Provisors.</note> that very Parliament, in which he enacted his <hi>Laws against Treason.</hi> And certainly, <hi>Henry</hi> the Second was more vex'd with <hi>Becket,</hi> than ever <hi>Henry</hi> V. feared <hi>Oldcastle.</hi> We doubt not, those Kings had many good Subjects, and our King hath some better than you seem to be. But they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered not in Religion, as you do from ours: And yet then, your Faction was always encroaching where it was suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and dangerous where it was opposed.</p>
            <p>Did not your Pope force King <hi>John</hi> to do him homage for <hi>England?</hi> Did he not wrestle with <hi>Edward</hi> I. <note n="*" place="margin">Mat.

            <q>[We will no longer trouble you with putting you in mind of any more of our mighty Kings who have been feared abroad, and as safe at home as any since the Reformation of Religion.

            <p>The <hi>French</hi> King will believe what he pleases, but not all that you say of him.

            <p>Pray Sir, what may <hi>that</hi> be? For you have murthered Kings, and them of your own Religion, four or five in this Realm since the Conquest (not to speak of those Numbers elsewhere.) But that was in the growing Age of Popery.

For neither had that King better Subjects than those which were Massacred; nor had his Successor erranter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels than those that did Massacre them.

may be partial for the one, and You for the other.</p>
            <p>First, of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> a King should be the most compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judge: hear therefore what King <hi>James</hi> saith, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the fresh memory of those dayes. <hi>I could never yet</hi>

               <hi>learn</hi> (saith he) <hi>by any good and true Intelligence, that in</hi> France, <hi>those of the Religion took Arms against their King. In the first Civil Wars they stood only upon their Guard, they stood only to their lawful Wards, and Locks of Defence. They armed not, nor took the Field, before they were pursued with Fire &amp; Sword, burnt up and slaughtered. Besides, Religion was neither the root nor the rinde of those intestine Troubles. The true ground of the Quarrel was this; during the Minority of King</hi> Francis II. <hi>the Protestants of</hi> France <hi>were a refuge and succor to the Princes of the Blood, when they were kept from the King's Presence, and by the Power of their Enemies were no better than plainly driven and chased from the Court. I mean the Grandfathers of the King now Reigning, and of the Prince of</hi> Conde, <hi>when they had no place of safe Retreat. In regard of which worthy and honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Service, it may seem the</hi> French <hi>King hath reason to have the Protestants in his gracious remembrance. With other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion or Insurrection the Protestants are not justly to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Certain it is, that King</hi> Henry III, &amp;c. <hi>by their good Service was delivered from a most extream &amp; eminent peril of his Life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they never abandoned that</hi> Henry III. <hi>nor</hi> IV. <hi>in all the heat of Revolts and Rebellions raised by the Pope, and the more part of the Clergy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Then of <hi>Religion,</hi> since you will allow none but the Pope to be Judge, let us hear his Judgment from <hi>Thuanus,</hi> who was a Roman Catholick, and a most authentick Historian.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Thu.</hi> Hist. l. 53.</note> He tells us, the Pope had an account of the Massacre from his Legate at <hi>Paris,</hi> that he read his Letter in the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of Cardinals, that there it was decreed that they should go directly to St. <hi>Marks,</hi> and there solemnly give <hi>thanks to Almighty God for so great a blessing conferred upon the Roman See, and the Christian World.</hi> That soon after a Jubilee should be publisht through the whole Christian World, and these causes were exprest for it, To give <hi>thanks to God for destroying in</hi> France <hi>the Enemies of the Truth, and of the

Church, &amp;c.</hi> In the Evening, the Guns were fired at St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> and Bonefires were made, and nothing was omitted of all those things that use to be performed in the <hi>greatest Victories of the Church.</hi> Some dayes after, there was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> with the greatest resort of Nobility and People. First went the Bishops and Cardinals, then the Switzers, then the Ambassadors of Kings and Princes: then under a Canopy, went His Holiness Himself, with the Emperor's Ambassador bearing up his Train for him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Over the Church-Door was an Inscription set up, in which the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> in the name of the King of <hi>France,</hi> congratulated his <hi>Holiness,</hi> and the Colledge of Cardinals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the <hi>plainly stupendious effects, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether incredible events, of their Councils given him, and of their Assistances sent him, and of their twelve Years Wishes and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> Soon after, the Pope sent Cardinal <hi>Ursin</hi> in his name, to congratulate the King of <hi>France,</hi> who in his Journey through the Cities, highly commended the Faith of those Citizens that had to do in the Massacre; and distributed his Holiness's blessings amongst them. And at <hi>Paris,</hi> being to perswade the reception of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured it with this Argument, That the memory of <hi>the late Action, to be magnified in all ages, as conducing to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and the Dignity of the Holy Roman Church,</hi> might be as it were sealed by the Approbation of the Holy Synod: for that so it would be manifest to all men that now are, or hereafter shall be, that the King consented to the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of so many lives, <hi>not out of hatred or revenge, or sense of any injury of his own, but out of an ardent desire to propagate the Glory of God.</hi> That, what could not be expected whilst the Faction of Protestants stood, now since they were taken away, the Catholick Apostolick Roman Religion which by the Synod of <hi>Trent</hi> is cleared from the venom of the Sectaries, might be established without Controversie, and without Exception, <hi>through all the Provinces of the</hi> French <hi>Dominion.</hi>

Thus you see how well Protestants may live in a Popish Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, under a Popish King: nor was <hi>Charlemain</hi> more Catholick than this; for though he contends something with the Pope, 'tis not of Faith, but about Gallicane Priviledges, which perchance he may very lawfully do.]</q>

By any other way than this he cannot destroy them, without the violation of his Laws: which, as they are the only <hi>Forces and Towers,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Subjects ought to be secured against their King; so, since he is pleased to allow them no other, these Laws, backt with his puissance, are forces enough to secure them against their fellow-Subjects.</p>
            <p>We cannot pass this Paragraph, without observing your Jesuitical ingenuity; how you slight those favours that you have; how you complain of those <hi>hardships</hi> that you have not; and how you insult over the poor <hi>Hugonots,</hi> by comparing with them, who generally would mend their condition by changing with you. Pray Sir, do not Popish-Peers sit in our English <hi>Parliaments,</hi> as well as Protestants in the French? or have you not as free access to our <hi>Kings</hi> Brother, as they have to theirs? or would you have his Highness to Catechise, as the Abbot had the Duke of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester?</hi> perhaps that you would have.

            <p>For what cause then were they enacted? Plainly for this cause, to guard the lives of our Princes against your traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous practices.</p>
            <q>[It hath often been urged, that our Misdemeanors in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days, and King <hi>James</hi>'s time, was the cause of our Panishment.]</q>

               <hi>Paul</hi> IV. who would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge her for sundry causes; the chief that he alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were these: First, Because <hi>this Kingdom is a Fee of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and it was audaciously done of her to assume it without his leave.</hi> The second was, because <hi>she was Illegitimate:</hi> for if her Fathers Marriage were good, the Pope must let down his Mill. But after all this, his Successor <hi>Pius</hi> IV<note n="*" place="margin">In his Letter by <hi>Parpaglia,</hi> dated 1560. <hi>May</hi> 5.</note> did own her, and would have done any thing for her, so she would have owned him. Which because she would not, the next <hi>Pope Pius</hi> V. issued out his Bull<note n="*" place="margin">Dated 1570. <hi>Feb.</hi> 25.</note> against her, and deposed her; not for Bastardy<note n="†" place="margin">See the Bull it self, there is not the least mention of Bastardy in it.</note> but for Heresie; that is, for being a Protestant; for which Heresie it was, that the Northern men Rebelled against her, and many more of her Subjects disowned her: and some or other were every foot plotting how to take away her life.</p>
            <p>True it is, that some of these pretended to do it in favour of the <hi>Queen of Scots.</hi> But how if that Queen had not been a Catholick? or Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had not Been thought <hi>Illegitimate?</hi> would a legitimate Protestant have been so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for? or would a Popish Bastard have been rejected by them?</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. had occasion to consider this. For his Holiness had a Bastard<note n="*" place="margin">James Buon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compagno.</note> of his own to provide for, and another<note n="†" place="margin">Don John.</note> of the Emperors; no doubt good Catholicks both of them.

               <note n="*" place="margin">Whom his Holiness had created Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of <hi>Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> Earl of <hi>Wexford,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thu.</hi> Hist. l. 64.</note> with Forces to win it for him. To the other he gave the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and gave him leave to win it for himself. But what was all this to the <hi>thrice Noble Queen of Scots?</hi> Possibly she might have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to have married one of the rwo? but then it must
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47021:14"/>
have been expresly with this condition, That her Son <hi>King James</hi> (who was a Heretick) <hi>should have nothing to do with the Succession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When their bubbles were broken, and she was dead, all her <hi>Right</hi> descended to King <hi>James,</hi> who being as little to the Pope's mind, as Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was, <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. only took no publick notice of Him, but he proceeded with all his might against Her. He curst her afresh, and publisht a Croysade against her, and gave the whole <hi>Right</hi> of Her Kingdoms to <hi>Philip</hi> the II. King of <hi>Spain.</hi> But neither that Popes Bounty, nor his three Successors Blessings, nor the <hi>Spanish</hi> Arms, nor the <hi>Italian</hi> Arts (for no way was left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tried) could ever prevail against Gods Providence; which, till the end of her days, kept that Queen always fast in her Possessions.</p>
            <p>At last, Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. seeing there was nothing to be done against her, resolv'd to let her go like a Heretick as she was; and to take the more care that another Heretick should not succeed her. For which cause he sent over two Breves into <hi>England,</hi> one to the Clergy, and the other to the Laity, commanding them not to admit any other but a Catholick, though never so <hi>near in Blood,</hi> to the Succession:<note place="margin">Cambden, Eliz. 1600.</note> that is to say, in plain words, not to admit King <hi>James</hi> to Reign after Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> death. So 'tis clear, that your Popes never stuck at that <hi>hard Question</hi> that you speak of.</p>
            <p>Let us see what our Country-men did, who, as you say, <hi>suffered for it in those days.</hi> They did like obsequious Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, at every turn, as their Head directed them. They acted for the Papal Interest as far as they were able. They made the <hi>House of Scotland</hi> the Cloak for it, as far as it would reach. And it reacht pretty well, as long as the Title was in Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> But after the Title came to be in King <hi>James,</hi> Pray Sir, name us those Papists, or but one single person of them, that either died or suffered for Him: and then you bless us with a discovery.</p>
            <p>What then? were they idle for so many years as past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the commencing of his Title, and the Death of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47021:15"/>
Queen <hi>Elizabeth?</hi> Nothing less. For they were as busie as Bees, in contriving how to hasten her Death, and how to put him by the Succession. And if it were for his Service, that they would have destroyed Her; pray for whose ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was it, that they would have defeated Him? but that will be known by the story.</p>
            <p>Soon after his Mothers Death was the <hi>Spanish</hi> Invasion; which would have defeated him with a Witness, if it had sped; and yet our Papists, both Negotiated <note n="*" place="margin">Cambden E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz. 1588.</note> it, and writ in Defence <note n="†" place="margin">Cardinal <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>'s Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>V.

In which he mentions, <note n="†" place="margin">

               <hi>if King James would turn Catholick, they would follow him; but if not, they would all die against him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which pious Resolutions were seconded with agreeable Actions. For they endeavoured, as far as Catholicks are obliged by their Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> as far as they durst and were able; at first; to hinder him from coming in, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to throw him out again, or to destroy him in the place, as we shall have occasion to shew you in the answer to the next Paragraph.</p>
            <p>The mean while out of this present discourse, in which you cannot deny any thing that is material to our purpose; It appears that this <hi>hard Question of Right to the Crown,</hi> was not between the Parties themselves in one or t'other of whom you confess the <hi>Right</hi> was. It appears that your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Judge of Controversies very easily and impartially resolv'd it, by denying both sides of the <hi>Question,</hi> and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming the whole <hi>right</hi> to himself. It appears that your Catholicks, who are said to have sided with one against the other, did in truth side with the Pope against them both. And lastly it appears that their <hi>Misdemeanors</hi> were inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable Treasons, if any Treason can be inexcusable that is befriended with such an Apologist.</p>
            <q>['Twas for the Royal House of <hi>Scotland</hi> that they suffered in those days; and 'tis for the same Illustrious Family we are ready to hazard all on any occasion.]</q>
            <p>Sir, we have found you notoriously False in that which you Affirm: Pray God you prove True in that which you Promise.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:47021:16"/>[Nor can the consequence of the former procedure be but ill, if a <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. (whom Sir <hi>W. Raleigh,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Cherbury,</hi> two famous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, have so homely Characteriz'd) should after twenty years cohabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion turn away his Wife, and this out of scruple of Conscience as he said) when as History declares that he never spared Woman in his Lust, nor Man in his Fury.</q>
            <p>This <hi>Character</hi> would better agree with many a Head of a Church whom we could name you, than with <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. of whom better <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>V. Thu. Hist.</hi> l. 1.</note> Historians speak better things. But if he were such a Monster as you would make him, perhaps it was for want of a better Religion; for he was <note n="*" place="margin">

And you had no occasion for this flurt at him; unless that, having undertaken to put the best colours upon Treason, you might think you did something towards it in bespattering of Kings.</p>
            <p>We have a touch of the same Art in the next Paragraph. Where having undertaken to excuse the Gun-powder-Treason, you call it first a <hi>Misdemeanor,</hi> then the <hi>Fifth of November,</hi> and then a <hi>Conjuration;</hi> soft words all of them: but you deal wicked hardly with the <hi>great Minister</hi> of State; whom you make to have been the Author of it; as if the Traitors had not conspired against the State, but the State against them.</p>
            <p>But before we come to answer this, It will be needful to set down the story, as it appears out of the Examinations and Confessions of the Traitors themselves.</p>
            <p>The rise of this Treason, was from the before-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Breves</hi> of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. in which he required all his Catholicks, that after the <hi>death of that wretched Woman Queen</hi> Elizabeth, they should admit none but a Catholick to reign over them. These <hi>Breves</hi> were by <hi>Garnet</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial of the Jesuites, communicated to <hi>Catesby</hi> and others: who in Obedience thought best to begin their Practices in her life time. So they sent Father <hi>Tesmund</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> into <hi>Spain</hi> to crave the assistance of that Crown. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> sent them back with the promise of an Army. But soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> died, and no Army came. Therefore
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47021:16"/>
again they sent <hi>Christopher Wright</hi> into <hi>Spain</hi> to hasten i<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and <hi>Stanley</hi> out of <hi>Flanders</hi> sent <hi>Fawks</hi> thither upon the same errand; who finding the Councils of <hi>Spain</hi> at this time wholly enclined to peace, returned quickly back, and brought nothing but despair along with them.</p>
            <p>Yet the Breves had so wrought upon <hi>Catesby,</hi> that he could not find in his heart to give over; but still casting about for ways, he hit upon this of the Powder-Treason, which as being much out of the common Rode, he thought the most secure for his purpose He communicated this to <hi>Winter,</hi> who approved it, and fetcht <hi>Fawks</hi> out of <hi>Flanders</hi> to assist in it. Not long after <hi>Piercy</hi> being in their company, and offering himself to any <hi>service for the Catholick Cause, though it were even the Kings Death: Catesby</hi> told him, that that was too poor an Adventure for him: but, saith he, if thou wilt be a Traitor, there is a <hi>Plot of greater advantage; and such a one as can never be discovered.</hi> Thus having duly prepar'd him, he took him into the Conspiracy. And the like he did with so many more as made up their Number thirteen of the Laity.</p>
            <p>But where were the <hi>Jesuites</hi> all the while? rot idle, you may be sure. The Provincial <hi>Garnet</hi> was privy to it from the beginning, so were divers <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Baldwin, Hammond, Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,</hi> and <hi>Gerard,</hi> were named by the Conspirators, as privy with them.</note> more of the Society. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that when <hi>Watson</hi> endeavour'd to have drawn them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Plot (for the setting up of the Lady <hi>Arbella</hi>'s Title, in opposition to King <hi>James</hi> his) they declin'd it, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>V. VVatsons</hi> Confession.</note> saying, <hi>They had another of their own then afoot, and that they would not mingle designs with him for fear of hindering one another.</hi>

            <p>But <hi>Watson</hi> miscarried with his Plot, and the Jesuites went on with theirs. They absolv'd the Conspirators of the Guilt, and extenuated the Danger of their design; they perswaded them how highly Beneficial it would be in the Consequences of it; they gave them their Oath, by the Holy Trinity, and the Sacrament which they did then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that none of them should reveal it to any other, or withdraw himself from it without common consent: and for the pittiful scruple of destroying the Innocent with the Guilty, <hi>Garnet</hi> answered, they might lawfully do it in order
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47021:17"/>
to a greater good. Yet it seems there was a spark of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity in some of them. which the Divinity of this Casuist had not quite extinguish't; as appear'd, either by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting of some Lords that were afterward fined for it in the Star-Chamber, or certainly by that Letter of warning to my Lord <hi>Monteagle,</hi> which was the happy occasion of the Discovery of the whole Treason.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Warwick-shire,</hi> where the Princess <hi>Elizabeth</hi> then was, they had appointed a meeting, under the pretence of a Hunting-Match, to seize upon her, the same day in which the King and his Male Issue were to have been destroyed. There met about fourscore of them, which was a number sufficient for that business. But the news of the Discovery coming among them, they were so dismayed at it, that they desisted from their enterprize, and fled into <hi>Stafford-shire;</hi> where, the Countrey being raised against them, they were some of them kill'd, and the rest taken; and those which were left alive of the prime Conspirators were sent up to <hi>London,</hi> and there Executed.</p>
            <p>This is the plain story, now let us see how you colour it.</p>
            <q>[Now for the Fifth of <hi>November;</hi> with hands lifted up to Heaven, we abominate and detest.]</q>
            <p>What is it that you <hi>abominate and detest?</hi> That day which is the Festival of our Deliverance? We can believe you without <hi>your hands lifted up to Heaven.</hi> Or mean you the Treason which was to have been acted upon that day? why then do you not speak out and call it so? For if you cannot afford to call it Treason, it is not the <hi>lifting up of your hands</hi> that can make us believe you do heartily <hi>abominate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test it.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>[And from the bottom of our hearts say, that may they fall into irrecoverable Perdition, who propagate that Faith by the Blood of Kings, which is to be planted in truth and meekness only.]</q>
            <p>It was a good caution of a Philosopher to the Son of a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47021:17"/>
common Woman, that he should not throw stones among a multitude, for fear of hitting his Father. You might have had that caution when you threw out this curse; for your Father the Pope stands fairest for it of all men that we know in the World.</p>
            <q>[But let it not displease you, Men, Brethren, and Fathers, if we ask whether <hi>Ulysses</hi> be no better known? or who hath forgot the Plots <hi>Cromwel</hi> framed in his Closet; not only to destroy many faithful Cavaliers, but also to put a lustre upon his Intelligence, as if nothing could be done without his knowledg. Even so did the then great Minister, who drew some few Desperadoes into this Conjuration, and then discovered it by a Miracle.]</q>
            <p>Having spit and wip't your mouth, now you make your speech. And it begins with a mixture of <hi>Apostle</hi> and <hi>Poet;</hi> to shew what we are to expect from you; namely, with much Gravity, much Fiction: and so far you do not go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to deceive us.</p>
            <p>The scope of your speech is to make the world believe that your Catholicks were drawn into this Plot by Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Cecil.</hi> You are so wise, that you do not offer to prove this; but you would steal it into us by an example, that we are concerned in. As <hi>Cromwel</hi> trepann'd <hi>many faithful Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,</hi> even so <hi>Cecil</hi> drew in <hi>some few Desperadoes.</hi> Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (they say) are odious: But to the business.</p>
            <p>First, admitting your Fiction, as if it were true, that <hi>Cecil</hi> did draw in those wretches into this Treason. Was it ever the less Treason because he <hi>drew</hi> them into it? For, according to your own supposition, they did not know that they were drawn in by him. But they verily thought that they had followed their own Guides; and they zealously did according to their own Principles. They did, what they would have done, if there had been no <hi>Cecil</hi> in the world; provided there had been a Devil in his room, to have put it into their heads. For your excuse only implies, that they had not the Wit to invent it: But their progress in it shews, that they wanted not the Malice to have executed it. So that according to your own illustration: As those faithful Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47021:18"/>
whom <hi>Cromwel</hi> drew in, had their Loyalty abused, &amp; were nevertheless Faithful still; so those Powder-Traitors whom you say <hi>Cecil</hi> drew in, had their Disloyalty outwitted, and were nevertheless Traitors still. For as well in the one case as in the other, this very thing that they could be drawn in, is a clear demonstration that they were before-hand sufficiently Disposed for it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When you have considered the absurdity of your excuse for your friends, you may do well to think of an excuse for your Self. For that which you affirm of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>'s having drawn them into this Plot, is a very groundless and impudent Fiction, and you are properly the Author of it. For though others perhaps may have spoken this in rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery; yet you are the first, that we know of, that has asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it in Print.</p>
            <p>Pray Sir, whence had you this tale? By what Tradition did you receive it? Or had you some new Revelation of the Causes threescore years after the Fact? For 'tis plain, that King <hi>James</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>None were therein culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but only Jesuites and Catholicks.</hi>
               </note> knew nothing of it. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and his fellow <hi>Apologists</hi> in that Age never pretended it. The parties themselves, neither at their Tryal, nor at their Execution, gave any intimation of it. Can you tell us which of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators were <hi>Cecil</hi>'s Instruments to draw in the rest? Or can you think he was so great an Artist, that he could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade his Setters to be hang'd, that his Art might not be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected? For 'tis well known that he sav'd not any of those wretches from suffering. And they which did suffer, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged none other, but themselves, in their Confessions. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, Father <hi>Garnet</hi> said, before Doctor <hi>Overal,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers<note place="margin">Casaub. Epist. ad Front.

            <p>These are strong presumptions of the Negative; but you ought to have proved your Affirmative, or at least to have offered something toward it. For if barely to say this, be enough, then here is an excuse indifferently calculated for all Treasons in the world that miscarry: (and if they pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, who dares call them Treasons?) Here is a never failing Topick for any one that would write an <hi>Apology</hi> in behalf of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47021:18"/>
any Villany whatsoever. For if the Traitors be discover'd by any kind of accident, this will alwaies remain to be said for them, that <hi>the then great Minister drew them in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why did you not say this for those Conspiracies in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> daies? You might have said it perhaps with less improbability. But then had you a higher Game to fly at, namely the <hi>Queens</hi> Title to her Crown; and if you durst have made so bold with King <hi>James</hi> his, you would not have stoopt at so low a Quarry as a <hi>Minister</hi> of State.</p>
            <p>But by the way we cannot but acknowledge, that you Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites are a sort of most obliging Gentlemen. If men will believe what you Say, nothing that you do can fall amiss. In your attempts against the life of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged his Majesty that now is, as being Martyrs for the <hi>Royal House of Scotland.</hi> And in your Plot to blow up that Royal House, you were a kind of Fellow-sufferers with <hi>the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cavaliers;</hi> for as they us'd to be trapp'd by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> even so you were drawn in by Secretary <hi>Cecil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is worth observing in this Paragraph, how you diminish that hellish Plot, by calling them that were engag'd in it, a <hi>few Desperadoes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Fewness</hi> of them will be considered in your next.</p>
            <p>But in what sense do you call them <hi>Desperadoes?</hi> Were they such in respect of their Fortunes? That is so well known to be false, that it needs no Answer. Were they such in respect of their Discontents? that seems to be your Meaning. But there was little Reason for any. For at the time of this Conspiracy, there was none of your Priests in Prison, there was no Mult taken of any Lay-man, <hi>Nor was there a man of them, as</hi> King <hi>James.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">King <hi>James</hi> Speech in Parliament, 1605.</note> said, <hi>that could alledge any pretended cause of grief.</hi> And yet they were continually Restless, as we have shewn you in their story. Was it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had not all the Liberty they would have had? This is so far from excusing them, that it rathet gives us oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of suspecting You.</p>
            <p>'Tis no wonder that you, who cannot afford to call this Conspiracy a Treason, are not willing to allow the <hi>Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> of it a <hi>Miracle.</hi> Yet you might have forborn Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing

            <q>[This will easily appear, <hi>viz.</hi> how little the Catholick Party understood the Design, seeing there was not a score of Guilty found, though all imaginable industry was used by the Commons, Lords, and Privy Council too.]</q>
            <p>The <hi>design</hi> it self was <hi>understood</hi> but by <hi>Few,</hi> because it was neither safe nor needful to impart it to many. But the <hi>Papists</hi> generally knew that there was a Design in hand; and though they did not know the horrid nature of it, yet many of them pray'd for the success of it: and if the Plot had taken effect, and the Hunting-Match had gone on, we should then have been better able to have judg'd how your <hi>Catholick Party</hi> stood affected toward it. Sure enough though there were but a <note n="*" place="margin">5 Jesuiteb 13. Lay-men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Owen</hi> and <hi>Stanley<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

What a Coil here was about the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of Father <hi>Garnet</hi>'s straw? And perhaps you have seen his Picture, and <hi>Gerard</hi>'s too among the <note n="*" place="margin">At <hi>La Fleche,</hi> and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</note> Martyrs of your Society. Nay his Holiness himself shew'd his good Will to them, when after all this, he made <hi>Tesmund</hi> Penitentiary at S. <hi>Peters</hi> in <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p>You <hi>suppose</hi> that which is False, to avoid that which is True. For who ever said, that <hi>All the Papists of that Age were Consenting</hi> to the Gun-Powder-Treason?

            <p>We have answer'd your Instances, of the <hi>French Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch Papists;</hi> and your unjust upbraiding us with the <hi>greatness of your Duty,</hi> and with our <hi>want of compassion and pity.</hi> And yet, as if all these were Unanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, you come over with them again and again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These barbarous people,</hi> you say, <hi>sequester none for their Faith;</hi> but pray what did you, when you <hi>govern'd the Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd World?</hi> you hang'd and burn'd men, for no other cause but their Faith; and this you did with abundance of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; so it seems we may be worse than <hi>Barbarous,</hi> and yet much better than you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:47021:22"/>But that were little for our credit, unless we had this to say more; that not the worst of you <hi>suffers</hi> any otherwise than by known Laws, or any more than is of pure Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For, we hold it Necessary to maintain the Authority of the King, and the Peace of the Nation. If you call any thing <hi>Religion,</hi> that is contrary to these; must we therefore alter our Laws? or ought you to mend your Religion?</p>
            <p>You put the Effigies of <hi>Cromwel</hi> upon any thing that you would render odious; as your Inquisition bedresses one with Pictures of Devils, whom they are about to burn for his Religion. For such Disguizes are apt to work much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the weak judgements of the multitude. But he must be very weak indeed that cannot perceive the wide Difference, between the Edicts of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> that were design'd to Ruine men for their Loyalty, and those Laws that our Princes have made to Restrain them from Treason and Rebellion.</p>
            <q>[We have no other study, but the glory of our Sovereign, and just liberty of the Subjects.]</q>
            <p>Sir, if we may judge by your Works, there is <hi>nothing</hi> less <hi>studied</hi> in your Colledge.</p>
            <q>[Nor was it a mean Argument of our Duty, when every Catholick Lord gave his voice for the Restauration of Bishops; by which we could pretend no other advantage, but that 26 Votes (subsisting wholly by the Crown) were added to the defence of Kingship, and consequently a check to all Anarchy and Confusion.]</q>
            <p>This is no <hi>Argument</hi> of Your <hi>Duty;</hi> for, sure, You are no <hi>Lord.</hi> Nor is it likely that these Lords follow'd Your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in the doing of this Duty.</p>
            <q>['Tis morally impossible but that we who approve of Monarchy in the Church, must ever be fond of it in the State also.]</q>
            <p>If you mean this of Papists in General, that which you call <hi>morally impossible,</hi> is Experimentally True. For in <hi>Venice, Genoa, Lucca,</hi> and the Popish Cantons of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> where
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47021:22"/>
they very well <hi>approve of Monarchy in the Church;</hi> yet they are not <hi>fond of it in the State also.</hi> But if you mean this of the Jesuitical Party, then it may be true in this sense, that you would have the Pope to be sole Monarch both in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals and Temporals.</p>
            <q>[Yet this is a misfortune, we now plainly feel, that the longer the late Transgressors live, the more forgotten are their Crimes, whiles distance in time calls the faults of our Fathers to remembrance, and buries our own Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance in eternal oblivion and forgetfulness.]</q>
            <p>We can now allow you to complain, and commend your selves without Measure; having prov'd already, that you do it without cause.</p>
            <q>[My Lords and Gentlemen, consider we beseech you the sad condition of the <hi>Irish</hi> Soldiers now in <hi>England;</hi> the worst of which Nation could be but intentionally so wicked, as the acted Villany of many English, whom your admired Clemency pardoned. Remember how they left the Spanish Service when they heard their King was in <hi>France;</hi> and how they forsook the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of that unnatural Prince, after he had committed the never to be forgotten Act of banishing his distressed Kinsman out of his Dominions. These poor men left all again to bring their Monarch to his home: and shall they then be forgotten by you? or shall my Lord <hi>Douglas</hi> and his brave Scots be left to their shifts, who scorned to receive wages of those who have declared War against <hi>England.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>To swell up the Bill of the Merits of your Party, you take in the Services of the <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>Scottish Soldiers,</hi> as if they were a part of the <hi>English Catholicks,</hi> whom you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to plead for in the Title of your <hi>Apology.</hi> And that you may seem to have done this, in kindness to Them, and not to your Selves; you exhort us to <hi>Consider</hi> them, in such terms, as if You were the first that had ever thought of them. God forbid but they should be consider'd as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve; and he is neither good Christian, nor good Subject, that would grudge to contribute his proportion toward it.</p>
            <p>But you seem to have a farther drift in the mentioning of these Loyal <hi>Irish.</hi> For you immediately mingle them with the <hi>worst of that Nation;</hi> namely with those infamous But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, that in times of as great Peace and Liberty as ever
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47021:23"/>
that Nation enjoyed, and in the Name of that gracious King under whom they enjoyed these, cut the throats of above an hundred thousand of his Protestant Subjects of all Sexes and Ages. It was so black a Villany, that You, the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gist<note place="margin">Lord <hi>Orory's</hi> Answer to <hi>W<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Within few months about two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.</note> of such Actions, knew not how to mention in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, <hi>viz.</hi> after the <hi>French</hi> Massacre, because you had not wherewith to colour it. And yet being conscious to your self that this lay as a blot upon your Cause, you thought fit to place it among these brave Men; as if their Names would mend the hue of an Action that will make the Names of all that had to do in it, look black, and detestable to Mankind, throughout all Generations.</p>
            <p>Nor do you deal much better with our Royallists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; of whom you do not stick to affirm, that in their <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired Clemency,</hi> (and if this were true, who would not <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire</hi> it?) they <hi>pardon'd Many English,</hi> whose <hi>Acted Villanies</hi> were so wicked, that the <hi>worst of the</hi> Irish <hi>Nation could be but Intentionally so wicked in their</hi> Villanies.</p>
            <q>[How commonly is it said that the Oath of Renouncing their Religion is intended for these, which will needs bring this loss to the King and you, that either you will force all of our Faith to lay down their Arms (though by experience of great Integrity and Worth) or else, if some few you retain, they are such whom necessity hath made to swear against Conscience, and who therefore will certainly betray you, when a greater advantage shall be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. By this Test then you can have none, but whom (with Caution) you ought to shun. And thus must you drive away those who truly would serve you; for had they the least thought of being false, they would gladly take the advantage of gain and pay to deceive you]</q>
            <p>You proceed, concerning the <hi>Irish and Scottish Soldiers,</hi> in these words; <hi>How commonly is it said, that the Oath of Renouncing their Religion is intended for them!</hi> Pray Sir, can you tell who are <hi>said to intend this?</hi> For if they are such as have no Authority, it is frivilous. If they are such as have Authority, it is false. And we do verily believe it was never said, wisht, or thought of, by any one that lov'd the King, and the peace of the Nation.</p>
            <p>But what trick had this Jesuite in his head when he fram'd this? One may guess at his design: But let it pass. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47021:23"/>
he only imagined this, to heighten his Fancy, that he might think and write the more Tragically toward the end of his Oration.</p>
            <q>[We know your Wisdom and Generosity, and therefore cannot imagine such a thing; nor do we doubt when you shew favour unto these, but you will use mercy to us, who are both your fellow Subjects, and your own flesh and blood also; if you forsake us, we must say the world decayes, and its final transmutation must needs follow quickly.]</q>
            <p>Here you un-imagine for the Souldiers, and imagine for your self; and, as if you really thought your self in danger, you beg for <hi>mercy</hi> of the Royalists, in such words as your Predecessor <note n="*" place="margin">

            <q>[Little do you think the insolencies we shall suffer by Commitee men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whom chance and lot, hath put into petty Power. Nor will it chuse but grieve you to see them abused (whom formerly you loved) even by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemies of us both.]</q>
            <p>It seems <hi>Committee-men</hi> are intrusted with his Majesties Authority; or that none must use it against Papists for fear of being accounted <hi>Committee-men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is time to have done, when we are come to the dregs of your Rhetorick.</p>
            <q>[When they punish, how will they triumph and say, take This (poor Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists) for your love to Kingship; and again This, for your long doting on the Royal Party: all which you shall receive from us Commissioned by your dearest Friends, and under this Cloak we will gladly vent our private spleen and malice.</q>
            <p>Sir, though you set your self before to speak Tragically, this does rather seem a piece of Drollery. But you Have your design either way. For no man can read it, but he must either Laugh, or Shake his head.</p>

               <p>[We know my Lords and Gentlemen, that from your hearts you do deplore our condition, yet permit us to tell you, your bravery must extend thus far, as not to sit still, with pity only, but each is to labour for the distressed as far as

in reallity his ability will reach: Some must beseech our Gracious Sovereign for us, others again must undeceive the good, though deluded multitude: therefore all are to remember who are the prime raisers of the storm; and how through our sides they would wound both the King and you: for though their hatred to us our selves is great, yet the enmity out out of all measure increases, because we have been yours, and so shall continue even in the fiery day of tryal.</p>
               <p>Protect us we beseech you then, upon all your former promises, or if that be not sufficient, for the sakes of those that lost their Estates with you; many of which are now fallen asleep: But if this be still too weak, we must conjure you by the sight of this bloody Catalogue, which contains the names of your murthered Friends and Relations, who in the heat of the Battle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance saved many of your lives, even with the joyful lofs of their own.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Sir, in answer to this Paragraph, you oblige us to speak plainer, what before we only intimated to you.</p>
            <p>It was the policy of the Rebels in the beginning of the late War, to harrass the Papists in all parts of the Kingdom. One Reason of it was to make his Majesty Odious; for, the Papists being his Subjects, and having none but him to fly to, it was certain he would do what he could to Protect them, and this would make many Zealous People believe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that what the Rebels pretended was true, <hi>viz.</hi> that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty was a Friend to Popery. Another Reason was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themselves with their Spoils, and to invite the Needy<note place="margin">* <hi>Second Mo derater, p. 43.</hi> Most of them in the begining of the late War (seeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by the Parliament, &amp; exposed to the plunder of the then Soldiery) fled into the King's Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to save their own lives, without taking up Arms to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend others.</note> Rabble with a Prospect of Booty; among which, if they found a string of Beads, or a Crucifix, it serv'd them upon both Accounts, both to fill their Pockets, and to justifie the Cause.</p>
            <p>By this Means you were driven into his Majesties Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; where, besides those that Voluntarily offer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to his Service, many of you were Necessitated to it for a subsistance, and many more of you did not serve him at all, but only shrowded your selves under his Protection. Whereas the Protestant Royallists had no such Necessity, for they might have been welcome to the Rebels, to do as They did; or they might have been Permitted to live quietly at their home. But they chose to do otherwise, and were hated the more for it by the Rebels, because they preferr'd their duty before those Considerations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:47021:24"/>From this account of the Motives that brought us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is easie to Judge how far we are in Debt to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
            <p>First, As for them which <hi>lost their Estates</hi> with us, We remember those things were alledged in their Defence, <note n="*" place="margin">Second Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator, p. 43.</note> which we would have been loth to have admitted in ours. But possibly it was not their Fault that these things were Alledg'd, nor was it to our Advantage that they were not Accepted. For the Rebels, having devour'd these Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens Estates, fell to ours, with the more Colour, and never the less Appetite.</p>
            <p>In your Catolague of those Papists which were Slain in the Service, you have Omitted some names which we are able to Reckon. But perhaps you did this in Design, that you might the more excusably Reckon some names that you ought to have Omitted. So you begin with my Lord of <hi>Carnarvon,</hi> the onely noble man in your Catalogue, who was indeed too negligent of his Religion, till he came to be in view of Death; But then, in his extremities, he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd a Priest of yours, and Ordered the Chaplain <note n="*" place="margin">Mr <hi>Langford</hi>
               </note> of his Regiment to pray with him. If you take this libert of stealing Martyrs, we have Reason to wonder, that you had not taken in one that would have adorn'd your Cause in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>viz.</hi> his Majesty himself; since <hi>Militiere</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">In his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Truth.</note> was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd to publish, that that Blessed and Glorious Prince died of your Religion. Him alone we might weigh against All that ever was good in your Church. But besides, we could reckon you a far greater number of Protestants, than you pretend to do of Papists, that <hi>lost their lives</hi> also <hi>in the Day of Battle.</hi> They lost them joyfully, in hopes to have sav'd his Majesty's Life; and 'twas an Accession to their Joy, <hi>if perchance</hi> they <hi>sav'd any of yours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But did they ever intend their sufferings should go for nothing, or become Ciphers to yours in the day of Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? or that their blood should be made use of to stop the Execution of those Laws for which they shed it? Did they think your <hi>condition</hi> was so <hi>deplorable,</hi> or their own was su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluously fenced and secured against you before the late troubles?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:47021:25"/>Pray Sir do not perswade us to believe a thing so incredible, or to do at the rate as if we did believe it. Rather if you have such an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of your own Faculty; Try what you can do with your own Party, and perswade them to do what is fittest &amp; best for Themselves.</p>
            <p>But because the Genius of your Writing does not give us any such Hopes of You: We shall rather make bold to say something from our selves, by way of Advice, to as many of them as may happen to need it, and are capable to receive it.</p>
            <p>We desire them to content them selves with that condition which they enjoy'd under his Majesties Royal Predecessors: and neither to Disparage those dayes, by endeavouring to perswade the world that they which suffered then for Treason died for Religion; Nor to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue all the Liberties which they now Enjoy, if they may not be allow'd to Exceed the Measures of their Fathers. We wish they would not, for the paring of their nails, make all Christendom ring with Cries of Persecution. We wish them deeply to lay to Heart, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and Peace, and Welfare of their Nation. To abhor him, that could<note place="margin">

We desire them to keep their Religion to themselves: and not lay about them, as some do, to make Proselytes; of which they have had a plentiful harvest in the late Confusions; and if they should think to go on at that rate, we have reason to fear, it would be a means to bring us into Confusion again. We desire them at least not to abuse the weakness of dying persons: nor under pretence of carrying Alms to condemn'd Prisoners, to Convert some of them with Drink, and to Cheat others with hopes of Salvation upon easier tearms than ever God yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd unto Men. We desire them not to hinder the course of Justice, by interposing in the behalf of any Criminal, because he is a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. We desire them to content themselves, as their Fathers have done, with such Priests as are known and protected <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>V. Cambden</hi>'s Eliz. 1602.</note> by the Civil Power; and that They would be pleas'd to demean themselves as Priests ought to do: not disguising themselves like Hectors, or ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with Gentlemen, to poyson the Clubs and Coffee-Houses with Phanatick Discourses, or even with Atheism it self, to destroy all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that they may have their will upon ours. We desire them not to fill the World with their Pamphlets, <hi>Parallels, Philanaxes, Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Apologies,</hi> &amp;c which tend only to the fermenting of Mens Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not at all to the conviction of their Reason. If they please to come into the fair Field of Controversie, we shall not decline them; and we think we are not in Debt to them upon that Account. But for Books of the other sort which are apt only to inflame Parties, and make the People Jealous, and the Government Uneasie, We wish they would spare their Own pains, and consequently Ours. If they will not; let them bear their own blame, and let them Answer it to the world what Occasion they had to give us this trouble of Answering them.</p>
