            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Lawe?</p>
                  <p>22 For it is written that Abraham had
two Sonnes, one by a bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dwoman,
and one by a free woman.</p>
                  <p>23 But he whiche was of the bondwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,

was borne by promise.</p>
                  <p>24 Whiche thinges are figuratiuely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode.
For these are the two
Testamentes, the one from mount
Sinay, begettyng vnto bondage,
which is Agar.</p>
                  <p>25 (For Agar is the mount Sinay in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia,

which is nowe,) and is in

free: which is the mother of vs al.</p>
                  <p>27 For it is written, Reioyce thou bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren

hath many mo chyldren then shee
which hath an husbande.</p>

                  <p>29 But as then he that was borne after
the flesh, persecuted hym that was
borne after the spirite, euen so is it
nowe.</p>
                  <p>30 But what sayth the Scripture? Put
out the seruaunt and her sonne:
for the sonne of the seruaunt shall
not be heyre with the sonne of the
free woman.</p>
                  <p>31 Then brethren, wee are not children
of the seruaunt, but of the Free

you heare the Lawe: doo you knowe the
Lawe? as though hee shoulde saye, I
see verily, that you are ignoraunt of the
Lawe, although you woulde neuer so fayne
bee vnder the Lawe: for if you knewe the
Lawe, and whyther it woulde brynge you,
and from what it woulde hynder you,
doubtelesse you woulde not be, so ready too
take the yoke vppon you. You imagine
too gette freedome by submyttyng your

waye too brynge you intoo perpetuall

when you seeke too meryte, but whyle you
seeke too haue it by deserte, which you can

which you myghte atteyne. And all thys
commeth, bycause you knowe not the
Lawe, for no man wyll wyttingly and
willyngly depryue hymselfe of rewarde,
<pb facs="tcp:13115:5"/>
and thruste hymselfe intoo eternall chral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
See therefore what commeth
of ignoraunce the Mother of Popyshe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion,
and of all errour and superstition,
false Doctrine, and Idolatrie.</p>
            <p>The Papistes are wyse in theyr gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
when they will not haue the people
too knowe the mysteries of their owne
Popishe Religion. For I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that a great number which nowe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynue
in blyndenesse, if they dyd see that
which they handle in the darke, they would
repent that euer they touched it, yea, they
would detest it as much as he that for lacke
of lyghte putteth a toade in hys bosome,
in steade of a byrde, or which taketh vp
dounge in steade of goulde, or drynketh
Poyson in steade of Wyne, when hee
seeth howe hee hath beene deceyued.
And therefore I maye saye too them, as
the Apostle dooth too the <hi>Galathians.</hi>
Tell mee, you that long too bee vnder
the Pope, doo you knowe what Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
meaneth? Doo you knowe whyther it
wyll carye you? I am perswaded, if
you knewe, a great number of you would
soone haue doone with it. But alas howe
<pb facs="tcp:13115:6"/>
should you knowe? Your masters hold best
you should not knowe, fearing you woulde
not follow them,<note place="margin">Iohn. 4.</note> if you sawe whither they
led you. And of vs you will not learne, for
so your masters teache you to worship you
wote not what, and wilfully to refuse all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
whereby you myght be learned
to worship God aright: Howbeit this is
most true, thinke of it as you will, The ende
and drift of Poperie is to carye you from
Christ, and so from God, vnto whom there
is no accesse but by Christ. For that I may
bring so many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersies as are between
the Christians and the Papistes into one,
what other thing doo wee striue for in all
our preachings, but that Christ onely should
be our perfect sauiour &amp; redeemer? What
other thing is sought throughout al partes
of Poperie, but that Christ onely shoulde
not be our King, Sauiour, Redeemer,
hygh Priest, sacrifice and propiciation for
our sinnes, mediatour and aduocate, and his
worde our onely sufficient instruction? But
that the Pope, the Masse, our owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
the merites of Sainctes and inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, Popishe ceremonies, traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
counsels, decrees and decretals, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
<pb facs="tcp:13115:6"/>
and Images, &amp; such like, must needes
challenge no small portion of that honour
and glory, which the holy scripture maketh
proper to God and our sauiour Christ alone.<note place="margin">Apoca. 7. 10.</note>
               <hi>Saluation be ascribed to him that sitteth
vpon the throne of our God, and to the
Lambe.</hi> It is the voyce of all them that
are saued by Christ: And therefore all the
Angelles of God, and all the creatures of
God, ioyne with them in confessyng, that <hi>al
blessyng, glorye, wisedome, thankesge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng,
honour, might, and power ought
to be ascribed to hym for euer and euer.</hi>
Consider this you papistes for your owne
benefite, learne to knowe what poperie is,
before you determine to dye therein. And
as in this general controuersie I haue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the papistes to knowledge and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of their owne groundes and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
so might I runne through euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
errour of theirs: But one or two
may serue for examples: Tell me you that
would eate the naturall body of Christ in
the sacrament, doo you knowe what absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
doo followe of it? O you thinke it a
goodly matter to receiue the body of Christ
into your mouthe. But if you had wit, you
<pb facs="tcp:13115:7"/>
woulde thinke it muche better to receiue
Christ into your hartes, and so to receiue
him, that he should neuer depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence,
for <hi>he dwelleth in our hartes by fayth.</hi>

                  </gap>. 3. 17.</note>
And so doo wee teache men to receiue the
body of Christ by fayth, that he may dwell
with vs for euer: Whereas they that teach
you to receiue the naturall body into your
mouthes, giue no more to fayth, then to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie:

you will say, yea, but it taryeth not with
the wicked. No more it doth with the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
by your owne doctrine, for you haue not
yet determined howe farre it goeth downe
into the stomacke of man, nor howe long it
abydeth, but you all agree, that it abydeth
no longer then the fourmes of breade and
myne remayne vncorrupt, which is not
long after they come into the stomacke: but
this is not all the absurditie that followeth
of that eating. For whyle you streine the
body of Christ into so small a compasse, and
multiply the same into so manye places,
what else doo you, but ouerthrow the truth
of his naturall body? Which if it be not
like ours in all things, except sinne, then
<pb facs="tcp:13115:7"/>
coulde it be no redemption of our bodyes.
Then haue we no hope of resurrection, nor
assumption into heauen, which is grounded
vpon the truth of this naturall body, being
fleshe of our fleshe, and bone of our bone, in
which our nature he suffered death, rose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and ascended into heauen for vs.
But I may not stand vpon these matters.
Tell me you that woulde fayne heare your
olde Latin seruice, doo you knowe what it
was? Uerely a great part of it was such
as you woulde bee ashamed to heare it in
Englishe. But if it had bene nothing else
but the Scriptures of God, and godly
prayers, yet the Apostle in his Epistle to
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> telleth you plainly, that
beyng in a tongue vnknowen, it were not
meere for the Church of God. But to leaue
the Papistes, and returne to the <hi>Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
Tell mee,</hi> sayth S. Paule, <hi>you that
would be vnder the lawe, doo you heare
the lawe, or haue you read the lawe? &amp;c.</hi>
As if he should say, take no heede what men
beside the booke teache you of the lawe, but
looke to the lawe it selfe. The false Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
would haue borne the <hi>Galathians</hi> in
hand, that they must ioyne the obseruation
<pb facs="tcp:13115:8"/>
of the lawe with the fayth of the Gospell:
They woulde not bring them altogether
from Christ, but they woulde match the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
of <hi>Moyses</hi> lawe, with the fayth
of Christ. Wherefore the Apostle wylleth
them to looke what the lawe sayth, and not
what these counterfeyt lawyers sayde. He
willeth them to examine the lawe, whether
it admitteth or alloweth any such mixture
as they woulde bring in, or no? The lyke,
and in a manner the same controuersie, wee
haue nowe with the Papistes, sauing that
the Papistes as verie Antichristians, are
worse then the false Apostles. They agree
both in this, that they ioyne workes wyth
Christ, merits with mercy, man with God,
in the meane of our saluation: but herein
the false Apostles were lesse hurtfull, that
they ioyned the workes of the lawe which
God himselfe required, the Papistes ioyne
works of Superero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation, which are such
as God neuer commaunded, and preferre
them as much more meritorious, then any
workes which God hath prescribed. They
both agree in this, that they place righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
in the obseruation of Ceremonies:
but the Papistes are more blasphemous
<pb facs="tcp:13115:8"/>
then those false Apostles. For they, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they placed righteousnesse in Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
yet it was in such ceremonies as
God himselfe appoynted to be obserued for
a time: but the Papistes place instification
in ceremonies which were neuer of Gods
institution: for Circumcision, the passouer,
with other sacrifices, and rytes of the olde
Testament, had God for their Author: but
holy water, holybread, Pilgrimages and
such like, had neither God nor good man
for theyr founder, but came from Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
the enemye of GOD and Christ.</p>
            <p>And therefore you that would be vnder
the Lawe, looke well to your footyng whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you stande vpon good grounde, for if
righteousnesse come by the Lawe, then
commeth it by suche deedes onely as the
Lawe commaundeth. And if a man may
be iustified by obseruation of Ceremonies,
they must bee such Ceremonies as GOD
hath required, when euen of those which he
hymselfe required, beeing doone otherwise
then hee meant them, hee sayeth:<note place="margin">Esay. 1. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>Who
hath required these thyngs at your han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des?</hi>
At whose handes doo you looke too
receyue the rewarde of righteousnes? is it
<pb facs="tcp:13115:9"/>
not of hym that hath taught you the rule of
ryghteousnesse? Therefore if you wilbe iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifyed
by the Law, looke what be the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
&amp; Ceremonies of the lawe &amp; keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
for god hath not promised the reward but to
hym that obserueth them. <hi>The man</hi> (sayth
hee) <hi>that dooth them, shall lyue in them.</hi>
Geue not eare therefore too the Papistes,
but geue eare too the Lawe, if you hope
too wynne rewarde by obseruing the lawe.
And especially in that poynt, wherein the
false Apostles of <hi>Sainct Paules</hi> tyme, and
the false Apostles of our tyme, agree, that
is, ioyning mans merit with Gods mercy.
Tell mee, you that refuse too bee cleerly see
at lybertie from the bondage of the Lawe
by Christe, and wyll needes bee vnder the
Lawe, doo you know the Lawe? Can you
tell whether God wyll allowe suche a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or no, of woorkes and grace, of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and merits? If the condition of the lawe
will beare suche a medley, no man forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
you, but that you maye seeke righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes
where it may best bee founde: but if
the condition of the Lawe bee so streight,
as it will admit nothyng but a perfecte ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
in him that shall haue the reward,
<pb facs="tcp:13115:9"/>
why will you seeke too establish your owne
righteousnes, and so void your selues cleane
of the righteousnes of God in Christ? And
so whyle you wyll bee iustifyed both by
Christe and by the woorkes of the Lawe,
you shalbee iustifyed neyther by Christe,
nor by the woorkes of the Lawe. For the
Lawe can abyde no transgression, nor the
grace of Christ any satisfaction. And yet
there is perfect righteousnesse in the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of the law: And a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is iustified by
faith, without the works of the law. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the deuils sophistrie concludeth, that
if iustification be by either of these meanes
by it selfe, much rather it must be whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
are both ioyned together. Wherefore wee
must see whether they may be ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or no. Let vs therefore first heare the
lawe. The lawe in deede is a perfect rule
of righteousnesse to iustifie, not the hearers,
but the obseruers: The man that dooth
all thinges commannded by the Lawe,
shall lyue thereby, that is, by his ryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
hath deserued eternall lyfe. But
here is a perfect obseruation requyred, or
else no ryghteousnesse obteyned, no life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued:
for cursed is hee that abydeth not
<pb facs="tcp:13115:10"/>
in all the preceptes of the lawe to doo them.
So that here appeareth a double condition
annexed to the lawe. The one is an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and perfecte obseruation required of
them that shall be rewarded: the other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
curse and damnation threatned
to him that hath transgressed. By which
it is most euident, that the Lawe and the
Gospell, grace and woorkes, merite and
mercye, bee of so contrarie nature, as
it is impossible they shoulde bee ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the atteyning of eternall saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
One transgression if there were but
one in a mannes whole lyfe, and that
neuer so small, yet such is the rygour of the
lawe, as it barreth vs from ryghteousnes,
and maketh vs subiect to the sentence of
Gods cursse. Now let vs on the other side
consider the Gospell, and see whether that
admitteth any mixture of deedes of the
Lawe. By the Gospell <hi>we are assured,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 2.</note>
               <hi>that wee are saued by grace:</hi> but grace is
a woorde of such freenesse, as it ceasseth
to bee grace, if you adde anye thyng to
it. If it bee of woorkes) sayth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle)
then is it not of grace, and if it
bee of grace, then is it not of workes: for
<pb facs="tcp:13115:10"/>
grace were not grace, if it were not free.
And it coulde not bee truely sayde, that
we are iustified freely by his grace through
the redemption of Christ Iesus, if anye
thyng in the worlde came in place of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
besides the redemption of Christ
Iesus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> But let vs heare what the lawe
sayth: <hi>It is written in the lawe</hi> (for so are
all the fyue bookes of <hi>Moyses</hi> accompted)
<hi>that Abraham had two sonnes, one of a
bondmayde, another of a free woman,
the one called Ismael, the other named
Isaac. Ismael was borne of Agar the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian,
which was a bondwoman,
Isaac was borne of Sara the wyfe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
which was a free woman: such
as Agar the mother was, such was Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael
her sonne, and Isaac was free, as
his mother Sara was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fyrst wee must obserue here, that this
comparison is altogether within the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that was a fygure
of the Churche of GOD. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee muste not seeke <hi>Ismaell</hi> and
hys posteritie among them that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
wythout the Churche, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
open hatred agaynst the same:
<pb facs="tcp:13115:11"/>
But euen in the bosome of the visible
Churche, euen in the family of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
those that professe themselues to bee the
sonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, the sonnes of
God, and occupie no small ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mes in the
Churche, but euen the highest oftentimes,
as <hi>Ismael</hi> for a season beyng the first borne
of <hi>Abraham</hi> was accompted as the heyre
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and so the most principal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in all the housholde. Wherefore if we
wil at this day know who be the <hi>Ismaelits,</hi>
we must not looke to the profane nations of
the Turkes and misereantes, that openly
despise the Churche of God, but euen to
those that make the boldest and lowdest
clayme to be heyres of the Churche, euen
the Papistes. They haue their profession,
so had <hi>Ismael,</hi> they haue their tytle, so had
<hi>Ismael,</hi> they stand vpon their prerogatiue,
and so dyd <hi>Ismael.</hi> They will haue a place
in the familie of <hi>Abraham,</hi> yea they wyll
thrust out <hi>Isaac.</hi> They claime (they say) by
the elder tytle, to be heyres of the Churche,
yea they weene they haue the Churche it
selfe in possession. And here it is maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
howe they swell and stande vppon typ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes,
if you seeme to allowe them any place
<pb facs="tcp:13115:11"/>
at all in the Church, though it be but in the
Belfrey, they will streight way perke vp
into the Chancell. But softe a whyle my
masters, we allowe you no other place in
the Churche of God, then that which <hi>Isma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>
sometymes occupyed in the familie of
<hi>Abraham.</hi> And that in deede was no base
roome in outwarde appearance, and in the
iudgement of men. For who was thought
to be the heyre of <hi>Abraham</hi> for sixteene or
seuenteene yeeres, but <hi>Ismael,</hi> the eldest
sonne of <hi>Abraham?</hi> You, who seemed to
haue more right vnto the inheritance of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
then he that had the prerogatiue of
the first begotten. But all the sonnes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
are not the heyres of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
For it is written: <hi>In Isaac shall thy seede
be called.</hi> Wherefore we must not regard
who maketh clayme to the inheritance of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> but who is rightly begotten to
be the heire of <hi>Abraham:</hi> for a bond man is
capable of no inheritance. And the child is
accompted in the ciuill law, of such conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as his mother is. Therefore <hi>Ismael</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
borne of a bond woman, hath no iust ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to be the heyre of <hi>Abraham,</hi> though he
pretend to be his eldest sonne. And he that
<pb facs="tcp:13115:12"/>
was borne of the free woman, though hee
were younger by many yeeres, yet by the
prerogatiue of his free byrth, became the
heyre of <hi>Abraham</hi> his Father. Wherefore
if the Papists and all they that seeke to bee
iustifyed by their workes, be proued to bee
the sonnes of the bond woman, it wyll not
helpe them any thing in the world, that they
haue of long tyme beene accompted as
principal members of the familie of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi>
for it will fall out in the ende, that
they shall be found no better then <hi>Ismaelits</hi>
and <hi>Agarynes,</hi> and haue the same rewarde
that <hi>Agar</hi> and <hi>Ismael</hi> had.</p>
            <p>We haue heard now, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had
two sonnes, of which, the one only was hys
heire. And now let vs see why <hi>Ismael</hi> being
the naturall sonne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; the first
borne, was not the heire, either before <hi>Isaac</hi>
or at leastwise ioyntly with him: here in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deede
standeth all the matter of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
although there be two sonnes, why there
is but one heyre, but it is soone answered,
because there is but one way to come to the
inheritance, and that is onely by promyse,
only by mercy, only by fayth. So the cause
now followeth, why <hi>Ismael</hi> could not be <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:13115:12"/>
heir, and only <hi>Isaac</hi> was: because
<hi>Ismael</hi> was borne after the flesh, and <hi>Isaac</hi>
was borne by promyse. The inheritance
depended wholly vpon the promise, and the
promise altogether vpon the grace of god.
Therefore he that was borne after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
was the heire, &amp; not he that was borne
after the flesh. But this at the first view, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to be straunge, why S. Paule shoulde
say, that <hi>Ismael</hi> was borne after the fleshe,
&amp; <hi>Isaac</hi> by promise. Wheras there seemeth
to be no difference, but that <hi>Isaac</hi> was born
after the fleshe, as <hi>Ismael</hi> was, for he was
conceiued after the maner of al the worlde,
as <hi>Ismael</hi> was. It is the only priuiledge of
our sauiour Christ to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ghost. Wherfore <hi>Isaac</hi> might be thought
to be borne after the flesh, on the other side it
seemeth that <hi>Ismael</hi> was borne by promise.
For <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> was not moued by fleshly lust
to take <hi>Agar</hi> to his wyfe, but by the sugges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Sara,</hi> that he might haue an heyre of
the promise. Why should not <hi>Ismael</hi> then
(whose byrth was sought by so good an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent)
bee saide to be borne after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myse?
And wherefore should <hi>Isaac</hi> bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
to be borne after the flesh, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was
<pb facs="tcp:13115:13"/>
conceyued and borne as <hi>Ismael</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men are? But let vs heare what the
Apostle sayth: <hi>He that was borne of the
bond woman, was borne after the fleshe,
and hee that was borne of the free wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
by promise.</hi> Nowe let vs see howe
<hi>Ismael</hi> was borne after the fleshe, &amp; <hi>Isaac</hi>
by promise. If we looke to the conception
of <hi>Ismael,</hi> we shall see nothing in it, but
carnall and fleshly, not only because it was
altogether according to the course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
but also &amp; chiefly because this deuise
of <hi>Sara,</hi> wherunto <hi>Abraham</hi> consented to
beget children of <hi>Agar,</hi> though it seemed to
come of a good intent, yet was it altogether
carnall and fleshly. But God woulde haue
mans deuise to haue no place in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie
of <hi>Isaac,</hi> because he should be a ryght
figure and patterne of them that are heires
of the promise. For thus the case stood, God
had promised to <hi>Abraham</hi> to giue him the
lande of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to his seede, which
shoulde be as the starres of heauen, and as
the sande of the sea innumerable, that hee
should be the father of many nations, and
that in his seede all the nations of the world
should be blessed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13115:13"/>
Now <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeued this promise
of God, and it was imputed to hym for
righteousnes, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> whyle he contynued sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faste
in this Fayth, GOD seemed too sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
of long tyme the performance of hys
promyse, for <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> waxed old, <hi>Sara</hi> was
both olde and barreyne, so that all hope of
Children betweene them seemed too be cut
of: at laste, thys deuyse came intoo <hi>Saraes</hi>
head, that <hi>Abraham</hi> shoulde take <hi>Agar</hi> the
<hi>Aegiptian</hi> her bondemayde too wyfe, and
so of her should begette Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that should
bee heyres of the promise. No doubte her
ende and purpose was to obteyne that
which God had promysed, and in suche re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and none other, dyd <hi>Abraham</hi> agree
too her deuise. And here we see what good
intents are, if they be not directed by Gods
woorde. For surely the intent of <hi>Abraham</hi>
&amp; <hi>Sara</hi> in this matter, was exceeding good:
but theyr mean which they had deuised, was
starke nought. For it was altogether beside
the word of God: it proceded not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the spirit of man, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flesh
and blood, and therefore it was a mere car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and fleshely deuise, &amp; although it hath
a shewe of great godlynes, yet is there no
<pb facs="tcp:13115:14"/>
spark of godlines in it, for it proceeded not of
faith, but of infidelity: for although <hi>Sara</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
the promise of God to bee true, yet she
thought it could not otherwise be performed
but by this carnall deuise of hers: she would
helpe god to perfourme his promise, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she
thought he was flack in perfourma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; saw
more &amp; more difficulty to grow dayly by the
age of <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> encreasing in weaknes &amp; old
yeares, vnapt for generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; such are al the
deuises of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by which they sek to obtein the
promised inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the kingdom of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they be altogether carnal &amp; fleshly, &amp; procede
o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly of infidelity. For why do they sek to adde
any thing of their own to the most free &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
promise of god, but that they doubt ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his strength or goodwil to perfourme
that which he hath promised? &amp; therfore they
wil help the one w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> laying to the shoulders of
their own stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth &amp; the other they wil procure
by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending the dignity and worthines of
their owne persons, as though God were not
throughly wel pleased in his only begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> son
our Lord &amp; sauiour Christ. By this that hath
been said, I trust you do now vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, how
<hi>Ismael</hi> was born after the flesh, namely that
in his conceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; generation, there can no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered that is heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly &amp; spiritual,
<pb facs="tcp:13115:14"/>
but altogether natural &amp; carnal. For notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
ther was an inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; purpose to beget
an heir of the promis, yet eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
being gouerned by a carnal &amp; fleshly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise,
proued nothing els, but an earthly, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
&amp; fleshly matter. Wherfore he that was
borne of the bond woman, was borne altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
after the flesh. Now let vs see how <hi>Isaac</hi>
was borne by promise. <hi>Isaac</hi> was born of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
the free woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: not by her carnal deuise as
his brother <hi>Ismael</hi> was, but by faith in gods
promise. For <hi>Abraham</hi> was now old, &amp; past
the strength of begetting childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Sara</hi> was
both old &amp; barren, here nature had denied the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
children: flesh &amp; blood had denied the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
humayn reason had denied the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the childe that was now conceyued and
borne, came altogether by promis of God, &amp;
not by strength of man. <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> waxed nowe
stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in fayth, though weake in body, &amp; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
neither his own body as good as dead,
nor the dead wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be of <hi>Sara</hi> his wife, but only

               </gap>t portion of the prayse should
haue been geuen to God. For nature
shoulde haue had one part, because <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
although he were old when he begate
<hi>Ismael,</hi> yet he was not so olde, that he was
past the strength of generation. And as
for <hi>Agar,</hi> shee was lusty, and in the flowre
of her age. What singuler prayse shoulde
God haue had in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ception, other then
<pb facs="tcp:13115:15"/>
in all naturall woorkes? But the chiefe
parte of the commendation, shoulde haue
been challenged by the wysedome of man.
For if this deuise of <hi>Sara</hi> had taken place,
howe muche thinke you woulde shee haue
pleased her selfe in that witty inuention?
And <hi>Abrahams</hi> diligence and indeuour to
put in practise this inuention of theirs,
might haue been thought woorthy of no
small co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation. And in <hi>Ismael</hi> the title
of First begotten, woulde haue thrust in it

            <p>Amongest these matters, euery one set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
foorth it felfe as worthy of the prayse,
I pray you howe small a pittance shoulde
haue been leaft for the promise of GOD?
And as you see it here in the patternes,
so is it moste clearely to be seene in them
that followe these patternes. Whereby the
Papistes shewe them selues most playnly
to be after <hi>Ismael,</hi> chyldren of the fleshe,
the naturall sonnes of the bondwoman,
borne after the fleshe. For that they may
be heyres of the promyse, they ascribe
somethyng to nature, somethyng to mans
wisedome, somethyng to theyr owne indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie,
<pb facs="tcp:13115:16"/>
and by no means they wilbee perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
to receyne the inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce altogether by
Gods promyse. To nature with the heathen
Philosophers, they attribute the beginning
of al vertues in themselues, &amp; such strength,
as without the grace of God they maye dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them selues to an aptnes to receiue the
grace of God, but wyth the grace of God
they may be able to perfourme whatsoeuer
God requyreth at theyr handes. By mans
wisdome, they haue founde out woorkes of
greater price and worthinesse to winne the
fauour of God, then God himselfe in hys
Lawe hath prescribed and appointed. And
as for their own labour &amp; industry, it dooth
in a manner all in all, for thereby nature is
applied to winne grace, grace is exercysed
to merite rewarde, wisdome is practised to
increase merite, which shal not only be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for those that labour in them, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
dooth ouerflowe too the satisfaction of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens sinnes, and too the obteyning of
righteousnesse for other men which fayle
in the measure of their owne. In the
meane tyme, they saye they doo not exclude
the grace of God. No more dyd <hi>Ismael</hi>
the promise of God, but <hi>Ismaell</hi> coulde not
<pb facs="tcp:13115:16"/>
inherite the promyse of God, bycause hee
was borne after the fleshe, no more can
they hee partakers of the grace of GOD
bycause they seeke to procure it by camall
and fleshly meanes. And they only are after
<hi>Isaac</hi> heyres of the promyse, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende
no tycle too the promysed inhery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce
but only the promise of GOD,
which seeke it only by grace, and not by
workes, which obteyne it by Fayth and not
by desertes.</p>
            <p>For neyther nature, nor the wisdome of
man, nor the strength of man, nor the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse
of man, made <hi>Isaac</hi> heir of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
but only Faith in the promyse. These
thynges (sayeth <hi>sainct Paule</hi>) whych are
written of the two Mothers in <hi>Abrahams</hi>
house of contrary condition, and the issue
of them both, are <hi>Allegoricall,</hi> that is figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiuely
or typically to bee vnderstoode.</p>
            <p>For in as muche as <hi>Abrahams</hi> house
was the Churche of GOD, suche no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

were fygures and examples for vs

<pb facs="tcp:13115:17"/>
was a bonde woman ingendring into bon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dage
him that is borne after the fleshe, euen
in that familey, so hath there alwayes bene
in the outward face of the Church, a great
seede and multitude of Heretykes and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrytes,
which haue sought iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by
their owne merytes. Suche wer before the
comming of Christe a great number of the
frowarde and obstynate Iewes, and in the
tyme of Christe, the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seys,
which abusing the doctrine of the law,
contrary to the scope and ende of the Lawe,
sought to establishe their owne righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in obseruation and keepyng of the law:
but in the meane tyme, they became voyde
of the righteousnes of God. And yet thy did
not pretend to exclude the grace of God, as
appeareth righte well in that Phariseye of
whome our Sauiour Christ telleth the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Luke.</hi> 18. against them that trusted in
themselues that they were ryghteous, and
despised other. This Pharisey trusted in
himselfe that hee was righteous, and yet
not without the grace of God. For hee ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
God thankes that he was not as other
men were, or &amp;c. And such for al the world,
as this Pharisey was, are the whole gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb facs="tcp:13115:17"/>
of Papistes. For they wil seeme too
ascribe much to the grace of God, in forme
of words, and almost altogether, and so dyd
the Pharisey. But yet neuerthelesse, hee
with them, and they with hym, are <hi>Ismae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi>
sonnes of the bonde woman, borne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <hi>The two Mothers</hi> (sayth s. <hi>Paule) are the
two couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts or Testaments,</hi> that is, they
represent vnto vs the two <hi>Testamentes,</hi> or
couenants, that God hath made with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
touching their Saluation. For God
hath made two couenantes, one in the
Lawe, the other in the Gospell, the one, the
couenant of Iustice, the other the couenant
of mercy. In the one he requireth perfect
righteousnesse, in the other hee offereth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sinnes. And both these coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauntes
<pb facs="tcp:13115:18"/>
haue a necessary vse to bring vs to
saluation. The Couenauntes of Iustice,
doe shew vs what perfection of rightuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
God requireth, and how farre we are
from it, to humble vs &amp; inforce vs to seeke
rightuousnesse els where then by our owne
desertes. And so the law when it is rightly
vsed, is sayde to be a Schoolemaster vnto
Christ. For God dyd not make that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt
of rightuousnes with vs, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that we should obteyne righteousnesse
by obseruation of the Law, but by settinge
before our eyes, the impossibilytie of the
condition which is required to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and the extreeme sentence of Iustice,
when the condition is broken, to driue vs
altogether from hope of attayning to the
rewarde of righteousnes by workes, and
to cause vs most ioyfully to receiue the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde
Couenaunt of his mercy offered in
Christ. So that the law indeede prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
a rule of perfect rightuousnes, if men
could obserue it, but in as much as no man
was euer able to obserue it (except our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Christ) no man euer was or shall be
iustifyed by it, but by Christ onely. And as
the couenant of Iustice doeth require per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb facs="tcp:13115:18"/>
righteousnesse and geueth no pardon:
so the couenant of mercy giueth righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
freely, &amp; admitteth no satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. These
are those two Couenants that GOD hath
made with mankynde concerninge their
iustifycation &amp; saluation, &amp; more then these
two, he hath not made: so that he which wil
be iustifyed by the law, must looke for no
mercy: and hee that wyll be iustifyed by
grace in Christe, must not thinke of any
merit, worthynesse, or satisfaction of his
owne, but only in Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>What place then haue these mongrels that
make a confusion of grace and merites,
of Fayth and Workes, of the Law and
the Gospell? They haue no place in ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the two Testamentes, the olde nor
the new. If they wyll haue a thyrde way
of Iustifycation, they must shew a thyrde
Couenaunt: yf they cannot shew a thyrde
Couenant, they cannot haue a middle way
of Iustifycation.</p>
            <p>Wee haue shewed good euydence for
the two Couenants, the one of Iustice, the
other of mercye, and how the one Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunte
neyther beareth wyth anye trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressyon,
nor alloweth anye pardon,
<pb facs="tcp:13115:19"/>
the other admitteth no dignity of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
nor alloweth any satisfaction of his, for
his vnworthinesse. Let the Papistes which
wilbee iustified partly by the grace of God,
and partly by their owne merites, let them
I say nowe stande foorth, and shewe vs the
Tables of suche a couenante, if euer God
made any such with men, that he would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyue
them halfe their sinnes, and allowe
them to make amends for thother halfe: let
them shewe their euidence if they haue any,
if they haue none, as there is none mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Scripture, but the two Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
the two Couenantes, the lawe and
the Gospell: what tytle or clayme can they
make to the heauenly inherytance, whereof
they haue no promyse, no Testament, no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
but only a carnal perswasion of their
owne fleshely reason, an earthly Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of humayne wysedome, yea an hellishe
presumption of their prowde worldly affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
whereby they shewe themselues to bee
nothing els but <hi>Agarens</hi> and <hi>Ismaelytes,</hi>
Children of the bondewoman, and borne
after the fleshe, as <hi>Ismaell</hi> their Father
was, whose tytle and clayme vntoo the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
inheritance, was altogether earthly
<pb facs="tcp:13115:19"/>
and carnall, vtterly voyde of the promise
and woorde of God.</p>
            <p>But let vs heare the Apostle descrybing
the two Couenantes. <hi>The one</hi> (sayeth
hee) <hi>is from mount Sinay, gendrying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

therfore which is the fyrst couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to <hi>Agar,</hi> bycause it begetteth into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
as shee dyd, yea mount <hi>Sinay</hi> from
whence the Lawe was published, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

as it were the seede, by which, of <hi>Sinay,</hi>
that is the Church of Hypocrites, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
no Children but vntoo perpetuall

            <p>But here nowe aryseth a doube, howe

Iustification is not sought by Fayth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the deedes of the Lawe, but eyther by
the deedes of the Lawe onely, or by the
deedes of the Lawe and Fayth: then is the
lawe which is holy of it selfe, by this abuse,
made a corrupt seede, of which is concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
these bastardly Hypocrites that false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
chalenge to bee the Sonnes of GOD.
whereas they are in deede the sonnes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
sclauery and bondage. You will say,
they seeke lyberty by this meanes, and not
bondage, but certayne it is, they fynde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng
but bondage: what soeuer they
pretende too seeke. For such is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the lawe, that it bryngeth all men
intoo bondage, that are not set at lyber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye,
by the onely meane which GOD
hathe appoynted for theyr infranchis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente,
whiche is the Redemption of the
Sonne of GOD. Now when these
men that seeke too bee vnder the Lawe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
the onely charter of infranchismente,
<pb facs="tcp:13115:20"/>
which almightye GOD dooth most mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully
offer to gyue them freely, they are
intangled wyth double bondage, and
thraldome both that which is by nature,
whereunto all the sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte,
that are not set at libertie by the sonne
of GOD: and also that which groweth by
theyr omne confession, while they refuse
the freedome offered, and voluntaryly put
their neckes vnder the yoke of the Lawe,
which promiseth no lybertie, but vpon the
keeping of an impossible condition, and
threatneth certein and perpetual bondage,
for euery voluntary, &amp; yet necessary trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.
So that it is impossible for al the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that are vnder the Lawe, eyther to obteyne
the reward which it promiseth, or to avoyd
the punishment which it threatneth. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mount <hi>Sinay</hi> which is <hi>Agar,</hi> &amp; the law
thus abused, begetteth no childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall
sclaues vnto euerlasting bondage.
<hi>(For Agar is mount Sinay in Arabia, and
answereth in figure too that Hierusalem
which is now, &amp; is in bondage, with her
children.)</hi> First let vs here obserue, that
manner of speeche whyche the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
vseth, when hee sayeth that <hi>Agar</hi> is
<pb facs="tcp:13115:21"/>
the mount <hi>Sinay,</hi> whereas it is euydent
that he meaneth that <hi>Agar</hi> dooth figure or
signifie the mount <hi>Sinay.</hi> The Papistes
make great exclamation agaynst those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters,
which in the woordes of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
as they cal them, <hi>This is my body,</hi>
doo expounde est for <hi>significat. This is my
body,</hi> that is, this bread dooth signifye my
body. And a great matter they make of the
verbe <hi>substantiue est,</hi> as though that when
soeuer it is vsed is Scripture, it declareth
a substaunce, and no fygure or sygne of a
substaunce. Howbeyt there bee infynite
places of Scripture, where thys verbe
<hi>substantiue est,</hi> can not bee otherwyse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted,
then for <hi>significat,</hi> and thys our
Texte is one very manifeste place. <hi>Agar</hi>
(sayth hee) <hi>is the mount Sinay in Arabia.</hi>
What? was <hi>Agar</hi> nowe chaunged into
the substaunce of a Mount? who is so
vayde of reason or sense, but he must needes
confesse, that hys meanyng is, <hi>that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi>
dooth sygnifye Mount <hi>Sinay,</hi> or is
a fygure of Mount <hi>Sinay</hi> in <hi>Arabia:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea: but I knowe what will bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.
<hi>Sayncte Paule</hi> speaketh not
here of the <hi>Sacramentes.</hi> That is true,
<pb facs="tcp:13115:21"/>
but when the holy Ghoste speaketh of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes,</hi>
which are holy and Heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
signes, it were more probable too vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande
hys speache fyguratiuely, and
not litterally. Yea it is most vsuall in the
Scripture, when the spirite of God spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> to say they bee
those thinges which they doo but represent
and signifie. As <hi>Circumcision</hi> is called
the couenant, the Lamb is called the Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
Baptisme is called the newe byrth,
and S. <hi>Paule</hi> speaking of the <hi>Sacrament</hi>
of Christes blood sayth, The Rocke was
Christ: And our Sauiour Christ himselfe
sayth, This cuppe is the newe Testament.
In al which speaches there can be no trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation
and chaunge of substances
be vnderstoode, but a signe, a figure, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation.
What then? Doo we make
the <hi>Sacramentes</hi> nothing else but bare
signes, naked figures, and imaginatiue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations?
God forbyd, it is not in
vaine that the ontwarde elementes in the
deuine <hi>Sacramentes</hi> doo beare the names
of those things which they doo represent,
but that God doth truely and in deede per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme
his promises vnto the faithfull, of
<pb facs="tcp:13115:22"/>
which these <hi>Sacramentes</hi> are the seales, to
confyrme their fayth. So God in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
which is the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
dooth worke effectually to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
of the olde man, and renuing of the
newe man, whereby the man that is bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
is made the childe of God. And Christ
in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of his bodye and blood,
dooth truely feede vs wyth hys bodye
and blood which is the onely foode of our
soules, wherby wee are nourished and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
vnto eternall lyfe. But to returne
to the matter: <hi>Agar</hi> in this fygure, dooth
signifye the Mount <hi>Sinay</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> from
whence the Lawe of bondage was giuen,
as <hi>Sara</hi> dooth signifie the Mount <hi>Sion</hi> in
<hi>Hierusalem,</hi> from whence the Gospell of
freedome proceeded. And wee must note
here, that <hi>Sinay</hi> is a mountayne in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart
of <hi>Arabia,</hi> where the lawe of bondage
was proclaimed. Namely we must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that it was altogether out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of the land of promise. It was in the
barren wildernes, not in the land that flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with milke &amp; honye, It was in <hi>Arabia,</hi> &amp;
not in <hi>Canaan.</hi> So that god would signifie,
euen by the place where hee published the
<pb facs="tcp:13115:22"/>
law, that it perteined not to the promise of
his mercy, but to the pacte or Couenant of
his iustice. For the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was
the land of promise, a very fruitfull land, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
in all commodities and pleasures
of this lyfe, which GOD professeth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
vnto the people, that hee gaue it
them, and that without all desert or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse
of theyrs, of his onely goodnesse
and mercy towards them, to fulfyll hys
promyse made to their Fathers. Forbyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them alwayes to thinke or saye that
for theyr owne ryghteousnesse God had
chosen them, to cast out those nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, putting them ofte in mynde
that they were a frowarde and stiffnecked
people, and howe many wayes they had
deserued that God shoulde vtterly haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
them, as <hi>Moses</hi> preacheth to them
in <hi>Deuteronomie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore the lande of <hi>Canaan</hi> was
to them a <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the Kingdome
of Heauen, which beyng an inheritance
of most gloryous and eternall felicitie,
no man shall attayne vnto, by his owne
merytes or woorthinesse, but onely by
the mercye of God. No more then the
<pb facs="tcp:13115:23"/>
               <hi>Israelites</hi> were brought into the lande of
promise in respecte of their owne deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings,
but only by the promise of GOD.
Now farre without the bondes of this holy
lande, in a deserte and solitarie place, in a
barraine and vnfruitefull soyle, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
grewe for the sustentation of mannes
life, where water wanted for the necessarie
vse of man and beast, euen there God chose
a harde stonie and craggie rocke to be the
pulpet from whence he thundred out the
Lawe of Iustice, with most terrible lightes
and noyses, to signifie that by the Cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of his ryghteousnesse, no man shoulde
looke for any fauour or grace, but that all
they that were founde transgressors of this
law, should vndoubtedly incurre the paines
of eternall condempnation. This was
Mount <hi>Sinay</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> This was <hi>Agar</hi>
the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> This was the mother of <hi>If<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,</hi>
This is the nobilitie of the sonnes of
bondage.</p>
            <p>But he proceedeth, and. sayth that <hi>Agar</hi>
or <hi>Sinay</hi> answereth in figure or similitude
to that <hi>Hierusalem</hi> which is nowe, and is
in bondage with her children. Some tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations
reade that <hi>Sinay</hi> bordereth vppon
<pb facs="tcp:13115:23"/>
               <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> but that is neither true in the
litterall sense, nor agreeth with the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Apostle in this figure, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
the Greeke worde which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
vseth. For mount <hi>Sinay</hi> dooth not bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
vppon <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> but is farre distant
from it by certaine hundreth myles. But
the worde which the Apostle vseth, doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
a respect or relation of one thing to an
other. And so he meaneth that Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay</hi>
hath respect to that <hi>Hierusalem</hi> which
is nowe, which is, to the earthly <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
because the earthly <hi>Hierusalem</hi> did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
in figure to <hi>Agar,</hi> &amp; not to <hi>Sara,</hi> to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,</hi>
&amp; not to <hi>Sion.</hi> And why so? Because she
was now degenerated &amp; gone out of kind,
as the Prophet complayneth:<note place="margin">Esay. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>How is the
faithfull Citie become an Adulteres?</hi>
Because she sought to bee iustified by the
Lawe that was giuen in Mount <hi>Sinay,</hi> and
refused the grace of Christ, that was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
on Mount <hi>Sion.</hi> She should haue been
a liuely Image of the heauenly <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
if shee had accepted the Gospell of
Christ, but nowe by refusing the same, shee
answereth in figure to <hi>Sinay</hi> the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of <hi>Arabia,</hi> to <hi>Agar</hi> the mother of
<pb facs="tcp:13115:24"/>
               <hi>Ismael,</hi> and is in bondage, with her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Shee was called with her children to
libertie and freedome by the sonne of God,
who onely hath authoritie to set at libertie
those that were in bondage, but they proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refused it, and stoode vppon their prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue,
saying, We are the seede of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
wee haue not serued any man, howe
sayest thou that wee shall bee made free?
They woulde not vnderstande that euerye
one that committeth sinne, is the seruant of
sinne, and cannot haue eternall abyding in
the house.<note place="margin">Iohn. 8. 67.</note> They woulde not acknowledge
that the Sonne of GOD who alwaye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bydeth
in the house, hath Authoritie to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchise
them, and that they could not be
delyuered from the bondage of sinne, but by
him. Therefore they ramayne styll in
bondage without hope of deliuerance. For
the Adultresse <hi>Hierusalem</hi> theyr mother,
hauing nowe embraced a seruyle doctryne
and Religion, is become <hi>Agar</hi> or <hi>Sinay,</hi>
whose qualities and condition she doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
represent. Wherefore although they
doo with full mouthe neuer so proudlye
boast themselues to be the seede of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
they are neuerthelesse, the sonnes of
<pb facs="tcp:13115:24"/>
               <hi>Agar.</hi> And no greater priuiledge they haue
by beyng the sonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi>
had, who also was the Sonne of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
but after the fleshe onely, and not
after the spirit. Wherefore though <hi>Sinay</hi>
in distance of place be farre of from <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
yet in qualitie and condition they
are altogether lyke, for they are both ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyle,
the doctrine of them both ingendreth
to bondage.</p>
            <p>Thus you see how <hi>Hierusalem</hi> which is
nowe, <hi>that is,</hi> the earthly <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
by reteyning the doctrine and religion of
bondage, and refusing the doctrine and
Religion of freedome, is become <hi>Sinay</hi>
of <hi>Sion, Agar</hi> of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> A good
admonition for vs al, to take heede, that
wee doo not imbrace the doctrine of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
but most ioyfully and thankefully
receyue the glad tydings of libertie. That
wee maye beware by the punishment of
<hi>Hierusalem,</hi> to refuse freedome offered,
least wee bee chrust into perpetuall bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.
No Citie nor people in the worlde
had greater priuiledges of honour, then
the Citie and people of <hi>Hierusalem:</hi> And
yet we see nowe, how iustly <hi>Hierusalem</hi> is
<pb facs="tcp:13115:25"/>
turned into <hi>Sinay,</hi> freedome into bondage,
glory into shame, that we should not stande
vpon any prerogatiues or priuiledges, as
though any thing could exempt vs from the
seueritie of Gods iudgement, if wee reiect
the grace of God when it is freely offered.
If <hi>Hierusalem</hi> escaped not punishment for
all her dignitie, what shall become of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
or <hi>Babilon</hi> which haue no preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
of dignitie, if they being called to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
doo still continue in bondage? And here
we haue an example whereby to shape the
Papistes an answere, for all that they can
bring, to commende the dignitie of theyr
Churche of <hi>Rome.</hi> For the present time, or
that hath been these many hundreth yeres,
they can speake little good of her, if they
will speake the truth that all men doo see
with their eyes in this age, or may reade in
stories of the former ages, written by their
owne Registers: but they haue a great
glory to bring forth the auncient commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of fayth which the Scriptures and
olde doctors doo ascribe vnto the Churche
of <hi>Rome,</hi> the godly conuersation of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rient
Christian <hi>Romanes,</hi> the multitude of
Constant Martyrs which that Churche did
<pb facs="tcp:13115:25"/>
yeelde in the space of two or three hundreth
yeeres, but all in vayne, yea all to their
greater shame, except they can proue the
same fayth, conuersation, and Christian
constancie, to remaine now in the Churche
of <hi>Rome,</hi> that was in those golden dayes of
the primitiue Churche. S. <hi>Paule</hi> in deede
commendeth the fayth of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> to
be celebrated in all the world, which place
the Papistes thinke to make much for the
dignitie of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> But let them
shewe that the Pope and hys Churche of
<hi>Rome</hi> doo nowe hold the same fayth whych
S. <hi>Paule</hi> praysed in the <hi>Romanes</hi> of hys
time, or else it maketh nothing in the world
for the Churche of <hi>Rome</hi> nowe, but to her
shame and reproche, which is degenerated
from that doctrine of libertie which of olde
time was wont to be imbraced in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
The fayth of the <hi>Romanes</hi> of that time,
which S. <hi>Paule</hi> commended, was this, that
a man is iustified by faythe without the
deedes of the lawe. Is this the doctrine of
the Churche of <hi>Rome</hi> according to the true
meaning of S. <hi>Paule</hi> and the whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of his Epistle to the <hi>Romanes?</hi> Do
they not teache the contrarie directly, that
<pb facs="tcp:13115:26"/>
a man cannot be iustified by faith only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the workes of the lawe? Wherfore see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Romanes</hi> that are nowe, haue a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
faith to the <hi>Romanes</hi> of olde time,
there is no cause why they should claime the
auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t prayse, which haue not retained the
auncient fayth. And forasmuch as they
are fallen from the grace of Christ to
seeke ryghteousnes by their owne merits,
there is no reason why they shoulde haue
the commendation of the fayth of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
which haue submitted themselues to
to the bondage of the Lawe.</p>
            <p>And if <hi>Hierusalem</hi> that is nowe, be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into <hi>Agar,</hi> and the earthly <hi>Sion</hi> into the
barreyn <hi>Sinay,</hi> because shee hath despised
the promise of mercy &amp; redemption which
the auncient <hi>Hierusalem</hi> and Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>Sion</hi> in
the tyme of the godly Parriarches and
Prophetes most ioyfully receyued: why
shoulde <hi>Rome</hi> that is nowe, wyth her seuen
hylles, appointed for the throne of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chryst,
enioye the prayse of the auncyent
<hi>Romanes</hi> and the Christian Churche
that sometyme was a straunger in that
place, whom nowe shee persecuteth, and
condemneth their fayth for Heresie? Shee
<pb facs="tcp:13115:26"/>
cannot bee taken for the heauenly <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
that professeth the seruyle doctrine and
Religion of the earthly <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can her children the Papists, be taken
for Citizens of the heauenly <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
which thinke so great a part of religion to
consist in going a Pilgrimage to the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Hierusalem.</hi> The Apostle here vtterly
reiecteth <hi>Hierusalem</hi> that is nowe, and
thrusteth her out of the lande of promyse,
into <hi>Arabia</hi> the desatte. The Papistes
make no accompte of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> that is
aboue, but all their delight is in <hi>Hierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi>
that is on earthe, so they shewe themselues
right <hi>Agarens</hi> &amp; <hi>Ismaelites.</hi> What a great
matter is made in Poperie of <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
that is now? yea although it be in the hands
of <hi>Turkes</hi> &amp; <hi>Paganes,</hi> yet they so esteeme it,
that they thinke they should haue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
treasure in the world, if they coulde get
the possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that citie, out of the <hi>Paganes</hi>
handes. And for that purpose howe manye
thousand men haue lost their liues in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises
that haue beene aduentured, to
gayne that place out of the <hi>Turkes</hi> &amp; <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans</hi>
dominions?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13115:27"/>
What an hygh poynt in Religion is
it made of the Papistes, to visite <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
that is nowe? yea it is a matter of
so great importance, that the vowe which
one hath made to go on Pilgrimage to
<hi>Hierusalem,</hi> cannot be dispensed withal,
by any other inferiour person, but euen by
the Popes owne holynesse hymselfe. Such
a goodly matter it is to be a Citizen of the
earthly <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let the Papistes alone with theyr
holy mother the earthly <hi>Hierusalem</hi> mount
<hi>Sinay</hi> or <hi>Agar,</hi> and let vs returne to the
comparison of the Apostle, which saith: But
<hi>Hierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is aboue, is free, which
is the mother of vs al:</hi> wee heard before,
that there were two mothers in the familie
of <hi>Abraham, Agar,</hi> and <hi>Sara: the</hi> one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
into bondage, the oher vnto liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
wee harde also that these mothers doo
signifie two Couenants, or two Churches,
and that <hi>Agar</hi> signifieth the Couenant of
Iustice, or <hi>Hierusalem</hi> that is nowe, the
Churche of Hypocrites, which abuse this
couenant in seeking to be iustified therby,
which was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to direct vs to the couenant
of mercy: Now must we consider <hi>Sara</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:13115:27"/>
seconde mother, which was a freewoman,
how she was a figure of the new couenant,
and of the heauenly <hi>Hierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that is the
mother of all the Children of God. The
first couenant in Mount <hi>Sinay</hi> what it was,
namely the Couenant of righteousnesse, we
haue sufficiently declared alreadie. The
seconde Couenant of mercy is excellently
well described, by the Prophet <hi>Ieremie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ieremie. 31.</note>

               <hi>Chap. 8. Beholde the dayes
come (sayeth the Lorde) that I wyll
accomplishe with the house of Israel
and Iuda a newe Couenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. Not accordyng to the Couenant
which I made wyth theyr Fathers in
the daye when I tooke them by the
hande to bryng them out of the
lande of Egypt: for they themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
abyde not in my Couenant, and
I regarded them not (sayeth the
Lorde.)</p>
            <p>10. For this is the Couenant that I will
make with the house of Israel. After
those dayes (sayth the Lorde) I wyll
gyue my Lawes into their myndes,
and wryte them in theyr hartes:
<pb facs="tcp:13115:28"/>
And I wil be their God, and they shal
be my people.</p>
            <p>11 And they shall not teache euery man
his neyghbour, and euery man hys
brother, saying, Knowe the Lord: for
they shall al know mee from the least
to the greatest of them:</p>
            <p>12 For I wyll bee mercyfull to their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryghteousnesse,
and I wyll no more
remember their sinnes, and their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</p>
            <p>Beholde this is the newe Testament,
this is the seconde Couenant of mercy, not
written in Tables of stone as the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
of iustice was, but in the fleshely
Tables of our hartes, by the spirite of
GOD. Of this Couenant <hi>Sara</hi> was a
lyuely fygure, when shee brought forth
<hi>Isaac,</hi> not by course of nature, or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
deuyse as <hi>Ismael</hi> was begotten: but
by the power of GOD, accordyng to
hys promyse. For by the doctrine of this
couenant, the children of God, are borne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
libertie, through faith. For to those that
receiue Iesus Christ, he giueth this digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that they should be the sonnes of God,
eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to those that beleeue in his name, which
<pb facs="tcp:13115:28"/>
are not borne of blood, nor of the will of the
fleshe,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1. 12. 13.</note> nor of the will of man, but of God.
And this is that lawe that commeth out of
<hi>Sion.</hi> that word that proceedeth out of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
which proclaimeth libertie &amp; free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from <hi>Sion.</hi> to all them that embrace
Christ by faith. The same godly matrone
<hi>Sara,</hi> being the mother of the faithfull, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a figure of the true Church of god which
is no earthly Citie flourishyng in worldly
dignity, but is altogether heauenly and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,
<hi>Hierusalem that is aboue, is the
mother of vs all.</hi> For although a great
number of children be dispersed ouer al the
worlde, yet is shee heauenly, because shee
hath her beginnyng of the heauenly grace,
and dwelleth aboue by Fayth: and those
her Children which are in the worlde,
are but Pilgrymes and straungers on the
earth, for their conuersation and dwelling,
theyr Franchise and libertie is in heauen,
from whence <hi>they looke for a Sauiour.</hi>

The word of promise and couenant of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
is that incorruptible seede, by which
she conceiueth children, &amp; heires vnto God:
In the same she hath milke for hir infantes,

they come of yeeres apt to enioye their

<hi>Heauenly Hierusalem the mother of vs
all,</hi> that are Gods Children, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all Heretikes and Scismatykes that
bee not Chyldren of thys one mother, are
excluded from beyng Chyldren of God.
Here also wee see that the Churche is
Catholike or Uniuersall, and howe shee
is Catholike or Uniuersall, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specte
of euerie great multitude, that
challengeth her to bee theyr mother, but
shee is the mother of all the faythfull, of

to the Couenant of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and not of the wyll or workes, meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
or worchynesse of man, but of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

            <p>The thyrde condition, she is heauenly,
<pb facs="tcp:13115:29"/>
shee is from aboue, shee is not bounde to
any place vpon the earth. No she hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken

And thinke you she wil forsake heauen

all the inchanters and <hi>Sorcerers</hi> of <hi>Aegipt</hi>
and <hi>Babilon,</hi> cannot drawe her down from

wee wilbe Children of the freewoman, wee

where our Mother dwelleth, and not too a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in Heauen, for <hi>she is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of vs al,</hi> that are the Children of God.
We learne here, that if we be true children
of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> that is aboue, what manner
lyfe and conuersation beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vs, namely
such as our Mother is, yea and our Father
also, heauenly, Godly, Spirituall. Besides
thys, in that <hi>Hierusalem</hi> is aboue, wee see
howe madde the furie and rage of Tyraants
is, that thinke by persecutyng her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
which are straungers on earthe, they
can destroye and vanquishe her that is in
<pb facs="tcp:13115:30"/>
Heauen, whereas when they haue done the
vttermost that their rage leadeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto,
that is, to kyll their bodies, they do but send
home the Children to theyr Mother, who
as long as shee is great with Childe, by the
seede of the Gospell, shee still traueleth in
birth in bryngeth foorth men Chyldren,
which vnder their Prince and eldest Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the mother and the Children, vntill hee
bee caught by the heeles, and throwne into
the bottomlesse lake that burneth with fyer

            <p>The fourthe condition of the Church is,
that she is free, and therfore bringeth forth
Children vntoo freedome. Shee is free, in
that she is redeemed and bought out of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
by the blood of the Sonne of God,
that she might be holy and vnspotted before
hym, not hauyng her owne ryghteousnesse,
wherewith she is adorned, but the garment
washed in the blood of Christ, which is the
righteousnesse of <hi>Sainctes,</hi> Thus is shee a

that are made free from sinne and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,
to serue the Lorde GOD their
<pb facs="tcp:13115:30"/>

the dayes of their lyfe. By this that hath
beene sayde, it is manifest, that the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not the Church of Christ, for
she is earthely, glysteryng in Earthly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye,
maynceyned by carnall strength and
wysdome, mainteyning the Doctrine of
bondage, and persecutyng the Gospell of
lybertye. Here also is decyded a great

vs, whether the Catholyke Churche of
Christe bee vysible yea or no. The Papy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
stoutely mainteyne, that the Catholike
Churche is vysible, that is, apparant and
open to bee seene to the eyes of all men, and
they thynke it the strongest reason they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue,
eyther too defende their Churche, or to
impugne ours, that their Church hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
beene and yet is vysible, and in the
open veywe of the world, when our Church
wythin these hundreth yeares, was dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
intoo Corners and not too bee spyede
excepte it were in a fewe persecuted mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
The grounde they stande vppon
is a wrong Interpretation of the saying of
our Sauiour Chryste in the. 5. of <hi>Saincte
Math.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 5. 14.</note> A City that is builded vpon an hill
<pb facs="tcp:13115:31"/>
               <hi>cannot be hidde.</hi> But thys perteyneth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the Cytie of <hi>Rome,</hi> although it be
builded not on one, but vpon seuen hils, For
our Sauiour Christ (as the whole contexte
of his speach doth euydently declare) spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not there of the Catholike Church, but
of hys Apostles that were appoynted to be
the light of the world, &amp; therfore must needs
be seene, were as a Cytie which is buylded
on a hyll, and therefore coulde not bee hyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
exhorting them therefore to gyue good
example of lyfe and doctrine, bycause their
place was such, as their example could not
bee secret, but open and manifest, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
eyther very profitable or very hurtfull.
But this place, (which euery man must
confesse to bee vnderstood of the Catholyke
Church) doth most clearly declare, that the
Catholike Church neither is, nor can be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and subiecte too the eyes of any man,
but onely them, that are indewed with the
eyes of Fayth. For hee sayth that <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
is aboue, shee is in Heauen, euen
shee that is the Catholyke and vniuersall
Mother of vs all, and therefore shee is not
to be seene but by the eye of Fayth. Let the
Papists still glorie in their visible Church,
<pb facs="tcp:13115:31"/>
let them acknowledge none other Mother
but their visible Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we will
boldly defy them and the whoore their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for the Heauenly and Spirituall <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
that is aboue, is the mother of
vs all.</hi> And thys the Apostle proueth by the
Testimonie of <hi>Esaye,</hi> taken out of the. 54.
Chapter, that the Church bryngeth foorth
lawfull sonnes and heyres too God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
too the promyse, euen of the gentiles.
For in as muche as the <hi>Galathians</hi> were
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> hee bringeth foorth the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
promyse made vntoo the Church of
the Gentyles, that (although of long tyme
shee were barreyne and had no husbande,
and therefore brought foorth no Children
too GOD, yet the tyme should come, that
God woulde ioyne her as a chaste virgyn
in mariage vntoo Chryste, and then shee
shoulde bee more fruitfull, and brynge forth
moe Children vntoo God, then euer dyd the
Church of the Iewes, when shee was the
spouse of God so many hundred yeares, all
which time the other was barren, desolate,
and had no husbande. So brethren (sayeth
he) we are after <hi>Isaac</hi> Children of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
Not only those that are the carnall
<pb facs="tcp:13115:32"/>
seede of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Isaac,</hi> but all those
that take holde of the promyse of God by
fayth. For what prerogatiue of dignity had
<hi>Isaac</hi> too bee the Sonne of God more then
<hi>Ismaell:</hi> bycause hee was the carnall leede
of <hi>Abraham:</hi> so was <hi>Ismaell:</hi> Bycause hee
was the firste begotten of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that
was hee not, but <hi>Ismaell</hi> was: nothyng
then but the promyse of GOD made <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac</hi>
the Sonne of GOD, and the same
promyse extendeth too all nations of the
worlde as largely and in as ample man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as too the carnall seede of <hi>Abraham
Isaac</hi> or <hi>Iacob.</hi> In thy seede shall all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the worlde bee blessed.</p>
            <p>Therefore Brethren wee are after <hi>Isaac,</hi>
not by carnall generation, but by spirituall
regeneration, Children of the promyse.</p>
            <p>For the onely Pryuyledge that made
<hi>Isaac</hi> the Sonne of GOD, was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myse
of GOD, and that also maketh vs
the sonnes of GOD. What made <hi>Iacob</hi>
too bee preferred before <hi>Esaw,</hi> who was
the Sonne of <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Sonne
of <hi>Isaac,</hi> yet <hi>Iacob</hi> was loued, and Esaw
was hated? Whereby (I saye) was <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
preferred to bee the heyre of <hi>Isaac</hi> his
<pb facs="tcp:13115:32"/>
Father, but by the election of GOD? It
is therefore of the election, grace, mercy,
and promyse of GOD, that any man is
aduanced to this honour to bee the Sonne
of GOD, and not of any meryte, dignity,
or worthynesse of a man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But euen as then hee that was borne
after the fleshe, persecuted hym that
was borne after the Spirit, euen so is
it nowe.</hi> By these woordes the Apostle
comforteth the <hi>Galathians</hi> and all other,
that were true Children of the Church, and
armeth them to patience, assuryng them
that of the Hypocryticall Churche of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritmongers,
they should looke for nothyng
else but persecution. For it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyle
if those proude sclaues, the Chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the Earthelye <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> dyd
vntoo the Sonnes of the Heauenly <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
as Ismaell</hi> theyr Father dyd to
<hi>Isaac</hi> the true heyre, boastyng of hys byrth
righte. For suche is the swellyng pryde
of that slauysh generation, that although
they bee altogether bondemen and thrall
vnto perpetuall distruction, yet doo they
moste arrogantly contemne and despyse
all other, that professe not the same waye
<pb facs="tcp:13115:33"/>
of Iustification that they doo.</p>
            <p>Therefore our Sauiour Christe telleth
a parable agaynste them that trusted in
them selues, that they were ryghteous,
and desprsed other. For they that be once
so proude as to iustifie them selues, they
will also contemne and despyse others. Of
this contempte aryseth their cruell mynde,
whereby they doo also persecute them.</p>
            <p>Thus the false Apostles that preached iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
partly by Christe, and partly by
obseruation of the Lawe, raysed persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
agaynst the true Apostles, that taught
iustification by grace of Christe only, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
by Faith alone without the deeds of
the law, and al them that receyued the same
moste co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable doctrine. And their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours
the Papistes, are nothyng behynde:
for they neuer cease to the vttermost of their
power, too persecute and afflicte the true
Children of promyse with all kynde of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
that they can deuyse, to maynteyne
the proude perswasion of their owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
and too deface the glorye of the
mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te free and plentyfull Redemption of
Christe. But for as much as the Apostle
here sayeth, <hi>that hee that was borne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:13115:33"/>
the fleshe, persecuted hym that was
borne after the spirite,</hi> wee haue to see,
what kynde of persecution this was, by
which <hi>Ismael</hi> persecuted <hi>Isaac.</hi> For in al
the story of <hi>Ismael</hi> there is no mention of
persecution, but onely in the 21. Chapter
of <hi>Genesis,</hi> where it is written, that at
such time as <hi>Abraham</hi> made a great feast
at the weaninge of his sonne <hi>Isaac,</hi> and
there was great ioye and reioycing on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
syde for <hi>Isaac</hi> that was <hi>Abrahams</hi>
sonne by <hi>Sara</hi> according to the promyse of
GOD, <hi>Ismael</hi> which was then in the
house, a prowde Ladde of syxteene or
seuenteene yeares olde, scorned and moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
his younge Brother <hi>Isaac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This derysion and skorninge, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
compteth for persecution, and not
without great cause, for it shewed the
prowde stomacke of <hi>Ismael</hi> that contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and dispised hym whom GOD had
chosen, secondlye it declared his inwarde
hatred and cruell minde that hee bare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Brother whom he so contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyoustye
deryded, workynge hym all the
spighte and villanye that hee could and
durst. And chiefely it deserued to bee
<pb facs="tcp:13115:34"/>
called persecution, because he scorned and
mocked the grace and election of GOD.
Wherefore though hee dyd not persecute
hym with the Sword which he coulde not,
yet hee persecuted him with his scornefull
reproches, which is worse, because he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
and trode vnder his feete, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of GOD whereof <hi>Isaac</hi> was made
an heyre by the mercy and grace of God.
And verely there ought no persecution to
be so greeuous vnto vs, as when wee se the
grace of GOD vpon which our vocation
is grounded, to be trodden vnder foote and
defaced with the prowde tauntes &amp; scornes
of the vngodly: yea it is the fountayne and
beginninge of all persecutions, when the
wicked doe hate and despise the grace of
GOD in his chosen, as appeareth moste
playnly in the story of <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Abel:</hi> yea
our Sauiour Christe hymselfe no doubte
was more greeued with that blasphemous
mock of the proude persecuting <hi>Iewes, He
trusted in God, let hym take hym if hee
wyll haue hym. &amp;c.</hi> then with their buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge,
scourginge, and naylynge of hym.
And as the glory of GOD ought to bee
more deare vnto vs then our owne lyues,
<pb facs="tcp:13115:34"/>
so ought we to be more greeued at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing
of Gods glory by the scorning and
deriding of the vngodly, then at any bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
Tormentes, or at the losse of our owne
liues. For there is no kinde of persecution
more detestable, then that, by whiche the
saluation of our scules is assaulted, as it is
by the proude taunts &amp; scornes of gods eni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mies
both Papistes and Atheistes, who
when their cruell rage is restrained, that
they cannot persecute vs by fire and sword
as their desyre is, then they blaspheme the
grace of GOD, in our election and voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with most bitter and contumelious
scorning and derisyon. So that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of GOD and all they that wyll liue
godlye in Christe Iesus, shal neuer want
persecution. For if the bloody sworde bee
wrung out of the Tyrauntes handes, yet
wyll they not cease to persecute, vnlesse
their tongues also were pulled out of their
heades. For they that are borne <hi>after the
flesh,</hi> that is, al Hipocrites and Iustifyers
of them selues, wyll euer playe <hi>Ismaels</hi>
parte, if they can doe nothinge els against
the Children of promise.</p>
            <p>And this is the grounde of the hatred of
<pb facs="tcp:13115:35"/>
the papistes against vs. But to conclude,
what shall be the ende of these persecuting
scorners? Aske not the worlde, for the
world thinketh that such holy Hipocrites
are the chiefe pillers of the Church, and
principall members of the same. They
them selues saye: that they onely are the
Churche, and that the sonnes of promise
shall haue nothinge to doe there, but by
there licence. But what saith the scripture?
The scripture will not flatter them, the
scripture wyll not dissemble with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cast out the bond woman &amp; her sonne,
for the sonne of the bondwoman shall
not inherit with the sonne of the free
woman.</hi> These were in deede the wordes
of <hi>Sara</hi> vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> but they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrmed
by the Oracle of god, which willed
<hi>Abraham</hi> to follow the worde of <hi>Sara</hi> in
al that she had sayde. Therefore this is the
sentence of GOD, though <hi>Ismael</hi> keepe a
sturre in the house a longe time, and beare
hymselfe bolde on his birthright as though
he wolde bee the onely heyre, persecuting
the right heyre <hi>Isaac</hi> with tauntes &amp; scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge,
yet at the length he is thrust out of
dores with that prowde dame <hi>Agar</hi> hys
<pb facs="tcp:13115:35"/>
mother, that dispised her misteris <hi>Sara,</hi> and
vtterly reiected from the inheritaunce.</p>
            <p>There were a great number of s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ruauntes
which taryed in the house when <hi>Ismael</hi> the
first begotten was thrust out. What was
the cause that they taryed? Because they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced
the grace of God in <hi>Isaac,</hi> which
<hi>Ismael</hi> contemned. The same e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
the popish <hi>Agar</hi> and all the <hi>Isma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi>
her children, though they boast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to be the onely Churche, so that they
woulde seeme to thrust <hi>Isaac</hi> and his seede
out of the dores, yet the scripture hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
their ende longe a goe, and of all
other hypocrites whiche now are mixed
they shall be seuered, which occupye great

            <p>Let vs therefore thankfullye embrace the
