         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

by a Charge againſt me,
in which I doubt not (and ſo
the reſt of the Gentlemen under
this miſ-fortune with me) to give
a ſatisfactory accompt of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
therein: And for that
which concerns my ſelf, I ſhall give this Anſwer to it:</p>
            <p>I cannot undertake to charge my memory (at
this time) to give particular and poſitive anſwers to
thoſe paſſages at <hi>Oxford,</hi> which received a full
debate in the Houſe of Commons two yeares ſince;
I doe not finde any new matter in this Charge,
ſave what I have (together with Mr. <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap>
who was a Commiſſioner with me there) then
gave accompt of, when we were accuſed by the
Lord <hi>Savill;</hi> And this Houſe was ſo fully ſatisfied
(after a full debate held ſeverall daies thereon, that
it was <hi>Reſolved upon the Queſtion, July</hi> 21. 1645. (by
this Houſe) <hi>That the matter of the report ſhould be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
and finally laid aſide.</hi> And for the truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
to manifeſt my innocency, and diſcover the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of the Lord <hi>Savill,</hi> who was then my Accuſer,
I ſhall refer my ſelfe to the Papers which concerne
my then Examinations, and the reſolutions of the
Houſe thereon.</p>
            <p>And thus much I am informed ſince concerning
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114366:3"/>
his Lordſhip, that he hath been much troubled at
what he then did; and (to teſtifie his remorſe for

long ſince, to me, to give me aſſurance thereof, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
declaring from him, <hi>That when his Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was made with the Parliament, and was paſſed by
both Houſes, he would then diſcover unto me how that
whole buſineſſe was laid againſt me, and who they were
that laid it; which when I knew, I ſhould ſee I had no
cauſe to be ſo angry with him, and therefore I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
by a Peere of the Re<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lme, (who came from him
not to be againſt him in ſetting the fine for his compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition;
telling me that his Lordſhip durſt not diſcover
it before, but when his Compoſition was paſſed, he
would let me know the particulars, the le<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt inckling
whereof (to come from him to their knowledge, in whom
he was in danger) might prove his ruine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet I can aſſure you (to ſpeak it without vanity)
I (knowing my own innocency) paſſed by it, never ſo
much as ſending to the Lord <hi>Savill</hi> about it, nor do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Lordſhip any diſ-ſervice for his former malice
againſt me.</p>
            <p>And as for the Letter ſent from the Earl of <hi>Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi>
to me, containing (as I am charged) ſome ſecret
deſigne. It is true, I received a Paper from him,
after which it was my unhappineſſe to fall ſick,
which made me to forget it for ſome time; yet ſo
ſoone as it came to my minde, I did acquaint the
Houſe with it; the contents of it was (in a line or
two, very ſhort) a recommendation of the bearer,
the Lord <hi>Savill:</hi> I had then the words freſh in my
minde, and did then repeate them in the Houſe, at
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114366:3"/>
which time the Houſe was ſo far ſatisfied therein,
that this Houſe <hi>Reſolved upon the Queſtion,</hi> July 19.
1645. <hi>That the receiving of that note, in the manner as
I did, was no holding of intelligence with the Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the Paper it ſelf, I do not know what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
of it, or whether I burnt it, as perhaps I might.</p>
            <p>Now for that part of the Charge which chargeth
me that the Earle of <hi>Lindſey</hi> moved for a paſſe to go
to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and that the King ſhould ſay, That I did
him better ſervice in the Parliament, then I could
do there; That was reported to this Houſe from the
Examinations of what the Lord <hi>Savill</hi> informed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me; and, as I ſaid then, ſo now, I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it, I am confident it is falſe; the Earl of <hi>Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi>
nor any body elſe, had never motion to any ſuch
deſire from me, nor had I ever any ſuch thoughts.</p>
            <p>As for what I am charged in the ſecond Article,
with ſending ſeverall Meſſages to the Earl of <hi>Dorſet</hi>
and the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> or to joyne with any in drawing
up Propoſitions, and ſending them privately to His
Majeſty; It is all falſe and untrue, in all and in every
part of it.</p>
            <p>To that in the third Article: I muſt acknowledge
that (by the Lady <hi>Carliſles</hi> favour) I have often wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon her, both at her lodgings in <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and
elſewhere, but never with any diſaffeſted perſons,
to hold correſpondency with the Queene, to put
Conditions upon the Parliament, to bring in the
King upon any termes, by our plotting againſt the
Parliament, or to do any other thing in proſecution
of ſuch evill deſignes; but only to ſhew that reſpect
which is due to a Lady of ſuch Honour.</p>
            <p>And I conceive it is well knowne to this Houſe,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114366:4"/>
that I have been alwayes ſo farre from having a
great power upon the Treaſure of this Kingdome,
to maintaine the Queenes Party, aſſure her Pention,
or undertake to doe more for the <hi>King</hi> then the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
would doe, That I have had as little to doe with
money buſineſſes as any; I have not growne great
by the ruines of others by theſe ſad times, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
my ſelfe nor friends to higher fortunes then
otherwiſe we could have aſpired unto.</p>
            <p>And that I ſhould ſend unto the Queene, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
her to ſend the Prince into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to come
into this <hi>Kingdome</hi> in the head of an Army, or invite
the <hi>Scots,</hi> or joyne with any other for inviting the
<hi>Scots,</hi> or any other forreigne forces to enter this
Kingdome, it is utterly falſe, and a meere invention
of malice againſt me; nor doe I know of any
meanes uſed to cauſe or encourage any Officers or
Souldiers to gather together tumultuouſly at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
to affright and aſſault the Members of
<hi>Parliament;</hi> for my part I am clear of any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>And for obſtructing of Petitions (as I am charged
in the firſt Article) when Petitioners came to
the <hi>Parliament</hi> for redreſſe of publike grievances; I
have onely delivered my opinion in this Houſe,
when ſeditious Petitions have been read; and for
Major <hi>Tuleday,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Tew,</hi> they affronted the
Committee, and <hi>Tew</hi> endeavoured to raiſe a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
in the Court of Requeſts, to the danger and
diſturbance of the Committee, who committed them
both untill the next morning, which was approved
by this Houſe, yet (upon my motion in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe)
this Houſe was pleaſed to bayle Major <hi>Tule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi>
and ſhortly after Mr. <hi>Tew</hi> was diſcharged.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:114366:4"/>
As for that which is laid upon me in the eight Article,
concerning the drawing up of the Declaration, it was done in
this Houſe, the Houſe allowing it, and it paſſed both Houſes,
and therefore it ſeemes ſtrange to me that any ſhould que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
that which was made an Act of both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
I drew it up indeed (though very unwilling to take
that tax upon me) as neare as I could according to the ſence
of the Houſe, in obedience to a generall Call upon me for
it, being exceedingly preſt and urged to doe it, as you well
know. And for the reliefe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> it was alwaies my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to promote it, deſiring that an intire Body might
have gone out of the Army.</p>
            <p>It is true, ſome forces for <hi>Ireland</hi> were commanded back
from <hi>Bromſgrove</hi> in <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> to <hi>Reading,</hi> which was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by the Committee that they might receive their pay
ſafe. The Officers then repreſenting to the Committee the
great neceſſities of the Souldiers, and that they did not know
how to convey it into <hi>VVorceſterſhire</hi> in ſafety, in regard that
it muſt paſſe through the quarters of the Army, who had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
great diſpleaſure to thoſe forces which were drawne
off for <hi>Ireland;</hi> and the Committee was the rather indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to doe it, becauſe they knew the monies which was ſent
to <hi>Oxford</hi> for disbanding a Regiment there quartered, was
ſeized on, which feare cauſed the calling back of thoſe to
<hi>Reading,</hi> and not upon any deſigne whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And whereas by the 14. Article I am charged with thoſe
Gentlemen, to obſtruct Articles againſt the Lord <hi>Inchiquen,</hi>
and for calling back the Lord <hi>Liſle,</hi> that his command might
be committed to the Lord <hi>Inchiquen,</hi> I was (alwayes ſo farre
from keeping off proceedings upon thoſe Articles, that I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
it all I could, and ſeverall times moved it in the Houſe,
being very deſirous to have all cleared concerning the Lord
<hi>Inchiquen,</hi> whom I beleeve to be a man of honour and
fidelity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:114366:5"/>
And for that the Lord <hi>Liſles</hi> time of government in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was expired (which was but to continue one yeare in
that Command;) the Parliament being pleaſed to diſpoſe of
the Affaires of <hi>Ireland</hi> in an other way; I went in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
debates thereon (in the Houſe) according to my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and conſcience, not reſpecting any particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but the common good; and for the writing of a Letter
to put out all thoſe who favoured Independants, I never
knew of any ſuch thing done.</p>
            <p>And whereas I am charged by my power and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to obſtruct Juſtice in the cauſe between Alderman
<hi>Langham</hi> and Captaine <hi>Limery,</hi> it is very untrue. I confeſſe,
that my ſelfe, and Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton</hi> (who is accuſed with
me) being one afternoone in the Court of Requeſts, we
heard that the Houſe of Lords were then to ſit, we went
to aske the occaſion thereof, and meeting with the Earle of
<hi>Rutland</hi> in the <hi>Lobby,</hi> his Lordſhip told us, That it was about
a great Cauſe depending between <hi>Langham</hi> and <hi>Limery,</hi>
and we had ſome diſcourſe about it, but I did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that the merit of the Cauſe was at all in queſtion,
onely the entertaining of it upon an Appeale, concerning
which I ſaid, That it was my Opinion, that it was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Juſtice of the Kingdome, and not to be denyed to
any: This was all that paſſed between us, as ſome of Maſter
<hi>Limeries</hi> Counſell then preſent (who heard it ſpoken) can
teſtifie.</p>
            <p>And for the whole Charge delivered into this Houſe
againſt me from the Army, I have had a ſtrict ſcruteny
over my conſcience, and have made enquiry upon every
branch thereof into my paſt actions and intentions, and
cannot finde that I have deſerved ſuch a returne from any
