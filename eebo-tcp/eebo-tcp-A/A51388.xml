            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT having pleaſed Almighty God, to deprive me of the Sight of both my Eyes, for above Three Years already paſt; and being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſabled to do my King or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try any further Service, I thought it might not be amiſs, to employ ſome part of my Time, during this Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Retirement, in Recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting ſome Obſervations and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43640:3"/>
which I have heretofore made, from what I have ſeen or heard, either at Home or Abroad; as believing they might, at preſent, be profitable to my ſelf, and hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſeful to others.</p>
            <p>And therefore I have at laſt dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted them into a ſmall Treatiſe, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four <hi>Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Anſwers,</hi> which do, in truth, concern every one, who has the true uſe of that Reaſon with which he was born: But more eſpecially profeſt Chriſtians, who ought, every Day of their Lives, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to propoſe to themſelves ſuch Interrogatories, and require, at the ſame time, ſincere and direct An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers from their own Conſciences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:43640:3"/>
Now, if the Method of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe, be lookt upon as <hi>Particular</hi> and <hi>Unuſual,</hi> I hope it may be the more grateful; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as new things, though of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle conſequence, do uſually find a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable acceptance.</p>
            <p>If it be thought too <hi>Short</hi> and <hi>Conciſe</hi> for a Subject of ſuch Weight and Importance; there will be this Convenience, that it will give leſs trouble to the Readers.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be cenſured for <hi>Sharp</hi> and <hi>Satyrical Reflections,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it may be conſidered, That thoſe Reflections are either directed againſt profeſt Atheiſts, Libertines, and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Livers, who make a Mock of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Holy Scriptures; or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43640:4"/>
elſe, that they are made uſe of to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the Credit and Reputation of a certain Treatiſe called <hi>Leviathan,</hi> which has corrupted the Minds and Manners of ſo many hopeful Youths of this laſt Age, who by reaſon of the tenderneſs of their Years, and want of Solidity and Experience, could not eaſily diſcern the Fallacies and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtences of thoſe dangerous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, that are ſo ſubtilly couched in that impious Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, if in this ſmall Treatiſe there ſhall be found Errours, Miſtakes, or uſeleſs Paſſages proceeding from the Author's Blindneſs, Old Age, or Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and his being forc'd to make uſe of other Men's Hands and Eyes, he begs the courteous and candid <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſers,</hi> to put them all into a <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:43640:4"/>
and to conſider that ſince <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum eſt errare,</hi> he had in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe a two fold end and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; the One to gratify his <hi>Readers,</hi> the other to benefit <hi>Himſelf:</hi> For while They either do, or may go away with what is of real Uſe and Practiſe in their Lives and Converſations, He comes after, to glean and gather up thoſe Miſtakes and Trivial Paſſages, for the Exerciſe of Self-mortification, and for the begetting and continuing a mean Opinion, and low Thoughts of his own Abilities.</p>
            <p>And therefore flatters himſelf with hopes to find a favourable Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his hearty and ſincere, though weak Endeavours (being already paſt the Seventieth Year of his Age)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43640:5"/>
to leave that behind him, which may at leaſt help to turn ſome Souls to Righteouſneſs, when he himſelf ſhall be turned to Duſt and Aſhes:</p>

            </p>
            <p>One, who deſerves no Name: A poor and deſpicable Individual of the unhappy <hi>Species</hi> of Human Race, which in its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal was Excellent and Admirable, but is now become Wretched and Miſerable.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, in the Silence and Shades of Night, my roving Fancy gives me a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient view of <hi>Adam</hi> in his Innocency; as he was LORD and KING of this lower World, and ſitting in State, with his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Conſort, in the Garden of <hi>EDEN,</hi> whither all the Creatures reſorted to do him Homage, with all Reſpect and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as to their Liege and rightful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign.</p>
            <p>Again, ſometimes it repreſents the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Scene of his terrible Fall, by his fond
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43640:6"/>
Compliance with his new Bride's deſires, to diſobey his Maker's Command, and thereby to expoſe himſelf, and her, and his whole Poſterity, to Death and endleſs Miſery.</p>
            <p>That Angels were created before Man, and that one of their chief Order for his <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> was caſt out of Heaven, we need no better proof than the ſad Rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall; for certainly no other Created Being would ever have attempted to deface God's own Image and Likeneſs, but the chief of Apoſtate Angels, and Prince of Devils.</p>
            <p>Methinks I hear the Father of Lies, in the ſhape of a Serpent (which was proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at that time, the moſt Lovely and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, as well as the moſt Crafty and Subtil of all the inferior Creatures) thus accoſting the Mother of all Living,</p>
            <p>Fair Queen of this Lower World! What great pitty it is, that ſuch excellent Creatures as your Self, and your Royal Aſſociate, ſhould here feed on Herbs and courſer Meats, whereas there is ſo noble a Plant in this your own Garden, the Fruit whereof is not only incomparably fair to the Eye, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly pleaſant to the Taſt, but has alſo a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43640:6"/>
ſecret Vertue to inſpire the Eaters with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Wiſdom and Knowledge. If your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker has forbidden it you, it is only to raiſe and heighten the Deſires of your Divine Souls, after their proper, Adcquate and Coeleſtial Objects. How ſhould the LORD GOD take Offence at your doing that, which will moſt certainly make you ſo like to himſelf, and his own Divine Eſſence?</p>
            <p>How far <hi>Eve</hi> might be ſurprized, to hear a Serpent ſpeak in her own Language; Or, whether the Gift of Speaking might, in thoſe Days, be ſometimes given by God, to ſome of the chief of Inferior Creatures, upon ſome ſpecial occaſion (as it was in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-times given to <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Aſs) And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devil ſpoke to her through the mouth of a real Serpent, or in an aſſumed ſhape, I ſhall not go about to determine. Some learned Men believe that this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent was a Dragon; becauſe, ſay they, the <hi>Naturaliſts</hi> in their Writings deſcribe the Dragon to be a Creature of wonderful Beauty, (and doubtleſs it was a much more beautiful Creature before its Curſe, in caſe that were the very Animal that was made uſe off by the Devil) with a long golden Beard, bright and ſparkling Eyes, Scales ſhining with glorious Colours, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43640:7"/>
the like; inſomuch that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped a Dragon, as a Diety; and the <hi>Greeks</hi> borrowed <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">

               </gap> that Beautifull Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Image, to repreſent their God <hi>AEſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius:</hi> But in how beautiful a ſhape ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Devil appeared, it is evident that his Deſign was, to all intents and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, moſt ſpiteful and malicious.</p>
            <p>O cruel Satan! Was there not room e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for thee, and all thy Infernal Crew, to range up and down in the vaſt and wide Expanſe, without intruding ſo rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and abruptly into Paradiſe?</p>
            <p>O ſpiteful old Dragon! What Wrong, or Injury, did our firſt Parents do to thee, while they were dreſſing the Garden, which their MAKER had ſo lately pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them in, that thou ſhouldeſt invent ſo helliſh a Stratagem, and in Maſquerade make ſo fatal an Addreſs, at once to rob them of their Innocence, diſturb their preſent Peace, and diſappoint them of their future Happineſs?</p>
            <p>Be therefore for ever accurſed, <hi>O Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub, Thou Prince of Devils,</hi> and true Original of all Sin and Wickedneſs, for thy malicious Practiſes to deceive all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43640:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the World, for ſo many Thouſand Years; whenas thou canſt not be ignorant, but that the Sins of every Soul that thou has tempted, (be it Saved, or be it Damned) ſhall one Day be ſet to thy Accompt, and add Degrees to thy Eternal Torment. <hi>(From all Evil and Miſchief, and from all the Crafts and Aſſaults of the Devil, and all his Infernal Spirits,</hi> Good Lord deliver us.)</p>
            <p>Now here, I doubt not, but that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Reader will expect I ſhould inſert ſome ſhort Diſcourſe concerning <hi>Bleſſed</hi> and <hi>Apoſtate Spirits,</hi> and I could heartily wiſh I had a ſufficient Knowledge of, and Inſight into thoſe Myſteries, to anſwer fully his deſires.</p>
            <p>But I am afraid on the one ſide, that he would be very little ſatisfied with my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, in caſe I ſhould, in imitation of a late learned Author, try to ſqueeze a plauſible Deſcription of <hi>LOST PARADISE,</hi> out of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Viſion in the Iſle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> and fancy to my ſelf a formal and pitcht Battle, upon a vaſt and wide Plain, in the North part of Heaven, fought between two mighty Hoſts of Bleſſed and Revolted Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, conducted and led up by mighty Arch-Angels, (for their Generals) riding in Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen

Neither am I willing to tire my Reader with endleſs Quotations out of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, Pious and Learned Fathers, who were, for the moſt part, ſomewhat tender in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering their Opinions about the Doctrin of Spirits, but wiſely waved the poſitive Determination of Queſtions, relating to the <hi>Inviſible World,</hi> and thoſe deep Myſteries of <hi>Incorporeal Beings,</hi> as not to be fathom'd by the Line and Plummet of Human Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <p>And therefore I ſhall content my ſelf with what Light I can get from the Holy Scriptures, and where thoſe are either ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, or ſilent, to be very cautious, ſober and modeſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there were, are, and ever ſhall be, true and real Subſiſtencies of Good and Evil Angels, the following Paſſages of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writ</hi> do plainly inform us, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>
                  <p>—Before the Angels of God, <hi>12 Luke 8.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>—He ſhall come—with all his holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>25 Matth. 31.</hi>

                  <p>—If God ſpared not the Angels that ſinned, <hi>2 Pet. 2. 4.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>—The Angels that kept not their firſt Eſtate, <hi>Jud. 6.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:43640:9"/>
—<hi>The Angels came,</hi> 4 Matth. 11.</p>
                  <p>—Out of whom went <hi>7</hi> Devils, <hi>8 Luke 2.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>—Everlaſting Fire Prepared for the Devil and his Angels, <hi>25 Matth. 41.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>—But are as the Angels in Heaven, <hi>22 Matth. 30.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As concerning the Time when the Angels were Created, it may be conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by comparing ſeveral Texts of Scripture, and making the following In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sons of God, and the Morning-Stars are put together, and the Morning-Stars were made before the Earth, <hi>Job</hi> 38. And the Earth was made three Days before the Stars in the Firmament, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. (And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Morning Stars cannot be meant Stars of the Firmament.)</p>
            <p>Again, by <hi>Stars,</hi> are meant <hi>Angels,</hi> 12 <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>And by the <hi>Heavenly Hoſt,</hi> are meant <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> 2 <hi>Luke</hi> 13. and 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 21.</p>
            <p>And the Heavens and Heavenly Hoſts are joined together, 2 <hi>Gen.</hi> And the Heavens ſaid to be Created the Firſt Day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:43640:9"/>
Therefore it ſeems probable, that the Sons of God, otherwiſe the Morning-Stars, (or which is the ſame thing) Angels, or the Hoſt of Heaven, were created on the firſt of the Six Days in the Morning.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That there were great Numbers of both <hi>Bleſſed</hi> and <hi>Apoſtate Angels,</hi> we are aſſured from ſeveral Paſſages in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>

               <p>What were, and are the fatal Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the Diſobedience of our <hi>Firſt Parents,</hi> we too well know, and find by woful Experience. (And had not their heavy Sentence been allayed with a happy Promiſe of a <hi>Meſſias,</hi> both their, and our

Condition had been altogether hopeleſs.) But what had been the Conſequences, in caſe they had remain'd in that purity in which they were created: As namely, to what Numbers they had increaſed and multiplied? in what parts of the World they had inhabited? And if in colder Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, their Bodies had required Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Veſtments? Whether Fleſh had been allowed them for Food, as well as Fruits and Herbs? And the Earth brought forth its Encreaſe without any Labour or Tillage? And laſtly, if they had never died, but after a certain Term of Years, had been Tranſlated from Earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as Righteous <hi>Enoch</hi> was, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Elias?</hi> Are all Queſtions more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious than neceſſary, (as the Caſe now ſtands with us.) And ſuch, as I believe, the wiſeſt Man living, had he all imaginable Helps of Humane Learning, and acquired Knowledge, would never be able, with any certainty, to determine.</p>
               <p>Thus much we may reaſonably believe, and ſafely conclude, That as they were at firſt created by the wonderful Contrivance and Mechany of the bleſſed Trinity, and made after G O D's own Image and Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they were truly Noble and Excellent Creatures.</p>

               <p>When he conſiders how cloſely the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, with the help of its Fibers, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Meat that is chewed in the Mouth, and the Drink that is received in, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed down, and mixeth therewith ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick fermentatious Juices, bred in its inner Coat, and impregnated by the <hi>Saliva,</hi> till the finer parts, by a convenient heat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a white milky Cream; after which, together with the thicker Maſs, (with which they are as yet involved by the Conſtriction of the Stomach,) they paſs down to the Guts, where by the mixture of the Bile, and the pancreatick Juice, they are by another manner of Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, quite ſeparated from the thicker Maſs, and ſo received of the Lacteal Veſſels, as the thicker is ejected by the Stool.</p>
               <p>When he rightly conſiders the Figure and Motion of that admirable Machine, (the Heart) and how it is ſuſpended in the Body, by the Veſſels that go in and out of it, and that as an ordinary Forcing-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, being placed in the middle of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Town, draws the Water of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining

               <p>We are apt to admire the Skill of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, who can make us a <hi>Pendulum</hi>-Clock,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43640:13"/>
of the choiceſt Braſs and Iron, to vibrate with a juſt and equal Motion, for the ſpace but of one Year, and that with the help of a ſuſpended Weight: What ſhall we then think of a Movement, compoſed of fleſhy Muſcles and Fibers ſuſpended in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſalem</hi>'s body, and continuing its Pulſes, without the help of either Weight or Springs, for the ſpace of Nine Hundred, ſixty and nine Years, which time would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly wear out the Wheels and Pinions of a great many Braſs and Iron Clocks.</p>

               <p>According to that ſmall Skill I formerly had in <hi>Opticks,</hi> it was my Opinion, (with ſubmiſſion to better Judgments,) that the Figure and Colour, or Colours of a viſible Object (however ſituated, or in what po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture ſoever it be placed) make the Baſe of an imaginary Cone, compoſed of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite viſical Rays, which is conveyed in an inſtant through a Lucid <hi>Medium,</hi> to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of every Beholders Eye, where a ſmall ſection of the <hi>Apex</hi> of that Cone, is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43640:14"/>
refracted by the ſeveral Waters and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks, and then the Figure of the ſaid Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject being inverted by the Humor <hi>Chryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus,</hi> is, in the ſame poſture, lodged in the <hi>Tunica Retina,</hi> from whence it is conveyed into the common Senſory.</p>
               <p>Again, by thoſe Experiments I have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore made in <hi>Acouſticks,</hi> I then judged, that different Percuſſions of the Air, do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get infinite ſpherical Figures of Aereal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (as a Stone thrown into the midſt of a Pool of ſtanding Water, or (which is much more curious) a ſtroak with a Pin's head upon the ſuperſicies of a long Veſſel of Quick-ſilver, begets in the firſt infinite numbers of Circles, or in the laſt infinite Arches) which ſpread themſelves every way, till they meet with ſome harder Body that makes reſiſtance; which let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be a Man's Ear, in the Cavity of which the aforeſaid Figures of Aereal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſuffer ſeveral Reverberations, and then make a Percuſſion upon the <hi>Tympanum,</hi> or Drum, (which is a Nervous, and almoſt pellucid Membrane, and of moſt exquiſite Senſe) and from thence are conveyed into the Brain.</p>
               <p>And by the help of theſe, and other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, I then made (which were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Years ſince) and the Bleſſing of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Endeavours, I found out the <hi>Tuba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtentero-phonica,</hi> or <hi>Speaking-Trumpet,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved that Invention ſo far, as to make humane Voice both audible and intelligible, either in plain Words and Sentences, or elſe in Cypher, for conveighing Secrets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or out of beſieged Places, (over the heads of their Enemies) or for one Ship to ſpeak to another, at the diſtance of three <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles, or thereabouts; and had I not received ſome Diſcouragement (which then I did not think I deſerved) I did not doubt but to have improved it to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of eight, nine or ten Miles.</p>
               <p>I did likewiſe, at the ſame time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive, and cauſe to be made by my Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, a very large <hi>Otocouſtacon,</hi> one end whereof being laid to my Ear in a ſtill Evening, in the middle of St. <hi>Jame</hi>'s Park, brought into it (as I thought) innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sounds of Coach and Cart-wheels, and humane Voices, in, and throughout all the Streets, as well thoſe of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> St. <hi>James</hi>'s and <hi>Pickadilly,</hi> as the others between <hi>White-hall</hi> and <hi>London-Bridge;</hi> but thoſe Sounds being often confuſed, and thoſe that were nearer, drowning thoſe which were more remote, and ſometimes offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

I then deſiſted from my making any further Experiments: However, ſome years ſince, having received ſeveral Viſits, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of ſeveral deaf Perſons, and believing that it might be an acceptable Service to all Mankind, I determined to proceed, not doubting to contrive ſuch a Machine, as would have taken a juſt Gage, or Meaſure, of the Degrees of any Perſons deafneſs, and likewiſe to invent another ſmall Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to hang upon the Ear as an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby thoſe Degrees of Deafneſs ſhould have been in a great meaſure, or altogether reſtored; had it not pleaſed Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD, in the interim, to viſit me with Blindneſs.</p>
               <p>But now, in all the aforementioned O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, how the Soul of Man, by the help of the Brain, (which is the general Organ of Senſe) perceives and judges Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of all ſentient parts, and out of it, as out of a Fountain, by the help of eight or ten pair of Nerves (whoſe Origin is derived from the <hi>Medulla</hi>-ſubſtance of the Brain) it communicateth the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits (being firſt elaborated) to all the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43640:15"/>
parts of the Body, and thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows them with the faculty of performing Animal Actions: For example, how, and in what myſterious manner, the Soul ſends out the Animal Spirits, ſo many ſeveral ways, to receive in, and judge of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and Colours of ſo many hundred Objects in one Minutes ſpace, and ſo many different Sounds of Vocal and Inſtrumental Muſick, within the compaſs and meaſure of a Semibref, and that without confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding viſual Rays, or Aereal Percuſſions, which muſt of neceſſity very often inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with each other, or what manner of Creatures thoſe Animal Spirits are, which have never yet been diſcerned by the ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt Eye, or beſt Glaſſes?</p>
               <p>Let the ableſt Philoſopher in the World tell me, otherwiſe than by the empty Terms of Anatomy.—<hi>Et erit mihi mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> Apollo.</p>
               <p>And this is all I have here room to treat of, relating to Senſe. There is yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that very well deſerves to be taken notice of, concerning <hi>The Motion of the Limbs,</hi> and their great force, in lifting up, thruſting from them, or pulling to them great weights with the nimble Motion of all the Parts, ſome of thoſe Operations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43640:16"/>
with, and others confounding our ordinary Doctrine of <hi>Staticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know very well, That a pound weight, ſuſpended at one end of an iron Rod pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced horizontally, at ſix foot diſtance from its <hi>Fulcrum,</hi> or perpendicular Axis, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderates a Weight of ſix pounds ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the other end of the ſaid iron Rod, at one foot diſtance from the ſaid <hi>Fulcrum,</hi> or Axis, (the length of one foot of that Rod, on the one ſide of the Axis being firſt made equal in Weight, to the aforeſaid length of ſix foot of the ſame Rod, on the other ſide of the Axis) And if the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Weight of ſix pound, be raiſed two Inches in perpendicular height<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the force of the ſaid one pound, (with ſome ſmall addition) that one pound weight muſt of neceſſity deſcend Twelve Inches, or one Foot.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe I am not ignorant, that if a Globular weight of ſix pound, be ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at one end of an Iron Rod of ſix foot in length, hanging perpendicularly upon a ſmall Pin, or Joint, the force of two pound weight being faſtned by a Pack-thread, to the <hi>Center of Gravity</hi> of that Globular weight, and conveniently placed, ſo as to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43640:16"/>
move up and down over a Pulley, will heave up that Globular weight, (a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional part of the ſaid Rod being firſt equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderated) to the perpendicular height of two foot. Again, the weight of four pound applied in the ſame manner, will heave up the ſaid Globular weight, to the perpendicular height of four foot, and the force of ſix pound Weight, will heave it up to the Horizontal Line, (or 90 Degrees) which Experiment, being exactly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, gives great light to young Practitioners in the <hi>Mechanicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, I know by Experience, that an Engineer ſtanding on the top of a Tower, may by the help of Ropes and Pullies, with a ſmall force, heave up a Tun weight, or more, to the perpendicular height of 10 or 20 Foot, provided there be proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time given him for that Operation; and alſo, that he has a ſufficient <hi>Fulcrum,</hi> or place, to which he may faſten one of his Blocks.</p>
               <p>I can likewiſe imagine the Soul of a Man, whilſt his Body ſtands bolt up right, to be a ſpiritual Engineer, and to be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Brain, as in its Watch-Tower, and there to make uſe of each hand and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43640:17"/>
arm to lift up a ponderous Weight, to the perpendicular height of 6 or 12 Inches: But I muſt, at the ſame time, ingeniouſly acknowledge, that I do not at all appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, neither have I any <hi>Idea,</hi> or Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by what ſecret power the Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts or dilates the Muſcles, how it ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borates, and ſends forth the Animal Spirits, or how it makes uſe of any of the ten pair of Nerves, whoſe Origin is derived from the <hi>Medulla</hi> ſubſtance of the Brain, which is, in a manner, as ſoft as Butter: And I leave, to the Contemplation of the moſt skilful and ſubtil <hi>Mechanick,</hi> or Philoſopher, in the World, the innumerable Difficulties that will ariſe from all the following In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of a Porter, taking up great and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous Burthens from off the ground, and heaving them on his ſhoulders.</p>

In the Morning of my Life, for ſeveral Hours, I ſtood idle in the Market-place, with others of my Companions, pleaſing my ſelf with childiſh Toys and youthful Vanities.</p>
               <p>In my more mature Age, though I had frequent Calls and Invitations to labour in God's Vineyard, yet nevertheleſs I rather choſe to gratify my own roving Fancy, and ſatisfy my vain Curioſity, in ranging Abroad, and making enquiry into the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and Manners of foreign Countries, and then to enter into the ſecret Intregues and myſterious Tranſactions of my own; where I had opportunity to hear, ſee and obſerve many things, which muſt be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in Oblivion.</p>

But in all the various Paſſages of his Life, and frequent ſhifting of Scenes, the Devil, and his Agents, are always at hand, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb and hinder the Actor in his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, both of Religious and Moral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and at laſt to carry him off the Stage, with Eternal Diſhonour and Diſgrace.</p>
               <p>It will not be difficult to trace his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-Footſteps, from the firſt Creation to this preſent Time.</p>
               <p>Having beguiled our firſt Parents, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to miſchief their two Sons: Firſt, by polluting <hi>Cain</hi>'s Offering, and laying Sin at his door; then by urging him to be wroth and angry with his Maker, for not accepting it. And laſtly, by provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him to break all the Bonds of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to become his own Brother's Murtherer.</p>
               <p>This done, he proceeds to tempt the Old World to the Commiſſion of groſs and enormous Impieties, till God deſtroyed them with a Deluge.</p>
               <p>After the Flood, when <hi>Noah</hi>'s Poſterity was multiplied, the Devil turned Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43640:21"/>
and drew a Deſign for the Children of Men, to build a Tower in the Plain of <hi>Shinaar,</hi> whoſe top was to reach to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, from which he himſelf had ſo lately fallen.</p>
               <p>When God had diſperſed thoſe Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, by the Confuſion of Languages, he took upon him the Office of an Infernal Prophet, Prieſt and King, inſtructing his Diſciples and Followers, to forſake the Worſhip of the True God, to yield Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to all his Commands; and to erect Altars, plant Groves, and to offer Sacrifice to Devils, under various Forms of Beaſts, Birds and Creeping Things. And ſo great was his Malice, that he would not ſpare that Grove of Oaks, at or near <hi>the Plains of</hi> Mamre, which the good old Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> had planted, and made uſe of as an Oratory, orſelect place of Divine Worſhip for himſelf, and his numerous Family; but cauſed it to be converted to Idolatrous Uſes, till ſuch time as <hi>Conſtantine the Great</hi> took care to have the Heathen Altars and Images demoliſhed by the Biſhop of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and a Chriſtian Church erected in their ſtead.</p>

It would be endleſs, to make enquiry into all the Actions, and various Forms of Worſhip among the Men of the Old Gentile World, and Heathen Idolaters: Or to make an Enumeration of the Names of their reſpective Idols.

               <p>There is (ſaith my Author) a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> called <hi>Tunquin,</hi> where ſome of the Inhabitants worſhip four Gods, whoſe Names are <hi>Rauma, Betols, Ramonu</hi> and <hi>Brama,</hi> and a Goddeſs called <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bana.</hi> Others of them hold <hi>Tranſmigration of Souls,</hi> and have a great Veneration for a certain Hermit called <hi>Chacabout,</hi> one of the greateſt Impoſtors that ever was in <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third Sort, have great eſteem for one <hi>Lanthu,</hi> one of the greateſt Magicians of the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> That Impoſtor's Diſciples having given it out, that his Mother carried him in her Womb, without loſing her Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for the ſpace of Seventy years, which,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43640:22"/>
I am apt to believe is a Mock the Devil puts upon our bleſſed Saviour's being carried Ten Months in the Womb of a Virgin.</p>
               <p>It is the Cuſtom of the <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> to Adore three things: The firſt is the Hearth of their Chimney, made of <hi>Three Stones.</hi> The ſecond is an Idol, which they call <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſa,</hi> the Patroneſs of Handy-Crafts. The Third is the Idol <hi>Buabin,</hi> which they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore before they build their Houſes.</p>
               <p>They likewiſe preſent Offerings to Trees, Elephants, Horſes, Cows, and almoſt all kinds of Animals.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, they have great Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for two Magicians, and one Magicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: The firſt Magician foretells future Events: To the ſecond, they have recourſe in all their Sickneſſes. And ſometimes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeveral Apiſh-tricks, he himſelf, together with the ſick Party, and thoſe who brought him, do Homage and the Devil, and the ſick Party's friends preſent him and the Devil, with an Entertainment of their choiſeſt Meats.</p>
               <p>But if the ſick Perſon, after all their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, do not recover, his Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43640:23"/>
with as many Soldiers as they can get together, diſcharge their Guns and Muſquets three times, to drive away his Devilſhip from thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the chief Magician <hi>(Thaybou)</hi> being conſulted, and finding that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper ariſes from the Souls of the Dead, he, or his Brother <hi>Thay-phouthouy,</hi> finds ways to draw to him that Soul that is the Author of the Diſeaſe, and then ſhuts it up in a bottle of water well ſtopt, till the Party be cured, afterwhich he breaks the Bottle, and lets that Soul looſe to go about its buſineſs.</p>
               <p>The Magicianeſs <hi>Bacoti,</hi> keeps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Correſpondence with the Devil, (to whom, if ſhe has a Daughter, ſhe offers her as ſoon as ſhe is born,) and if any Mother happen to loſe a Child, ſhe makes her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to this Magicianeſs, who, by the beat of a Drum, pretends to Summon the Soul of that Child, and tell the Mother, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther its Condition in the other World be Good, or otherwiſe.</p>

Drums, Trumpets, Bells and Muſquets, till the Ecclipſe be over, and then make great Rejoycings for having conquered that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Creature.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Some he makes to carry their Arms over their Heads, during their Lives, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes certain Carnoſities to breed in their Joints, that they can never bring them down again.</p>
               <p>Others he makes to ſtand upon one Foot, holding a Chaffing-diſh in one hand, and with the other pouring out Incenſe, as an Offering to their God, fixing their Eyes all that while upon the Sun.</p>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43640:24"/>
always hold them faſt within his Clutches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus, in the foregoing Inſtance of the</hi> Tunquineſes, <hi>the Hermite</hi> Chacabout <hi>left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him Ten Commandements, which he enjoined his Followers to obſerve with all manner of ſtrictneſs,</hi> viz. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Not to Kill. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Not to Steal. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Not to defile their Bodies. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Not to Lye. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Not to falſify their Words. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> To reſtrain their inordinate Deſires. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Not to do Injury to any Man. <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Not to be great Talkers. <hi>Ninthly,</hi> Not to give way to their Anger. <hi>Tenthly,</hi> To labour to their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to get Knowledge. <hi>Beſides all this,</hi> They who deſigned to lead a Religious Life, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Delights of this Life; be Charitable to the Poor; overcome their Paſſions, and give themſelves up to Meditation.</p>
               <p>He taught moreover, That after this Life, there were Ten diſtinct Places of <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Torment;</hi> and that the Contemners of theſe Laws, ſhould feel Torment propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to their Offences, without any End of their Torments. That they who endeavoured to fulfil his Law, and had fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in any point, ſhould wander in divers Bodies (holding Tranſmigration of Souls)
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43640:25"/>
for the ſpace of Three Thouſand Years, before they entred into Happineſs. But that thoſe who had perfectly Obeyed his Laws, ſhould be rewarded, without ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Change of their Bodies: And that he himſelf had been Born ten times, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he enjoyed the Bliſs that he poſſeſſed; not having in his firſt Youth, been illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with that Knowledge which he afterwards attained.</p>

                  <p>As for his Ten Commands, and his other Inſtructions immediately following, one would think at firſt ſight, that this Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor had collected them out of the Holy Scriptures, ſave only that there is not a Word therein that has the leaſt regard to a <hi>Saviour</hi> or <hi>Meſſias.</hi> But alaſs! that ſubtil old Serpent, and Prince of Darkneſs, who is ſo perfect a Hater of the Saviour of the World, and of Humane Race, makes it his principal Care and Caution, to keep all his Subjects and Vaſſals from the leaſt Knowledge of thoſe divine Myſteries which relate to the holy JESUS.</p>
                  <p>For my part, I am apt to believe, altho' ſo many Ages have paſt ſince the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the bleſſed Apoſtles among the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43640:25"/>
                     <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who undoubtedly converted very great numbers of them, while they lived amongſt them; that ſome of theſe Converts left behind them many pious Inſtructions to their Children, who alſo left the ſame to their Children, and ſo from Generation to Generation, which, in proceſs of time, were corrupted by Satan's Artifices, being confounded and intermingled with a great number of fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and extravagant Traditions.</p>
                  <p>Of this I ſhall here take the freedom to mention one famous Inſtance. There were, about fifteen Years ſince (as a Traveller aſſures me, who was himſelf in thoſe parts) and probably are to this day living, above Twenty thouſand Families, of a certain People who call themſelves <hi>Christians,</hi> or <hi>Diſciples of St.</hi> John, from whom they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have received their Faith, their Books and Traditions.</p>
                  <p>Theſe people inhabit at preſent at <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſara,</hi> about ten days Voyage from that place, where the River <hi>Tigris</hi> divides it ſelf into two Arms, (the one running through the ancient <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> and the other towards <hi>Meſopotamia)</hi> in view of which ſtands an old Wall of about a League in compaſs,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43640:26"/>
which the Chronicles of that Country ſay, was the Ruins of the ancient <hi>Babylon,</hi> (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Wall ſix Coaches may go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaſt) being made of burnt Brick, each Brick ten Foot ſquare, and three Foot thick.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Chriſtians of St. <hi>John,</hi> anciently lived by the River of <hi>Jordan,</hi> where St. <hi>John</hi> baptized, and ſo from him they took their Name: But ſince the time that <hi>Mahomet</hi> conquered <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> although he had given them his Hand and Letter of Privilege not to be moleſted; his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors reſolved to extirpate them, ruining their Churches, burning their Books, and exerciſing all manner of Cruelties upon their Perſons, which obliged them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> and <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> and for ſome time, they were under the Patriarch of <hi>Babylon,</hi> from whom they ſeparated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 175 Years ſince, and then removed into <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> and the Towns round about <hi>Balſara.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their Creed is full of Fables, and ſoul Errors.</p>
                  <p>They never Baptize, but in Rivers, and only upon <hi>Sundays:</hi> But before they go to the River, they carry the Infant to Church, where there is a Biſhop, who reads cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43640:26"/>
prayers over the head of the Child; from thence they carry it to the River, with a train of Men and Women, who, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the Biſhop, go up to the knees in Water, then the Biſhop reads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain certain prayers out of a Book which he holds in his hand, which done, he ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles the Infant three times, ſaying, <hi>Beesme brad Er-rabi, Kaddemin, Akreri, Menhal el Gennet Alli Koulli Kralek,</hi> which is in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, <hi>In the Name of the LORD, firſt and laſt of the WORLD and of PARADISE, the high Creator of all Things.</hi> After that, the Biſhop reads ſomething again out of his Book, while the Godfather plunges the Child all over in the water; after which, they all go to the Parents houſe to feaſt.</p>
                  <p>If any tax their Baptiſm for inſufficient, in regard the Three Perſons of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are not mentioned therein, they give no reaſonable Anſwer, nor have they any knowledge of that Myſtery; only, they ſay, that Chriſt is the Spirit and Word of the Eternal Father.</p>
                  <p>They believe the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> to be the Son of God, begotten upon Light; yet will not believe the Eternal Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt as God, although they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43640:27"/>
he became Man, to free us from the puniſhment of Sin; and that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Womb of a Virgin, without the knowledge of Man, by means of the Water of a certain Fountain which ſhe drank of. They believe he was Cruciſied by the <hi>Jews,</hi> That he roſe the Third Day, and that his Soul aſcended up to Heaven, his Body remaining upon Earth; but withal, That Chriſt vaniſhed when the <hi>Jews</hi> came to take him; and that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded their Cruelty with his ſhadow.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Euehariſt,</hi> they make uſe of Meal kneaded up with Wine and Oil; the Wine they make with Grapes dried in the Sun, and caſting water upon them, let them ſteep a long time, and with that they Conſecrate the Cup; The <hi>Arabians</hi> (under whoſe Government they live) not permitting them the uſe; of ordinary Wine. The Words of their Conſecration, are no other then long Prayers, but make no mention of Chriſt's Body or Blood, which they ſay is not neceſſary, becauſe God knows their intention. After the Ceremonies are end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Prieſt eats ſome of the Bread, and diſtributes the reſt to the people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:43640:27"/>
All their Biſhops wear their Hair long, with a little Croſs wrought with a needle.</p>
                  <p>Theſe People believe, and ſay, That the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> undertaking to create the World, according to God's Command, took along with him Three hundred thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix Thouſand <hi>Demons,</hi> and made the Earth ſo fertile, that it was but to Sow in the Morning and Reap at Night. That the ſame Angel taught <hi>Adam</hi> to plant and ſow, and all other neceſſary Sciences.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, That the ſame Angel made the Seven lower Spheres, the leaſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of reaches to the Center of the World, in the ſame manner as the Heavens do, all continued one within another; and that all theſe Spheres are of different Mettals: That, next the Center of <hi>Iron,</hi> the Second of <hi>Lead,</hi> the Third of <hi>Braſs,</hi> the Fourth of <hi>Laten,</hi> the Fifth of <hi>Silver,</hi> the Sixth of <hi>Gold,</hi> and the Seventh of <hi>Earth,</hi> which contains all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>They believe that over every Heaven there is Water, and that the Sun ſwims in a Ship upon that Water, and that the Maſt of that Ship is a Croſs; and that there are a great number of Boys and Girls to guide the Ships of both <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon:</hi>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:43640:28"/>
Beſides, they have the picture of a Bark, which, they ſay, belonged to the Angel <hi>Bachan,</hi> whom God ſends to viſit the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> to ſee whether they move ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, and keep cloſe to their Duty.</p>
                  <p>In reference to the other World, and Life to come. They believe there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, but where Angels and Divels, together with the Souls of Good and Bad reſide. That in that World there are Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Houſes and Churches; and likewiſe that the Evil Spirits have their Churches, where they pray, ſinging and rejoycing upon Inſtruments, and feaſting, as in this World.</p>
                  <p>That when any one lies at the point of Death, three hundred and ſixty <hi>Demons</hi> come and carry his Soul to a place full of Serpents, Dogs, Lions, Tigers and Devils, who, if it be the Soul of a wicked Man, tear it in pieces; but if it be the Soul of a juſt Man, it creeps under the Bellies of thoſe Creatures into the preſence of God, who ſits in his Seat of Majeſty, to judge the World.</p>
                  <p>That there are alſo Angels, who weigh the Souls of Men in a Ballance, and thoſe who are thought worthy, are immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admitted into Glory.</p>

                  <p>They hold that Chriſt left 12 Apoſtles to preach to the Nations.</p>
                  <p>That the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is not dead, but lives ſomewhere in the World, though no body knows where; and that next to her, St. <hi>John</hi> is to be the chiefeſt Saint in Heaven, and next to them <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of whom they recount ſeveral Miracles and Apocryphal Tales. That when St. <hi>John</hi> came to be of Age, his Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther married him; and alſo that he had four Sons which he begat upon the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and not upon the Body of his Wife. That he died a natural Death, but commanded his Diſciples to Crucify him after his death, that he might be like Chriſt; and laſtly, that he died in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Fuſter,</hi> and was buried in a chryſtal Tomb, brought to that City by a Miracle,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43640:29"/>
and that this Sepulchre was in a certain Houſe near the River <hi>Jordan.</hi>

                     <hi>They highly adore the</hi> Croſs, <hi>becauſe, ſay they, we have a Book wherein it is written,</hi> That every Day, early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Angels take the Croſs and put it in the middle of the Sun, which receives its Light from it, as the Moon does alſo hers: And that without theſe Croſſes neither Sunnor Moon would give any Light, and the Ships they were in would ſuffer Shipwrack.</p>
                  <p>Their Feſtivals are Three, the one is in Winter that laſts three Days, in memory of our <hi>Firſt Parent,</hi> and the <hi>Creation of the World:</hi> The Second in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and called the <hi>Feaſt of St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> John:</hi> The Third laſts five Days in <hi>June,</hi> during which time they are all Re-baptized.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> they do no work. They neither Faſt, nor do any Penance. They have no Canonical Books, but a great number of others that treat of nothing but <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> in which they believe their Prieſts to be very crafty, and that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are at their beck.</p>
                  <p>They ſuffer no Women to go to Church, nor any of the Laity to kill a Hen, or any

                  <p>In the firſt place, we are as well aſſur'd that the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> were writ by the firſt Divulgers of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which were ſoon afterwards Tranſlated into <hi>Latin, Syriac,</hi> and other Languages, and Copies thereof diſperſed, and publickly preach't in moſt parts of the habitable World, and ſo tranſmitted to us without

any notorious depravations; as we are ſure, that in our Statute Books are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Recorded the ſeveral Laws which have been Enacted in all the King's and Queen's Reigns, from <hi>William the Conqueror</hi> to this preſent Age; and much more ſure, then you or any private Man can be, of the Conveyances, Hands, or Seals, of his Anceſtors, from time to time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he holds his Lands and Poſſeſſions.</p>
                  <p>We have no more reaſon to doubt that there was a <hi>Jeſus</hi> born in <hi>Bethelem,</hi> than that there was at that time a <hi>Herod</hi> at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> or an <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> at <hi>Rome:</hi> The wonderful Star that appear'd at <hi>Chriſt's</hi> birth, is mentioned by <hi>Macrobius:</hi> And a great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to Chriſtianity ſpeaks of the coming of the <hi>Magi</hi> from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Julian the Apoſtate</hi> Confeſſes, the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a <hi>New Star,</hi> though he trifles about the manner of its appearing.</p>
                  <p>The Ecclipſe at Chriſt's Paſſion was left upon Record among the Heathen.</p>
                  <p>As for the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and for their being moſt carefully preſerved through-out all Ages, till the coming of our Saviour Jeſus! (at which time they were publickly read in all the Synagogues) we need no better Evidence,

                  </p>
                  <p>We read in the 31ſt. of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> that when <hi>Moſes</hi> had made an end of writing the Words of the Law in a Book, untill they were finiſhed, That He comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Levites</hi> which bore the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD, ſaying, <hi>Take this Book of the Law, and put it in the ſide of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God.</hi> (And we may reaſonably judge, that the reſt of the Canonical Books, when written, were alſo here laid up) Beſides the King was to keep a Copy for his own uſe, 17. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. And the Prieſts that were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Law muſt needs have Copies of it themſelves: So in an ordinary way it might be preſerved by multitudes of Copies, ſome of which might eſcape in the hands of good and pious Men, in Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Times. Whence it will follow, That we have no reaſon to think that the Book of the Law, which was loſt for a great while, and after the Captivity found by <hi>Hilkiah,</hi> and by him given to <hi>Saphan</hi> the <hi>Scribe,</hi> who carried it to King <hi>Joſiah,</hi> was the only Copy of the Law that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 8.</p>
                  <p>During the Captivity, thoſe Books which were already written, were undoubtedly in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43640:39"/>
the hands of the Prophets and Prieſts, ſome of whom, as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>Gedaliah</hi> ſtaid in their own Land; others, as <hi>Daniel</hi> and his Companions, were carried away Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: And we are ſure that <hi>Daniel</hi> had theſe Books, and out of them gathered the number of Years the Captivity was to laſt, 9 <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. where it is thus written, <hi>viz. In the firſt Year of</hi> Darius, <hi>the Son of</hi> Ahaſuerus, <hi>of the Seed of the</hi> Medes, &amp;c. <hi>I</hi> Daniel <hi>underſtood by Books, the number of Years, whereof the Word of the Lord came to</hi> Jeremiah <hi>the Prophet, that he would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh Seventy Years in the Deſolations of</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Cyrus</hi> was moved to reſtore the <hi>Jews</hi> by reading the Propheſy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> where it is foretold 210 Years before his time, that he ſhould be raiſed up for that Work.</p>
                  <p>After the Captivity theſe Books were kept in a great number of Copies, of which every Synagogue had one at leaſt. In this interval, <hi>Ptolomy Philadelphus</hi> procured the Tranſlation of the <hi>Seventy,</hi> the authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Edition of which was kept in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Library, about the Year of the World 3465. As for the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they were in one entire Volume long before the Captivity; and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43640:40"/>
that the reſt of the divinely inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Pſalms and Propheſies that were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before the Captivity, were laid up with them.</p>
                  <p>After the Captivity the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans relate, that the great Synagogue, (of which <hi>Ezra</hi> was Preſident, and at which <hi>Haggai, Z<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

In the next place, our bleſſed Saviour's miracles were ſo numerous, ſo openly performed, and before ſo many thouſand Spectators, both of the <hi>Jews</hi> and other Nations, of which many were his impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Enemies, who wanted neither Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Subtilty nor Malice to have ſoon diſcover'd any fraudulent Practices; and thoſe Miracles being ſuch, as could not be perform'd by Men or Devils, or any thing leſs than a ſupernatural and Almighty Power, it being never known, ſince the World was created, that the Devil ever open'd the Eyes of thoſe that were born blind, or fed ſo many thouſands of hungry Perſons with five Loaves and a few ſmall Fiſhes, or with the ſpeaking of two or three Words, raiſe Men out of their Graves who had been dead and buried four days, there will be leſt no reaſonable or plauſible Pretext for any ſceptical Unbeleiver to call in queſtion his divine Power.</p>
                  <p>I do believe, that the Devil is a Spirit of wonderfull knowledge, and mighty power; and able when ever God permits him to blind the Eyes of us Mortals, and ſo to counterfeit real Miracles, as for a while <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Magicians did in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance perform ſome of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Miracles,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43640:41"/>
and that which is no ſmall help to the performance of his Sorceries and Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts, and other of his diabolical practices; he has undoubtedly a perfect knowledge of the Sympathies, Antipathies, and ſecret vertues, that are either in the Bodies of all ſorts of Animals and Plants, or elſe in Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and inanimate things; which if they ſhould be publickly known or divulged, Humane Society would be very much confounded, if not utterly deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>Who can give a rational accout of Straws jumping to the jett? Or the Duſt of Iron to the Load-ſtone? Or of the needles turning to the <hi>North.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What reaſon can any Philoſopher give, why the bark of a Tree in <hi>Peru</hi> ſhould be a ready Cure for a Fever or Ague? Or why the Skin of an Eele or Snake ſhould give preſent eaſe, to the violent pain of the Cramp? Or, (which is yet more wonderfull) why a ſmall bit of Wood, being cut and taken at ſuch a criticall hour, or minute, and being gently rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed upon a freſh wound, ſhould immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſtaunch the Blood, (though iſſuing forth with great violence) and perform the Cure in a few hours ſpace, (the Wound being only wrapt up cloſe, and kept warm,) without any chyrurgical Operations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:43640:41"/>
I my ſelf have ſeen and practiſed many ſtrange Experiments of other kinds which I think not at all convenient here to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh: And look upon it as an effect of God's wonderful Providence, Mercy and Goodneſs, that the Books which <hi>Solomon</hi> wrote concerning Plants and Herbs, were concealed from, or at leaſt not made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or publick in, future Ages. And that ſeveral Experiments, which ſome later and learned Authors (ſuch as <hi>Paracelſus, Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi> and others, have publiſhed to the World,) have either been miſunderſtood, or not at all believed.</p>
                  <p>As for the Miracles done by <hi>Moſes,</hi> there are two things very conſiderable and worth our notice.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, though the Magicians, by the Devil's aſſiſtance, did in appearance, turn the Rods into Serpents, and Water into Blood, and bring up Frogs upon the Land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> yet it is manifeſt that they were in no wiſe able to undo <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Miracles, or to remove any of the <hi>Ten</hi> Plagues, which would certainly have been a moſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Service to K. <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who had ſo much a do to bring his hard and ſtubborn heart to intreat <hi>Moſes</hi> to beſeech the Lord his God, for the ſpeedy removal of the Frogs, the Flies, the Hail, and the Locuſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:43640:42"/>
Again, it is no leſs obſervable, That the Magicians counterfeited no more than two or three of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Miracles; and when they attempted to proceed, they were forced to deſiſt and confeſs it was the power and <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God:</hi> Neither was the Devil, with all his Magick-Arts, able to help them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſo vile and deſpicable a Creature as a <hi>Lowſe;</hi> or to give them afterwards a Receipt to cure their <hi>Boils</hi> and <hi>Blains</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> had fixt upon their bodies, ſo that they were no longer in a condition to ſtand before <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Servants; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we hear any more of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in all thoſe Tranſactions; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Moſes</hi> went on triumphantly with his Miracles, till he had ſafely landed all the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> on the other ſide of the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> and left <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all his Hoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with the returning Waters, and become dead Carkaſſes.</p>

                  <p>If God ſhould permit real Miracles to vouch diabolical Deluſions, or indeed, ſuffer any of the Devil's Magick-Arts to ſtand in competition with his own Almighty works upon ſuch extraordinary Occaſions, of either revealing, or confirming any new Truth or Doctrine, it would ſoon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43640:42"/>
throw Chriſtian Religion: But we always find the contrary throughout the Holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Magicians were ſoon put to ſilence: Their Rods were ſwallowed up by <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod: They were at a <hi>Non-plus</hi> in producing a <hi>Lowſe;</hi> and at laſt were forced to withdraw, and diſappear with ſhame and diſgrace.</p>
                  <p>The prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> though they cut and mangled their fleſh with ſharp knives, and from morning to Evening made bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Cries, were not able to bring down Fire from Heaven upon their Altars.</p>
                  <p>The Sorcerer <hi>Elymas,</hi> was, by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſtruck blind at <hi>Salamis</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> more than once publickly baffled the famous Sorcerer <hi>Simon Magus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that whatever was done by <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Magicians (which is one of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Inſtances of the Devil's power and Enchantments) or whatever was at any time after done by any of his Sorcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, does not in the leaſt derogate from any of our bleſſed Saviour's Miracles, or the Miracles afterwards performed by any of his Apoſtles or Diſciples, which did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately prove on both his, and their Teſtimony to be Divine; And conſequently were an abſolute Confirmation of our
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43640:43"/>
Saviour's being the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and ſent by God himſelf from Heaven for the Redemption of loſt ſinners, and opening the Kingdom of Heaven to all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
                  <p>This Argument of Miracles was urged by Chriſt himſelf, (who certainly knew beſt the force of it) againſt the <hi>Scribes, Phariſees,</hi> and unbeliving <hi>Jewes:</hi> And he did acknowledge, that if he had not done thoſe things which no other Man on Earth could do, they might have had a fair ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for their Unbelief.</p>
                  <p>In the time of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> (ſays <hi>Joſephus,</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> by Nation, and of a contrary Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and wrote his Hiſtory about 86 years after Chriſt)</p>
                  <p>There was one <hi>Jeſus,</hi> a wiſe Man (if it be lawfull to call him a Man) who was a Worker of great Miracles, and a teacher of ſuch as love the Truth, and had many, as well <hi>Jews</hi> as <hi>Gentiles</hi> who clove unto him: This was <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and when <hi>Pilate,</hi> upon his being accuſed by the Men of our Nation, bad ſentenced him to be Crucified, yet did not they who had firſt loved him, forſake him; for he appeared to them the <hi>Third Day</hi> alive again; according to what the Prophets, divinely inſpired, had foretold concerning him: As they had done an innumerable
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43640:43"/>
number of very ſtrange things beſides, and even to this day, both the Names and ſort of Perſons called <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſo named from him, do remain.</p>
                  <p>To which Atteſtation of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> were it neceſſary, might be added great numbers of Teſtimonies from ancient Writers.</p>
                  <p>I muſt needs acknowledge, That our bleſſed Saviour's Apoſtles, though the greateſt part of them were poor <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> men, of low Birth, ſmall Fortune, and mean Education, were by the Spirit of God, endued with the wonderful <hi>Gift</hi> of ſpeaking ſtrange Languages, and other miraculous Powers, that ſo they might be better enabled to diſperſe the Goſpel into many remote Countries, as they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards did: Namely St. <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Sicily, Britain</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> as likewiſe at <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi> St. <hi>Andrew</hi> in <hi>Galatia, Bithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and all along the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea: St. <hi>James</hi> in <hi>Spain, Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and other parts of the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> St. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew</hi> in <hi>India.</hi> St. <hi>Thomas</hi> among the <hi>Parthians, Medes, Perſians, Carmans, Hircans, Bachtrians</hi> the <hi>Aſians, Ethiopians</hi> and <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.

                     <hi>Alexandria.</hi> And though St. <hi>James the Juſt</hi> did ſtay at Jeruſalem, yet probably he might have ſome Converts of almoſt all Nations, who frequently reſorted to that City, <hi>Parthians, Medes</hi> and <hi>Elamites,</hi> Dwellers in <hi>Meſopotamia, Cappadocia, Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Aſia,</hi> and divers other places.</p>
                  <p>To all theſe may be very well added St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who though he was none of the Twelve, yet he was not the leaſt of the Apoſtles; and having received his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from Chriſt himſelf in a Viſion, left <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and preached the Goſpel at <hi>Antioch, Seleuſia, Cyprus,</hi> Pamphilia, <hi>Iconium,</hi> Lyſtra, <hi>Piſidia, Galatia, Macedonia, Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thracia, Neapolis, Theſſalonica, Beraea, Athens, Corinth, Epheſus, Jeruſalem, Illiricum, Sclavonia, Troas</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet notwithſtanding all this, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that theſe poor Men ſhould, at the ſame time, carry on any private Deſign of their own, being all of them ſent forth as Lambs among Wolves, and foretold by their own Maſter (whom all, but <hi>Judas,</hi> had ſeen ſcourged, Spit on, and crucified between two Thieves,) that they ſhould be perſecuted and hated of all Nations for his Name ſake, and the Goſpel, (which yet at their peril they were to preach and publiſh) and after all ſorts of Affronts,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43640:44"/>
and cruel Uſage, ſhould ſuffer ſhameful and ignominious Deaths, which they all did, as ancient Hiſtorians aſſures us, St. <hi>John</hi> (Chriſt's beloved Diſciple) excepted; neither had he eſcaped, as one of them tells us, had God permitted the Cauldron of burning Oil, into which he was thrown by <hi>Domitian's</hi> Order, to put an end to his life.</p>
                  <p>As for St. <hi>Peter,</hi> he, for baffling <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> was, by the Command of the Emperor <hi>Nero,</hi> crucified at <hi>Rome</hi> with his Head downwards.</p>

                  <p>There are ſome who ſatisfie themſelves, that God is ſo merciful, and ſo juſt in his Judgments, that he will never puniſh finite Sins with everlaſting Puniſhments, but ſuch Men little think how miſerably they deceive themſelves, while they aſcribe leſs Power to the Almighty Maker over his Creatures, than an ordinary Potter has over his Clay and earthen Veſſels: Beſides, that in the <hi>Goſpel Diſpenſation</hi> there are propos'd to <hi>Fallen Man</hi> two things, which very well counterballance one the other, both as to Time and Meaſure; namely, on the one ſide Eternal and inexpreſlible Happineſs; and on the other, endleſs and unſpeakable Miſeries. Now, if the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner do voluntarily, and with deliberation chooſe the laſt of theſe, <hi>Volent non fit Injuria,</hi>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:43640:48"/>
he has his choiſe and deſire, and has no reaſon in the World to complain of any hardſhip, much leſs of any Injury done to him, it being a greater Mercy to grant Eternal Life upon a bare Repentance and Believing, during our earthly pilgrimage, than it is a Severity to inflict eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for continuing in actual Sin, for the very ſame term of time.</p>
                  <p>The Author of <hi>Leviathan</hi> will, by no means admit of a <hi>Local Hell,</hi> or indeed of a <hi>Local Heaven:</hi> For the firſt of which he has no better Reaſon than this, (truſting to his own skill in <hi>Geometry</hi> and <hi>Staticks)</hi> that it cannot be either in the Cavity of the Earth, or any other body of the like magnitude hanging in the expanſe; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as in any circumſcribed Bodies there cannot be included a Bottomleſs-Pit, which, in ſacred Stile, is ſometimes called <hi>Hell:</hi> Whereas if he had conſidered, that our Antipodes tread as heavy on the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Earth, and carry their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as upright towards Heaven, as any of us; and that ſhowres of Hail and Rain in calm Weather, fall upon any part of this Terreſtial Globe directly towards the Center, in a ſtraight line; He might very eaſily have judged, that this Globe of Earth hanging in the expanſe, by nothing
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43640:49"/>
but the Almighties Word and Power, has its own proper Center, as all other Bodies of the ſame or greater Magnitude have; and conſequently, that if underneath there were a great Cavity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that Cavity fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a fluid body of Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, the convex Superficies of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bular fiery Lake, would in every part of it be the uppermoſt, and the parts adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its Center would be the loweſt, and probably the Bodies of damned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates being thrown into this Lake, would ſometimes float upon it, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times plunge to and fro in it: But foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Center of this globular Lake, would be but an imaginary point, thoſe Bodies would plunge and move to and fro within it in <hi>Saecula Saeculorum,</hi> without finding any ſolid <hi>Fulcrum,</hi> or firm Bottom; neither could the moſt learned Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, or skilful Geometricians in the whole World, be ever able, by contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating all their Lives, the Dimenſions of that fiery Lake, and its Center of Gravity, to make any other thing of it then truly and properly a Bottomleſs-pit.</p>
                  <p>And if thoſe learned Men ſhould allow in that caſe, the ſhell of this Terreſtial Globe to be no more then 17 or 18 hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Yards in thickneſs, and then compute
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43640:49"/>
how many cubick Yards and Feet would be contained within its concave Superficies, they would perhaps find room enough, and to ſpare, for all the Bodies of Human Reprobates, from the firſt Creation to this preſent time, and for ſome Thouſands of Years to come. As for the Devil and his Angels, if above ſix Thouſand of them were crowded into the body of one <hi>Gada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene,</hi> a few thouſands of cubick yards might very probably contain all his Infernal Legions: And as for the Bodies of Human Reprobates, they being once Spiritualiz'd, may, for ought any Man knows, be preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into a much leſs compaſs, than ours that are of a groſſer ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>Beſides all this, who knows whether the Confinement of both Devils and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, within a ſmall compaſs and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſpace, may not rather augment and encreaſe, than any way leſſen or diminiſh their everlaſting Torments.</p>

And methinks our Saviour's making ſo often mention of a Lake of Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, ſhould ſtrike all Atheiſts and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines with as great a dread and fear, as the Hand-writing on the Wall, did of old <hi>Belſhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar:</hi> When they do but conſider what vaſt quantities of ſulphureous Matters have been caſt out of the gaping Orifices of Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> and <hi>Veſuvius</hi> in <hi>Sicily</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Naples;</hi> and what horrid Noiſes, (as Travellers report) have been ſometimes heard out of thoſe burning fiery Furnaces, like the howlings and skreeches of ſome miſerable living Creatures: Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that prodigious Lake of burning Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which a few Years ſince (if we may believe <hi>Gazettes)</hi> was vomited out of one of thoſe Mountains, and like a mighty Torrent, run along upon the ground, and ſo into the Sea, a whole League in length before it was extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>For my own particular, if it were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to make Conjectures in matters of that conſequence, I ſhould be apt to believe, that the Sun, were a Body much more convenient for that purpoſe; foraſmuch as</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is a Body greater than the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Earth, by many Degrees, as is plainly demonſtrable by <hi>Ecclipſes.</hi>

Secondly, We have reaſon to believe from Sacred Writ, that at the End of the World, there will be no further uſe of the Sun's light.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, According to the Opinion of the beſt, and moſt accurate Aſtronomers of latter Ages, the Sun is placed in the very Center of the World, (however in the Holy Scriptures that are written, as is ſuppoſed, <hi>ad captum vulgi,</hi> it is expreſſed otherwiſe) And therefore muſt be, of all other Bodies, the moſt infernal, and then one would think that place is moſt likely to be Hell, which is furtheſt off from Heaven.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If the Rays of the Sun, which are ſent out from its lucid body at a vaſt diſtance, being contracted here below, and with the help of parabolical and eliptical Figures, become in their <hi>Focus</hi> much hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſooner melt down Gold and Silver, than any <hi>Culinar,</hi> or indeed, any <hi>chymical</hi> Fire, How great muſt we then imagine the heat of that fiery Globe to be, in its own proper body, eſpecially if the Sun were darkned, and its glowing Rays turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and thoſe few Spots which we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern on its ſuperſicies, were multiplied till they ſhould become an entire Cover, and be made the <hi>Blackneſs of Darkneſs</hi> for ever

and the body of the Sun made a fluid and eternal Fire by God's Almighty Power.</p>
               <p>And now if all theſe things ſhould be ſo, the Hiſtory of <hi>Abraham, Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> would not be extream difficult to be explained by Interpreters.</p>
               <p>If Teleſcopes help us to diſcover un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Stars, of different Lights: If ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-Trumpets, or cloſe Pipes, may be ſo made, as to conveigh Words ſeveral Leagues: And if <hi>Stephen</hi>'s mortal Eyes could look from Earth into Heaven, and there ſee <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> ſtanding, at the diſtance of, no Man knows how many mvriads of Miles, how eaſy had it been for the Maker of all things, by his Almighty Power, firſt to tranſlate the Bodies of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> after they were dead and buried, (as well as thoſe of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> before they were interr'd) the one to Heaven and the other to Hell? And afterwards ſo to clear up all the Mediums between Heaven and the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the World, as that the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliz'd Eyes of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Dives</hi> might plainly ſee one another's Perſons and Poſtures, and their Ears might hear each other's Voices at as great a diſtance, as the length of the Semidiameter of the whole Univerſe.</p>

               <p>But, <hi>Chriſtian Reader,</hi> let you and I, in this our Day, and while we have Time and Opportunity, make Proviſion for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
               <p>In order to this, there are ſome things which we either do, or may know by the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> and thoſe Principles which we brought into the World with us; the viſible things of the Creation, natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leading us to the knowledge of one God Almighty, Maker and Governor of all things; and the Law of Nature that is written in our hearts, prompting us to worſhip that God; to be juſt in our Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; to honour our Parents, and the like: And when on the one hand, we faithfully perform, or on the other hand do any thing contrary to what the Light of Nature dictates to us, we have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences within us, that do either accuſe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43640:54"/>
or elſe excuſe our Actions and Behaviours, and thus far go the Heathens.</p>
               <p>But now there are other things, which more nearly concern us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and theſe are revealed to us in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which Scriptures we are to eſteem and reverence, as undoubted and unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Truths, both as to the hiſtorical part of them, and alſo the Precepts, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Threats contained in them, and that for the Reaſons alledged in a foregoing part of this Treatiſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In theſe Scriptures we are taught and commanded, to acknowledge the Holy, Bleſſed, and Glorious Trinity, Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and one God, who is an infinitely glorious Spirit, that was from Everlaſting without Beginning, and ſhall be to Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without End; That he is no bodily Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſuch as our Eyes behold, but Spiritual and Inviſible, whom no Man hath ſeen, or can ſee; who comprehends all things, and is only Immenſe, not to be comprehended by any, who can never be defined by any Words, nor conceived by the Mind; That He is infinitely Great and Excellent, beyond all that we can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly imagine; That He has received his Being from none<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and gives Being to all things.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:43640:54"/>
2. To acknowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His Divine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and glorious Attributes; as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, His All-ſufficiency, and admirable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, in Diſpoſing, Governing, and preſerving all things; his Omnipotence, Omniſcience, and Omnipreſence; his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Truth and Juſtice; his tranſcendent Purity and Holineſs; and his infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Goodneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To love this God with all our Hearts and Souls, as He is the Fountain of all Goodneſs and Excellency in himſelf, and as He is infinitely kind and merciful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, both in reſpect of our Souls and Bodies; in giving us a Being in the World, in forming and framing us wonderfully in our Mother's wombs, in breathing into us the Breath of Life, and enduing us with reaſonable Souls, after his own Image and Likeneſs; in giving us our Birth within the Pale of the Church, and not among <hi>Heathens, Turks</hi> or <hi>Infidels;</hi> in leaving us ſo many pious Examples of the bleſſed Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles and Martyrs, who are gone before us, and with their own Blood have traced out for us the true way to Life and Happineſs; But above all, that unparallell'd Pattern of Piety and Goodneſs in the Life of the <hi>Holy Jeſus,</hi> who ſo freely gave up himſelf, as
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43640:55"/>
an Offering, to ſave loſt Sinners, and to open the Kingdom of Heaven to all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; in giving us Food and Rayment, and all the good Things of this Life; and preſerving us from ſudden Deaths and Dangers, ever ſince we hung upon our Mother's breaſts.</p>
               <p>To anſwer all which Love and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God to us, we muſt expreſs our Love to him by our hearty and honeſt Endeavours to pleaſe him in all things, which we can never do, without a ſincere Repentance, and a firm Reſolution to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our Lives, and never to harbour in our Boſoms any ſecret Luſt, or live in any known Sin or Sins; as likewiſe by taking all Opportunities of converſing with him, as well in our private Cloſets, as in the publick Aſſemblies, by Prayer, Faſting and Meditation, by reading and hearing his Word, and receiving the bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; and laſtly, by our earneſt and longing Deſire, whenever we ſhall put off theſe fleſhly Tabernacles, to enjoy him by Beatifick Viſion, amongſt bleſſed Saints and Angels in the higheſt Heavens.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To fear him, not only with an awful fear, from the conſideration of his Power and Juſtice, he being a God of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity, and alſo, when
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43640:55"/>
provoked by our Impieties, able to caſt both Body and Soul into everlaſting Flames, which is infinitely more than either Men or Devils can do againſt us; but alſo with a Filial fear, as an obedient and dutiful Child, truly fears to offend or diſpleaſe a loving and tender Father.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To truſt in Him, and to depend upon Him at all times, and in all Conditions, as well in regard of our Spiritual as our Temporal Concerns.</p>
               <p>If we are aſſaulted by Temptations, we are to rely upon him, either for removing them, or elſe, for giving ſufficient ſtrength to withſtand them.</p>
               <p>If at any time we are threatned with outward and temporal Dangers, by our Enemies or Perſecutors, we are to reſt upon Him, knowing that the God whom we ſerve is able to deliver us; and that He will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do it, if He ſees it beſt for us; if not, that He will as certainly allay our Sufferings with that inward peace, and thoſe ſpiritual Comforts, that neither the World can give us, nor the worſt of our Enemies can ever take from us, and therefore we muſt be careful never to attempt, or ſeek to deliver our ſelves from ſuch like dangers, by any unlawful or indirect means; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as in ſo doing, we utterly forfeit
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43640:56"/>
God's more powerful aid and aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>If we are in want either of Spirituals or Temporals, we are to truſt and rely upon Him, for a ſeaſonable and plentiful ſupply of both kinds: He having graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly promiſed to give the Holy Spirit to thoſe that ask Him, 11 <hi>Luke.</hi> 13. And as for bodily wants, thoſe who truly ſerve and fear him, are aſſured, that they ſhall want no good thing that is ſit for them, 34 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. And again, <hi>Behold the Eye of the Lord is upon them that hope in his Mercy, to deliver their ſouls from death, and to feed them in the time of Famine,</hi> 33. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18, 19. Why ſhould we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt a God, who is able, whenever he pleaſes to make Rivers flow out of hard Rocks, or prepare a Table in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; who clothes the Lillies, and feeds the young Ravens; with whom the very hairs of our Heads are all numbred, and in whom none ever truſted and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To ſubmit entirely, and with all humility to His holy Will, and heavenly Wiſdom, in all His Diſpenſations and dealings with us; and that from a deep ſenſe of our own meaneſs and vileneſs, and his tranſcendent Excellencies and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and that infinite diſtance and

               <p>To have no other Gods beſides Him, whether Idols made with hands, or thoſe of our own beloved Luſts.</p>
               <p>Not to take His holy Name in vain in our ordinary Diſcourſes; much leſs to prophane it with wicked Oaths, bitter Curſes, or horrid Blaſphemies.</p>

               <p>To keep holy His own Day, (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all other Days ſolemnly ſet apart for

To be meek and lowly, and to have a very mean Opinion of our ſelves, which is the only Soveraign Remedy againſt Pride and Vain-glory; and the beſt Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient we can make uſe of throughout the whole Courſe of our Lives, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering our unruly Paſſions, and ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

our inordinate Affections. And this we muſt do, unleſs we intend to make God our profeſt and open Enemy; and what the iſſue and end of that will be with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Offenders, the following Texts will ſoon inform and ſatisfy us, 16 <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. <hi>Pride goeth before Deſtruction, and an haughty Spirit before a Fall,</hi> Again 16 Prov. 5. <hi>Every one that is proud in Heart, is an abomination to the Lord, and though hand join in hand, he ſhall not be unpuniſhed. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> was in his time, for ought we know, the greateſt King upon Earth, and yet for his Pride was driven from among Men, to dwell and feed with the Beaſts of the Feild.</p>

To be modeſt and chaſt in all our Actions, Words and Thoughts, and not to ſpend the flower of our Age, and the choiceſt part of our Lives in Chambering, Wantonneſs, Adultery, Fornication, and all Uncleanneſs; and to pull down many grievous and heavy Judgments upon our own heads.</p>
               <p n="10">10. To be Temperate in all things, that is to ſay, in our Eating and Drinking, and not ſquander our precious Time, throw away our Eſtates, and ruin our Families, moſt ſhamefully waſt ſuch quantities of God's good Creatures, as might relieve
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43640:58"/>
great numbers of indigent Perſons, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice our own Healths, beget Quarrels and Contentions, and many times ſhorten our days, and bring our ſelves to untimely Ends; and which is worſt of all, forfeit our precious and immortal Souls, by Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony and Drunkenneſs, and all manner of Riot and Exceſs.</p>
               <p>To be temperate in our Sleep, which was ordained by God, for the refreſhment of our frail Bodies, that ſo they might not be wearied out with continual Toil and Labour, and that we might be enabled from time to time, to perform ſuch Duties, as Religion, or Works of our Calling require of us. And foraſmuch as ſome Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions require more than others, every Man muſt be governed by his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; for whoever does not limit himſelf, does not only waſt his precious time, but alſo injures his Body, and makes it a very ſink of Humors, and ſubject to ſundry Diſeaſes and Diſtempers.</p>
               <p>To be moderate in our Recreations, which are ſometimes neceſſary both for the Body and Mind; always provided that they are ſuch as neither diſhonour God, injure our Neighbour, take up too much of our time, or divert our Minds from our more neceſſary Imployments; in the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43640:58"/>
number of which lawful and uſeful Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, can very hardly be reckoned the ſitting up whole Days and Nights at Cards and Dice, and immoderate uſe of other Paſtimes, which I forbear to mention, but leave the conſideration of all ſuch Exceſſes to every Man's private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>To be moderate in Apparel and Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; ſince Apparel and Garments were the Effects of the Tranſgreſſion of our Firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; and therefore none of their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity have any Reaſon to make uſe of them ſo extravagantly, as ſome Perſons of this laſt Age have done to that degree, that they have made themſelves ridiculous, in the Eyes of many ſober Beholders.</p>
               <p>The Pride and Vanity of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Sion,</hi> or <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ladies, were ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprehended in the time of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> by God Almighty Himſelf, 3 <hi>Iſai.</hi> 16, 17, 18, &amp;c.

                  <p>Again, Husband are to love their Wives, even as Chriſt alſo loved the Church, ſo ought Men to love their Wives, as their own Bodies: He that loveth his Wife, loveth himſelf, for no Man yet hateth his own fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it: For which cauſe, ſhall a Man leave his Father and his Mother, and ſhall be joined unto his Wife, and they two ſhall be one Fleſh, 5 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 25, 26. &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>It is no ſmall Truſt that Parents repoſe in Governours and Governeſſes; but more eſpecially in School-Maſters and Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for the pious and virtuous Education of the Youth of both Sexes; which Truſt, if it be faithfully and honeſtly perform'd, is of unſpeakable Benefit and Uſe in a Common-wealth, and ſuch School-Maſters and Miſtreſſes deſerve to be valued and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected according to their Merits.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, if this Truſt be not rightly perform'd, but neglected and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it is of pernicious conſequence, of which I my ſelf have ſeen ſome woful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and have heard very bitter Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.</p>
                  <p>It is, and has been a daily practiſe, in ſome Schools, by harſh and cruel Maſters, and by peeviſh, hard-hearted, and ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd Miſtreſſes, to beat and bruiſe poor Childrens heads, as if their double Fiſts were ſo many Mallats, their Scholars heads as ſo many Blocks, and they themſelves

                  <p>There is yet a Generation of Vipers, (I mean ſome particular Nurſes) who are ſo barbarous, as to give dangerous Blows, in their Fury and rage, to poor young Infants in their Cradles, and in their own Laps; inſomuch that thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Babes dread as much the fierce Looks of thoſe Furies, as Men uſually dread the ſight of Lions or Tigers: Not to mention ſome other Behaviour of ſome of thoſe Nurſes, after they have taken upon them ſo great a Charge, that many times proves the loſs of thoſe poor Infants Lives; for all which they muſt undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly one day Anſwer, it being a kind of Man-ſlaughter, and ſo near a-kin to Murder.</p>

               <p>It is a Book that very well deſerves a <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> or a <hi>Caveat Emptor</hi> to be ſtamped in Capital Letters upon its Cover. I am very tender of naming the Author,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:43640:66"/>
who now ſtands or falls to his own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and hope that he made his Peace with Heaven, by a ſincere and hearty Repentance before he went from hence; beſides, that Chriſtian-Charity obliges me to make very ſoft and gentle ſteps over dead Men's Graves; though, at the ſame time, Chriſtian-piety prompts me to declare to all the World, That had I the vanity to think my ſelf equal to him, both for Natural Parts and acquired Learning, I would not have been the Writer and Publiſher of ſuch a Diſcourſe, to have gained the Wealth of both the <hi>Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Company of <hi>Stationers</hi> may do God and their Country very ſignal Service, (and poſſibly not at all impair thereby their private Fortunes) if, inſtead of applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and vending that impious Treatiſe, they would join together, in buying up all the Copies, and converting them to Aſhes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaking of the vaſt and wide Ocean, tells us of a <hi>Leviathan,</hi> that God had made to play therein: But, ſure I am, that God could never be pleaſed that any Man ſhould make a <hi>Leviathan</hi> here upon Earth, to play with his Divine Attributes, and Holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:43640:67"/>
This Treatiſe may not be improperly called the Authors <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or, <hi>The Sinner's Common-Hall,</hi> where all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concerned may be furniſhed at very eaſy Rates, with new invented Mattocks, Spades, and all other Inſtruments and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſils of politick Pioneers, to undermine Civil and Church-Governments.</p>
               <p>I muſt needs acknowledge, That the Method of this Treatiſe is very pleaſant, the Stile elegant, and the Expreſſions very proper and ſignificant, and is interlaced with ſpecious Touches of Learning, and that of divers kinds, politely extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and wittily digeſted; but let me tell thee <hi>(mi figliolo, mi Jovane)</hi> and timely forewarn thee, <hi>Guardati d' aceto di vin dolce!</hi> It is only to beguile the Readers, and ere they are aware to lead them into Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths, and make them ſwallow down moſt pernicious Principles.</p>
               <p>Thus the skilful Angler covers the fatal hook with a pleaſant Bait, and the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Fowler carefully hides the Snare from the unwary Bird.</p>
               <p>Thus the appearance of a Sepulchre is oft times very glorious, when the inſide is full of Rottenneſs, dead Men's Bones, and all Uncleanneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:43640:67"/>
Thus a lewd Strumpet, being adorned with gay Cloths, and ſet off with rich Jewels, falſe Teeth, Hair and Eye-brows, and a painted Face, ſeems beautiful to the beholders; who, if ſhe did but once lay aſide thoſe Ornaments and Diſguiſes, would ſoon affright her moſt voluptuous Lovers, and become a Soveraign Remedy for their incontinence.</p>

               <p>This Author, in <hi>pag.</hi> 63, 64. 87. 169. and in many other places boldly aſſerts, That all Men by Nature, are in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of War, every Man againſt every Man: That every Man hath right to every thing, even to the Goods and Body of his Neighbour; that is to ſay in plain Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh; every Man, by Nature, is a Raſcal, Villain, Thief, Robber and Murderer; till by a Pact or Agreement, they choſe out of their Company a Soveraign, who is abſolute, and nothing that he can do is any Injury or Injuſtice to any of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and is perfectly Maſter of their Eſtates and Lives: Inſomuch, that <hi>David</hi>'s killing <hi>Uriah,</hi> was no injury to <hi>Uriah,</hi> becauſe the Right to do whatever he pleaſed, was given to <hi>David</hi> by <hi>Uriah</hi> himſelf.</p>

2.

though <hi>Adam</hi> by his firſt Tranſgreſſion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf, and his Poſterity, to the Wrath and Diſpleaſure of his Maker; yet we no where find that his Maker took from him that Soveraignty and Dominion, or the uſe of his Reaſon to manage it, which he had before given him; or that he left his Subjects in a ſtate of War, to Rob, Spoil, and Murder one another. But on the other ſide, have good Reaſon to believe, that <hi>Adam</hi> enjoyed his Soveraignty while he lived; and conſequently, that all that came forth of his Loins, were his Natural Subjects, and yielded him due Obedience: And though there might be many wicked Men amongſt them, yet that there was not ſo much as one that durſt publiſh a <hi>Leviathan,</hi> neither were they in the general, ſo far degenerated, and become worſe than any of the brute Creatures, (as the Author pretends) having quite loſt all thoſe Principles of Honour and Juſtice, which were originally ſtamped in their Souls.</p>
               <p>We have likewiſe reaſon to believe, that the Patriarchs, <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and others, were Soveraigns in their reſpective Families, till ſuch time, as Families being multiplied, there aroſe Quarrels and Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the ſtronger ſubduing the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43640:72"/>
enlarged their Dominions, but without thoſe ſenſeleſs Pacts and Agreements, as this Author would fain perſwade us; for no ſuch thing was ever yet in practiſe, but is a product of his own waking Thoughts, of which he makes mention, page 60. in the following words, <hi>viz. That waking, he thought of his abſurd Dreams; but never dreamt of the Abſurdity of his waking Thoughts.</hi> And the plain truth is, I think in my Conſcience, no other Man in the whole World, ever dreamt of them, till he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo abſurdly publiſht them.</p>
               <p>Again, how confidently ſoever this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor aſſerts, That <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Uriah</hi> no injury. We read, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. That the Lord ſent <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> to <hi>David</hi> to complain of Two of the greateſt Injuries and Acts of Oppreſſion and Injuſtice that could poſſibly be offered, by a Prince to his Subjects; or indeed, by one private Perſon to another. The firſt was, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>Uriah</hi> wrongfully. The 2d. was, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing his Wife. The words of <hi>Nathan</hi> are theſe, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed thee King over</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and I delivered Thee out of the hand of</hi> Saul, <hi>and I gave thee thy Maſter's houſe, and thy Maſter's Wives into thy boſom; wherefore haſt thou killed</hi> Uriah <hi>the</hi> Hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, <hi>by the hands of the Children of</hi> Ammon, <hi>and taken his Wife to be thy Wife?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:43640:73"/>
Now one of theſe Injuries being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented darkly by <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> in a Parable of two Men living in one City, the one Rich, and the other Poor, and the rich Man taking wrongfully the poor Man's Lamb out of his boſom, the faid King waxed wroth, and ſo highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it, that he ſwore to <hi>Nathan,</hi> that this cruel Deed ſhould coſt the Offender his life: And why? Becauſe he had no pitty.</p>
               <p>So then it is manifeſt, that, to aſſert that <hi>David</hi> neither did, nor could do any wrong to <hi>Uriah,</hi> is not only to give <hi>Nathan</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> but alſo God himſelf the Lye, which is no leſs than Blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>In page 152. He inſtructs his Diſciples, That in caſe a Man ſhall come from the <hi>Indies</hi> hither, and perſwade Men here to receive a new Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though he be never ſo well perſwaded of the truth of what he teaches, he commits a Crime, and may be juſtly puniſhed for the ſame; now this Lobſter-like-argument of his, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing artificially thrown forward, does again naturally crawl backwards. His meaning is, as he has too plainly expreſt in many places; That if a Man go from hence, and preach a New Doctrine in <hi>Africa,</hi> he commits a Crime, and conſequently St.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43640:73"/>
                  <hi>Jude</hi> did very ill after <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Reſurrection, to take a Journey from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> into <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> and there to take upon him to rebuke the Superſtition of the <hi>Magi,</hi> and to preach a <hi>New Doctrine,</hi> and ſo was put to death deſervedly.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> for his making a Mutiny and Uproar at <hi>Athens,</hi> and diſturbing the Worſhip of the great Goddeſs <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Epheſians:</hi> And in fine, both he, and all the Apoſtles, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted great Crimes, in preſuming to preach <hi>New Doctrine</hi> amongſt all Nations, where Idolatry was Eſtabliſhed, and owned by publick Authority. (for, ſays the ſame Author, page 152. <hi>To maintain a Doctrine contrary to the Religion Eſtabliſhed, is a greater Fault in an authorized Preacher, than in a private Perſon.)</hi> And therefore they all ſuffered condign Puniſhments, and were acceſſary to their own cruel Deaths. But now, this reflects more ſeverely upon our bleſſed Saviour, who gave his Diſciples their Commiſſions, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Go yee and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And which is yet more, it reflects upon God the Father, who ſent his Son into the World for that end and purpoſe; and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43640:74"/>
alſo the Holy Spirit, which was ſent down from Heaven after our Saviour's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, to inſpire thoſe Apoſtles with diverſity of Tongues, and ſuch other mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Gifts, as might rightly qualify them for the preaching the Goſpel throughout all the Nations of the World.</p>
               <p>So that this laſt Aſſertion is, in effect, Blaſphemy againſt the Three Perſons of the ſacred Trinity.</p>
               <p>Our bleſſed Saviour 10 <hi>Matth.</hi> 33. Says, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall deny me before Men, him will I alſo deny before my Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> And in another place, <hi>By your Words you ſhall be juſtified, and by your Words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi> So that, to deny Chriſt before Men, is our Saviour's ſenſe, in a Crime that excludes and ſhuts a Man out of Heaven. But this Author affirms poſitively, page 271. <hi>That the denying of Chriſt before an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del Prince, is not a Chriſtian's Act, but his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign's Act, and conſequently no Sin.</hi> And ſo he plainly gives the Son of God the Lye.</p>
               <p>Our bleſſed Saviour, when he ſent out his Diſciples 10 <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.

Doctrine of Chriſt's Diſciples was a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sin then that of <hi>Sodom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this Author tells us, page 286. <hi>That thoſe who refuſed ſo to hear and receive them, did not Sin in ſo doing.</hi> And here we ſee again, the Arrogance and Impudence of the ſame Author, in giving the Lye to the Lord <hi>Jeſus.</hi>

               <p>Our <hi>Hebrew</hi> Maſters, do indeed, teach us to read the <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Sentences</hi> of part of the Scriptures; but this politick <hi>Pedagogue</hi> would inſtruct us to read, not only the <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Sentences,</hi> but the true Senſe and Meaning of them backwards.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in divers places, owns his caſting out Devils and unclean Spirits; and ſometimes theſe unclean Spirits owned him to be the Son of the moſt high God, as did the Legion of Devils, with which the Man was poſſeſſed in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the <hi>Gadarenes,</hi> 5 <hi>Mark</hi> 7. and divers others. And the Phariſees, (the worſt, and moſt malicious of his Enemies) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his caſting out Devils: Yet notwithſtanding, the compoſer of this Treatiſe had the Confidence to affirm, page 354. <hi>That no Man was ever poſſeſſed with any other Spirit, than that by which his Body was naturally moved.</hi> And ſo gives the Lye, not only to our Saviour, but to all
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:43640:75"/>
the Four Evangeliſts, who have left upon Record moſt remarkable Inſtances of thoſe Miracles.</p>
               <p>In page 62, 63, and 64. this Author tells us, <hi>That Man, by Nature is in a State of War, every Man againſt every Man; and every Man has a right to every thing, over the Goods and Body of his Neighbour:</hi> And yet in his next Chapter, (which is not above eight pages further, he ſets down <hi>Ten Laws of Nature,</hi> which <hi>Laws of Nature</hi> are immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and eternal, and ſtamped upon Men's Souls, and every of them tends to Peace and Quietneſs, Love and Kindneſs, Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and doing to others, as we would be willing they ſhould do to us; and theſe two Aſſertions, are as contrary one to the other, as Light is to Darkneſs; however it is much more modeſt to give himſelf the Lye, then to give it ſo often, as he has done, to the Saviour of the World, and the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In page 88. he acquaints us,</hi> That by the People aſſembled, are transferr'd all their Right on him whom they choſe their Soveraign, which Soveraign can do no Injuſtice, though at his pleaſure, he take away any of their Lives: <hi>And yet page 152. he aſſerts,</hi> That no Man in the inſtitution of their Soveraign, can be ſuppoſed to give away the Right of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:43640:75"/>
his own Body. <hi>And page 112.</hi> If an Aſſembly meet and agree together, they may rebel, and make War againſt their Soveraign. <hi>And I affirm, that no Man of Senſe or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, can be ſuppoſed to defend the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors reputation in ſo notorious a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In page 285. and divers other places, he affirms,</hi> That Chriſt's Kingdom not being of this World, he left the <hi>Jews</hi> to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and other Nations to their reſpective Soveraigns; <hi>and yet page 106. he plainly affirms,</hi> That Chriſt acted in this World, as King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and by his Soveraign Power and Authority, ſent two of his Diſciples to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and bring away the She-aſs, and her Colt, on which he was to ride into <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page 62. He affirms,</hi> That the Deſires and Paſſions of Man are no Sin, though it be an abſolute Breach of the Tenth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour forbids ſwearing by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Earth, Jeruſalem, or a Man's own head, 5 <hi>Matth.</hi> 34, 35, 36. but this Author aſſerts, page 71. <hi>That ſuch kind of Oaths is no ſwearing, and ſo makes our Saviour guilty of Lying.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Page 152. he ſays,</hi> That every man is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to know the Law of Nature, it being ſo plain; <hi>and yet, pag. 141. he avers,</hi> That
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43640:76"/>
the Law of Nature is, of all Laws the moſt obſcure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 261. he ſays,</hi> Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s death did not ſatisfy God<hi>'s</hi> juſtice, <hi>and yet, pag. 356. he acknowledges,</hi> That the Paſſion of Chriſt is a full Ranſom for all manner of Sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 272. he affirms,</hi> That there were no true Martyrs, but thoſe who converſed with our Saviour while he was here upon Earth; and that he who is no Miniſter, can be no Martyr: <hi>Now if ſo, all other Martyrs have thrown away their Lives, and were acceſſary to their own Deaths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pag. 60. he ſays, <hi>That Contempt is the Immobility of the Heart:</hi> But this cannot be, for when the Pulſe ceaſes to beat, the Man can no longer live; and conſequently, this Author, contemning all ſorts of Laws, Learning and Religion, could never have lived to finiſh his <hi>Leviathan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Saviour acknowledges, that if he had not done ſuch Miracles as no Man elſe could do, the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> might have had for their Unbelief ſome juſt pretence.</p>
               <p>But this Author avers, pag. 148. <hi>That Miracles are not at all ſufficient to give evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:</hi> But ſure I am, that this bold Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his, which is a Wonder, though not a Miracle, gives the whole World a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43640:76"/>
ſufficient Evidence of his great Arrogance and Impudence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Saviour ſays,</hi> That the Reprobates ſhall go into everlaſting Puniſhment: <hi>And St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſays,</hi> That this Mortal muſt put on Immortality: <hi>but this Author ſays p. 345.</hi> That the Reprobates Bodies ſhall not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And pag 245.</hi> That no individual Perſon ſhall be puniſhed with Torment Eternal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 360. he ſays,</hi> That to pray to the King for fair Weather, is Idolatry: But if the King command a Man to do ſo, and he do it, it is no Idolatry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 360. he tells us,</hi> That if a Man, who is no Paſtor, worſhips an Idol, and others follow him, this is no Scandal given: <hi>However, I wonder he ſhould not think this to be a very ſcandalous Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Author were yet living, I ſhould take the boldneſs to give him this civil Item, <hi>(oportet mendacem eſſe memorem)</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince he aſſerts, <hi>pag.</hi> 60. <hi>That Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Memory are the ſame thing:</hi> For if ſo, I greatly wonder how he could imagine ſo many Falſities and Contradictions, and yet, at the ſame time not remember them. For my part, I muſt confeſs, I do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <hi>Imagination</hi> and <hi>Memory</hi> to be the ſame thing; and if it were practicable, I
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:43640:77"/>
ſhould thus reaſon the Caſe with him: <hi>Sir, Your</hi> Leviathan <hi>is a product of meer Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; for never any ſuch thing yet was: But of that which never yet was, you could have no Remembrance,</hi> Egregie magiſter ergo falleris.</p>
               <p>I cannot here omit his poſitive Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſame page, <hi>That all Men have equal Faculties of Body and Mind;</hi> but God forbid it ſhould be true, for then every Man, equal to him as to Education and acquired Learning, would write and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and by that means, all Bookſellers ſhops would ſoon be fill'd with impious and pernicious Books.</p>
               <p>What other Men may judge of this his poſitive Aſſertion, I know not: For my part, I am not of that Opinion, That a <hi>Marius, Diocleſian, Julius Caeſar,</hi> or <hi>Tamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi> had not Gifts and Endowments of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture far above a <hi>Plebeian,</hi> or Common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; or that every Peſant, or Country Thatcher, had equal parts to compare with <hi>Jack Straw,</hi> or <hi>Wat Tyler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt needs confeſs, That if all other Men were like the Author of this <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> I ſhould then conclude, That all Men are indeed both by Nature and Art in a State of War.</p>
               <p>

It's too plain, That he was in War with the whole World; and its great pitty the whole World was not in War with him, when he firſt publiſhed his accurſed <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan.</hi>

               <p>As to the Deſign in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> general of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Diſcourſe, I am willing to believe
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43640:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the Author's <hi>Res Anguſta Domi,</hi> and perſonal Vain-glory, might move him in ſuch a juncture as that was, to fiſh in troubled waters, in hopes to advance his Fortune, and get himſelf a Name: But Satan who ſtood behind the Curtain, and prompted him to this Undertaking, had undoubtedly a further and deeper Deſign; namely, to encourage all Perſons whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to follow the Devices and Deſires of their own hearts, without the leaſt fear or dread of burning Lakes, or endleſs Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by ſhamefully diſtorting and wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the plain Texts of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by ſearching for Errours in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by undervaluing and leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening our Saviour's Miracles, and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to overthrow the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> by calling in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the Subſiſtence of bleſſed Angels, Unclean Spirits, and Departed Souls; by turning heavenly Manſions, and the place of Eternal Torments into meer Metaphors: And laſtly, by ſetting up a <hi>New Common-Wealth,</hi> and a <hi>Soveraign,</hi> who, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> muſt have the abſolute Command, not only of the Eſtates and Bodies, but alſo of the Souls and Conſciences of all his Subjects, though it be to deny the Doctrine of Chriſt and his

and to Worſhips Idols, and Sacrifice to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</p>
               <p>This Arch Enemy of Souls is, alas! too well acquainted with Humane Frailties; (which are, in truth, the effects of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiling our <hi>Firſt Parents)</hi> and knows, That <hi>Quicquid volumus, facile credimus,</hi> that very ſlender Arguments, if they do but gratify fleſhly Deſires, have great power and force with poor Mortals.

And here I hope it will not be ill taken, to make an humble Addreſs to the young Nobility and Gentry of this Nation, that they will be pleaſed to have ſo great a regard to their own Eternal Welfare and Happineſs, as neither to countenance this impious Book themſelves, nor allow it a place in their Libraries, for fear it may one day corrupt ſome of their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Race, when they are laid in their cold Tombs.</p>
               <p>I moſt earneſtly beſeech you, Sirs, to hearken to a poor Man's Advice, who has no ſiniſter Ends or Deſigns; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he here urges, is out of true reſpect and kindneſs. Who reflects with great remorſe upon his own miſpent Hours, Days and Years; and were it in his power to recall Time and Opportunities, would certainly (with God's aſſiſtance) employ them to better Ends and Purpoſes.</p>
               <p>Hitherto, your tender years, and little Experience, may juſtly plead for your not diſcerning <hi>Id manticae quod in tergo eſt,</hi> or diving into the ſubtil Fallacies and Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Compoſer of this Treatiſe: But now that you have ſome of his Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, Arrogancies, Contradictions and Extravagancies laid ſo plainly and clearly before your Eyes, to harbour or cheriſh

in your Boſoms ſuch Snakes and Vipers, would admit of no excuſe.</p>
               <p>If you find a Gameſter making uſe but of one falſe Die, he never wins a Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling more of your Monies. If a Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cheats you with falſe Wares, you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after, by your good Wills, come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his doors: And then, Why ſhould you give the leaſt reſpect or countenance, to one who endeavours to cheat you of your Souls, and rob you of Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
               <p>Foraſmuch as you may be well aſſured, That all ſuch impious Diſcourſes as theſe, are Traps and Snares laid for you by the Devil, and his Emiſſaries, to entice you to Sin and Wickedneſs, and then to plunge you in endleſs Woes and Miſeries;</p>
               <p>For the timely prevention of which, the beſt and ſafeſt Advice that I can poſſibly give to the Youth of both Sexes is, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy ſome part of their precious Hours in reading the Holy Scriptures, (rather than Plays and Romances, (which are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God himſelf to be the Rule of their Lives, and by which they muſt be one day judg'd, and give an account of all thoſe extraordinary Talents and Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, which they have received at his hands, above the vulgar and meaner fort

of Human Race: By which I mean,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, their ingenuous, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral, and more refined Education, there being few Parents among the Gentry or Nobility, who, for their own Reputation, are not exceeding careful to put their Children under ſuch Diſcipline of Tutors and Governeſſes, as may break their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural rudeneſs, and mould them into ſome form of Civility, and teach them that fundamental Leſſon of Obedience, upon which muſt be built all future Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and afterwards to cultivate their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, to bend their Wills, and <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline their Affections, as they grow up in years, to thoſe things, which are proper Accompliſhments for each of the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Sexes: Which is an Advantage, that poor and indigent Parents can never pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe for either Sons or Daughters, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great Expence, they being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſend them abroad, into all places, and among all Companies, where the one are in danger of learning all ſorts of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the other liable to manifold Temptations, and can ſeldom or never obſerve or practiſe ſuch a Severity and Reſervedneſs, as otherwiſe would become a Virgin-Innocence.</p>

2. A ſecond Advantage is, <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Riches,</hi> which many times comes into the hands of young Heirs and Heireſſes, as if they were dropt out of the Clouds: Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Pallaces, which they built not; Goods, which they provided not; Lands and Poſſeſſions, of which they never made the purchaſe; But are now become God's ſtewards, and muſt one day give accompt of all particulars, that is to ſay, what they have laid out upon themſelves, what they have diſtributed among the Poor, the Widow and the Fatherleſs, and what they have left behind them to their Children and Families.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third Advantage is, that of <hi>Time,</hi> the Rich have no need to employ their time, to gain that wherewith they alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy abound; whereas the poor Man has ſcarce any vacant Hours, or ſuch as he can call his own, but they are all fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall'd by their preſſing Neceſſities: The Shepherd muſt, by Day and Night, watch his Flocks and his Folds; the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is confined to his Plough, his Goad, and his Oxen; the Carpenter to his Saw and Ax; the Smith to his Hammer and Anvil; the Potter to his Clay and Wheel; and ſo are all Workmen and Artificers to

their ſeveral Manufactures and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>So that the <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Wealthy</hi> have, by this means, their Time at their own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, (God having prevented them with the Bleſſings of his Goodneſs) but muſt be accomptable to God how they have employed it; that is to ſay, what part or portion has been by them ſet apart for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and publick Devotions, and what for reading of the Holy Scriptures; what has been ſpent in lawful or unlawful Paſtimes, and what in ſloth and idleneſs; what in gratifying Pride and Vanity, or indulging any manner of Exceſs.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, as the Inclinations and Averſions of great Princes, are very much imitated by their Courtiers and Attendants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>MOſt gracious God, and merciful Father in Chriſt Jeſus, who, while he was here on Earth, took little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in his Arms, and bleſſed them: Be graciouſly pleaſed to have a particular Regard to the Youth of both Sexes; but in a more eſpecial manner, to beſtow a larger portion of Spiritual Graces, and Heavenly Benedictions, on thoſe whom thou haſt placed in higher Ranks and Degrees; let no Wind of falſe Doctrine blaſt thoſe fragrant Flowers in their blooms, nor any Compoſers of <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans,</hi> or other Impoſtors, beguile them of Eternal Life and Happineſs: Let them remember their Creator in the Days of their Youth, before the <hi>Evil Days</hi> come, and the Years when they ſhall ſay, <hi>We have no pleaſure in them.</hi> Ere ever the ſilver Chord be looſed, or the golden Bowl be broken, make them truly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that there is a Maker of all things, and Judge of all Men; (at the Bar of whoſe Tribunal all Men muſt one Day appear) that there is verily a Reward for the Righteous, of Eternal Joys; and as verily a Puniſhment for Reprobates, of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:43640:82"/>
endleſs Miſeries. That the Sentence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once paſt, (be it for <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil)</hi> muſt ſtand for ever fixt, and be irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable: That all the Riches and Honours which this World affords, can never counterballance the leaſt or meaneſt of Rational Souls; that ten Thouſand times ten Thouſand Years, either in Happineſs or Miſery, neither make nor meaſure the leaſt imaginable part of Eternity: That no Perſon of any Sex or Age, in the ordinary way of Providence, has any Aſſurance of Life, for ſo much as one Hour or Minutes ſpace: That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever harbours in his, or her boſom, any one known or habitual Sin, is for every Moment of that time, liable to Eternal Damnation.</p>
                     <p>That to truſt, either to a Death-bed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or to be encouraged by the Example of the <hi>Thief</hi> upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> is very unſafe and dangerous: The firſt of which may be obſtructed by Lethargies, Megrims, Bodily-pains and anguiſh, and many other Accidents; and the laſt, can afford no hopes, foraſmuch as, before Chriſt's Paſſion, it never was, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it neither could, nor ever can be any other Man's caſe. And laſtly, That as the Tree falls, ſo it lies; and after
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:43640:83"/>
Death, Judgment follows, and there can be no place for Repentance, or Believing, in the Grave, whither (ſooner or later) ſome are haſtening, and all the reſt are going.</p>
                     <p>Be pleaſed therefore, Gracious Father, to guard and protect them, from all the malicious practiſes of that inviſible Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Souls; and to plant thy true Fear in their hearts, now in their youthful Days, and tender Years; that ſo they may hereafter become burning and ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lights in their Generations. And having finiſhed their Courſe, and run their Race, and been faithful to Death, they may wear the Crown of Life, and their Souls be ſafely conveyed by their Tutelar and Guardian Angels, to the place of everlaſting Reſt and Happineſs: And all for the ſake of thy dearly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son, and our bleſſed Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

               <hi>To the Land of Darkneſs, and the Shadow of Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Truth is, this is a Queſtion, in one ſenſe, very eaſy to be anſwered by a Man, who is already paſt the Seventieth Year of his Age; ſince the Age of a Man, in the ordinary Courſe of Nature, is but <hi>Threeſcore Years and Ten;</hi> and though there ſhould be <hi>Ten</hi> (or <hi>Ten times Ten)</hi> more added to it, yet would his Life be but <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Sorrow,</hi> ſo ſoon paſſeth it away, and he is gone to his long home.</p>
            <p>Che noi ſiamo cenere e polve! Che breve è queſta vita; Ch'al girer di poc hore, il Ci'el riſolve la vanita.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:43640:84"/>
Alas, Man that is born of a Woman, has but a ſhort time to live; he is but of very few days, and thoſe full of Diſquiet and Troubles: He cometh forth like a Flower, and is cut down; he fleeth alſo like a Shadow, and continueth not; his Days are but a Span long, and ſwifter than a Weaver's Shuttle, or a Poſt that haſteth by; and at his beſt Eſtate, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Vanity.</p>
            <p>Who is he that can deliver himſelf from the hand of the Grave? One dieth in his full ſtrength, being wholly at eaſe and quiet, his Breaſts are full of Milk, and his Bones are moiſtned with marrow: And another dieth in the bitterneſs of his Soul, and never eateth with pleaſure.</p>
            <p>This made the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> Oratorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reflect.</p>
            <p>O Death! How bitter is the Remembrance of Thee, to a Man that liveth at reſt in his Poſſeſſions, unto the Man that hath nothing to vex him, and that bath proſperity in all things, yea, unto him that is able yet to receive Meat. <hi>And again,</hi> O Death! how acceptable is thy Sentence unto the Needy, and unto him whoſe ſtrength faileth; that is now in the laſt Age,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:43640:84"/>
and is vexed with all things, <hi>41 Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus 1, 2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This made eloquent <hi>Job</hi> cry out in the height of his Affliction.</p>
            <p>Let the Day periſh wherein I was born; let Darkneſs and the ſhadow of Death ſtain it, and a Cloud dwell upon it: Let alſo that Night be ſolitary wherein I was conceived, and no joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Voice come therein: Let the Stars of the Twilight thereof be darkned; let it look for Light, but have none, neither let it ſee the Dawning of the Day, becauſe it ſhut not up the door of my Mother's Womb, nor hid Sorrow from mine eyes. Wherefore is Light given to him that is in Miſery, and Life unto the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Soul? Who long for Death, but it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, and dig for it more than for hidden Treaſures? Who rejoice exceedingly when they can find the Grave, <hi>3 Job 3. 5.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>O that I might have my Requeſt, and that God would grant me the thing that I long for; even that it would pleaſe God to deſtroy me; that He would let looſe his hand, and cut me off, <hi>6 Job 8, 9.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus is Death to ſome the <hi>King of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> and to others, a kind Friend, and a welcome Gueſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:43640:85"/>
               <hi>However, be it Welcome, or not wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, it is the Sentence of God upon all Living,</hi> For all Fleſh is as Graſs, and all the Goodlineſs thereof, as the Flower of the field: Duſt we are, and to Duſt we muſt return.</p>

               <p>How weak are then the Projects, and how vain the Imaginations of poor Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Wights?</p>
               <p>To day, there's nothing but Feaſting, Muſick and Dancing in their ſtately Halls, and Banqueting-Rooms: To morrow, they are languiſhing upon their ſick Beds, given over by their Phyſicians, the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains drawn upon them by their Friends and Acquaintance, and in their laſt Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
               <p>To day, they purchaſe Lands of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and call their Manſion-Houſes by their own Names: To morrow, all that parcel of Ground or Earth, of which they can be truly called Maſters, does not exceed four Cubick yards.</p>
               <p>To day, they are ſitting at their Toi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, conſulting with their Glaſſes, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring

their own Shapes and Features; and cannot with any patience, endure the leaſt ſpeck or ſpot upon their ſhining and coſtly Garments: To morrow, they are dreſt from Head to Foot in grave Cloaths, and their loathſom Carkaſſes are given for food to the nauſeous and greedy Worms.</p>
               <p>To day, they are Lords of Mannors, and by their Deputies and Stewards, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point their reſpective Courts: To mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, they themſelves are no more than meer ſtewards, and muſt, in the preſence of a moſt righteous and impartial Judge, give a ſtrict Accompt, to the value of two Mites, as well of all their Disburſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as their Receipts.</p>
               <p>But now, in another ſenſe, there is no problematick Queſtion has ever been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to poor Mortals, neither in former nor latter Ages, that has given them grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Difficulties, or begot in the Minds of Thinking-Men, more anxious and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thoughts.</p>

a direct, poſitive, or categorick Anſwer: Foraſmuch as we have never received any News from the Dead, ſince the World was created, of which we can be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly aſſured; or Letters of Intelligence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from any One of thoſe innumerable Thouſands of departed Souls that have gone before us.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> was caught up into the <hi>Third Heaven,</hi> but, at his coming down again, he gives no other Deſcription of the Place, or of the Dwellers in thoſe upper Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than by meer <hi>Negatives.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead and buried four days; but where his wandring Soul had its A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, in that interval of Time, I do not believe there is left upon Record, an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or ſo much as the leaſt mention in any Hiſtory, whether Sacred or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane.</p>
               <p>If a young Traveller, quitting his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Soil, to viſit ſome remoter Parts of the habitable Earth, be extreamly ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, when he meets with Climates much hotter or colder than his own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ſhorter Days and Nights, with Perſons of different Complexions and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,

with variety of Cuſtoms and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of foreign Nations, with Sea-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſtrange wild Beaſts, and creeping Things of divers kinds; How much more muſt the Soul of a dying Man be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurprized, in the critical Moment of its paſſage into the Regions of the other World, and ſudden ſtepping from off the Bank of <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Mortality,</hi> and taking its flight into the wide Expanſe, and vaſt Abyſs of <hi>Eternity?</hi> where ſhortly it expects to meet with innumerable Myriads of incorporeal Beings, with which it had never before the leaſt Converſe or Acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Upon this Bank or Shoar, muſt Kings and Emperours leave behind them their Crowns and Scepters, Prelates and Judges their Mitres and Scarlet Robes, Rich-men their Houſes and Lands; the Covetous their Heaps of Gold and Worldly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and the Voluptuous, their <hi>Dalilahs,</hi> and all their ſenſual Delights.</p>

               <p>And let us ſuppoſe one ſingle Grain of that vaſt Globe, to be removed, or taken away, at the end of every Thouſandth Year: What a prodigious Length of Time would be expired, before that great Maſs, or Globe of Sand, would be removed? And yet, when all this Time ſhall be expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the Damned in Hell will be as far from an End of their Miſeries, as they were the firſt Hour, or Moment, they were thrown into that dreadful place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

There is yet a third Senſe, in which this Queſtion <hi>(Whither art thou going?)</hi> nearly concerns all good Chriſtians, and ſhould, every Morning and Evening of their Lives, be ſeriouſly propoſed to, and cautiouſly anſwered by their own private Conſciences.</p>
               <p>Now what has been ſaid in the two foregoing Senſes, ſerves only to inform, and to help us, to make ſuitable and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reflections.</p>

            <p>MOST Glorious LORD GOD, and merciful Father in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who inhabiteſt the higheſt Heavens, and yet art pleaſed to dwell in the loweſt Hearts; and haſt graciouſly promiſed, That where-ever Two or Three are gathered together in thy Name and Fear, Thou wilt be there in the midſt of them.</p>
            <p>Look down in mercy upon us, who are now before Thee, and dare not give ſleep to our Eyes, or ſlumber to our Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, till we have renewed our Covenant with the GOD and FATHER of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and have humbly offered unto Him,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:43640:101"/>
our Selves, our Souls, and Bodies, as a reaſonable ſervice.</p>
            <p>Be therefore pleaſed, O Lord, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give all the Sins of our paſt Lives, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the Omiſſions and Commiſſions of this Day, for which alone, ſhouldſt Thou enter into Judgment with us, Thou mightſt juſtly condemn us to the loweſt Hell, and give ns our portion with Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in utter Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed LORD, we deſire, from the bottom of our Hearts, to be ſenſible of our manifold Frailties and Infirmities, and of that Law in our Members, that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Warring againſt the Law of our Minds; ſo that whenever we would do Good, Evil is preſent with us, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingles with our very Prayers, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs our moſt religious Duties and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances.</p>

            <p>And for his ſake, we humbly beſeech Thee, O LORD, to lighten our Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and by thy great mercy; to defend us from all perils and dangers this Night, giving us a moderate and refreſhing Reſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> free from frightful Dreams, and ſinful Imaginations, which are the evil Effects of our corrupt Natures.</p>
            <p>When we awake, let our Souls be filled with heavenly Thoughts, and pious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, always remembring, That we are in the preſence of a God, who knows our down-ſitting and our up-riſing, who underſtands our Thoughts a farr off, and is acquainted with all our ways.</p>
            <p>If we ſhould be ſo vain and fooliſh, to believe that the Darkneſs would cover us, the Night ſhall be light about us, the Darkneſs hideth not from Thee, but the Night ſhineth as the Day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Darkneſs and the Night are both alike to Thee.</p>

            <p>And let no worldly Affairs hinder us, from being always in a readineſs, for our laſt and final Conflict with the Prince and Powers of Darkneſs, who knowing their time is but ſhort, will be ſure to make their fierceſt Aſſaults upon Departing-Souls, when they find them ſtruggling with Bodily pains, and ſharp Diſeaſes, and drawing nigh to their laſt Agonies. And ſometimes, to terrify them with frightful Dreams and Viſions, to make them, if poſſible, utterly to deſpair of God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and to let go their hold, and quit their Hopes of Eternal Life and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Make us therefore ſensible, how highly it concerns us, while we have Health of Body, and ſoundneſs of Mind, to arm our ſelves, like good Souldiers, with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Courage and Reſolution, for thoſe Death-bed Combats, and critical Hours, Minutes, and Moments of our Lives.</p>

And becauſe we are to wreſtle with inviſible Enemies, of mighty Power and wonderful Knowledge, great Subtilty and long Experience, who know too well our Tempers, Inclinations, and Infirmities, and where, and how to ſet upon us with the greateſt Advantage: Be pleaſed to ſend thy bleſſed Angels, and Miniſtring-Spirits, to comfort and aſſiſt us, in all thoſe ſiery Tryals and Temptations.</p>

our Mother's Breaſts; for protecting us this laſt Night from many calamitous Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, which in a Night might have befallen us, and bringing us ſafely to the light of another Day, and ſo giving us a longer time and ſpace for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Amendment of our Lives; moſt humbly beſeeching Thee to continue theſe thy Mercies and Favours to us, and to keep us the remainder of this Day, and of our Lives, from all Things that may be hurtful either to our Spuls, or Bodies.</p>
            <p>From all Evil and Miſchief, from Sin, from the Grafts and Aſſaults of the Devil, from thy Wrath, and everlaſting Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Good LORD deliver us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From ſaying in our Hearts that there is no God, or openly denying the Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and glorious Attributes, (of which either the higheſt Preſumption, or utmoſt Deſperation, are the uſual and woful Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.) Let the viſible things of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Reſtections of our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, in our Solitudes, and private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements, be ſufficient to diſſwade and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:43640:106"/>
Againſt Idolatry, and having other Gods beſides Thee, and from bowing down to, and Worſhipping, either Idols made with hands, or thoſe of our beloved Luſts, <hi>Lord ſtrengthen us by thy Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To keep us from taking the NAME of the LORD our GOD in vain, in our ordinary Diſcourſes, or prophaning it with wicked Oaths, on bitter Curſes: Let us remember that the ſame LORD hath aſſured all ſuch Offenders, that he will in no wiſe hold them guiltleſs.</p>
            <p>To obſerve religiouſly the Lord's Day, and all other Times ſolemnly ſet a part for Divine Worſhip and Service; not follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own Ways, nor ſpeaking our own Words, nor thinking our own Thoughts: Let thy good Spirit diſpoſe and encline our hearts.</p>
            <p>Let us never attempt to ſow Diſcord and Diviſions in the Church, or to offend our bleſſed Saviour's Little Ones, or any way to diſturb the Communion of Saints, as knowing who hath told us, <hi>That it would be much better for us to be thrown into the midſt of the Sea, with Mill-ſtones hung about our Necks, than to be guilty of ſuch Offences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:43640:106"/>
Let us always be conſcientiouſly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Honour and Obey our Parents, and all others, under whoſe Rule and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thou haſt placed us; behaving our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves with all humility and ſingleneſs of heart, not as Eye-ſervants or Men-pleaſers. And whenever Pride and Vain-glory would puff us up, and make us become wiſe in our own Eyes, let the remembrance that we are but Duſt and Aſhes, and born like the wild Aſſes Colt, pull down our haughty Looks, and abate our ſwelling Thoughts.</p>
            <p>From ſinful Anger, and unbridled Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, from provoking Language, and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Speeches, from Envy, Hatred and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and all the miſchievous and fatal conſequences, that may thereby happen, either to our ſelves, or others; LORD ever keep us by thy reſtraining Grace.</p>
            <p>From Rioting and Drunkenneſs, from Chambering and Wantonneſs, from Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Fornication and Uncleanneſs, or living in any known Sin: Let the fear of thy Wrath, and the Vengeance of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Fire deterr us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:43640:107"/>
To wrong our Neighbours by open Violence, or by Secret and fraudulent Practiſes: Let it never enter into our Thoughts.</p>
            <p>That we may never Slander, ſpeak Evil of, or raſhly cenſure others, or bear falſe Witneſs againſt them: Let us ſet a watch before our Mouths, and ſtrictly guard the Doors of our Lips.</p>
            <p>Let us be afraid of oppreſſing the Poor and Needy in the Gate, or ploughing in the field of the Fatherleſs, becauſe their Redeemer is mighty; or of devouring Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow's Houſes, leſt the Stones out of the Walls ſhould, one Day, be our Accuſers, and the Beams out of the Timber make Anſwer, and teſtifie againſt us.</p>
            <p>To covet our Neighbour's Houſe, to covet our Neighbour's Wife, his Man-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, his Maid-ſervant, his Ox, his Aſs, or any thing that is his: Let no worldly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, or carnal Delight be ever able to tempt or allure us.</p>
            <p>From Thieves and Robbers, from the Hands of bloody Men and Murderers,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:43640:107"/>
from Invaſion of foreign Foes, from the Conſpiracies of Domeſtick Enemies, and Treachery of falſe Friends; do Thou, O LORD, to whom alone all Hearts are open, all Deſigns known, and from whom no Secrets are hid, defend us by thy good Providence, confounding their Counſels, and bringing to nought their Devices.</p>
            <p>From Plague, Peſtilence and Famine, from bodily Torments, Tempeſts and Earth-quakes, and all the ſad Accidents of Fire and Water, for thy Mercies ſake, ſave and protect us.</p>
            <p>Neither do we pray for our ſelves alone, but for the whole Race of Mankind, now liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon, or working within the Bowels of the habitable Earth, or elſe floating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the deep Waters; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly for the Church Militant, where-ever ſcattered or diſperſed, that the Gates of Hell may never prevail againſt it: Look down with the Eye of pitty upon all, who in this tranſitory Life, are in Trouble, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Need, Sickneſs, or any other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, more eſpecially upon thoſe thy Servants, on whom thou haſt laid thine afflicting Hand, either for a Tryal of their Patience, or a Puniſhment of their
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:43640:108"/>
Diſobedience: Make them ſenſible that Affliction comes not forth of the Duſt, neither doth Trouble ſpring out of the Ground, but that the Hand of the LORD hath done it, to whom alone belong the Iſſues of Life and Death, and who doth whatever pleaſeth him in Heaven and in Earth, but never willingly aſſlicts or grieves the Children of Men, and then <hi>Why ſhould we receive Good Things at the hands of the LORD, and not Evil things?</hi> And, <hi>Why ſhould a living Man complain for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Sins.</hi> In the mean time be thou graciouſly pleaſed, who art the great Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician of Soul and Body, to mitigate their Pains, and to aſſwage their Griefs, and to lay no more upon Duſt and Aſhes, than thou enableſt them to bear with Chriſtian patience, and a lively Faith in the Merits and Mediation of JESUS CHRIST the Righteous, for the Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Sins, and the Salvation of their Souls: That ſo thy Fatherly Chaſtiſements may have their bleſſed Effects; and thoſe thy Children may come out of the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of Affliction, like Gold and Silver that hath been tried in the fire, and purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeven times.</p>
            <p>

Be merciful to theſe Kingdoms, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert thoſe heavy Judgments, which we have done as much as in us lay, by our crying Sins and Provocations, to pull down upon our Heads.</p>
            <p>Let the choiceſt of thy Bleſſings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend upon the Head and Heart of Him, whom by thy eſpecial Providence, thou haſt placed in ſupream Authority over us; together with all His Royal Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Give Grace and Wiſdom to all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators and great Counſellors in all their Debates and Conſultations.</p>
            <p>Clean Hands, and clear Conſciences to the Judges and chief Magiſtrates, that ſo they may help the Fatherleſs, and hear the Cauſe of the Widow, and upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, act in their ſeveral Places, without the leaſt partiality, or reſpect of Perſons.</p>
            <p>Spiritual Gifts and Graces to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of thy Word and Sacraments, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Dignified or Diſtinguiſhed, that they may truly and faithfully feed the Flocks committed to their Charge.</p>
            <p>

Sobriety and Godlineſs to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and Inhabitants of foreign Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that by their good Converſations and Examples, they may convert <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Inſidels</hi> to the Faith of JESUS, and turn many Souls to Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>The Dew and Bleſſing of Heaven to Schools and Univerſities, that out of thoſe Seminaries and Nurſeries may grow up Plants, that may be uſeful both to Church and State, in their ſeveral Capacities and Generations.</p>
            <p>Health and Happineſs here, and the Joys of Heaven hereafter to our Parents, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, Siſters, Kindred, or Chriſtian Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and to all our Friends and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors, who have at any time gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly and readily ſhewed us Kindneſs in our Diſtreſs, and when we truly ſtood in need of their Aid and Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>A Spirit of Reformation to the whole Commonalty, within theſe Realms and Dominions, that ſo they may live in the true Faith and Fear of Thee our GOD, in humble Obedience to their Superiors, and in Brotherly Love and Charity one towards another.</p>

Finally, we beſeech Thee, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with us, and all thoſe who ſhall this day meet in any of the publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, to aſſiſt at thy Divine Worſhip and Service. Let our Prayers come up before thee as Incenſe, and the lifting up of our hands as an acceptable Sacrifice. Touch, with a Cole from thine Altar, the Tongues of thoſe who are to ſpeak, that they may not ſpare, but cry aloud, and lift up their Voices like Trumpets, and ſhew the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> their Tranſgreſſions, and tell every Congregation their Sins: And let us, and all their Hearers, receive the Word with meekneſs and pure Affections, laying it up in our Hearts, and bringing forth the fruit thereof in our future Lives and Converſations, All which (with what ever elſe thou knoweſt to be needful for us) we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg in the Name, and for the Sake of JESUS CHRIST the Righteous, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding theſe our imperfect Prayers with that abſolute Form, which he himſelf, while he was yet upon Earth, taught his Diſciples, ſaying.</p>

Our Father which art in Heaven, hallowed be thy NAME, thy Kingdom come, thy Will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven: Give us this Day our daily Bread, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our Treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that Treſpaſs againſt us, and lead us not into Temptation, but deliver us from Evil, for thine is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory, for ever and ever,</p>
