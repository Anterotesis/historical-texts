         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Reaſons humbly propounded againſt Diſſolving the Antient Revenue ariſing by Wine-Licences, and Impoſing Twenty Shillings, or any other Sum, upon a Tun of Wine, in lieu thereof, to be paid by the Merchant.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THE Wine-Merchants trade up to the height of their (greatly) impaired Stock and Credit; and though the addition of 20 <hi>s.</hi> upon a Tun of Wine may ſeem ſmall, yet it will ſubſtract no leſs than 26000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> out of the Merchants Stock, which they muſt pay in lieu of about 12 or 13000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> which the Vintners now pay for their Wine-Licences: for that Revenue (as we are credibly informed) yeelds no more. The Merchants Payment of the ſaid 26000 <hi>l.</hi> will enforce them for want thereof, to trade for 100000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> leſs than now they do; which will not only be their loſs, but the King alſo will ſuffer in the Cuſtoms.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Cuſtoms upon Wines are already ſo high, that the Merchants after all their great Charge, Hazards, Loſſes in Forraign Parts, by Sea, and after Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, are forced to ſell their choiceſt Wines at the Retailers Prizes, for Money to pay the Cuſtoms; which Wine they Compound and Mix with mean decaying Wines and other Ingredients, to their great advantage. The addition of 26000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> will prove an exceeding Preſſure upon the Merchants, and no leſs difficult for them to raiſe, and multiply their Neceſſities, and further enable Retailers of Wine to prey upon them, and to encreaſe the ſaid evil Compoſitions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That a Grant of Tunnage upon Merchants Importation of Wine or any other Commodities, was never granted to any in <hi>England,</hi> but to the King as Soveraign Lord, for protecting them in their Traffick at Sea and Land; nor is it granted to any other Perſon in any Part or Place in the World, where we have been or traded, but to the Soveraign, upon this general equity of Protecting them in their Commerce. And we humbly hope this Honourable Houſe will not be prevailed with to make a Preſident herein to free the Vintners from paying their Antient Duty for Wine-Licences.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Cuſtoms upon Wines are already ſo exceeding high (even above the firſt Coſt thereof) that Forraign Princes have taken notice, and complained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and we doubt not but that a conſtant additional payment upon the Importers of Wine will occaſion and induce thoſe Princes to encreaſe their Cuſtoms upon our Commodities and Manufactures imported into their Kingdoms; and ſo the Merchant will not only ſuffer a double Miſchief and Ruine, and Trade thereby be impaired, but alſo the whole Kingdom will ſuſtain great Loſs and Damage in Vending their Commodities and Manufactures.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If the Revenue of Wine-Licences be Diſſolved, the Number of Vintners will be exceſſive. In <hi>Anno</hi> 1636, when <hi>England</hi> abounded moſt in Wealth, there were not above 2500 Taverns; and Wines were Bought Cheap beyond Sea, and not for Ready Money, but in Barter for other Commodities. During the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, all who would Sold Wine without Licence; and though the Warrs had exhauſted the Kingdom, yet about <hi>Anno</hi> 1660, the Number of Vintners were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed unto above 4800, which occaſioned Wine to be Bought at Enhanſed Prizes, and not in Barter, but moſtly for Ready Money, which is one of the Leaks through which much of our Wealth for theſe laſt 25 Years hath iſſued.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Revenue of Wine-Licences proceedeth not out of the Sober uſe of Wine in the Houſes of the Nobility and Gentry, who uſually have their Wines at the Firſt hand, but upon the more Extravagant expence thereof in Taverns, and there alſo nothing is Impoſed, but every man doth Limit his own Expence and Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; But if this Revenue be Diſſolved, and 20 <hi>s. per</hi> Tun, which is double the Value thereof, be Impoſed upon the Merchant, it will reach all Perſons and Uſes without diſtinction.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Retailers of Wine were become ſo Numerous and Skilful in that hurtful Art of Vitiating Wine, that the Act of <hi>Duodecimo Caroli Secundi,</hi> Inveſting the Crown with this Revenue of Wine-Licences, doth not only Reſtrain the Number, by appointing them to Pay for Licences, but alſo doth ſomwhat Chaſtiſe them for their ſaid unlawful Practiſes: But if this Revenue of Wine-Licences be Diſſolved, then the Number of Vintners will encreaſe, to the Debauching and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming of the Subject, and the ſaid Caſtigation will be Removed.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The Profits ariſing by Wine-Licences, is an Antient Revenue belonging to the Crown, and though (till of Late) Impoſed only by Prerogative, yet it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo manifeſtly Equal and Neceſſary, that it was admitted without the leaſt Oppoſition in the moſt Stormy and Adverſe Times; Therefore it is hoped the Retailers of Wine ſhall not be diſcharged from paying this their Antient Duty, which hath endured all Weathers, and an Impoſition of double the Value laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Depreſſed Merchants.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The Revenue of Wine-Licences ariſeth out of the Vaſt Gains of Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s of Wine, whoſe beginnings though very Mean, yet in ſhort time they arrive to great Eſtates, and are obſerved within theſe laſt 25 Years (wherein all other Traders have decayed) to have made more Purchaſes than any other Traders in <hi>England;</hi> yet by their earneſt Applications, we have cauſe to fear they will bring upon us a heavy Additional Duty, and alſo deſign to encreaſe the ſame to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from paying for Licences.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The Merchants Eſtates are uſually either in Forraign Parts, or in Retailers hands, or elſe Floating on the Seas, and expoſed to amazing Hazzards, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves poſſeſt of little elſe than empty Ware-Houſes, and cannot procure Money as Retailers of Wine may, who not only take much Ready Money, but alſo having their Cellars full of Wine, can value themſelves thereon at pleaſure: If the Merchant, though under this diſadvantage, muſt find Money to pay high Cuſtoms, and alſo this vaſt Additional Duty; Yet it is hoped the ſame ſhall not be encreaſed, to free Retailers of Wine from paying their Antient Duty of Wine-Licences.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The Revenue of Wine-Licences, as now placed, is to be payd by about 3000 Perſons who are Retailers of Wine, which can hardly be felt amongſt ſo many whoſe Stock is at leaſt ten times greater, than the Wine Merchants: but if in lieu of the Revenue of Wine-Licences, an Impoſition be upon the Merchant, the ſame will be paid out of the Purſes of a very few whoſe Stock is ſmall, and already very much burthened, and will be to them an exceeding Addition to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Payments and Sufferings, and but little for the Retailers to pay, and no more than what they paid Antiently.</p>
            <p n="12">12. That now the Merchants, when their Market for Wine is at the Worſt, have yet two ſorts of Cuſtomers to take them off, <hi>viz.</hi> Free-Vintners, and thoſe who are not free; between whom there is ſome Emulation, which is often uſeful to the Merchants, ſaving them from a Neceſſity of Selling their Wines upon the Free-Vintners Terms: but if the Revenue of Wine-Licences be diſſolved, all thoſe that are not Free-Vintners (who are more than thoſe that are Free-Vintners) will be utterly ſuppreſt, and themſelves and Families diſpoiled of their Trade and Livelyhood, and the Merchants expoſed to be preyed upon by the Free-Vintners, who then will have too great opportunity to raiſe themſelves unto an exceeding Oppulency.</p>
            <p n="13">13. If the Revenue ariſing by Wine-Licences be Diſſolved, it will Infringe the Antient Liberties and Priviledges of all the Corporations in <hi>England,</hi> who have Power by the Act of 7. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. to grant Licences unto Retailers to Sell Wine, and the Benefit thereof enures unto the Poor of the ſaid Corporations, who will not only be thereby deprived, but alſo very many Pattentees (who have paid great Sums for their Patents; and (as we are informed) have now, in conſideration thereof, ſome good Allowance in the Rent of their Wine-Licences) for they who have Patents; and they who have None, will be equally Free to Retail Wine, to the Prejudice of the Wealth and Welfare of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Objection.</label> We know it will be Objected, <hi>That when Trade is Free and Open, it becomes moſt Profitable both to King and Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſwer.</label>This holds true in Merchandize, generally uſeful and neceſſary; but where the Merchandiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is a Coſtly and Luxurious Superfluity, the more free the Trade is, the more it Conſumeth and Deſtroyeth the Subject, who had better give the King treble the value of what he may have by opening ſuch a Trade, than to have ſo much Wealth conſumed in ſo great a Superfluity. And if it be neceſſary by Licences to Reſtrain the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Traders in Ale and Beer, a native, neceſſary and cheap Commodity, and leſs apt to produce Exceſſe; then ſurely it is much more neceſſary by Licences to Reſtrain the Number of Vintners, who deal in a Coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Luxurious, Forraign Commodity, which tendeth much more to Exceſs.</p>
