         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT cannot but make ſad the hearts of all Engliſh men,
that rightly understand or know their owne liberty,
whereunto they were borne, and have juſt right and
propriety to, conſidering how great paines and charges hath
been extended toward the regaining of our lost freedome;
and what an infinite of lives and bloud have been loſt and
ſpilt for the gaining of the ſame, and what ſmall fruits are
as yet enjoyed indeed: In ſtead of a freedome ſought for,
and expected to be enjoyed, we now enjoy nothing but ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
and oppreſsion in the highest nature; and from
whom flowes cruelty more from, then from thoſe who
would have the world to beleeve, that they only are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that aime at purity of Religion, and the freedome of
the Subject, and alas they muſt needs act contrary. 'Tis
moſt certaine, that all hypocrites ſhall be made knowne,
even their owne wayes and doings ſhall diſcover them.
Who would have thought that ſuch a one as Major
<hi>Wylkes,</hi> who can take upon him to preach, and as he
would have the world to beleeve, preach the mind of God?
<pb facs="tcp:115701:3"/>
Certainly God goes contrary to his Word, if he dwell in
an hypocrites heart; as this Major hath plainly diſcovered
himſelfe to be; For deare friends, pray take notice that
this man never could, nor did reprove me of any one fault,
but privately went about to take away my life, and good
name: and if this be the acting of thoſe in whom God
doth dwell, then the Word of God must needs be a lye.
I ſhall ſpeake no more at this preſent, but ſhall refer you, and
all that know me, to what followes in the enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
And when you have weighed in the right ballance
of juctice, then cenſure of me as you pleaſe. The juſt and
righteous Iudge judge between me and thoſe mine adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries:
And if it be his will, looke in mercy upon this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> in relieving it from tyranny
and oppreſsion: which is the conſtant prayer of him who
is deare friends,</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the will and pleaſure of the Lord
Generall, to give me the Command of
the company which was once Collonel
<hi>Tichburnhams,</hi> Coll. <hi>Needham</hi> being
then Elected Collonel of the ſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment,
to whom I remained Captain
Lieutenant untill he was ſlain: After
him ſucceeded Coll. <hi>Raynsborough,</hi> to
whom I remained in the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
and being in Yorkſhire, at a town called Doncaſter,
within ten miles of Pontefract Caſtle, It was the Collonels
pleaſure, that there ſhould be a guard kept in the town, and for
that ſervice he did allot his own company, and one Captain
<hi>Grays</hi> company for that ſervice; and for the eaſe of the ſaid
two companies, he ordered that his own company ſhould be
divided into two diviſions, the one half to watch one night,
and the other half the other night, and Captain <hi>Grays</hi> the third
night. Upon the 28. of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1648. it was my lot to have
the guard, with eight files of men; about ſix of theſe files
armed men with pike and musket, and of theſe ſix files of
arms, not above four files that had their arms fixt; and out of
theſe eight files of men, I was to make good five ſeveral guards,
and to theſe ſeverall guards was not allowed above five ſhots
of powder and bullet, and not match that continued till the
morn; the ammunition was in the cuſtody of the Major <hi>Wylkes,</hi>
who had the ordering of it, and would not deliver any more, as
the corporal who went for it, told me; about four of the clock
in the after noon, being the 28 of <hi>Octob,</hi> I mounted the guard
with theſe few men, and equally divided them to their ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
guards, and continued with them till twas nigh about nine
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115701:4"/>
or ten of the clock in the evening, going from guard to guard,
at what time I was very ill, as many of the ſeverall guards can
teſtifie; there was with me when I was ſo ill, one Maſter
<hi>Wats,</hi> and one Maſter <hi>Flexney</hi> a corporall to my Coll. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and my man, they finding me ſo ill, did perſwade me to
go into ſome houſe to a fier; the Hinde being an Inne that once
or twice before I had drank in, and being nigh to it, we went
in all together into that houſe; for my part God knows my
heart, that I write nothing but the truth, and I really pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
before all the world, that I knew not the houſe any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
then any other Inne that a man might go into upon
his journey, when he comes into a town that he knows not,
nor was ever in before: For my part I was never in that town
before our Regiment came thither, neither had I been in three
houſes in the town before, and went to no houſe without law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
occaſion. Well, being at this houſe, and having a fier
made for me, I remained by it about an hour, being ſtill worſe
and worſe; ſo finding my ſelf not able to continue up all night,
I ſent my man immediately to my Coll. eldeſt ſerjeant, who
was to continue with me all night upon the main guard, for my
aſſiſtant, with expreſſe command and charge, that he ſhould
have a ſpeciall care of the ſeverall guards that night; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſent him word of my being not well, which command,
by his own confeſſion, was delivered unto him, and as far as I
know no leſſe obſerved; as ſoon as the meſſenger returned
and had told me the ſerjeants anſwer, which was, that he
would be as carefull as I if were preſent, I went to a chamber,
and the two other Gentlemen with me, and alſo my man,
and we all lay down upon two ſeverall beds, in one chamber:
In the morning I found my ſelf reaſonable well, and did ariſe
at the beating of the drum, it being the time of the travally,
which was betwixt ſeven and eight of the clock, with a reall
intent to have viſited the ſeverall guards; but as ſoon as I was
going down the ſtairs, I heard a great noyſe of horſes and
men; ſo immediately conceiving them to be an enemy by the
noyſe that they made, and hearing them cry out for the King,
for the King, I calld to thoſe that were with me in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and told them, that ſure the enemy was in the town; ſo
we all at once ran immediately down to the gate, and before
that we got down, they were paſt by over the bridge; But
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115701:4"/>
conceiving that the guard which was at the end of the bridge,
would have ſtopt them, I immediately ran after them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that I could gain the ſight of the guard, they had ſeaſed
on the guard, and taken away the corporall of the guard, and
two ſouldiers, which two ſouldiers they ſtript and ſent back
again, but the corporall they carried away with them; and
finding that there was no good to be done againſt them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome horſe, which we had not any, I indeavoured to
make good that guard, doubting that there might be more of
them in the town, or that thoſe which were gone might fall
back again; and ſtaying there a while, one brought news that
the Collonel was ſlain by thoſe which paſt away at this guard.
So not hearing of any more of them in town, I immediately
went back to the town, where I found it to be ſo. After that
I had cauſed all my company to ſtand to their arms, which
were from the guards, and had marcht a whiles about the town
in a poſture of defence, and finding no oppoſition, I divided
the whole company to the ſeverall guards, and then went to
Major <hi>Wylkes,</hi> who told me that I was acceſſary to the
Collonels death; which accuſation ſeemed very ſtrange to me,
but I told him, that he nor no other could make his words
good, he told me that he would make it good. So I left him,
and about ten or eleven of the clock, a friend came to me, and
told me, that the Major did intend to lay me faſt, and for that
purpoſe had written unto the Lieu. General. So from that time
I began to conſider with my ſelf, that it were better for me to
fall into the hands of the Lord Generall, and appeal to him,
rather then to ſubmit my ſelf a priſoner, to one who could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
abide me, nor never bore me any good will: So from that
time I began to prepare my ſelf, for to go unto the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and the next day, being the 30. of <hi>October,</hi> gave ſtrict
charge and command to the Officers of my company, to have
a ſpeciall care of the company, in keeping of them together
untill my return; and told them, that I was minded to go unto
the Lord Generall, about the death of my Collonel, and did
likewiſe write a letter to the Major certifying as much, and
that I would return again as ſoon as conveniently I could; and
ſo took my journey from Doncaſter, and really intended to go
firſt unto Saint Albones the head-quarters; but before that I
could gain it by forty miles, my money was almoſt all ſpent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115701:5"/>
and would not hold out to bring me thither; ſo was forc'd to
make uſe of my old quarters, by the way ſeveral times, and mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for <hi>London,</hi> but my horſe proved ſo weak, and the wayes
ſo bad, that I could not gain <hi>London</hi> till it was the fourth of
<hi>Nov.</hi> by the evening; where I continued till the next day
at night, fully reſolving to go to the head-quarters to acquaint
the Generall of the carriage of the buſineſſe, and to have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
liberty for ſome time, to have ſent about my occaſions, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
never been from the company one day before, ſince I
came to the command of them. But the next morning being
the ſixth day, at one of the clock in the morning, being a bed,
there came the Serjeant at Arms deputy, whom I permitted
to come into my chamber, who told me that one Major <hi>Wylkes,</hi>
had accuſed me for being acceſſary to the death of Col. <hi>Rayns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi>
and that I muſt anſwer it before the two Houſes of
Parliament in the morning, I told him that I ſhould be ready
to anſwer any thing that ſhould be proved againſt me: Then
he demanded how he might be ſure of me in the mean time;
one M. <hi>Warder</hi> who lived in the houſe, preſently paſt his word
for me, ſo the Serjeant at Arms deputy immediately departed:
And in the morning about nine of the clock he came again, and
produced his warrant, which was, that he ſhould apprehend
me where ever he found me; and all Juſtices of the peace and
other Officers, were thereby willed to aſſiſt him, ſhewing no
cauſe why nor wherefore, and that I ſhould be detained in his
cuſtody, to anſwer what ſhould be objected againſt me. I knew
not when, but rather then I would be troubleſome, I ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the tyrannicall order, and ſo went with him to the <hi>Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavage</hi>
below Ludgate, where I remained till night, having
the door lockt on me, indeed admitting any one to come and ſee
me that would: But at night news was brought me, that all
company muſt be debard me, and likewiſe pen ink and paper.
This order as was told me, was ordered by the Houſe, which
was indevoured, but not ſo ſtrictly as I did expect. The next
day a Gentleman one Captain <hi>Stevens</hi> and his Wife, and with
him a friend and his wife, ſent in a joynt of mutton to ſup
with me and my wife; But before ſupper, I underſtood that
Maſter <hi>Burr</hi> the Serjeant at Arms deputy, was in the houſe,
whom I immediately ſent for up to ſup with us, and likewiſe
the man of the houſe, who both came up. So I demanded of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115701:5"/>
Maſter <hi>Burr,</hi> whether I ſhould appeare before the Houſe, or the
Lord Generall; to whom the day before, being the ſeventh of
<hi>November,</hi> I ſent the full relation of my Colonels death, as
farre as I knew, and with it, a Petition for my inlargement?
who anſwered me, That he did believe, that if the Houſe ſhould
call me before them, they would referre me to a Councell of
Warre: I anſwered him, That I could wiſh I were at the head
Quarters; and had beene there before then, if not ſo prevented.
Being at Supper all together, the companie were very chearfull
and merry, but my Wife and my ſelfe ſat very ſad, and with
much diſquieted mindes; not knowing, but that my innocencie
would be made uſe of by mine adverſaries, to the taking away
of my life. About ten of the clock the companie all parted, and
my Wife and I went to Bed, but did ſleepe very unquietly. In
the morning there was a friend who ſent me word, that the
Houſe had taken me into conſideration, and had paſt Sentence
on me, That I ſhould be ſhot; and withall, adviſed me to make
my eſcape with all convenient ſpeed. This appeared, as uſually
the meſſengers of death doth appeare to ſome; truly, it did but
little take upon me: But that which troubled me, was, that I
ſhould be ſo blockiſh as to ſubmit to ſuch a Tyrannicall War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and that I ſhould be caſt into Priſon, and condemned, not
knowing why, nor wherefore, nor receiving any Tryall at all:
And I conceived further, that thoſe that tooke upon them to
be ſuch Tyrants, as to ſurprize a man by ſuch an Order, might by
the ſame Power take away my life.</p>
            <p>Well, hearing this newes, and knowing nothing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
I immediately deſired of God to direct me what courſe
to take; as for friends, I had very few in Towne, or none at all:
and that he would further be pleaſed, to ſtrengthen me againſt
the feare of mans power, or what ever they could doe unto me;
and that he would direct me in what ever I did undertake in
this buſineſſe. Having called upon God in this manner for
about halfe an houre, it was clearely diſcovered to me, that my
adverſaries did privately ſeek my life, and as it were all at once
the meanes and way was ſet before me for my eſcape; queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
not, but that God would in time vindicate me, although
that for the preſent hee gave them libertie to open their
mouthes againſt me; which, indeed, they have done to the
full. But this I know, that when the meaſure of hypocrites
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115701:6"/>
hypocriſie and wickedneſſe is at the full, then is their deſtruction
nigh at hand.</p>
            <p>About three of the clock, next morning, being the ninth of
<hi>November,</hi> I attempted my eſcape, and went away without any
difficultie, or the leaſt diſcoverie; and am now far enough from
the reach of their tyrannie, who thirſted after my life. I am not
ignorant, how mine adverſaries have ſet my Name forth in
Print, to make me odious to the world: A poore Revenge, and
a poore Accuſation, to ſay, That I was in a Whore-houſe when
my Colonel was ſlaine. Truly, if it were a Whore-houſe, it was
more then I knew on, or ever did diſcover, in the time whileſt I
knew the houſe. I ſuppoſe, that thoſe who rayſed that language
on me, were better acquainted with Whores, and ſuch houſes,
then I ever was; or their actings in that houſe, made them ſo to
ſtile the houſe. For my part, I never did any thing in that houſe
but what I did not care if all the world might know; neither
went I ever to that houſe without honeſt companie, and with
Gentlemen ſo civill, whoſe mindes beare a hatred to any ſuch
actions. And as for my being there that night when my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
was ſlaine, you have at large heard the truth, and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of it.</p>
            <p>Truly, I had thought that the <hi>Moderate Intelligencer</hi> had bin
ſo moderate a man, that he would not have ſo much wronged
his Title as now he hath done, by being ſo raſh, as to Print me ſo
odious to the world, before he had knowne the truth. Sirrah, I
ſuppoſe if thou hadſt knowne me, thou wouldſt not have bin ſo
unadviſed: but prethee take notice by the way, that I am a
Gentleman borne and bred, and did in they yeare 1643 receive
Commiſſion from the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> then Lord Generall, as
Captaine of Horſe, and have for the Kingdomes freedome ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
two ſeverall Troupes of Horſe, without any charge or
trouble to the Parliament, or Country: and further take notice,
that I never had any correſpondence with any enemie that ever
oppoſed the Parliament, or Armies: and further take notice,
that I never acted the part of a Coward, but have ſhewed my
ſelfe where thou never didſt, nor durſt; not for any of mine
owne ends in the leaſt, but really to ſerve the Kingdome. And
as for thy Author, I ſhall deſire all the Armie and Kingdome to
take notice. That upon the ſtorming of <hi>Maydſtone</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> when
he ſhould have led on his men to the Gate of the Towne, he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115701:6"/>
puts a Serjeant of mine to lead on the Regiment, and falls back
himſelfe into the Reare, or ſome place that was more ſafe for
him. This Serjeant is a Gentleman, who is ſomewhat allyed to
me by kinne, who like a valiant ſouldier ran on violently to the
Gate of the Towne, and with maine force, with ſome ſmall
helpe, got paſſage cleare for the whole Regiment to follow
him, and beating downe before him all that oppoſed, was the
firſt that got into the Church: and there taking a very good
Horſe, which ſtood readie for him, when he had him in his
poſſeſſion, as a free Prize, this Major <hi>Wylkes</hi> comes in, and by
violence, with the aſſiſtance of ſome that were with him, takes
away the Horſe from the right owner, and hath it at this time,
and moſt commonly rides on him: You may know the Nag by
his colour; it is a Sorrell Cheſtnut-coloured Nag, about fifteene
or ſixteene hands high, his Creſt being very high.</p>
            <p>But to let that paſſe, this Major mindes his Horſe more then
fighting, and that Gentleman, Serjeant <hi>Stevens,</hi> mindes his
fighting, or his buſineſſe, more then his Horſe: He immediately
aſcends the Tower, or Steeple of the Church, where he findes
eight of the enemie; he being all alone, yet ſets on them, and
overcomes them, and brings them all downe priſoners before
him.</p>
            <p>Now by the way pray take notice, that before any part of the
Body ingaged againſt the Towne, I was commanded with a
ſmall partie of Muskettiers to fall on Iome Boats which were
attempting to land againſt the left wing of the Armie; and
when that by the providence we had overcome them, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
many of them priſoners, I ſent this Gentleman, Serjeant
<hi>Stevens,</hi> for further Orders, and to acquaint Colonel <hi>Barkſtead</hi>
of what was done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this Major, as you have heard at large,
imployes him to doe the buſineſſe which he ſhould have done
himſelfe. But 'twas moſt ſtrange to heare, after that the fight
was over, how this Major did attribute this Gentlemans valour
to himſelfe; indeed, 'tis the part of Cowards to brag.</p>
            <p>Well, to proceed: From thence comming to <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> it
was the pleaſure of the Lord Generall, that our Regiment
ſhould make the firſt attempt on the Eaſt ſide of the Towne, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Eaſt ſtreet,</hi> or <hi>Eaſt Bridge,</hi> which was gayned; but I am
ſure, the Taylor was not ſeene till the time of gaining of it, or at
leaſt never ingaged in that buſineſſe: indeed, that truly valiant
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115701:7"/>
and religious Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Shambrooke</hi> ſhewed himſelfe
very gallant in that buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>But about a fortnight after that we were poſſeſt of the <hi>Eaſt
ſtreet,</hi> the enemie made a violent attempt upon our Regiment,
we having two ſeverall Guards upon both ſides of the Bridge,
of about ſixtie men apiece; one of thoſe Guards was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by that worthie Gentleman, Captaine <hi>Walker,</hi> who moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly
fought with the enemie, and made good his Retreat
unto the Body of the Regiment: but the other Guard, being
commanded by one Lieutenant <hi>Tomſon,</hi> then Lieutenant to Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Colonel <hi>Shambrooke,</hi> who was taken aſleepe on his
Guard, and moſt of his men, many of his men being at nine
Holes, and at Cards: by whoſe careleſneſſe all may judge, the
Lieutenant Colonel was then ſlaine; but this Lieutenant was
never queſtioned in the leaſt for his careleſneſſe.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, the enemie advanced; which frightned the
Countrie forces ſo much, that they left a very conſiderable
Guard, called the <hi>Turne-Pike,</hi> and never ſhot one ſhot; which
encouraged the enemie to advance upon our Regiment, it being
then the forlorne Regiment: we being then but five Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
were inforced to ſtand the burnt of the fight; but the Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
Major <hi>Wylkes,</hi> even like a man readie to give up the ghoſt,
and knowing not what to doe, he and many of his confederates,
of his owne Trade, who were Officers in the ſame Regiment,
get them into the hedges, and there couch like the trembling
Hare, whileſt Captaine <hi>Walker,</hi> Captaine <hi>Price,</hi> Captaine <hi>Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins,</hi>
and my ſelfe, drew downe our men into the mouthes of
the enemie, and by the aſſiſtance of a ſmall partie of Horſe,
through Gods mercie, we overcame them, as no queſtion but
you have heard at large before now; but I ſuppoſe you never
heard of our Taylors valour till now, who all the whiles we
and our men were ingaged, lay cloſe in a hedge.</p>
            <p>Well, having now told you of this vallant Gentlemans valour
at two ſeverall fights, as at <hi>Maydſtone</hi> and at <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> I will
now tell you of his courage and moſt deſperate valour at <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The enemie being in the Towne of <hi>Doncaſter,</hi> and comming
with a pretended Letter from the Lieutenant Generall to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Raynsborough,</hi> as they pretended, before that ever the
Colonel was toucht; this Major, by his owne confeſſion, in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115701:7"/>
my hearing, and in the hearing of divers others, ſaid, that he
lockt himſelf up into his chamber, and did not ſtir, untill that
the enemy were all gone out of the town; Pray take notice
further, that this Major lay not far from the Col. quarters, and
hard by the main guard, which if he had done as a ſouldier,
might through Gods aſsiſtance, given ſuch an alarum, as might
have protected our Colonels life.</p>
            <p>He being dead, and ſlain by the enemy, I muſt be acceſſary
to his death, becauſe that the good Gentleman would have it
ſo; and muſt be accuſed to the two Houſes of Parliament, and
the Lord Generall, ſo to be upon his bare word; and ſo put in
print, to the view of the whole world, and my life muſt be
diſpoſed of for I know not what: Tis to be admired how pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
my life was ſought after; but the good God having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
me forth out of their hands, I queſtion not, but that he
will make me to appear clear to all the world, and free from
any ſuch aſperſion as is laid to my charge. And although that
they have cauſed Ballads and Songs to be made of me, and ſung
up and down <hi>London</hi> ſtreets; Yet this I know, that the rod of
the wicked ſhall not alwayes reſt on the back of the righteous;
and though they may drive from <hi>England,</hi> yet they ſhall never
drive me from that God which hath protected me hitherto,
neither will the providence ever the ſooner leave me.</p>
            <p>I could not have beleeved it, but that by experience I feel
and ſee, that thoſe who have as they ſay, fought for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
liberty, had been ſuch private tyrants as now they have
approved themſelves to be.</p>
            <p>Well, to conclude, I ſhall deſire all that reade this booke, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
to weigh my condition, and juſtly to weigh all procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
againſt me in the right ballance. But, is it not a very ſad
thing, that a mans good name ſhall be taken away for a bare
report, or a bare letter written from one that hath a long time
bore me a private grudge, and ſought by all the means poſſible
that he could invent, to have me caſhier'd out of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and now would have nothing but my life, for what
reaſon the Lord knows, I am altogether ignorant I am ſure: as
for being guilty of Col. <hi>Raynsboroughs</hi> death, I am as clear from
it as the childe that is unborn. I ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Moderate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencer,</hi>
and thoſe that have written againſt me, ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
a very good conſcience, to recall what they have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115701:8"/>
againſt me, as in relation of being acceſſary to my Collonels
death, or uſing any whore-houſes.</p>
            <p>What I have written in the defence of my ſelf, or in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching
Major <hi>Wylkes</hi> for being a coward, I ſhall when time
ſerves, produce more witneſſes then will be deſired.</p>
            <p>I have ſpent all my time, ever ſince the beginning of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
wars, in the defence of this Parliament, and have undone
my ſelfe and my friends, for my too much forwardneſſe in this
ſervice. But never did I receive any more then two moneths
pay, as Captain, ſince I firſt received my Commiſſion from
the Lord Generall, Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> And now upon a bare falſe
accuſation, muſt be caſt into priſon, and be condemned to be
ſhot, being never brought to any tryall; And can any mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
man condemn me for making my eſcape? And now as
far as I know, for ſatisfaction for my dear yearnd pay, and
charges that I have been at, for the ſervice of this Kingdom,
muſt for ever be baniſht the Kingdom. But before I will give
up the ghoſt, I ſhall proceed by way of Petition, unto the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of Parliament, and to the Lord Generall; not knowing
but that God may work on their hearts, to clear up this falſe
accuſation, and lay it on the back of the right horſe.</p>
            <p>And further, before I ſhall conclude, I ſhall refer all thoſe
that know me not, to ſome particular worthy Gentlemen of
this Kingdom, who have known my carriage for a long time,
and doe know my birth and breeding. As</p>
            <p>Firſt, Unto my Lord <hi>Roberts,</hi> who is neer of kin unto me.</p>
            <p>Alſo to Maſter <hi>Smith,</hi> one of the Houſe of Commons, and
one of the ſix Clearks, who is alied to me alſo by kin.</p>
            <p>As alſo to Sir <hi>Edward Hungerford,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Piles,</hi> and to
Col. <hi>Ludlow</hi> Eſquire.</p>
            <p>I could nominate many in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and likewiſe
many worthy Gentlemen in the Armie; But theſe are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
