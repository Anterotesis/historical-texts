            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Firſt then they Conceive you may, as well and juſtly Reſign it to your Council, they being equally your Creatures, and then they obſerve the falacie of Leaving thoſe men free, whom you have Cauſed to be bound ere they came there, and with ſuch Chaines as you your ſelfe cannot looſen, no more then a Foraigne <hi>Prince</hi> can Give an <hi>Embaſſador</hi> ſent from hence Authority to Negotiate beyond his <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> and thoſe bonds which you have Laid upon them are concerning the very Eſſence of our Liberty, <hi>viz. the Government by one Perſon, which you were once ſo fully perſwaded of</hi> that you ſaid in your Declaration here, that you did believe that <hi>God</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into a conteſt with <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and would very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly open the eies of the <hi>Nations,</hi> ſo that within few years, there ſhould not be either left in the whole <hi>world.</hi> Ceaſe then, my <hi>Lord,</hi> to <hi>Flatter</hi> your ſelfe any longer with an Opinion that the well affected people of any of theſe Nations will think any better of <hi>your Monarchy</hi> then they now doe, when you ſhall ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly have Laid it down to thoſe men who have no power for any thing, but to reſtore it to you; and who are beſides a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of your own will. A Civill Army Raiſed by your ſelfe to handle the Eſtates of your people, as the other perhaps doe their perſons when they are purged and fitted to the principles of <hi>A Turkiſh Empire,</hi> and poſſibly you had this, this thought when you made this Modle, that becauſe it was probable (and it fell out

ſince) that the <hi>Moſt wiſe and honeſt part of the Gentlemen of England would not ſuffer themſelves to be perſwaded to come into your Council,</hi> nor own your Govenment, therefore you would make the people of that Nation your Lictors, who ſhould ſend you <hi>four hundred men bound hand and foot</hi> to perform your commands, and who ſhould have power to tax, poll, and oppreſſe them, but not the leaſt ſhadow of any to relieve them: And here I cannot choſe but touch at one thing often alledged; and it is, that if you do rightly and duly adminiſter juſtice, the Nation will be happy that you tooke this power, for it matters not who Governs ſo they Govern well, for my part I wholly diſſent from, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt this opinion, and do conceive it to have been invented firſt by ſome Lawyer or other flatterer, meerly to ſatiate their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Apoſtacy, for if it will be granted that there is in the moſt pure and incorrupt part of mankind, a natural inſtinct or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to Liberty in Government (which is for ought I know) the only thing that diſtinguiſhes them from beaſts for that the creature hath no Reaſon, or no Religion, cannot infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be ſaid by us as it can, that they never attempt to rule themſelves by Lawes but ſuffer a Monarchy over them, to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſtrongeſt of themſelves, or in us, without ever attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to aſſert their freedom) then it will likewiſe be confeſt that it is a vile and an unnatural Paſſion in us which makes us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer eſtate, much more a little quiet or eaſe, before that liberty which is ſo eſſential to us, and for this I have the example of all thoſe excellent Perſons and Nations whom their own hazards and adventures in this behalf have ſtyled ſo in the univerſal eſteem of all mankind; indeed if the contrary to this were true, it would follow as Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> holds, that any Perſon who believeth in his conſcience that he could govern better then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do, might, nay is bound to uſe all means to attain to power, and acquire the Government, the conſequence of which will be that if any man will call his Ambition Conſcience, no known Laws, no Conſtitution of Eſtate, no Common Right, <hi>in fine</hi> nothing divine or humane ought to ſtand in this way. I dare go yet farther and affirm that nothing can be more pernitious to

theſe Nations at this preſent, then for you to govern well, for it would Palliate the aſſumed Power, and ſo hide it from the juſt indignation of this age, and prove like the guilding of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous pills, or Painting of Sepulchers, and be a bribing us out of our Rights and Liberties with a ſeeming juſtice, nothing but this can Iull aſleep ſo many Patriots, who have been often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened with Drums and Trumpets, to adventure their lives againſt a Tyrant; neither indeed could any other thing then the juſt and happy Reign of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> have given the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat to the Roman liberty, or made way for thoſe Monſters who ſucceeded. You ſee then my Lord what a buſineſſe you have undertaken, when you have made it the intereſt of honeſt men to wiſh that you may commit all Exceſſes, and uſe more violence, break more Laws and ties, in carrying on this arbitrary Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty then you have done in the aſſuming of it. My Lord, I beſeech your Highneſſe to pardon the length of this Letter, which could not well have been made ſhorter, for that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention thereof is to evince, firſt, that to continue this preſent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment upon us or any thing like it, would be moſt injurious in you, not onely becauſe it is moſt contrary to your own truſt and Oathes but even againſt common right and juſtice, and in the next place that there is no neceſſity of a new erected Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, the nature and Condition of thoſe Nations being ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to a Commonwealth that we are no way fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any other form, but by an outward force and violence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that we have ſpent our blood and fortunes for it, and in the laſt place to ſhew that we are not eaſily deluded into a belief, that either the next aſſembly or any expediencies that ariſe from thence have any right or likelihood to mend our conditions; I ſhall next give your Highneſſe a ſhort account of my ſelf, and then humbly take my leave. I took up Armes with the firſt in the quarrel of the Parliament, not as a mercinary, as not having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my eyes the temptation of my Maſters pay or the ſpoile of their enemies, but purely and ſolely out of a conſcientious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to free my Nation from ſlavery and oppreſſion, and having confirmed my judgement in this, I did examine my zeal and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and believed it had enough of both to hazard my ſelf,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:168388:11"/>
for ſuch a cauſe; in which expectation I thank the Lord, I have not yet found my ſelf deceived; How I have behaved my ſelf ſince I came under your command, it would ſeem vanity for me to relate, if my former and preſent uſage did not make it neceſſary for me to ſay that for my Juſtification, which I ſhould never have ſaid for boaſting; this excuſe makes me bold to lay before you ſome of my ſervices, as wel as my perſonal diſcouragements: your Highneſs may pleaſe to Remember, (here ſome particulars are left out which would detect the perſon who wrote the letter) notwithſtanding all which I am yet ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to go on with my imployment here, and to be faithful in it, as being for the advancement of the Common Cauſe and againſt the Common Enemy, and yet if I were aſſured that you did intend to perpetuate upon us this ſlavery (after you had diſolved the Parliament, for an imputation of endeavoring to perpetuate themſelves) I ſhould have many ſcruples againſt ſerving you in <hi>Scotland,</hi> whither we are very lyable to be tranſported; for what Reaſon is there that we ſhould not give them leaves to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by their Native King, and whom they had received by their Parliament? and at the ſame time ſeeke to impoſe upon them by force another Prince of our Nation, whom we had choſen for them, or rather had choſen himſelf, what can you think my Lord the juſt God, who hath been uſed to deſide upon appeales would do in this quarrel, if they ſhould have recourſe to him with faith and prayer? Alas my Lord you do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how much theſe thoughts do weaken the hands and hearts of thoſe poor righteous and precious ſouls, who are yet left in the Army and who poure forth their tears and prayers daily before the Lord on your behalf, that you may find mercy in this day of your temptation, that ſo they may not be traduced to have ſlain ſo many men as Bravoes to your deſignes, and that you would make uſe of the Great power you are now poſſeſt of to ſettle and tranſmit to ſucceeding ages a ſtate of Laſting free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which a ſmall trouble and force would accompliſh, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this Government muſt be eternally ſupported by violence, no unnaturall things being permanent without it, or if this cannot be, their prayers and deſires are that you would ſummon a free

unlimitted Parliament (conſiſting of ſuch that have not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited their liberties) not bound or fettered by Indentures, and deveſting your ſelfe of all power and Command, you would leave the whole ſway &amp; Government to them, and ſwear the Army to obey them, by this means the Nation would either enjoy their liberty, or have the choice &amp; impoſition of their own yoak; nor is there any Reaſon except you will do one of theſe, upon which you can excuſe the diſmiſſion of the Parliament, for that it was within their power and deſign to make Indentures in the behalf of Liberty, which would have had an unqueſtionable Authority as well as a more Noble end, then thoſe you have compelled for the Contrary; If you ſhall wholly refuſe all things of this kinde, and obſtinately reſolve to goe forward in your way you now take, you will want the hands, hearts and prayers of all Gods people in theſe Nations; and though the principles of ſome of them may not give leave as private men to make you any further oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet they will waſh their own hands, and deliver their own Souls, and beſeech the juſt God of Heaven and earth, who hath appeared ſo viſibly and Miraculouſly for this Cauſe of freedom, and whom no hypocroſie can deceive, no falſe Oathes, nor teares prevaile upon to judge between you and theſe poor oppreſſed and deluded people, but if yet you ſhall Anſwer their hungry expectations of Liberty; you will give Glory to God, increaſe to his Church, flock and Religion, which hath been grievouſly diſhonoured by thoſe actions, Immortall fame to your ſelf, ſafty to your Poſterity, happineſs to mankinde, and will have the lives of many thouſands intirely at your ſervice and Command, and amongſt the reſt that of</p>

               <hi>REader, that this letter ſhould not be expoſed to publique view ſo long after the date thereof, I hope will not poſſeſs thee with any prejudice againſt it the honeſty and reaſon of the tract and faithfulneſſe of the Author to that good old principle of common juſtice, equity and liberty, ſecured in the moſt noble form of government,</hi> viz. <hi>The peoples repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive may commend it to thee, indeed that hath been the Axle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree of the cauſe which God ſo ſignally bleſſed us in, and ſince it was broken (although upon pretence of going faſter on in the obtaining of our liberties) hath blaſted us, wherein that ſaying is verified</hi> Melius in via claudicare quam extra viam currere. <hi>It was the deſign of the old, ſo it is of the new Court, to eſtrange the people from, and work them out of love with Parliaments, many honeſt well meaning men being too much led away with that miſtake. The Author mentioneth his fear of the laſt Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative not of their judgement in, &amp; affection to the publique cauſe of liberty, but by reaſon of that reſtriction in the inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture framed to ſerve the intreſt of the preſent Protector. But indeed the Gentlemen deſerve an honourable eſteem from all Engliſh men, who though they could not do the good deſired by us, and doubtleſſe intended by them, yet would not do us the evil (which a powerful party endeavoured to court and threaten them unto) in perpetuating by any act of theirs our vaſſalage to the preſent Grandees, or revoke thoſe acts which maketh it treaſon for any ſingle perſon to aſſume the ſupream Magiſtracy. I ſhall only adde this as the earneſtly deſire of my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf and of many who are friends to the good old cauſe, that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:168388:12"/>
the Lord would be pleaſed to guide us in the attayning of a free Repreſentative, which may aſſert our liberties, and ſecure them to poſterity, which will be a glorious anſwer to the faith, prayer, expence of blood and treaſure, both of the godly and likewiſe of the reſt of the freeborn people of England who have been faithful to the common cauſe of juſtice and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
