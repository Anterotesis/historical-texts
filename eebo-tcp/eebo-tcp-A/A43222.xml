            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>Paradoxical Assertion 1.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p> 
                        <hi>Concionari tàm Faeminis quàm Viris licitum.</hi> That Women ought to preach as well as Men.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT were a hard Chapter to impose Silence on Women; or to say more plainly, 'twere mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to think they can be Pythagoreans, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <hi>Pythagora's</hi> Soul by his way of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration could creep into, and masculate their Female Bodies. Nay, it might be thought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to Reason also, to suppose that Woman, who are flesh and Blood, as Men are, should be as mute as Fishes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aesops</hi> demure Cat transformed into a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, so soon as a Mouse appeared, forgot her new Nature, and instantly meawed: so let but a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion be started in the Parliament of Women, and 'tis an even lay, they'l all be Speakers. Well then, that they may make use of their Tongues, the most agil and best member they have, and for that very purpose given them, must be by all allowed fit, since they never took <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Oath, nor
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55536:6"/>
indeed could ever any yet oblige them Silence. For if the Tongue be the proper Instrument of Rhetorick to exhort and work upon the Heárts and Ears of any Auditory, why not the Tongue of a Woman, who is the perfection of Mankinde; whose majestick Eyes command Attention, whose smiling attractive looks win and charm the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; whose smooth and stately Foreheads seem to awe men into obedience; whose Lips (which are the doors of Eloquence) breathe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Harmony: and in fine, whose Angelick Faces, speak both Peace, Hope, Joy, and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, even when they themselves are most silent?</p>
                  <p>But you'l object, that though the power of their Rhetorical and Harmonious Countenances is really effective to dehort or animate, disswade or captivate their attentive Auditors, and draw all their eyes and hearts together, as it were, into a purse-net, yet are they scarce fit to meddle in Sacred affairs, or of capacity enough to preach, expound, and set forth the deep mysteries of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity You'l farther object perhaps, that they are ignorant, by reason they have not studied or seen the Academies, nor conversed so much with learned men, whose rational Discourses might have better instructed them.</p>
                  <p>To this I answer, They are of the long Robe also, and spend most of their time in dressing their Heads especially, and that there are few wise Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55536:6"/>
but do converse with men, and that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently; either by traversing Cases of Conscience when that pricks them, or opening the case when full of intricacy, or by displaying the Body of Divinity, in orderly spreading the Limbs, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding each part of the Text, and handling each natural member thereof with as much dexterity and cunning as can be desired. As for Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, who more versed in them then they? For Schooling, School-Points, and moot questions, who more studied in them then they? And as for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, though they commence not from, or amongst the Muses, who are all Female too) yet in all publick places, who minde, study or take them more, or who observe more their degrees of gradual preheminence? Nay, as some of the Disciples vainly questioned amongst themselves, who should be greatest in Heaven? So no doubt but they believe or hope at least, that their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds will marshal and place them according to their Husbands ranks and qualities in the other world also: That they are honourable and worthy of their degrees is undeniable; onely whether they have arrived to a competent degree of Learning, is the Dispute now in question</p>
                  <p>And I pray who need doubt it? their first Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eve</hi> did eat of the Tree of Knowledge, and that same Knowledge hath been as it were <hi>ex<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,</hi> derived from her, attributed to, and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55536:7"/>
in that cunning Sex particularly ever since.</p>
                  <p>Indeed in this learned Age who is ignorant? Where so many Teachers are, who can want knowledge? When Lay-men do preach, why not Lay-women? when blue Aprons can hold forth, why ought not the white Aprons, those gentle flags of Peace and Innocency be set up and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played? Examine their occult qualities, and you will soon acknowledge, that who ever bears the Bell away, yet they will ever carry the Clapper, which speaks for their interiour parts, and ever proclaims them most worthy. Weigh but their deep knowledge in Naturals, their profound ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in Physick and Metaphysicks, and set <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> aside, (who got his wisest knowledge too, as may be presumed, by his frequent converse with that Sex) you shall finde more wit and cunning in some Women, then you shall perceive in most Men. For observe it, besides him, and those few that came out of the East, how few wise men are recorded in the Scriptures? But for wise and holy Women, how many?</p>
                  <p>Again, if Witches (who are generally reputed wise Women) may fill up the number, (though Holy Writ mentions but one famous, that of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>) yet with how many such Sages doth this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and wiser Age swarm, even to amazement? And in holy Story how many Prophetesses were there? I dare say, far exceeding the number of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55536:7"/>
the Prophets, the small ones and all put together.</p>
                  <p>But what need I look so far back? Though <hi>Epiphanius</hi> upbraided <hi>Marcion,</hi> that he suffered Women to baptize; and though he derided the Romanists that they made Women Bishops, yet have we not had Pope <hi>Ioan</hi> of <hi>Mentz</hi> sitting su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream in the Apostolick Chair, poizing the Crosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with as much infallible judgement, uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reason, and with as much gravity and cunning experience as other Spinsters do handle their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staff? The pregnant Church then big with mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, implored the aid and Midwifery of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Bishop; and may she not now again grown big with another Tympany of Heresie, relie on the skill of another <hi>Iuno Lucina?</hi> How diligent were these famous Empresses <hi>Eudoxia</hi> and <hi>Pulcheria</hi> courted and sollicited by the Pope for the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of Easter? How did <hi>Pelagius</hi> strive by his frequent Letters to win the Empress to his side? How considerable were Women then in Church-affairs? And as <hi>Iulia</hi> in publique Coins had the honour to be stiled the Mother of the Army, of the Gods, the Senate, and her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; So why may not the learned Women of this age (if they but live unmarried, without a head, like Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) hope in time again to become heads themselves, and Nursing-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church?</p>

But I shall not need to bring such vain impertinent arguments
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55536:9"/>
into the field to maintain this Problem, since upon very good grounds and reasons I shall evidence that there is, another World, to wit, in the Moon, and shall make that World appear as clear as the Sun it self to any man of Reason and Judgement; that is not Moon-blind, or pertinaciously obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
                  <p>Let not any man therefore conclude me Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick or mad in asserting this Novel, before he hath weighed my Arguments in the equal scales of an unprejudicate understanding.

                  <p>Well may I therefore conclude that great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the World, <hi>Alexander,</hi> most ignorant, (though <hi>Aristotle</hi> was his Tutor) as well as most unhappy and miserable, in wishing there were more Worlds to conquer, who never knew or dreamt of any other World, save this he lived in.</p>
                  <p>And in truth so may I conclude of all other prophane Worldlings, like unto him, who fix and set up their Herculean Pillars here, supposing a

                     <hi>Ne plus ultra</hi> here on earth. For had that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Nimrod</hi> of Kingdoms lived but till now in this Speculative Age, I should not onely have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd him of this Plurality of Worlds; but by Demonstration, and that without the help of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilaeo's</hi> Prospectives, have shew'd him one more in the Moon, besides this, or that other hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Origen</hi> was of opinion, there should be more worlds successively one after another; fearing, saith <hi>Bodin,</hi> God should be idle: or as <hi>Plato</hi> sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests, lest Mankinde being destroyed, God should want Praise and Sacrifice. Ridiculous Conceits! 'Tis a plurality of Worlds at present I contend for.</p>
                  <p>Every Childe can see the Man in the Moon; and shall not Men of riper Judgement and clearer Eye-sight see and conceive more men there, and believe also that it is habitable? Do not those dusky Spots there plainly represented, perfectly resemble the Earth, whilst the white and brighter parts there are the Sea, as <hi>Plutarch, Thales,</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras</hi> affirm? How manifestly doth a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Astrologer discover Hills and Dales there, and the like Promontories and Concavities? If the Sun then be the Centre of the World, the Earth a Planet moved about the Sun, the Planets <hi>inhabited, each having his particular fixt Centre,</hi> and they all dancing in a Celestial Chorus and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony about the Sun: If they be of that infinite

vastness and distance one from another, as that our World to one there should appear but as <hi>Punctum indivisibile,</hi> small in respect: as all our <hi>Copernical</hi> Heaven-Lopers and <hi>Neoterick</hi> Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers affirm, as knowingly, as if they had used <hi>Icaromenipus</hi> his wings in <hi>Lucian,</hi> to have flown thither, and seen what was done in Heaven. Why may there not be then infinite Worlds? Why may not an Infinite Cause (as God is) cause and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Infinite Effects? <hi>Iob</hi> insinuates as much; <hi>Who shaketh the Earth out of her place.</hi> Well may we then admit of <hi>Brunus</hi> infinite Worlds and Suns; of <hi>Keplar's</hi> Lunar Geography; and believe with <hi>Campanella, Galilaeus, Origanus, &amp;c.</hi> that the Earth hath motion, is a Planet, and shines like the Moon, to these Lunar Inhabitants. Is not the World then in the Moon's face, as plain as the Nose in a mans face?—<hi>Credat Iudeas Appella.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides, Is there not a World of Knavery, Bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Simony, Falshood, Deceit? &amp;c And is not man himself another Microcosm, the exact Epitome of the Greater contracted into a lesser form?

What is this but to provoke Nature, stir a Jakes, trouble the Humor, and not to discuss it; or at least make a strong Body weaker, as by often brushing fine Cloth is worn thin; to play with Death, or rather to fight with it; to tempt God, and to tire out our frail bodies with Physick, when Nature alone is the best, safest, and wisest Physician. <hi>A Iove principium.</hi> Prayer and a bunch of Figs, and that but outwardly applied, prolonged <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> life fifteen years.

No matter then whether <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> or <hi>Paracelsus</hi> administer, <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> it is God that gives the increase of Health the Blessing.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Paracelsus</hi> therefore adscribes <hi>Hippocrates</hi> fortunate Cures, not to his Skill so much, as to the peoples strong Conceit of his Worth and Skill: so am I perswaded that many Patients, through the strong Fancy they have of the Doctor, (let the Remedy be never so ordinary) and by Gods help together, recover. The Physicians modesty with the Patients patience work it out sooner, then the desperate practices of Mountebank Quacking Harpies, who to get a Fee will purge the Purse to be sure, and prescribe Death to the next comer; or, like Tinkers, stope one hole, and make two for it.

                  <p>In the cure of an Ague, the very shame of all Physicians, what can <hi>Aesculapius</hi> prescribe better then Exercise and Sweating, which a laboring man cannot avoid?

                  <p>No, Marriage is honorable, and the bed unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed. It is <hi>Ecclesiae seminarium,</hi> and necessary for the propogation of mankinde.

I finde it honored again in the Old, by that stupendious preserving of Eight Married persons in the Deludge, and by Paring the rest of the Creatures then in Couples.</p>
                  <p>And in the New, I finde the whole Trinity Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and Confirming it, by espousing the Church, and resembling his Love and her Espousals, to a Marriage here on earth, by knitting himself to her in that Mutuality with an everlasting union. Since then God himself delighted in propagation, by that sacred Product of the three Persons in the Trinity, thus multiplied though co-eternal. Since we are bound in imitation of, and obedience to

                  <p>I confess indeed when I consider the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Virgins to whom with <hi>Elias, Elizeus,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> Heaven is given; as one said, Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages replenish the earth, but Virginity Paradise; as I am a meer natural man I can finde no reason, why <hi>Adam</hi> should have wooed <hi>Eve,</hi> a small weak piece of himself: for reason rather tells us, the weaker should expect and sue for support from the stronger.</p>

                  <p>Our law therefore in this particular I conceive

too severe, which inhibits a man upon pain of death to set fire to his own house: As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, If my House be ill-favoured, old, rotten, and decayed; and consequently dangerous either to be lived in, or to be pulled down, should I not rather fire it quickly (if it stand alone especially) then endanger any mans life in the demolishment thereof; and build a better, fairer, and more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial one in the room thereof?</p>

                  <p>Besides, Observe but how every Creature natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally desires to get out of his house of Restraint; for our Houses are but as our Inns to lodge, not to dwell in. The Snail as soon as it can creep, leaves its shell: the Chicken as soon as warmth doth hatch it, quits its marble Tenement: and even Man himself is soon weary of the Womb he hath lien a while enclosed in; and when able to walk, delights more in the open Fields then in his Closet.</p>
                  <p>The Turkish Ship-thieves I confess barbarously set fire on the Houses by nights in their populous Cities, that by the light of them they may the better run away with the Goods which were in them. And the Janizaries under the colour of preventing farther mischief, pull down a many more of the neighbouring Cottages, that thereby all may have the better opportunities of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Therefore in <hi>Constantinople, Adrinople, Grand Cairo,</hi> etc. buildings are the sleighter, by reason of the frequency of those fires, made purposely more often, then by chance, though too often fathered on the Persian Spies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nero</hi> indeed (as <hi>Platina</hi> reports) onely because he liked not the structure of <hi>Rome,</hi> set it on fire; or, because he would have the Burning of <hi>Troy</hi> represented unto him, (his cruel fancy work'd so high) for at the same instant (a merry Gentleman no doubt) he was playing on his Harp the Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Troy,</hi> whilst he beheld with delight the woful spectacle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hatto</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> another cruel Firebrand, calling the half-starved people into a Barn in time of a Famine, burnt them altogether therein, with this profane jeast, These are but Rats,</p>

                  <p>good for nothing but to devour Corn.

                  <p>'Tis confess'd, by this Art alone all the rest are made more familiar, and knowledge in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects is acquired at less expence of time and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; because I believe indeed few now a-dayes will give three hundred pounds for three Books of <hi>Philolaus,</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi> did.

                  <p>I Have read of a <hi>Parisian,</hi> that in sixty years stirred not out of the Walls of that famous City, (a Prison large and glorious enough I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess) but when the King had confin'd him within that Circuit during Life, then, and not before, the old man most desired to expatiate, and thereupon with grief dyed: So that it is not the Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the imposed Restraint that makes Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment so irksome. The voluntary seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Anchoret sweetens his Solitude and close Immurement: and it may be onely the forced Servitude and Restraint of more Volatile Spirits that makes their lives seem tedious.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> imprison'd by <hi>Henry</hi> the First his younger Brother, pined
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55536:23"/>
away for grief: And <hi>Francis</hi> the French King ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, was (as <hi>Guicciardine</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports) melancholly even to death, and that in an instant. And <hi>Iugurth</hi> that valiant Commander, after a few dayes Imprisonment at <hi>Rome,</hi> dyed. I grant, that to such high flying souls that have liv'd abroad at the height of jovial Exultation and Sensuality, to be debarr'd on a sudden of their former career of Pleasures, cannot but be irksome, at first especially, perhaps mortal. No doubt but <hi>Valerian, Bajazet,</hi> our <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, felt the smart of such tyrannous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements. You may sooner tame a Lark, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a Swallow, then such high flying Fancies. But to a Stoical temper, to an austere, stay'd, and reserv'd person, Imprisonment is Liberty. Such a man being <hi>nunquam minus solus, quàm cùm solus,</hi> and never more at ease, then when thus confin'd. To a Schollar, that can sit and travel all the world over in a Map, nothing so pleasant as Retirement: his Brains travel in Contemplation though he be fixt in his Cell: he can behold the Chorographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Typographical Delineations of the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test parts and Cities, turn over every stone, and build Castles, &amp;c. and never set foot over his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies threshold.</p>

                  <p>All this I say is nothing to a chearful Heart and Patient. The Ship the rich Merchant sails in, is no less a Prison, then the Captives Gally. Set

aside the Spanish Inquisition, (which tyrannizes over the Soul as well as over the Body) and is therefore more injurious; I see not, I say, that suggested misery in that or any other sort of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, which a wise, humble, and patient spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit cannot overcome and lessen, nay, turn it to his advantage and content.</p>
                  <p>By Imprisonment how many lewd riotous men are brought home? how many Vagrants settled? how many dangers and tentations avoided? it being the onely means to mortifie and master himself, and his greatest enemies, the World, the Flesh and the Devil?</p>
                  <p>Our whole life is but a continued Incarceration. Imprisoned we were in the Womb, and then in our Mothers Arms and Cradles: from thence translated to Schools or Shops under the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous Lashes of severe Masters and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: thence confin'd to a Colledge: or if abroad, we live but in an Island: or if put forth into the world, that is but a larger Prison, as it was to Great <hi>Alexander.</hi> Our soul, that's impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned in a vile Body of sin, and that body (as St. <hi>Pauls</hi> was) is often in misery and durance; in which Bands he delighted as much as in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hersal, and writ most of his Epistles.</p>
                  <p>Since then this life, though but a perpetual slavery and imprisonment, is yet sweet to us all, and more desirable than death, which is our one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55536:25"/>
liberty, and frees us from all the Iron shakels and weighty chains of our Sins; I may safely conclude, That imprisonment is in many respects, to a Christian, better then Death or Liberty.</p>

                        <hi>Monoculus melius, eminus, &amp; plus videt, quàm duos habent Ocellos.</hi> That he that hath but one Eye, sees better, farther, and more, then he that hath two Eyes.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WHether the Sight be, by <hi>intra</hi> or <hi>extramit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendo,</hi> as the Naturalists contend, it matters not: this is certain, That these two Lights were placed above, as Centinels to look about, and afar off to discern any dangers approaching to the Body. And in that notion, we know one Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel is enough in one place at one time; and fittest, lest by discourse, or otherwise roving, they both neglect their Duties. I grant indeed two Eyes in several Heads may see more then one in one Head: and so a Stander by may often see more then a Gamester.</p>
                  <p>All I aim at is, to hit this White. That one Eye sees better then two in one and the same Head. Waken but your Eye of Experience, and tell me, if you see not more perfectly and exquisitely with one eye shut, then with both open? For thus the Spirits Visual contract and unite themselves the more, and so become stronger. For the Eyes, if the sight meet not in one single Cone or Angle,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55536:28"/>
see things double, and not in their true proportion and individual Species as Nature formed them.</p>
                  <p>Besides, Observe but how the Pupil of that Eye, which is open, dilates, when you view your pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract in a Looking-glass, and shut the other. And I am sure all cunning Marks-men do chuse to wink with one Eye, that the other may the surer finde and hit the mark. Nay, when the Body is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depriv'd of sight, the Eyes of the Soul then see best.</p>
                  <p>And though I commend not those Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Divines, that have emasculated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and eradicated their Eyes, whether because our Saviour bid, <hi>If thy right Eye offend thee, plu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>Hannibal</hi> had but one Eye, and yet espied the Advantage to win many famous Battels. <hi>Homer</hi> was stark blinde, and yet what Poet more Eagle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted, or made more lively and accurate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions with both his Eyes? <hi>Democritus</hi> was blinde, and yet (as <hi>Laertius</hi> sayes) he saw more then all Greece besides. As our <hi>Democritus ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior,</hi> though blinde with one Eye, saw more then all Britain. <hi>Tiresias</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Maleasses</hi> and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55536:29"/>
                     <hi>Timoleon</hi> were blinde, <hi>Roscius</hi> squint-eyed, <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, Aesop,</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> purblinde; and yet who had more refined Wits and diviner Spirits?</p>
                  <p>Well then, since the one eyed person may see as clear as the two eyed man, and this is as clear as a Sun beam: I shall hold him another Light up, by which he shall see farther also. See through our Optick or Perspective-glasses, the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of the hand contracted, or through a Level, or when the eye-lids are gathered somewhat close, farther, then when too much light disperses the visual Beams, or weakens them quite, as looking on the Sun will dazle, and by continuance darken. The Night hath its beauty and amiable pleasures. And our New ingenuous Stargazers see through <hi>Galilaeus</hi> his Glass, with but one Eye, more Worlds, (as that in the Moon and other Planets) then all the wise Philosophers of old did, or could, had they <hi>Argus</hi> or <hi>Linces</hi> eyes, &amp; were now living.</p>
                  <p>The Lover, that is Moon-blinde, (if not stark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinde as his <hi>Cupid</hi>) sees a world of beauty in his <hi>Dulcinea</hi>'s face, which her self never saw with both her Eyes in her own false Glass.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude, the <hi>Monoculus</hi> or race of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> that hath but one Eye, and that in his middle Forehead, sees two in another mans head, that can see but one in his. Then clear it is, that he that hath but one Eye, sees better, farther, and more, then he that hath two Eyes.</p>

                  <p>When <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> fought with the <hi>Spartans,</hi> and was most opposed with that Sex, how shamefully was he beaten back, being forced to retreat with his son <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and the strongest part of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my?

                  <p>It is Revenge that thus steels their Valor.

                  <p>If then, I say, it be such an apparent injury there, what shall an enclosure, a constant Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with one be accounted in all the Reformed Churches, where all Fornication is wholly and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely forbid and punished?

                  <p>THough there is a Statute for all men to dye; and none was yet translated to Heaven (for I doubt whether <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> are bodily there as yet) but through <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Valley of dead and dry Bones: And for that cause <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list</hi> was falsly suggested not to dye, upon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Hypothesis, <hi>VVhat if he tarry till I come?</hi> Though <hi>Moses</hi> his Burying-place was concealed, least perhaps the Idolatrous Israelites should have adored his Shrine, or for other reasons best known to God himself: yet that there are more Christned, then Dead or Buried now adayes in <hi>England,</hi> is <hi>Billa vera,</hi> and as sure as Death it self.</p>
                  <p>Is it then because the Font being at the Church entrance, and therefore more perspicuous, and that we take notice of those that enter the stage at first with more attention alwayes, then him that speaks the Epilogue?

                  <p>For this Island is naturally wholesome, and since so many are translated hence to Forreign Plantations; since some kill themselves, and are denied Christian Burial; since many others dye in the Wars, on the Seas, or Gallows, and are numbred with the Dead indeed, but their number not particularly known: It is no wonder the Church-yards swell no more with Grave-stones, and that by these violent and unknown wayes and means, the Christnings should exceed the Burials in every Parish.</p>

                  <p>Or are they not like our Organ-pipes, which never sound full and loud, till soundly filled; and then, like them, no sooner full, but roaring?

loudly; that, thus amidst the high Jollities of those Bacchanals, they may the better be heard of that Deity they then invoke.

Besides, though the Younger be less able to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and for that cause in many places, by Custome, are first and best provided for: yet since our Common Law gives all the Reall Estates to the Eldest, she (who is the pattern to

                  <p>Some may ascribe this sterility of the Brain in the First-born, to the over early Copulation and Pregnancy in this fruitful Island, where we tread almost as soon as out o'th' shell, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the most part as soon as they do in the hottest Conntreys.

Thus while the Syrian Star in the Canicular dayes reigns (at <hi>Rome</hi> especially) they say Dogs and French-men have their Deliriums and are ever actively turning or walking, though at Noon the hottest time of the day.</p>
                  <p>Or is it because they are Round-headed, and so being of an Oval and vertiginous disposition, are never quiet, but turning round from one Maze to another Labyrinth? As these giddy turn-coats do through all the wield and blinde Maeanders of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Church Government? Or are they Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical, and have found out the perpetual moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely?
