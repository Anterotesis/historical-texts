            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>Rom. x. 2.</bibl>
               <q>For I bear them record that they have a zeal
of God, but not according to knowledge.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THese are St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, and he spoke
them of the <hi>Jews,</hi> those unbelieving
<hi>Jews</hi> that were so tenacious of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of their Fathers, and so utterly averse
to any Reformation of Religion: That tho' it
appear'd by undeniable evidence that Christ
Jesus was by God sent into the World for that
purpose, yet, did they to the last stand out in
their opposition of him and his Gospel, even
to the final rejection of their Nation.</p>
            <p>To these People doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
express a great compassion, heartily wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and praying for their Conversion. <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>
(saith he in the first verse) <hi>my hearty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and prayer to God for Israel is, that they may
be saved.</hi> That is, that they may come to the
knowledge of the Truth in Christ Jesus, and
by that means obtain everlasting Salvation.
And one reason why he was thus concerned
for them, he gives in the words following,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94577:3"/>
which are the words I have read unto you.
<hi>For I bear them record</hi> (saith he) <hi>that they have
a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.</hi> It
was a great motive to him to be concern'd
for their happiness, that they were zealous, for
<hi>Religion;</hi> tho' he knew at the same time, that
the Religion they were then so zealous of, was
not the right Religion; nor did the zeal they
shewed for it, proceed from right Principles.</p>
            <p>According to the account I have now given
of this Passage, Three things we may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of from it, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>I. The Apostles approving and tacitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
that <hi>Zeal</hi> which his Countreymen
expressed for Religion.</item>
               <item>II. His meek and charitable behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, even when their <hi>Zeal</hi> for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
was very faulty and blameable.</item>
               <item>III. His discovery of the faultiness of their
<hi>Zeal,</hi> which lay in this, <hi>that it was not according
to knowledge.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>These <hi>Three</hi> things I shall take for the Heads
of my following discourse upon this Text, and
shall afterwards make such Application of it,
as the Business of this Day calls for.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>First,</hi> I desire it may be observed, That
<hi>Zeal of God</hi> in general, that is, a hearty and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94577:3"/>
passionate concernment for Religion, <hi>The Apostle
here finds no fault with:</hi> On the contrary, he
approves it as a commendable thing. For you
see he represents it, as a piece of <hi>virtue</hi> in his
Country-men, and speaks it to their commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
that they had a <hi>zeal of God. I bear them
record</hi> (saith he) <hi>that they have a zeal of God.</hi>
As much as to say, that he owned, they had
that good quality, and they were to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for it; and for that reason he both
wisheth them well, and affectionately prayeth
for them.</p>
            <p>That which I would from hence take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to put you in mind of is this: That <hi>Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi>
and <hi>Vnconcernedness</hi> for <hi>Religion</hi> is not to
have a place among any ones virtues and good
qualities; it is rather a very great fault; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it may some times pass for an instance of
Wisdom and Prudence.</p>
            <p>If indeed Men had no <hi>Passions,</hi> or had so mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
their Passions, that they were rarely earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
or zealous about any thing; their uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedness
for Religion and the things of God
might be the less reproveable. But when <hi>Zeal</hi>
and <hi>Passion</hi> is more or less wrought into every
Man's temper, and the calmest Men may be
observed on sundry occasions not to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it; it is an inexcusable fault to have no
<hi>passion,</hi> no <hi>zeal</hi> for God and his Cause.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:94577:4"/>
How can a Man answer it to his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
to be heartily angry when an affront
in word or deed is done to himself; and yet to
be altogether insensible, when God is affronted
in his Presence? To make a mighty bustle, when
his own <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> is at stake, though in
never so small a matter; and yet to shew no
concernment for the <hi>Rights</hi> and the <hi>Honour</hi> of
that God who made him, and by whose favour
alone it is that he can call any thing his own
that he hath.</p>
            <p>O! What a world of Good might we all do,
if we had a true <hi>zeal of God.</hi> How many Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
and Opportunities are there put into
our hands every day (in what condition or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
soever we are) which if we were
acted by this principle, would render us great
Benefactors to Mankind, by discouraging Vice
and Impiety, and promoting Virtue and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the World.</p>
            <p>But perhaps I have set this business of <hi>Zeal
for God</hi> too high: because none are capable of
being thus <hi>Zealous,</hi> but those that have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a great degree of Virtue and Piety, which
we cannot suppose of all, nor the most. But
however, it will be a shame to all of us, if we
do not come up to that pitch of <hi>Zeal</hi> which
the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> are here commended for.
<hi>I bear them record,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, that they have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94577:4"/>
a zeal of God.</hi> What was this <hi>Zeal</hi> of theirs?
why, as I told you, (and as it plainly appears
from the whole Chapter) it was an earnest and
passionate concernment for the <hi>Religion</hi> of
their Country. Sure all Men among us both
good and bad may come up to this degree of
<hi>Zeal</hi> for <hi>God,</hi> and it is a reproach to us <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f we
do not. Especially considering that their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
at that time, was not <hi>God</hi>'s Religion,
but Ours is.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Publick profession of Religion in
the right way, is as much every Man's <hi>Interest,</hi>
and ought to be as much every Man's <hi>Care,</hi>
as any the dearest thing he hath in this
World. Nay to all Men that believe they
have Souls to save, it is more valuable than
any other Worldly privilege. It concerns us
all therefore to be Zealous in that matter.
The Duty we owe to <hi>God,</hi> to our <hi>Countrey,</hi> and
to <hi>our Selves,</hi> doth require it. In vain it is
to be busie about other things, and to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
this. A Man will have but small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
when he comes to die, to reflect that he
has been <hi>Zealous</hi> of the <hi>Privileges</hi> and <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and <hi>Rights</hi> of his Countrey-men; but it
was indifferent to him, how the <hi>Service</hi> of
<hi>God</hi> and the affairs of <hi>Religion</hi> were mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:94577:5"/>
II. The Second thing we observe from
this Passage, is, <hi>The Apostle's carriage to the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
Israelites, who though they were zealous
for God, yet were in a great mistake as to their
notions of the true Religion.</hi> He doth not bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
censure them. He is not fierce nor furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
against them. He doth not excite any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to use force or violence to them. But he
rather pities them. He makes their <hi>Zeal</hi> that
they had <hi>of God,</hi> an Inducement the more
heartily to pray for them, that God would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them in the right way that leads to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Tho' he is far from approving their
blind Zeal, in so obstinately opposing <hi>the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of God,</hi> that is, that method which God
had prescribed, for the attaining of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
by the faith of Jesus Christ; and <hi>setting up
a Righteousness of their own,</hi> which consisted
chiefly in observing the <hi>Ceremonials</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi>
his Law and the <hi>Traditions</hi> of their <hi>Fathers,</hi> as
it follows in the next Verse after my Text:
Yet he thinks them the more pitiable and the
more excusable, in that this their Opposition
proceeded from their <hi>Zeal of God,</hi> tho' it was
a mis-informed irregular Zeal.</p>
            <p>This practice and carriage of the Apostle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
these <hi>Ignorant Zealots,</hi> ought to be a rule
for us to walk by in the like Cases. If Men
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94577:5"/>
be of a different <hi>way</hi> from us, as to <hi>Religion;</hi>
if they hold other <hi>Opinions,</hi> or though they
be of another <hi>Communion</hi> from us: and though
too we are sure they are mistaken: nay and
dangerously mistaken too; yet, if they have
a <hi>Zeal of God,</hi> if they be serious and sincere in
their way; if their errours in Religion be the
pure results of a mis-informed Conscience: Let
us, as the Apostle here did, take occasion from
hence to pity them, and to put up hearty pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to God for them; and to endeavour all we
can, by gentle methods, to reduce them to the
right way: But by no means to express con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
or hatred of them, or to treat them with
violence and outrage. So far as their <hi>Zeal</hi> is
for <hi>God,</hi> let us so far shew tenderness and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
to them; and if their <hi>Zeal</hi> be in such
instances, as are really commendable, let us in
such instances not onely bear with them, but
propose them for our examples. This, I say,
was the Apostle's practice, and I think it is so
agreeable to the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> of our great
Lord and Master <hi>Christ,</hi> that it will become
us in like cases to act accordingly.</p>
            <p>But then after I have said this, These <hi>two</hi>
things are always to be remembred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That our Tenderness to mistaken <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots,</hi>
must always be so managed, as that the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94577:6"/>
true <hi>Religion,</hi> or the <hi>Publick peace</hi> suffer no da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
thereby. And therefore how kindly and
compassionately soever, we, as private Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
are to treat those that differ from us, and
pursue a wrong way out of Conscience: Yet
this doth not hinder, but that both wholsome
<hi>Laws</hi> may be made for the restraining the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitances
of mistaken <hi>Zeal;</hi> and when those
<hi>Laws</hi> are made, that they may be put in execution.</p>
            <p>The consideration of <hi>Law-givers</hi> and <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,</hi>
is different from that of <hi>private</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
Their business is to see that <hi>Nequid detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti
respublica capiat,</hi> to see that the <hi>Government</hi>
be secured; that the common <hi>peace</hi> be kept, that
the <hi>Laws</hi> of God be observ'd, that God's <hi>Religion</hi>
as it is delivered by <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> be preserved
sincere and undefiled, and that the solemn <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
of God be <hi>purely</hi> and <hi>decently</hi> performed.
And therefore there is no doubt, but that in all
these matters the Government may make Fences
and Securities against the Insults of intemperate
<hi>Zealots,</hi> and when these Fences are made, it should
be at their Peril if they transgressed them, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
Magistrates did their duty. And all this
we say is very consistent with that tenderness
and charity that all Christians, and even Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
themselves in their private Capacity, do
owe to misperswaded erroneous Consciences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:94577:6"/>
And then <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is to be remembred
that that Kindness and Tenderness to mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Zealots, which we are speaking of from the
Text, is not to be expressed to all alike; but
to some more, to some less, to some perhaps
in no degree at all; according as the nature
and quality of their Errors are, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the Men that are guilty of them, may
more, or less, or not at all, be thought to have
a real <hi>Zeal of God,</hi> and to act out of principles
of Conscience. Thus for instance,</p>
            <p>In the First place, Those that set up for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
of <hi>Atheism</hi> or <hi>Epicurism;</hi> that make it
their business in their Conversation to expose
<hi>all</hi> Religion, and to bring it into contempt;
that ridicule the Professors of it as a company
of easie credulous Men; that make no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of blaspheming God and all things Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
as occasion is given them: Why, these
Men may have <hi>Zeal</hi> enough for their Opinions,
and we find that they often have a great deal
too much; But are such to be treated with
that sort of Tenderness and Compassion that
we are now speaking of? No, by no means;
For they are quite out of the bounds of my
Text, They <hi>have a Zeal</hi> indeed, but it is not
a <hi>Zeal</hi> for <hi>God,</hi> but for the <hi>Devil</hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
of his Kingdom. And if one were to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94577:7"/>
measure the greatness of Crimes by the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
they do to humane Society; I should
think that this sort of People were not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
so much favour and respect from man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
as some other Malefactors that yet by
our Laws are to pay for their offences at no
less a rate than their Lives.</p>
            <p>Again, Secondly, If there be any Men that
under a pretence of <hi>Religion</hi> do teach or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
or promote any sort of <hi>Vice</hi> or <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality;</hi>
or whose Principles do necessarily
lead to debauch Mens manners in the plain
matters of <hi>Sobriety, Chastity, Truth</hi> or <hi>Justice,</hi>
or the like; such kind of People are by no
means Objects of that Tenderness and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
that we are now speaking of: For the
Laws of Nature as to moral <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi>
are so plainly writ in every Mans heart, that
he must be supposed to be an <hi>Ill</hi> Man that can
easily entertain any Principle (let it come ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so much recommended under the name of
Religion) that contradicts them. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
allowance may in charity be made for a
Man's <hi>mistakes,</hi> there is no reason that much
should be made for his <hi>Wickedness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again Thirdly, If there be any Men that
whilest they express a great Zeal for the <hi>Purity</hi>
of Religion, and exclaim against the <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:94577:7"/>
of it (as they term them) which are
introduced into the Publick Establishment, and
turn every stone to have all things setled in
another method; yet all this while God and
their own Hearts know that all this concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and <hi>Zeal</hi> of theirs for <hi>Religion,</hi> tho' it
make a great shew, is only pretended; and that
there is another thing that lies at the bottom,
that is to say Worldly <hi>Interest,</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi>
and <hi>Power,</hi> which they hope to compass by
such a Regulation of Matters as they desire:
I say, if there be any such Men, they are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
no way concerned in that compassion my
Text speaks of. For tho' they may be very
<hi>Zealous,</hi> yet it is a <hi>Zeal</hi> for their own secular
<hi>advantages</hi> that acts them, and not a <hi>Zeal of
God.</hi> If such Men could be known; instead
of being kindly and charitably thought of for
their Zeal in Religion; the Virtuous part of
mankind would look upon them as the worst
of Hypocrites. But since God only knows the
Hearts of Men; all such pretenders to <hi>Zeal</hi>
for <hi>Religion,</hi> must, till we know them also, be
treated according to the merits of the cause
they pretend to be zealous for.</p>
            <p>But then Fourthly and Lastly, All that I
have now said is with respect to those that are
out of the limits of my Text, such as have no
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94577:8"/>
               <hi>Zeal of God,</hi> tho' some of them may pretend
it: But then as for those that really act out
of Principles of Conscience, and have a real
<hi>Zeal of God,</hi> tho' in a wrong way; These are
true Objects of our Tenderness and Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
tho' yet in different degrees. For accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as their <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> do more
or less injure our common <hi>Christianity,</hi> or are
more or less dangerous to our <hi>Government</hi>
and <hi>Constitution;</hi> in the same proportion,
the greater or less Tenderness and Indulgence
is to be expressed towards them. But most
of what concerns this matter being already
setled by Law, I will not be so bold as to
meddle in it, and therefore I proceed to the
Third Head of my Discourse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III. The Third thing I told you we might
observe from this Text was this,</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle's
tacit Reprehension of the Iewish Zeal
upon this account, that it was not according to
Knowledge,</p>
            <p>The Use I make of this is, that from hence
we may be able to gather to our selves a true
rule for the governing our <hi>Zeal</hi> in matters of
Religion, and likewise for the judging in
others, what <hi>Zeal</hi> is commendable, and what
is not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:94577:8"/>
For be our <hi>Zeal of God</hi> never so great, yet if it be
not a <hi>Zeal according to knowledge,</hi> it is not the right
Christian <hi>Zeal.</hi> And though we see others never
so fervent and vehement in pursuing a Religious
Cause, and that too, out of Conscience; yet if this
<hi>Zeal</hi> of theirs be not <hi>according to knowledge,</hi> it is a
Zeal that justly deserves to be reproved. And
though both we and they may for our sincerity in
God's Cause, expect some Allowances, both from
God and Man, yet neither they nor we can justify
it, either to God or Man, that we are thus fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly
and ignorantly Zealous.</p>
            <p>I wish this mark of right <hi>Zeal,</hi> that it ought to
be <hi>according to knowledge,</hi> were more considered. For
it seems not often to be thought on by those that
are most <hi>zealous</hi> in their way, of what perswasion
soever they be. This same business of <hi>Knowledge,</hi>
is a thing that is most commonly forgot to be taken
in as an ingredient or Companion of <hi>Zeal,</hi> in most
sort of Professors. For as the World goes, those
Men are generally found to be the greatest <hi>Zealots,</hi>
who are most notoriously <hi>Ignorant.</hi> Whereas true
Zeal should not only proceed from true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but should also be always accompanied
with it, and governed by it.</p>
            <p>But what is it to <hi>have a Zeal according to Knowledge?</hi>
What doth this Character of justifiable right Zeal
contain in it? I answer, it must at least contain in
it these <hi>five</hi> following things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:94577:9"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> To <hi>have a Zeal according to Knowledge,</hi> doth
import, that we be not mistaken, as to the <hi>matter</hi>
of our <hi>Zeal;</hi> that it be a <hi>good Cause,</hi> that we are
<hi>zealous</hi> about. And since it is <hi>Zeal for God</hi> that we
are here speaking of, it must be something where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
our <hi>duty</hi> is concerned, that must be the object of
our <hi>Zeal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that a right <hi>Zeal of God</hi> implies, that we do
so well inform our selves of the nature of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
as not to pretend a Religious Zeal for any
thing that is not a part of our Religion. If our <hi>Zeal
for God</hi> be as it should be, it must certainly express
it self in matters that are <hi>good;</hi> about such objects
as God hath made to be our <hi>duty. It is good</hi> (saith
St. <hi>Paul) to be always zealously affected in a good matter.</hi>
But if we mistake in our <hi>Cause,</hi> if we take that for
<hi>good</hi> which is <hi>evil,</hi> or that for <hi>evil</hi> which is <hi>good,</hi> here
our Zeal is not <hi>according to Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As the <hi>object</hi> of our <hi>Zeal</hi> must be <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Knowledge,</hi> so also the <hi>Principle</hi> from whence
our <hi>Zeal</hi> proceeds, must be <hi>according to knowledge</hi>
also. That is to say, We must have solid and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
grounds to proceed upon in our concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for any thing; such as will not only satisfy
our selves, but all others that are unbyassed: In a
word, such as we can justify to all the World.</p>
            <p>If it be every Mans Duty (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us it
is) <hi>to be ready to give an answer to every one that asketh
him a reason of the hope that is in him:</hi> Then I am sure,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94577:9"/>
it is much more every Mans Duty, to be able to
give a reason of the <hi>Zeal</hi> that is in him. Because this
business of a Mans <hi>Zeal</hi> doth more affect the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and is of greater Concernment to it, than
what a Mans private <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Hope</hi> is.</p>
            <p>But yet how little is this considered by many
<hi>zealous</hi> Men among us. Some are <hi>zealous</hi> for a
point to serve an <hi>Interest</hi> or a <hi>Faction.</hi> But this is
not to be owned as the ground and reason of their
<hi>Zeal;</hi> for indeed if it should, it would not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of. Others are <hi>zealous</hi> for no other reason
but because they find their <hi>Teachers,</hi> or those they
most converse with, are so. They follow the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Cry,</hi> and examine no more of the matter.
Others indeed have a Principle of <hi>Zeal</hi> beyond all
this. For they are <hi>moved</hi> from within, to stand up for
this or the other Cause; they have <hi>Impulses</hi> upon
their Minds which they cannot resist: But that in
truth is no more a justifiable ground of any Mans
<hi>Zeal,</hi> than either of the former. For if these <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
and <hi>Impulses</hi> that they speak of be from God;
there will certainly be conveyed along with them,
such <hi>Reasons</hi> and <hi>Arguments</hi> for the thing that they
are to be <hi>zealous</hi> about, as will, if they be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
satisfy and convince all other reasonable Men,
as well as themselves. For it is a ridiculous thing to
imagine, that God at this day doth <hi>move</hi> or <hi>impel</hi>
Men in any other way than what is agreeable to
the Reason of Mankind, and the Rule of his holy
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94577:10"/>
Word. And if the Mans <hi>Zeal</hi> can be justified by
either of these, there is no need of vouching <hi>Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi>
for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As the Zeal which is according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
hath a good <hi>matter</hi> for its <hi>object,</hi> and proceeds
from a right <hi>Principle:</hi> So it is also <hi>regular</hi> as to the
<hi>Measures</hi> of it. He that hath it is careful that it do
not exceed its due Bounds, as the <hi>Ignorant Zeal</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
doth; but he distinguisheth between the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
objects he is <hi>zealous</hi> for, and allows every one
of them, just so great a Concernment as the thing
is worth, and no more. If the thing be but a <hi>small
matter,</hi> he is but in a <hi>small measure</hi> concerned for it.
If it be of greater moment, he believes he may be
allowed to be the more earnest about it. But he
looks upon it as a rash and foolish thing, and an
effect of great ignorance or weakness, to be hot
and eager for all things alike. We should account
him not many degrees removed from a <hi>Child</hi> or an
<hi>Ideot,</hi> that upon the cut of a Finger should as pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately
complain and cry out for help, as if he
had broken a Limb. Why just the same Folly and
Childishness it is, to make a mighty bustle about
small matters which are of no consequence, in
which neither <hi>Religion,</hi> nor the publick <hi>Peace,</hi> are
much concerned; as if indeed our Lives and Souls
were in danger. It therefore becomes all prudent
and sober Men to take care, that their <hi>Zeal</hi> do not
spend it self in <hi>little</hi> things; that they be not too
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94577:10"/>
passionate and earnest, and vehement for things
that are not worth much contending for. If we lay
a greater weight upon a Cause than it will bear,
and shew as much warmth and passion for small
matters, as if the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi> were at
stake, we are <hi>zealous</hi> indeed, but not <hi>according to
Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Zeal</hi> that is <hi>according to knowledge,</hi>
is always attended with hearty <hi>Charity.</hi> It is not
that <hi>bitter Zeal</hi> which the Apostle speaks of, which is
accompanied with <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> and <hi>perverse
Disputings:</hi> But it is kind, and sociable, and meek,
even to Gainsayers. It is that <hi>Wisdom which is from
above, that is first pure, then peaceable, gentle and easy
to be intreated.</hi> It is a Zeal that loves <hi>God</hi> and his
<hi>Truth</hi> heartily, and would do all that is possible to
bring honour and advancement to them: But at
the same time it loveth all <hi>Men.</hi> And therefore in
all things where it expresses it self, it purely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
the <hi>Merits</hi> of the <hi>Cause</hi> before it, but lets the
<hi>Persons</hi> of Men alone. It is a certain Argument of
an <hi>Ignorant</hi> and ungovern'd <hi>Zeal,</hi> when a Man leaves
his Cause and his concernment for Gods Glory, and
turns his Heat upon those that he has to deal with,
when he is peevish and angry with Men that differ
from him: When he is not contented to oppose
Arguments to Arguments, and to endeavour to
gain his point by calm Reasoning; but he flies out
into Rage and Fury; and when he is once trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94577:11"/>
herewith, he cares not what undecent bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Reflections he makes upon all those that have
the Fortune to be of a different side. But in these
Cases Men would do well to remember, that the
<hi>Wrath of Man worketh not the Righteousness of God,</hi> as
the Apostle expresseth it. All this kind of behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
savours of the Wisdom of this World, which is
<hi>earthly, and sensual, and devilish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> and lastly, Another inseparable Property
of <hi>Zeal according to Knowledge</hi> is, That it must pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
lawful <hi>ends</hi> by lawful <hi>means;</hi> must never do an
<hi>ill</hi> thing for the carrying the <hi>best Cause.</hi> This St. <hi>Paul</hi>
hath laid down, as a Rule, to be eternally obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
among Christians, when in the <hi>third</hi> of the
<hi>Romans,</hi> he declares, that <hi>their damnation is just, who
say, Let us do evil that good may come.</hi> Be therefore
our Point never so good, or never so weighty, yet
if we use any dishonest, unlawful Arts, for the
gaining of it; that is to say, If we do any thing
which is either in it self evil, and appears to be so
by the natural Notices of Mankind, or which the
Laws of our holy Religion do forbid: I say in all
such Instances we are Transgressors. And though
our <hi>Cause</hi> be very good, and our <hi>Ends</hi> very allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
yet since the <hi>means</hi> by which we would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
those <hi>ends</hi> are unwarrantable, the whole
<hi>Action,</hi> though proceeding from never so much
<hi>Zeal for God,</hi> is very <hi>Bad.</hi> For true <hi>Zeal,</hi> as it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
supposeth a right Information of Judgment,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94577:11"/>
as to the matter of it, so likewise it supposeth, that
a Man should act in honest ways, and endeavour
to attain his ends by lawful means.</p>
            <p>And thus have I laid before you the Properties
and Characters of that <hi>Zeal,</hi> which is <hi>according to
knowledge,</hi> which was the third and last thing which
I proposed upon this Text; And I pray God we
may always remember them whenever we have
occasion to express a Zeal, for any thing, especially
in matters of Religion. All that remains now, is
to make some brief application of my Text, with
reference to the business of the day.</p>
            <p>These words, as I told you, were spoke of the
Jews. But the Character here given of them doth
so well fit a sort of Men, whose fiery <hi>Zeal</hi> for <hi>God</hi>
and their <hi>Religion,</hi> gave occasion to the Solemnity
of this Day; that it looks as if it were made for
them. It is the <hi>Bigots</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that
I mean; to whom we must do the same right
that St. <hi>Paul</hi> here did his Country-men, We must
<hi>bear them Record, that they have a Zeal of God, but not
according to Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zealous</hi> they are sufficiently, as the Jews were,
no body doubts of it. But as for their <hi>Zeals being
according to Knowledge,</hi> there is great reason to doubt,
they are as faulty in that point, as St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen
were. Indeed if you were to draw the
comparison between the <hi>Jewish</hi> and the Popish <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:94577:12"/>
as to all the several particulars that our <hi>Saviour</hi>
and St. <hi>Paul</hi> take notice of as Instances of <hi>blind Zeal</hi>
in the former: You would find in all those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
both their <hi>Zeals</hi> to be much of a piece, not only
as to the <hi>Fervour,</hi> but as to the <hi>Blindness</hi> of
them.</p>
            <p>Was it an instance of <hi>Ignorant Zeal</hi> in the <hi>Jews</hi>
that they set up their <hi>Traditions</hi> to the disparagement
of the <hi>Law of God?</hi> I pray, who are those that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage
the holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> by setting their <hi>Traditions</hi>
upon an equal foot with them?</p>
            <p>Were the Jews to be blamed for that they were
so zealous for their old Religion, as to oppose that
<hi>Reformation</hi> of it, which our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> endeavoured
to introduce among them, because they thought it
was an <hi>Innovation.</hi> I pray who are those, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that very ground oppose all <hi>Reformation</hi> at this
Day, though yet the wisest and best Men among
themselves are sufficiently sensible, that there are
great Corruptions, both in their <hi>Doctrine</hi> and
<hi>Worship?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was it a fault in the Jewish Zeal that it placed
Religion too much in <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Formalities,</hi> in
<hi>washing Cups and Platters, in tithing Mint and Cummin,</hi>
and the like to the neglect of the weightier matters of
the Law, <hi>Justice, and Mercy, and Faith?</hi> I pray where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is <hi>Image-worship, Invocation of Saints, Penances, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages,</hi>
the use of <hi>Reliques, Holy Water,</hi> &amp;c. I say
wherein are these things better than those? And
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94577:12"/>
yet we know who they are that lay so great a stress
upon these and such other things, that it may be
truly said, a great part of their Religion is made up
of them.</p>
            <p>It would not be difficult to run the parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Zeals</hi> of the two <hi>Religions,</hi> through seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
more Instances; But it is an unpleasant Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and therefore I will pursue it no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Only one instance more of the Jewish <hi>Zeal</hi> I
must not pass by, because it comes up so fully to
the business of this Day.</p>
            <p>So <hi>zealous</hi> were they for their <hi>Religion,</hi> that they
did not care what sort of means they made use of
for the promoting of it, were they never so wicked
and unnatural. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> they <hi>hunted</hi> to Death
with <hi>false Witnesses; Stephen</hi> they stoned out of <hi>pure
zeal</hi> in a popular tumult. <hi>Forty</hi> of them solemnly
bound themselves under a <hi>Curse,</hi> that they would
neither eat nor drink till they had killed St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
But all this, and a great deal more our Saviour had
foretold they would do, when he told his Apostles,
that <hi>the time would come, when whosoever killed them
should think that he did God good service.</hi> A Blessed
way of doing God service is this, to act such wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
inhumane things as these! But such inhumane
things as these doth a <hi>Blind Zeal</hi> for Religion some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
put Men upon. And that it doth so, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have a greater proof (except what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94577:13"/>
mentioned) than the practices of the zealous
Men of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How many unlawful Arts have they used to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
all the Christian World to their Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster?
How many <hi>Forgeries</hi> for this purpose have
they been the Authors of, and maintain'd them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards?
How many disturbances have they gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Peace of <hi>Christendom,</hi> in the most unjust
and unnatural ways, for the advancement of the
<hi>Papal</hi> Cause? It was <hi>Zeal</hi> for Gods Service and the
Interest of holy Church, that so many Princes have
been Excommunicated and Deposed; that so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Tumults and Rebellions have been raised; that
so many <hi>Crusados,</hi> for the extirpating <hi>Hereticks,</hi> have
been sent out. By which, and such like means, it
may justly be computed, that as much <hi>Christian</hi>
Blood has been shed for the establishing <hi>Popery,</hi> as
it now stands, nay, and a great deal more, than
ever was during all the times of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
for the supporting of <hi>Paganism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if there were no other instance extant in the
World to shew what is to be expected from a
<hi>blind Zeal,</hi> especially a <hi>blind Popish Zeal</hi> for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that instance which the deliverance of this Day
doth give us occasion to mention, would be alone
sufficient to inform us. When for no other end,
but for the advancement of <hi>Popery,</hi> and the rooting
out that Pestilent <hi>Heresy</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> which
infested these Northern Climates, a Company of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94577:13"/>
Popish <hi>Zealots</hi> enter'd upon the most barbarous
and inhumane Project that ever was undertaken by
Men; even neither better nor worse, than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Parliament</hi> at one blow;
and had put all things in such a readiness in order
thereunto, that they certainly had effected it, as on
this day, had not their Conspiracy been detected
in a wonderful manner.</p>
            <p>But thanks be to God, their designs then, and
ever since, have been defeated, and some of them
even miraculously; and we trust in the Mercies of
God that they will ever be so.</p>
            <p>God hath been wonderfully Gracious to us, in
the preservation of our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> from <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish</hi>
attempts to destroy it, ever since it was setled
among us.</p>
            <p>How many Plots and Conspiracies were laid in
the time of the glorious Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to put an end
to her Life, and with it, to our reformed Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment?</p>
            <p>What a dreadful one was this of the <hi>Gunpowder
Treason,</hi> in the reign of her Successor?</p>
            <p>How many dangers have threatned us since that
time, from that quarter?</p>
            <p>What a horrible storm but of late did we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
and justly enough too, was impending
over us?</p>
            <p>And yet blessed be God (who hath never failed
to raise up Deliverers to his People in the day of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94577:14"/>
their Distress) that storm is blown over. And we
are here not only in Peace and Quietness, in the
full possession of our Native <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi>
and in the Enjoyment of the Free Exercise of our
<hi>Religion</hi> (which is one of the most desirable things
in the World) But such is the deliverance that God
hath wrought for us, that we also seem to have a
fair prospect of the Continuance of these Blessings
among us; and according to humane Estimate,
to be in a good measure out of the danger of our
old Inveterate Enemy, <hi>Popery</hi> I mean, which one
would think had now made its last effort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us.</p>
            <p>Is not this now a great Blessing? And must not
all sincere Protestants (of what perswasions soever
they be in other respects) necessarily believe so?
Certainly they must, if they think it a Blessing to
be <hi>delivered out of the hands of our Enemies,</hi> and to be
in a Condition <hi>to serve God without fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us all therefore own it as such to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty;
let us thankfully remember all his past
Deliverances from <hi>Popery,</hi> and especially, let us ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
forget those of this day; neither the <hi>former,</hi> nor
this <hi>late</hi> one.</p>
            <p>We have reason to believe, that God hath a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Care of his <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> in these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
not only because he hath so many times so
signally and wonderfully appeared for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it: But more especially, because we know,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94577:14"/>
and are convinced, that our Religion is according
to his Mind and Will; being no other than that
which his Son Jesus Christ taught unto the World;
that is to say, no other than that which is in the
<hi>Bible,</hi> which is our only <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It infinitely concerns us all therefore so to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
our selves, as to shew, that we are neither
<hi>unthankful</hi> for Gods past Mercies, nor <hi>unqualified</hi> for
his future Protection.</p>
            <p>And in order to that, I know no other way but
this, that we all firmly adhere to the <hi>Principles</hi> of
our <hi>Religion;</hi> and that in our <hi>Practices</hi> we conform
our selves to those Principles. That is to say,</p>
            <p>In the first place, That we sincerely love and fear
God, and have a hearty sense of his Presence, and
Goodness and Providence, continually abiding in
our minds. That we trust in him, depend upon
him, and acknowledge him in all our ways: That
we be careful of his Worship and Service, paying
him the constant Tribute of our Prayers, and Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and Thanksgiving, both in publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.</p>
            <p>And then secondly, that we be pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable
in our Lives; avoiding the <hi>Pollutions
that are in the World through Lust;</hi> and exercising
Chastity, and Modesty, Meekness and Humility,
Temperance and Sobriety, amidst the sundry
Temptations we have to conflict with.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, that we have always a fervent
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94577:15"/>
Charity to one another, <hi>that we love as Brethren;</hi>
endeavouring to do all the good we can, but do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
harm to none. Using Truth and Justice, and
a good Conscience in all our dealings with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
<hi>Living peaceable, if it be possible, with all Men.</hi>
And not only so, but in our several Places and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
promoting Peace, and Unity and Concord
among Christians, and contributing what we can
to the healing the sad Breaches and Divisions of
our Nation.</p>
            <p>And then lastly, that we pay all Submission, and
Duty and Obedience to the King and Queen whom
God hath set over us; endeavouring in all the ways
that are in our Power, to render their Government
both as <hi>easy</hi> to themselves, and as <hi>acceptable</hi> to their
Subjects, and as <hi>formidable</hi> to their Enemies as is
possible.</p>
            <p>If all of us that call our selves <hi>Protestants,</hi> would
charge our selves with the Practice of these things,
how assured might we rest that God would bless
us; that he would continue his Protection of our
Nation, our Church, our Religion, against all
Enemies whatsoever, and that we might see our
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> still more and more to flourish, <hi>and Peace
to be in all her Borders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May God Almighty pour upon us all the Spirit
of his G<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ace, and work all these great things in us,
and for us: And in order hereunto, may he send
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94577:15"/>
down his Blessings upon the King and Queen, and
so influence and direct all their Councils, both
Publick and Private, that all their Subjects may
be happy in their Government, and <hi>lead peaceable
and quiet lives under them in all Godliness and Honesty.</hi>
And after such a Happy and Peaceable Life here,
may we all at last arrive to God's Eternal Kingdom
and Glory, through the Merits of his dear Son,
<hi>To whom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
