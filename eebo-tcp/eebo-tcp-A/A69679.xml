         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Received and read your Letter, and this comes to (bring my humble Service, and) tell you so. In your Letter you tell me, <hi>First,</hi> Of an Inhumane and Bloody De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign and Popish Plot, a Traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Roman-Catholick Conspiracy (as you call it) against the Sacred Person and Life of our Gracious KING, (whom GOD preserve) and many more (by them) design'd for Ruine, and for the Subversion of the true Religion Establish'd by Law, and introducing Papal Tyranny, Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Idolatry. A Design not only Unchristian, but Inhumane and Barbarous; beyond all examples of Turkish or Pagan Cruelty; nor has it (in any
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50924:3"/>
story) any parallel Impiety; unless perhaps, that Bloody <note n="a" place="margin">Nuptiae Parisinae &amp; La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niena Protestantium in Gallia, Anno 1572. Vide Thuanum, ad dictum Annum.</note> 
               <hi>French Massacre,</hi> or the <hi>Gun-powder-Treason;</hi> all contriv'd and carry'd on, by Men of the same desperate Principles, and (though with the blood and ruine of many thousand innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons) to advance the Papal Interest. <hi>Secondly,</hi> You say, That the Popish Party decry this Impious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy, as a State-Trick (without truth or reallity) to make Catholicks (as they commonly miscall themselves) odious to the People, and this whole Nation. This I believe (and know) they do. As their Plots and Conspiracies, so their Impudence to deny or lessen them, (when discover'd) is mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous, and (were not their Persons and Principles known) incredible. So they did, (where, and when they durst) and still do <note n="b" place="margin">In an Almanack com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly sold, since His Majesties Happy Return; call'd, <hi>Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darium Catholicum;</hi> the Gun-powder-Treason is call'd, <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil's Contrivance.</hi> It was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 1662.</note> call the <hi>Gun-powder-Treason,</hi> A State-Design, to make them (though they were innocent) seem guilty, and Criminals. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Lastly, you say, that several Papists tell you, (in excuse of Popery, and their Party) That if indeed there be such a Plot and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy, (as is pretended) yet it is the only fault of those persons concern'd in it, not of Popery, or their Religion; the Principles and Doctrine of their Church, giving no ground or incouragement to such impious and Anti-Monarchical practices. This I believe too; because I find them making the same Apology for themselves, to take off the guilt of the <hi>Gun-powder-Treason.</hi> For (without all truth or modesty) they tell us in Print; <note n="c" place="margin">The aforesaid Popish <hi>Calendarium Catholicum,</hi> or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Almanack, at the end of it, about Holy-days set apart by Act of Parliament.</note> 
               <hi>That the Gun-powder-Treason was MORE THAN SUSPECTED, to be the CONTRIVANCE of</hi> Cecil, <hi>the great Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50924:3"/>
TO RENDER CATHOLICKS ODIOUS; and that there were but VERY FEW of that Religion, (AND THOSE DESPERADOES TOO) detected of it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All</hi>

            <p>Now these things premis'd, you desire to know of me, whether I think these their Allegations and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies true; or if I think them untrue and insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant (as you may be sure I do) that I would give you some reasons why I do so. In obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to your command, and to satisfie that Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that lies upon me (so far as I am able) to Vindicate Truth, and my Mother the Church of <hi>England;</hi> (though I have little time, and few Books here (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing absent from my own) save what I borrow of friends) I shall endeavour to say something, which may (I hope) be pertinent, towards the conviction of our Adversaries, and your satisfaction.

The <hi>Position</hi> is this ...... <hi>The Doctrine and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Popery, own'd by the Church of</hi> Rome (<hi>when believed and practised) are not onely dangerous, but pernicious to Kings, (especially to those who are Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants) prejudicial to the just rights of Monarchy, and inconsistent with that Loyalty, which (by the Laws of Nature and Scripture) is due to them; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to our Kings, by the establish'd and known Laws of</hi> England, <hi>made antiently, even by Popish
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50924:4"/>
Kings and Parliaments, against Papal Usurpations, and Anti-Monarchical Practices.</hi> And here (because it is impossible distinctly to shew, how Popish Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are dangerous to our Kings, and prejudicial to their Just Rights, and Royal Prerogative; unless we first know, what that Prerogative, and those Rights are) I shall inquire,</p>

               <item>2. How Popish Doctrines and Principles, may be dangerous, or pernicious to them.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. For the <hi>First;</hi> That <hi>England</hi> is a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> the <hi>Crown Imperial,</hi> and our Kings <hi>SUPREME</hi> Governors, and <hi>SOLE SUPREME</hi> Governors of this Realm, and all other their Dominions, will (I believe, I am sure it should) be granted; seeing our Authentick Laws and Statutes do so expresly, and so often say it. In our Oath of Supremacy we Swear, that the King is, the <hi>ONLY SUPREME Governor. SUPREME,</hi> so none (not the Pope) above Him: and <hi>ONLY SUPREME;</hi> so none co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, or equal to Him. So that by our known Laws, our King is, <hi>Solo Deo minor,</hi> invested with <hi>such a Supremacy,</hi> as excludes both Pope and People (and all the World, God Almighty only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by whom Kings Reign) from having any Power, Jurisdiction, or Authority over Him. For
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50924:4"/>
this <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Supremacy</hi> belonging to our Kings, and the Imperial Crown of <hi>England</hi> is assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not only by the Statutes of <note n="e" place="margin">Vid.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50924:5"/>
Parliament, yet declares fully for the Queen's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, (which, to some may seem strange) for that Act expresly says, 1. <hi>That the IMPERIAL CROWN of this Realm, with all its Prerogatives, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>was descended to the Queen.</hi> 2. That she was the <hi>SOVEREIGN and SUPREME</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of all Her Dominions, in <hi>AS FULL, LARGE, and AMPLE MANNER, AS ANY OF HER PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GENITORS,</hi> (therefore in as ample a manner as Her Father <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth.) 3. That <hi>by the MOST ANCIENT LAWS of this Realm, the punishment of ALL OFFENDERS, against the Regality and Laws of this Realm, belong'd to the King,</hi> &amp;c.

them) that Kings (from the beginning of the World, till our Blessed Saviours time) did, and <hi>de Jure,</hi> might exercise an Ecclesiastical, as well as Civil Jurisdiction and Supremacy; especially the Kings of the Jews, his own People; which Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy was of Gods own (and perticularly Divine) In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. These things premis'd, I come now to shew you, (in the second place) how dangerous, and (when, and where they have power to put them in execution) how pernicious Popish Principles are, to the Persons of Kings, and their just Rights and Prerogatives. And here, I say,</p>
            <p>1. That many of their <hi>Popish Principles,</hi> and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally approved and <hi>received Doctrines,</hi> are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dangerous, but destructive to, and inconsistent with the just Soveraignty and Supremacy of Kings. Because they generally say, and (in a thousand Books writ to that purpose) industriously endeavor to prove it, That all Kings and Emperors, are so far from being Supreme, that they are Subject to the Pope, as to their Superior Lord, to whom they owe Service and Fidelity. That this may appear, consider,</p>

            <p>IV. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the III. (as <hi>Infallible</hi> as any of his Successors) tells us, that the Papal <note n="s" place="margin">Innocentius 3. cap. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitae,</hi> 6. Extra de <hi>Major. &amp; Obedientiâ.</hi>
               </note> Power, is as much greater than the Imperial, as <hi>the SUN is greater than the MOON.</hi> And the Gloss there <note n="t" place="margin">Pontificalis dignitas qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragies Septies Regali major<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>So the learned Gloss.</hi>

He who put the Note in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent there, thinks this too little; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he says, <hi>Quinquagies septies;</hi> The Papal Power is (according to his Arithmetick) 57 times greater than the Imperial. A Man would think, that (by these accounts) the Popes Power were great enough. But there
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50924:11"/>
is an Addition there, (who was the Author of it, I know not) in which we are told, (you may believe so far as you think sit) that the <hi>Papal Dignity exceeds the Imperial,</hi> no less than 7744. so inconsiderable a thing (in these Mens account) is Regal and Imperial Majesty, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the vast Greatness of Papal Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</p>
            <p>In short; If you compare that Decretal of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> the Third (but now cited) with that famous Extravagant of Pope <note n="u" place="margin">Bonifacius 8. cap.

               <hi>Boniface</hi> the Eighth, (both which are received into the Body of their Canon-Law) you will find them cite several places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, (miserably mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood) and bring reasons to prove the Papal Power above the Regal and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial. But the consequences they draw from those Texts they cite, are so far from being Infallible, that they are (like those who cite them) evidently false; and what other Arguments they bring, are not only unlike reason, but ridiculous: yet although neither the Reasons, nor the Authority of their Popes, nor the general consent of the ablest Writers <hi>Rome</hi> has, (who all endeavor to establish the same Position, and the Popes extravagant Supremacy) can prove that he really has such Power, (nor are they cited by me to any such purpose) yet they clearly prove that they own that Doctrine (which is all I aim at) and (though they cannot) gladly would make it appear probable, and have us and all others to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</p>
            <p>6. And further, from this unlimited Supremacy of the Pope, they conclude (and publickly profess)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50924:12"/>
his <hi>power to depose Kings,</hi> absolve their Subjects from all Oathes of Allegiance, and dispose of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. That this may appear, I consider,</p>
            <p>1.

               <hi>That the POPE is the SUPREME VICAR of GOD, the Emperor Supreme ADVOCATE of the Church, than which NOTHING can be more HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOURABLE for any KING:</hi> (Surely Kings are much bound to him for that Honourable Office.) <hi>The</hi> POPE (as he goes on) <hi>is THE HEAD of Christ's Body; The Emperor and Kings are ARMS and HANDS; And therefore it is MADNESS to say, That the HEAD has not EMPIRE over the ARMS. The</hi> POPE, <hi>who is the Head and Top of the Ecclesiastical Body, is govern'd by the</hi> INSPIRATION <hi>of the Holy Ghost. The ARMS can do nothing, but what pertains to the Food, Rayment, and Protection of the Body. And</hi> St. Paul <hi>forbids us to doubt, that the Government and Prescription of all these, belongs to the Head, and from thence is derived to the ARMS. And therefore if Kings do not feed and cloath the Body, if the ARMS or HANDS do not do their Office, they may (by the Command of the HEAD) be CUT OFF, as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50924:13"/>
unprofitable Members.</hi> These are his words, or the English of them.</p>
            <p>So that (by this Popish Doctrine) the Pope, being Head of the Body, may, when he pleases, (for he is Supreme and Sole Judge in the case) cut off Kings and Emperors, who are but the Hands or Arms of that Body. And yet so hard is the Forehead of that Author, that he is not ashamed to say, (and put it in the Margent, that all might take notice of it) <hi>That this great Power of the Pope, is</hi>

               <hi>NOT AT ALL dangerous or prejudicial to Princes.</hi> How dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous this Doctrine of this Papal Supremacy, has been to Princes, the many Excommunications and Depositions of Kings and Emperors, in the six last Centuries, are evident and sad Witnesses; and what mischief (if not carefully prevented) it may do for the future, it will concern Princes, and all who are Loyal, and love Them, and their own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, seriously to consider.

               <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles</hi> of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do rightly refer them to him, as the true Author of them. Now, whether it were <hi>Gelasius</hi> or <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, it is all one, (as to my present business) it is by them confess'd, that a Pope was Author of that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious passage, Gratian</hi> refers it into the Body of their <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> and Pope <note n="h" place="margin">Vide Bullam Gregorii. 13.

               <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth approves, and (together with the whole Body of the Law, the Gloss and Annotations) confirms and ratifies it. Whence we may rationally conclude, that this Doctrine of the <hi>Popes Power</hi> to <hi>depose Kings,</hi> and <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve their Subjects</hi> from their <hi>Oaths of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance</hi> (though impious and rebellious) is so far from being <hi>disown'd,</hi> or <hi>detested by all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> (as some now pretend) that the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power of that Church has not only approved, but establish'd it for Law. By the way; though you see, that <hi>Gratian</hi> and Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> say, that Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> was the Man who <hi>deposed</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Hildericus;</hi> yet <note n="i" place="margin">Eginhardus in Vita Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roli Magni, p. 4, 5.

               <hi>an Historian</hi> of more Antiquity and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit than either of them (notwithstanding <hi>Gregories</hi> Infallibility) tells us, that it was <hi>Pope Stephen (Zacharies</hi> Successor) who <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed him.</hi> So that all agree, that <hi>A Pope</hi> (it matters not which) was Author of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.</p>

            <p>The sum of this Discourse is; That if the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Testimonies,</hi> 1. Of <hi>their own most learned,</hi> and (for Dignity) <hi>most eminent Writers de Conciliis;</hi> 2. Or <hi>their Publishers of their Councils General and Provincial;</hi> 3.

And so, those <hi>Impious</hi> and <hi>Damnable Positions</hi> in the Third <hi>Canon</hi> of that Council, (1. <hi>That Kings and Emperors may be Excommunicated by their own Bishops for not obeying the Pope: 2.

Whence also it manifestly follows; that all Protestants, Kings and Subjects, Princes and People, (who, by many Papal Bulls and Anathema's, stand actually Cursed and Excommunicated) are in a damnable condition, and if they die, (as they do, and should) without Popish Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, by this Roman, Uncharitable, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Divinity, they are eternally damn'd.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50924:40"/>
for I believe and know, that they are <hi>bruta fulmina,</hi> insignificant Squibs of false Fire; which can neither hurt their Souls here, nor hinder their Salvation hereafter. But notwithstanding this, they may prove dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and pernicious to Protestant Princes, as they may be, and are great incouragements to their Popish Subjects, to rebel, and diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey their Soveraigns, and securely (as to any thing of Conscience or Injustice in it) act any thing to their ruine. For they who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Popes pretended Power, that he can deprive their Prince of all Royal Power and Dignity, and that he has actually done it; that he has absolved them from all Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Allegiance and Fidelity due to him; that he is a Member of the Devil here, and surely to be damn'd hereafter, and that to kill him is no Murder. I say, those who submit to the Pope, and believe these Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Impious Doctrines, (as all must who believe the Pope, or the Roman Church In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible) have too much incouragement, not only to disobey and rebel, but (when they have power and opportunity) to take away their Princes Life, as being a Person odious to God and Man, and by the Pope, (their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible and Supreme Judge) by their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Laws, and their General Councils, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be such; especially seeing that if they miscarry in that attempt, (and while they seek their Princes Life, lose their own) yet

their Names shall (in Red Letters) be Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster'd in the Calendar, and they (by their Party) shall be reputed Martyrs; as all know, that <hi>Campian, Garnet,</hi> and our Powder-Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are. An honor, I am so far from envying them that I should be very glad (and so would many thousands more) to see our present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators (according to their merit) referr'd into their Calendar amongst such Martyrs; that so we might be freed from the fears of those Prodigious Villains and mischiefs they intended and indeavoured to act here, against their Gracious Soveraign, the Church and State, and there is too much reason to believe, that (while they live, and have ability and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity) they will prosecute those Black De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs. <hi>Dirum omen misericors (qui solus potest) averruncet Deus.</hi>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50924:44"/>
they contrive, and resolve to <hi>execute such a Conspiracy,</hi> as (for barbarous and <hi>prodigious Villany</hi>) <hi>neither Heathens nor Hell had (till that time</hi>) ever put in execution; I mean the <note n="a" place="margin">See the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 3.

their Plots and Conspiracies, (to ruine our Church and establish'd Religion) as much in <hi>Charles</hi> the First's, as in his Fathers time.

We read indeed, that our Blessed Saviour gives <hi>Peter</hi> Commission to <note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 21. 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>FEED HIS SHEEP and his LAMBS.</hi> But we <hi>never read</hi> that he (<hi>whose Kingdom was not of this World</hi>) gave any <hi>Commission to Peter,</hi> or his <hi>pretended Vicar,</hi> to <hi>raise Armies</hi> to <hi>kill,</hi> and (<hi>indictà causà</hi>) to <hi>Murder them.</hi> Though I know there are some, who from <hi>pasce oves,</hi> (with <hi>bad Logique</hi> and <hi>worse Divinity</hi>) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the <hi>Pope has Power to kill He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques.</hi> Like that Monk <hi>Erasmus</hi> mentions, who, with great Zeal for the Catholique Cause, and greater Ignorance, endeavoured to prove, that the Church might kill Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, from that passage in the Apostle, <note n="c" place="margin">Tit. 3. 10.</note> 
               <hi>HAERETICUM DEVITA,</hi> that is, (says the Monk) (who had no Greek, and little

            </p>
            <p>7. From the aforesaid reasons, I think we may (with good consequence) conclude; <hi>that the Pope and his party,</hi> ever since <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, <hi>(de facto) assum'd the Supremacy,</hi> which <hi>(de jure)</hi> was <hi>his before</hi>) have been in a <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Conspiracy</hi> against the <hi>Lives and Religion</hi> of our <hi>Protestant Princes;</hi> at least till the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Return of our Gracious Soveraign (whom God preserve) who being (by the good and Miraculous Providence of Heaven Restor'd to His Fathers Throne (His own Right and Inheritance) a blessed Peace, and all the happy effects of it, did immediately follow, to the great comfort and benefit of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; The Government of Church and State before shatter'd and ruin'd by a horrid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion (Begun, Incourag'd, and Promoted by the Pope and his Jesuitical Party) was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily Restored, and (by Law) establish'd; the Just Rights and Liberties of the Subjects assured to them, and confirm'd; a Gracious Act of Oblivion, and Pardon of Illegal, Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and Rebellious actions against the King and His Laws granted; and the blessing and benefit of all these extended to <hi>Papists</hi> as well as other. So that beside their <hi>Obligation to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Loyalty,</hi> by their <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Sworn Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,</hi> there lay upon them <hi>an Obligation to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50924:48"/>
Gratitude,</hi> for those <hi>signal favors</hi> they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from the <hi>goodness of a gratious Prince.</hi> So that it was the <hi>beliefe</hi> and <hi>hope of some,</hi> that the foremention'd <hi>Popish Principles</hi> and <hi>Practises</hi> had <hi>been forgot,</hi> or <hi>laid aside;</hi> and that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholiques (as both in <hi>words</hi> and <hi>wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi> they <hi>publickly pretended</hi>) would be very <hi>Loyal Subjects</hi> But these were vain hopes; for (notwithstanding all obligations to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and gratitude) even since His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Happy Return, the Popish Party have carried on their Plots and Conspiracies, against their <hi>gracious Prince,</hi> the <hi>establish'd Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Peace of our Church and State,</hi> with as <hi>much industry</hi> and <hi>impiety,</hi> as formerly. Which now <hi>evidently appears,</hi> by their <hi>impious Conspiracy,</hi> by the blessing of God very happily, though <hi>lately discover'd.</hi> That you may (in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral) know what this Plot is, and that I do not miscall it, when I say it is an Impious Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: I shall give you two Authentique Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>

            </p>
            <p>By what is already said, (I suppose) you may see, what the Roman-Catholick, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Principles and Practises have been, are, and (while there is a Pope, and a Party to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and incourage such Practises) ever will be; and how dangerous such Principles are, and (when put in execution) how pernicious they are (and ever will be) to all PRINCES, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally PROTESTANTS, and all those they are pleas'd to call, or miscall Heretiques. Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Principles I have hitherto mentioned are these:</p>
            <p>1. The Pope (with them) is <hi>Supreme MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NARCH</hi> of all the World, even in Temporals; at least <hi>indirectè,</hi> (as the most moderate amongst them sometimes say) and <hi>in ordine ad spiritualis,</hi> which distinction can afford no comfort or security to Temporal Princes. For if the Pope have such vast power, <hi>directè,</hi> or <hi>indirectè,</hi> 'tis all one, he has it; and if a Prince be deposed, or murdered, by <hi>either end of the distinction,</hi> he is equally, and as
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50924:49"/>
surely Murder'd; as he who is kill'd by the edge, or back of the Sword, is as certainly kill'd.</p>

               <note n="c" place="margin">And this vast power the Pope challenges over all King, and Emperors, to Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate and Depose them, is such; that if any King or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror obey not the Decree of the Pope and his Councils, he is, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> deprived of all his dignity, and Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is not any private person, but a General Council of their own, which tells us so..........<hi>Omnibus Christi fidelibus inhibet, sub p nâ PRIVATIONIS OMNIUM DIGNITATUM &amp; BONO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RUM Ecclesiasticorum &amp; mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danorum, et ALIS P<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>AENIS juris: etiamsi REGALIS sit dignitatis aut IMPERIALIS; quibus si contra HANC IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HIBITIONEM fecerint, sint AUTHORITATE HUJUS DECRETI, et IPSO FACTO PRIVATI,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>1. The words of the Council are these; and the Proposition they condemn this......<hi>Quilibet Tyrannus potest ac debet licite ac meritoriè occidi, per quemlibet vassallum &amp; subditum, etiam per insidias, vel blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditias, vel adulationes non obstante quocunque Jura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento seu confederatione factis cum eo, non expectata sententiâ vel mandato Judicis cujuscunque.</hi> That is ..... <hi>Any Tyrant may, and ought to be lawfully and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoriously kill'd, by any vassal or subject of his, even by treachery or flattery; notwithstanding any oath, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation made to, or with him; and not having the preceding sentence or command of any Judge whomsoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:50924:51"/>2. This is the Proposition, which the Fathers at the <note n="a" place="margin">They confess it to be <hi>Concilium Generale approbatum, &amp; a Gregorio Duodecimo Vero Pontifice, confirmatum.</hi> Longus a Coriolano, in summa Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. p. 858. yet they reject what displeaseth the Pope in it. Idem Ibidem.</note> General Council at <hi>Constance,</hi> condemned, (for a General approved Council, and confirm'd by a true Pope, they acknowledge it; though they have little reason for it, as may appear by what (<hi>b</hi>) <hi>Ges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> has said, and <note n="c" place="margin">Longus à Coriolano p. 866.</note> 
               <hi>Longus à Coriolano</hi> has not (though he endeavour it) Answer'd.) But it is penn'd with<note place="margin">(<hi>g</hi>) Gesnar. in Praefat. ad Epitomen Concil. ex additis ad Chronicon Urspergens.</note> that Art, and Roman-Catholick cunning, that though it seem to say something for the Security of Kings and Princes; yet indeed it is (as to that purpose) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together insignificant. For,</p>
            <p>1. Here is nothing in this Proposition, or the Condemnation of it, by the Council; which condemns, or any way disapproves the Popes Excommunications or Depositions of Kings, their Absolutions of their Subjects from their Oaths of Allegiance, or giving away their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. It is only the <hi>Assassinations and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Tyrants</hi> which are spoken of; not any Excommunications, Depositions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Kings.</p>
            <p>2. Nor does the Council deny, but that <hi>every TYRANT may be kill'd;</hi> but that which they condemn as erroneous, is; That <hi>every Tyrant may, and also OUGHT to be kill'd.</hi> Now this is a Conjunctive and Copulative Proposition; and such Propositions are (in Logique) false, when either part is false, though both be not. So this Proposition, <hi>Every Man is rational and Learn'd;</hi> is erroneous, because one part is so:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50924:52"/>
for though every Man be Rational, yet every Man is not Learned. In like manner, although it will be granted at <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>every Tyrant may be Kill'd;</hi> yet that <hi>every Tyrant ought to be Kill'd,</hi> will not be so easily granted. For let him be a Tyrant in respect of Title, one who is an Usurper, and has no right to the Crown; yet let him be a Roman Catholique, a zealous Maintainer and Promoter of the Papal Religion and Interest; or one under whom they find more favour than they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from the true King; they will not say <hi>that he OUGHT to be Kill'd.</hi> And on this account it was (I believe) that the Pope and his Party did not think, <hi>That CROMWEL (though a Tyrant) OUGHT to be Kill'd;</hi> or (for ought I know) ever went about it; (though they desired and endeavoured to take away the Life of <hi>CHARLES the Martyr,</hi> who had a most just Title to the Crown) because they found more favour under him, and more freedom from the punishment of Penal Laws, than they ever had before; or could expect, if the true Owner of it, possess'd the Crown. In <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s time, no Oaths of Allegiance or Supremacy were press'd upon them, our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy and Common-Prayers were taken away, and an <hi>Ordinance passed, That no Man should be Censured for not coming to Church;</hi> so that there was no way then to discover, or legally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict a Popish Recusant. On which ground, the Fathers at <hi>Constance,</hi> might condemn this
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50924:52"/>
Proposition, (as erroneous) <hi>Quilibet Tyrannus</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Every Tyrant MAY, and OUGHT o be Kill'd;</hi> and not deny that <hi>every Tyrant MIGHT be Kill'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. When they condemn this Proposition, (as er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous) ......<hi>Every Tyrant may LAWFULLY,</hi> and <hi>MERITORIOUSLY be Kill'd:</hi> on the same account the <hi>Proposition is erroneous,</hi> and (as such) might be condemned by them; and yet they might believe <hi>it LAWFUL</hi> to Kill any Tyrant, thought not <hi>Meritorious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. When they say, a Tyrant cannot lawfully be kill'd <hi>per Quemcunque Vassallum &amp; Subditum,</hi> by any of his <hi>Subjects;</hi> this is but poor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for Kings or Pinces, and afford them no certain Security. For if a King be <hi>Kill'd,</hi> it is not much material, whether a Native or an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lien be the Assassin, he is Kill'd. So that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the Council of <hi>Constance</hi> has said; they may hire an Alien to Kill a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Prince, as <hi>Lopez</hi> was to Murder Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and a Spaniard to Assassinate <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> of <hi>Nassaw:</hi> or (what was really intended and endeavoured, and probably had taken ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, had not the good Providence of Heaven miraculously hindred it) the Pope may give away our Nation, and send a Spanish Armado, (as he did in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time) or a French Army, to kill Prince and People, and take possession of it. <hi>Dirum omen misericors (qui solus potest) averruncet Deus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:50924:53"/>5. When that Council denies this Proposition, (and condemns the Affirmative as erroneous) That <hi>a Tyrant may be Murdered by any Vassal and Subject;</hi> it is in the singular number, (<hi>per Vassallum &amp; Subditum</hi>) and hinders not, but that more, or the <hi>major part</hi> of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Commonweal may do it; for although this Doctrine be impious and Heretical, yet (at <hi>Rome</hi>) it is Catholique, (or Roman-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique) and by many of their eminent Writers, maintain'd and justify'd.</p>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50924:53"/>
could be expected. 2. Now although to us, (and in truth) Kings and Supreme Princes, neither have, nor can have any Judge: it being necessary, that the Judge be Superior in Power and Jurisdiction, to the Person Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (otherwise he cannot be a legal and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge) and to say, That Kings and Supreme Princes have any Superior on Earth, (where they are Supreme) is a contradiction. 3. But at <hi>Rome,</hi> it is otherwise; the Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Catholiques do constantly affirm, That both the <hi>Pope and the People,</hi> are Superiors to Kings, and may pass sentence on them, and declare them Tyrants. 4. And therefore if Subjects may not kill Kings, (who are Tyrants) without such sentence or command, but must expect it; then if thy <hi>have expected,</hi> and <hi>have it,</hi> then they <hi>may kill them lawfully and meritoriously.</hi> For <hi>exceptio firmat regulam in non exceptis.</hi> 5. And 'tis to be observed, that it is, <hi>Sententia vel Mandato Judicis,</hi> by the Sentence or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Judge. So that if any private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son have the <hi>command</hi> of the Pope or People, (who are <note n="b" place="margin">Regem (si Tyrannus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claretur à PAPA vel POPU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LO) quilibet, etiam PRIVA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUS, potest JURE PER<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And here further, because many of our Popish Party, seeing the horridness of this Damnable and Hellish Conspiracy, and (in reality I hope, or at least) seem to condemn both it, and the Authors of it; laying the blame upon the Persons only of some few, and with great confidence, (to give it no worse name) denying the Roman Church to approve, or receive any Principles, which can encourage such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies, or prove pernicious, or dangerous to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, their Persons, or Government: I shall briefly give you an account of some more of their received Doctrines and Principles, (besides those already na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) which have been, and (while they are believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) ever will be prejudicial to Princes, and the Peace and Quiet of their Subjects and Dominions.

               </note> Author of that Note) <hi>for the Pope to dispence against the Apostle, as to positive Law.</hi> So that Papists may take as many Oaths of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance and Supremacy as their Prince shall please, yet the Pope (when he pleases) can dispence with them, and set them free, from all obligation of fidelity. And hence it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently follows; That a true Roman-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique (who believes this Popish Power of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50924:57"/>
with all Oaths) may take a thousand Oaths of Allegiance, and yet give no assurance of his Fidelity to his Prince; seeing the Pope may (upon their approv'd Principles) when he pleases, set them free from all such Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 4. But, if all these ways, of nulling the Obligations of Oaths of Allegiance fail: yet the Popes Janizaries (the Jesuites) have a new way to prevent all such Obligations of Oaths, without any Dispensations; and that is by Equivocations, rectifying Intentions, and their Doctrine of Probabilities: pernicious Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, destructive of Humane Society, and so notoriously now known to the World, that I neither shall, nor need go about to prove them, or shew the pernicious consequences of them. Sure I am, that by their Popish Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, no Papists in <hi>England</hi> are <note n="a" place="margin">As may (to omit all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) abundantly appear by Father <hi>Parsons</hi> Book writ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Oath of Allegiance: The Title of his Book is this, <hi>A Discussion of the Answer of Dr. Will. Barlow.</hi> And at large lately in Father <hi>Caron's Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strantia Hibernorum,</hi> &amp;c.</note> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to take the Oath of Allegiance to their King: and then 'tis easie to judge, what good Subjects they are like to be. For certainly, what I may lawfully do, that (on a just and serious occasion) I may swear to do. If it be a duty, and lawful for me to obey my Princes commands, and pay him fidelity; then certainly, I may (by Oath) bind my self to the performance of it. So all Men, by the Law of Nature and Moral Veracity, are bound to <hi>speak truth;</hi> it is both <hi>lawful and a duty:</hi> and therefore, when (in Judicature) I am call'd to be a Witness; I may, and (by the consent of all Nations) ought to take an Oath, to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50924:57"/>
bind me, and assure others, that I will speak truth. All Men (as I said, and all confess) are bound by an indispensable Law of Nature to speak truth (when there is a just occasion for it) and yet (in Judicature) his testimony would not pass for good evidence, who (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing required) would not (by Oath) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the truth of it. And therefore Princes have just reason to believe, that those who will not take an Oath to be Loyal Subjects, will never be so without it. And indeed the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why Princes may justly suspect the fidelity of their Popish Clergy, who refuse the Oath of Allegiance, will farther appear, if we consider,</p>
            <p>2. That when and where Popery prevails, all their Bishops swear absolute Allegiance and Fidelity to the Pope, and therefore cannot swear it to their Prince too.

The Proofs I mean, shall be drawn from the clear Testimonies of their own eminent and learned Writers, their Canon-Laws, approved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in and by their Church, their Popes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals, and their own General Councils.

Certainly (upon these Popish principles) all the Clergy must and will much rather fear and obey the Pope who can, than their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who (by their principles) have no power to punish them. But this is not all; for (to omit all other) there is one pernicious Popish principle more, not yet mention'd, which ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely abrogates and deprives Princes and

And although this Popish principle be erroneous and traiterous, against the light of Nature and Scripture, Reason and Revelation; yet 'tis not all. For they do not only say, <hi>that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50924:63"/>

I take it then to be evident, that the aforesaid Popish Doctrines and Principles are exceeding dangerous, and to all Supreme Powers (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Protestant Kings and Princes) pernicious.</p>
            <p>2. And from the Premises, it will as evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the aforesaid Popish Principles, are not the private Opinions of some particular Persons only: seeing, 1.
