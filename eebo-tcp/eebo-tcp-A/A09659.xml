            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE OF M. IOHN FOX, To the Christian Reader.</head>
            <p>AS it is greatlie to be reioyced, and the Lord highlie to be praised for the happy enterprise of the Godlie worke of Nehemiah, begonne by the reucrent and vigilant Pastour of Christ his Church of famous memorie M. Iames Pilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Bishop of Duresme: So againe it were to be wished, that if the lord had thought it so good, his dayes might haue continued to the full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting of the same, which now is left vnperfect, onelie containing fine Chapters by him expounded'. For the setting out where of being reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted hereunto, I thought to adde these few lines in recommending the same to the godlie reader, trusting no lesse, then that whosoever will take paines in reading thereof, the same shall finde his labour therein not altogether lost. And that for diuers causes. First for the better explaining of the Chapters whereof he intreateth. Secondlie for the opening of auncient hystories intermixed withall, much needfull to be knowen. Thirdlie for the opportunitie of the tyme well serving for the purpose present. For as Nehemiah then by gods prouidence was set up for the reedifying of the materiall Tomple of Hierusalem destroyed by the Babylontans, so in like sort the spirituall Church of Christ, in this spirituall Babylonicall capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, being a long time in ruine and decay, standeth in great need of Godlie helpers, and good workemen, as blessed be the Lord, some we haue seene, and doe see, right zealouslie occupied to the shedding of their blood in repayring Christ his temple. Yet notwithstanding the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of so great importance, and the time so daungerous, it shall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse in these our dayes to be taught by the time before vs. First, that
<pb facs="tcp:14649:3"/>
the outward temple in Hierusalem destroyed by the Babylonians, did lie wast for manie yeares, it cannot be denied. Which being graunted, it must needs follow, that eyther the sayd materiall temple doth beare no representation of the spirituall Church of Christ (which cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) or else that the same Church of Christ must necessarilie suffer some captiuitie, &amp; Apostasie for a time by certaine spirituall Babilonians inlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times: which being so, then must it likewise follow consequently, that as that former temple of God in Hierusalem after long captiuitie at length was restored againe by the mighty hand of God, so the like is to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished in Christ his Church, after long wracke and decay, to be repayred againe, as we see now come to passe. For what oppression, what tyrany, what darkenes hath ouerwhelmed the poore Church of Christ these manie yeares by the Romish Assyrians, who is so blind that seeth not? wherfore much deceiued be these our Pope holiepretensed Catholikes, who drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in their fantasies no other true Church to be in earth but onlie their holy church of Rome, falslie so perswade them-selues, because the outward state of their Romish church, so gloriouslie, and richlie shineth in the world, and therfore the true Church of Christ is at no time to be blemished with ignoraunce and darkenesse, but continuallie florisb with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out spot or wrincle in the eyes of men, neuer to suffer any wrack, or decay, but perpetually to be preserued from all ruine or distresse. By which ruine if they meane the perpetual, or finall desolation of the true Church of Christ, true it is that the same shall neuer sinallie be for saken nor ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, but for a time the same to suffer vioience and oppression by ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies it cannot be denied. For Antichrist, by the secret permission of God, must haue his owne course, and raigne here in the church for a time, in which time by the assured Testimonie of S. Paules Epistle there must come a defection and Apostasie, wherby is signified no doubt a spirituall &amp; as it were a generall departing from the right faith of the gospell, for a time and space, till it shall please the Lord againe to giue his booke to the mouth of his Prophets, and to send downe by his Angell his measuring reede to measure the wasted temple of the Lord' for the reedifying againe. as we read, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>: 10. 11.</p>
            <p>Howsoeuer Antichrist in the meant space doth florish in this world, sitting in the Temple of God, boasting him-selfe as God, and drawing the faith of the people from God to him-selse; Certainlie with the true Church of Christ it standeth much otherwise, which must be brought down by Antichrist not to final destruction, but for a time to be oppressed, till it shall please God againe to repaire it, as we by experience haue good proofe to declare. Wherefore let no man meruaile at the decaied state
<pb facs="tcp:14649:3"/>
of Christ his Church, which hath bene solong time continued, nor thinks the worse of the Gospell non preached, as though it were a new faith or a new Religion lately erected. If this gispell now preached were not taught by Christ him-selfe, by Paule, and other Apostles, let it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for new. If the Popes doctrine be not agreeing to the same, then let euery man iudge which is new, and which is old. Brieflie, let vs take example of the auncient tabernacle or house of God, first set vp by Moses, afterward more magnifically <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to the like proportion in timber, &amp; stone by Salomon: which house or tabernacle the Lord promised to stand for euer: yet notwithstanding the same temple of God (exemplifying no dout the spirituall Church of Christ here in earth) was vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne by the Babilonians for a certaine space, and afterward repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againe by Gods people with much difficulty, and hardnes of times: and after that the same againe miserablie dispoyled, and destroyed by wicked Antiochus. In like manner the spirituall Church of Christ, although it haue the true promise of Christ to endure for euer, as it doth and euer shall doe, yet lacketh not her Babilonians, her Anticchus, her ouerthrowers, &amp; temporall oppressours: yet not so oppressed, but at length, by labourers, and artificers of God, is to be repayred againe, albeit sent in great sharpnes of time, we see it now come to passe.</p>
            <p>Which being so, let vs therefore, comparing time with time, looke well to the matter euery man what he hath to doe. Such as be builders may take example of those good builders therof, whome we read that with one hand they builded, and with the other they held their weapon, that is the spirituall sword of Gods word to keepe of the enemie. Such workmen the Lord send into his vineyard to be diligent labourers, not loyterers: nor braulers, but builders, labouring, and working, not with one hand, but with both hands occupied. And likewise vpon these labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers the Lord send good ouerseers, such as this good Nehemiah, who not regarding his owne priuate charges, and expenses, bestowed all his care in tendring and setting forward the erection of the Lords house, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the workemen, to prouide for their necessities, to defena them from enemies, to keepe them in good order from strife and variance. For as euery good building there best goeth forward, when the workmen in one consent ioyne them-selues together: So contrariwise nothing more hindreth the setting vp of any worke, as when the workmen are deuided among them-selues. Albeit during the time of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> we sinde no great sturs among the people, or if there were any, it was seene composed by the wise handling of that good gouernour, as in the fift chapter may appeare. wherefore for the better example to le taken of these distressed
<pb facs="tcp:14649:4"/>
dales, I thought it not amisse in this so daungerous building vp of Christs Church in the perillous latter times, this treatise of Nehemiah, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled by the right reuerend and famous prelate M. Iames Pilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton of blessed memory, to be published and commended to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian readers, wherby all good labourers, and ouerseers of Christ his Church may receiue some fruitfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisement to consider in these soe great affayres of the Lord his busines what is to be done and looked vnto.</p>

They call their schul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers together afore daie, by ringing of a bell, as though they should go to warte or to hunt. They make one of the kings sonnes their ruler, or some great men ouer 50 in a bande: and commaund them to follow their Captaine 30. or 40. furlongs when he runneth afore them. They aske account of those things that they haue learned, exercising their voice, breath, and sides, to hear, colde, raine, and passing of riuers. They teach them to keepe their Armour &amp; cloathes drie, and to feed &amp; liue hardlie like husbandmen, eating wilde fruits as acornes and crabbes. Their dailie meate after their exercise is verie hard bread, Cardanum, salte, and flesh rosted Their drinke is water. They hunt on horsebake with picking their dartes, shooting their shaftes, or casting with their sling. In the forenoone they are exercised with planting of trees, or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp the rootes, or make harnesse, or applie them-selues to working ofline, or making of nets. The kings giue rewards to those that get the best game at running and other games, which they vse euerie 5. yeare. They beare office &amp; plaie the souldiers on foote and horsse, from 20. years olde vnto 50. They be armed with a shield made like a diamond. Besides their quiuer, they haue their crooked falchion and daggers: vpon their head a steeple-cappe, vpon their breast a coate of plate. Their Princes haue their breeches triple folde, and a coate with wide sleeues lined with white, and syde to the knee, and the outside coloured. Their apparel in some is purple, or els of diuers coloures: in winter of diuers coloures. Their cappes like vnto the Miters of their southsaiers, their shooes high &amp; dubble. The common sorte weare a lined coate to the mid-leg, &amp; about their head a role of sindal. Euery man vseth his bowe &amp; sling. The Persians fare daintilie, hauing manie and diuers kindes of meate, and their tables shine with their plate of gold &amp; siluer. They debate their weightie matters at the wine: if they meete their fellowes or acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by the waie, they kisse them: if they be poorer, they make curtesie. Their southsaiers they leue vnburied to the birds. The greatest riches that the kings had, were in buildings, and they coyned no more monie, then serued the present neede. The people were temperate in their liuing, but their kings passed in excesse. The kings attire of his head was of myrrhe and other sweete gommes. They kept commonlie 300. women which slept in the daie, &amp; sang &amp; daunced all the night. If the king would goe to any of them, the floore was couered with fine arris: He rode seldome, but in his chariot. If he suffered any man to come to his speache he sate in a throne of gold, standing on foure pillers, with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious stones. At the head of his bed were 5000. Talents of gold, which where called the kings pillowe: at his feete were 3000. Talents of siluer, which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his footestoole: ouer his bed was a golden vine, withgolden branches and grapes, drawne with pretious stones.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>ALthough there be diuers opinions, whether <hi>Ezra</hi> or <hi>Nehemiah</hi> wrote this booke, yet for my parte I rather beleeue, all reasons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> wrote it, as <hi>Wolphius</hi> well prooueth it. But whether so-euer the one or the other wrote it, if the authoritie of the writer may giue any strength to the writing, or mans worthines adde anything to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of Gods holie Scripture, it skilleth not much: for they were both the true, learned, and faithful seruants of God. Yet surelie this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie man <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> which in English is to saie, <hi>a comforte sent from God,</hi> to comfort his people in those troublesome times, should not be robbed of his well deserued thankes, but first God should be chieslie praised, that raised vp so worthie a man, whose pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degree is vnknowne, &amp; his fathers to, in so ill a time to do not onely so great things both in the commonwealth &amp; Religion, in peace and warre: and then shold <hi>Nehemiah</hi> also be worthelie next commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that so faithfullie obeied the Lord his God, so painfullie traueiled for the wealth of his countrie, also attained such learning, that he could, and was so diligent in studie among all his great affaires, that he would, to the greate glorie of God &amp; comforte of all his Church vnto the worlds end, put these his owne doings in
<pb facs="tcp:14649:6"/>
writing. A worthie example for all that loue religion, be seruitours in the courte, attend on the Prince, beare office in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or captaines in the warres, to followe. For in all these things was Nehemiah famous: in religion earnest, in great fauour with his Prince, with all vprightnesse of life towards all, in warre skilful, curragious, &amp; painful, and with his penne so learned, that he could so clerkelie put it in writing. Gentelmen therefore and men of the world are not borne to liue in pastime and pleasure, as they list, and manie doc, no more then poore men: but first to serue the Lord, promote his word and religion earnestlie, minister iustice seuerelie, mainteine peace quietlie, defend the common-wealth stoutlie, releeue the oppressed mightilie, followe learning and studie diligentlie, that so they maieincrease in vertue and honestie, as Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah did, and after all these great trauailes refresh themselues with honest pastimes measurablie. Among the heathen Princes such a one was Iulius Cesar, in the warres cunning and happie: in gouernment of the common-wealth commendable, and in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning so excellent, that no man hath written more eloquentlie. Such like were Alexander Seuerus, and Marcus Aurelius, Emperours. But I will not perswade much in Gods cause with prophane ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. And to returne to our purpose, I would not haue men thinke that the scripture taketh his authoritie &amp; credit of the man that writeth it, but the writer is to be credited for the holie Ghosts sake, who inspired him with such heauenlie knowledg, and whose instrument he is for God to speake by. Scripture commeth not first from man, but from God, and therefore God is to be taken for the author of it, &amp; not man. The Gospel saith: <hi>It is not you that speake, but the Spirit of your father, that speaketh in you.</hi> And. S. Petersaith, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 20. 2. Pet. 1. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moued by the holie Ghoste.</hi> Augustine, saith well. <hi>The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a letter sent from God the creator vnto man his creature.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when thou readest this booke or other parts of the Scripture, doe it as gladlie and reuerentlie, yea and much more to, then thou wouldst vse and read the Princes, or thy friends letters, seeing it is a letter sent to the from thy God for thy saluation. God then is the cheifest author of this booke, as he is of the rest of the Scripture, &amp; Nehemiah the penne or writer of all these misteries. Dauid said of himselfe, <hi>my tongue is the pen of a writer that writeth swiftly:</hi> meaning <note place="margin">Psal. 45. 2.</note> the holy Ghost to be the writer, &amp; his tongue the penne. So Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah was the author of this booke, as Dauid of the Psalmes. And because they should know which Nehemiah he was, he saith he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14649:6"/>
was <hi>the sonne of Hachalia.</hi> For there were diuers others of that name, but not his sonnes.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p n="1">V. 1. It came to passe in the moneth of Nouember, and in the 20. yeare, that I was in the castle of Susan.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And there came Chanani, one of my breethren, he &amp; men of Iuda: and I asked them for the Iewes which scaped, and remained of the captiuitie, and for Ierusalem.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And they said to me, the remnante which remained of the captiuitie there in the countrie, be in greate miserie and reproche: and the wall of Ierusalem is broken downe, and the gates of it are burned with fire.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And it came to passe when I heard these wordes, I sate downe and wept, and being sad certeine daies, I fasted, and praied before the Lord of heauen.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>THe Scriptures vse not to reckon their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes after the order of our calenders, but by the exchange of the moone: for our callenders are not of that auncientie, that the Scriptures be by many yeares. The first moneth in the yeare with them began at the next change of the moone whensoeuer it fell after the 22. daie of <hi>March:</hi> when the daies and nights be both of one length. And then was <hi>March</hi> called the first moone of the yeare, whereas we make <hi>Ianuarie</hi> our first moone. So this moone here which is called <hi>Casleu,</hi> was the 9. moneth from it, and fell in the latter end of <hi>Nouember,</hi> what daie soeuer the moone then chaunged. The 20. <hi>yeare,</hi> that he speaketh of here, was of the reigne of <hi>King Artaxerxes,</hi> as appeereth in the beginning of the 2. Chapter, of whom ye shall heare more there. <hi>Susan</hi> was the cheif Citie of all the kingdom of <hi>Persia,</hi> where the king had both his pallace, aud a strong castle also of the same name, where his treasure was kept. <hi>this Citie</hi> (as Strabo writeth) <hi>was long, and in compasse 15. myles about.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who this <hi>Chanani</hi> was, it appeereth not, but beelike some honest man of good credit, and more earnest in religion and loue to his
<pb facs="tcp:14649:7"/>
countrie then others, because his name is put downe in writing, &amp; the others are not. And where <hi>Nehemiah</hi> calleth him <hi>brother,</hi> it is not necessarie to thinke, that he was of the same father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was, but either further of in kinred, or els of the same countrie and religion. For this word <hi>brother,</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture signifieth all those sorts of brotherhod, that be any waies kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or els of anie countrie and religion. S. Paul saieth, <hi>I wish to be</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>accursed from Christ for my breethren &amp; kinsmen after the flesh, which be the Israelites.</hi> Where he calleth al the children of Israel his <hi>breethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> because they came all of one father <hi>Iacob</hi> long agoe, and now were of one country, and professed one God. What occasion these men had to come to the courte, it appeereth not: &amp; therefore not necessary to be searched: but belike some greate sute for their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, because they tooke so long a iourny in the winter, and so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable a time of the yeare; which men commonlie vse not to doe for smale causes. And by this we maie learne a good lesson, that no time is so troublesome, no iournie so long, but good men will not refuse it, to serue God &amp; their countrie. And where <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> walking abroade about the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, beginneth to examin the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the <hi>estate of the Iewes,</hi> how they did, <hi>and of the Citie of Ierusalem,</hi> in what case it was, it declareth the great loue that he had to his people, countrie, and religion. O worthie example for all courtiers to follow, sometimes to walke abroad, to see what suters there be, &amp; learne the state of the countrie from whence they came, &amp; help to further their good causes. The contrarie is to commonlie vsed: they locke them-selues vp, &amp; will not be spoken with, their doores must be opened with siluer keyes, many meanes and freendes must be made, and a long time of attendance, afore ye be heard, except some seruant about them haue some gentle remembrance to help you to their speach. And this is more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon in the meaner sorte, then the higher. yet I saie not that all walkers abroad and talking with suters be euer good men. For <hi>Absalon walked afore the courte gate, tooke them by the hand, and imbraced them, asked what sutes they had, pitied their causes,</hi> but for an ill purpose, to bring the King his <note place="margin">2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14649:7"/>
their King, and set vp <hi>Absalon.</hi> We need not at these daies to complaine of all courtiers, that they be so hard to speake to, and thatmanie times the master is not at leysure, vntil the seruant be pleased with something, though the master bid the contrary. For there be too many, that when suters do come, they will learne too diligentlie, what sute they haue, out of what countrie they come: &amp; then if they will faithfullie declare vnto them, what office is there voide in the countrie, or what good farmeholde is to be had there at the Princes hand, or rather at anie Church, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise they will help to further his sute diligently: but when they haue learned all that they can, then they know him not, when they meete him againe the next daie, or els giue him faire wordes with strange lookes and manie delayes. By these meanes and such like they are so cunning in all corners of the realm, that they can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlie tell what the Prince or anie man in the countrie hath: and if it be not presentlie voide, they are content with a reuersion, though it be manie yeares to come: yea and often sue for the same thing, that the poore man came for, saying, another would haue had it, if he had not staied it: and so vnder a cloake of freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship make him paic more then he needed. We seeke what should be the cause of such needelesse dearthes as the realme is full of, &amp; surely though manie be giuen, yet I thinke none greater then this. For when these leases be graunted, the landlord hath but his olde rent, and the tennante no more but his olde fermeholde: but the leasemonger, that is crept in betwixt the landlord and the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, goeth awaie with the sweet from them both. For first he racks the rent, and sacks the tennante so, that he is not so able to sell his things so reasonablie, as els he might, nor serue the Prince nor his landlord, as he should: nor the landlord paying so deere for all thinges, is able to liue as his Elders did before. This vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining micher liueth better then they both, &amp; taketh no paines at all for it, that they both shoulde liue on, and the one releeue the other. <hi>Haman walked afore the courte gates to see who would reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him, as he passed by, and who would not:</hi> poore <hi>Mardocheus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">Ester. 3.</note> he would not, was brought in great daunger of his life, and al the Iewes with him: but God that ouerthroweth such courtiers diliuer vs from the like, and raise vs vp some godlic <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to fauour the common-wealth &amp; religion, as he did. The miscrable end of <hi>Absalon, Haman,</hi> and such as we haue seene in our dayes, maketh wise men to take heede how they liue and behaue them selues in the courte: for none is so high, but by like offending of
<pb facs="tcp:14649:8"/>
God, they maie haue as great a fall. As this toucheth not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest sorte of courtiers, so the good ones will not be offended, and those that be guiltie, God graunte them to amend it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>And they said.</hi> After that Nehemiah had of good will towards his people &amp; countrie, so diligenlie inquired how they did, and in what case they were: <hi>Chanani</hi> and the other Iewes that came with him, declard in what miserable case the people were, <hi>in hatred &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised of all people about them, &amp; that Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their citie, where God was cheifly worshiped, lay waste, &amp; burned, &amp; vnbuilt.</hi> Thus God bringeth goodmen togither one to comfort another, &amp; things are not ruled by chance: for both Nehemiah &amp; these Iewes lamented the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable state of their people and countrie, and by their talke God prouided a remedy. Nehemiah was in good state to liue, &amp; in great fauour whith the King, and needed not to trouble him selfe with the cares of his countrie, if God had not otherwise mooued his mind to pitie, with talking with his countrie men. This good then courtiers, lawiers, and great men may haue by talking with poore suters, that if there be anie sparke of grace in them they wilbe mooued with the lamentable complainte of poore suters. Surely thou that art in authoritie, or hast learning, oughtest to thinke, that the poore suter commeth not to the by chaunce: but the same God, that gaue thee thy authorite and learning, hath sent this poore man to thee to be releiued by thee. Looke therfore vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, heare him, as Salomon teacheth, saying: <hi>the good man heae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the cause of the poore.</hi> Hide not thy selfe from him, consider his <note place="margin">Prouer. 29.</note> complainte, pitie and help him, and not so much for monie, as for charities sake, for so did good Nehemiah. What can be a greater greife to an honest hart, then to haue all things that he doeth or saith, be they neuer so good, to be taken in ill parte, to be hated &amp; ill spoken ofby all his neighbours, to be slaundered and beelied, &amp; to haue displeasure where none is deserued. In this case were the miserable Iewes, then the beloued people of God, though now iustlie cast of, for their wicked hate to our Christ, the Sonne of the liuing God. Beside that, <hi>their Citie was burned, the gates stood open,</hi> that enemies might rush in, murther, and spoile them when they list, except they should keepe a continuall greate watch, which was to trouble some and costlie for them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>And it came to passe.</hi> What good commeth by hearing poore men speake, appeareth heere plainlie in them that feare God. For that pitiful state, which he vnderstood his brethren the Iewes, and that famous Citie <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to be in, by their reporte, did so
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14649:8"/>
mooue his hart and greiue him, that <hi>he satte downe, and wept certaine daies, was sad for them, fasted, and praied vnto the Lord of heauen for them.</hi> Hearing and seeing bee tow sences, which bring into the minde of man, to consider all things that be painefull or pleasant to others: for except we see them, or heare them, we cannot learne or vnderstand them, much lesse pitie them, or be glad of them. S. Paul saith likewise in Gods cause. <hi>Faith commeth by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:</hi> For when thou hearest the preacher declare the glorious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> of God, his sharpe punishing of sinne, the wretched estate of man, that of him selfe can doe nothing but sinne, and the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting paines appointed for all hardharted sinners, it maketh him to quake, to enter into him-selfe, condemne him-selfe, aske for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, &amp; from thenceforth to become a new man: so when he heareth Gods great mercie declared to man in Christ, it maketh him to beleeue, loue, obeie, and follow so louing a father. This profit then commeth by hearing the poore mans complainte, that it mooueth them to pitie, to teares, to fasting, and praying the Lord to releeue the miserie of thy oppressed brother. Turne not therefore thy face from the poore, but heare them, and pitie them, as thou woldst be heard and pitied thy selfe. So in religion, if thou wilt learne to feare God aright, to know thy selfe, amend thy life, and what blessing God hath prepared for thee, run not from the Church, as many doe, some for one cause, some sor another, but none for good: but humble thy selfe in the sight of thy God and his people, heare his worde reuerentlie, beleeue it stedfastly, obey it diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, praie earnestlie, and God shal heape his blessings on the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifullie. And that we may the better vnderstand how this mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable case of his breethren &amp; countrie did touch his hart inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he sheweth it by his behauiour outwardly: for the affections of the minde declare them-selues openlie in the face and behauiour of man, when they growe great in the hart. As if we be sorie, our countenance is heauie, sad, and clowdie: if we be merry, our face hath a good culloure, &amp; sheweth it selfe pleasantlie: when we be ashamed of ill doing, we blush: in feare we be pale, in anger high culloured and swolne in the face, &amp;c. So this sorow for his bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren did so pinch him at the hart, that he could not stand, but sat downe, as a mans leggs in heauines are so weake, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beare him: his hart was so burdened, that he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare, but brast out into teares: for certaine daies he could not be merry, eate nor drinke, but fasted, and in the end found no other remedie, but turned him-selfe vnto the Lord, fell vnto praier, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
<pb facs="tcp:14649:9"/>
him-selfe that God would heare him, and releeue them in his due time, when he thought good. By this we may learne how coldelie they praie, that cannot bend nor kneele, when they speake to the Lord or if they kneele, it is but on the one knee, &amp; that must haue a soft quishion vnder it, and a softer vnder his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boe. Weepe he may not, for disfiguring his face: fasting is thought hipocrisie and a shame: and when his panche is full, then as priests with their drunken nowles said mattins and belked out, <hi>Eructauit cor meum verbum bonum,</hi> with good deuotion, as they thought, so he blusters out a fewe blustring words, without due considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, &amp; then he thinketh he hath praied well. O wretched man, that forgettest thy God and thy selfe. Remember what thou art, alumpe of carth, a sinke of sinne, wormes meate: and that bellie which thou carest so much for, is but a stinking dunghill. Downe proud pecocke, consider when thou praicst, that thou speakest to the Lord of heauen &amp; earth, at whose beck the deuiles doe trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his thunderbolts flie abroad to punish thy sinne: who in his anger <hi>drowned the whole world, except eight personnes, burned Sodom and Gomorah with fire &amp; brimstone from heauen,</hi> to pull downe thy <note place="margin">Gen. 7. &amp;19.</note> proud hart, and teach thee to feare his maiestie. Learne of the poore Publicane, which was so ashamed of his wicked life, that he durst not looke vp vnto heauen, but condemning him selfe, cried <hi>O God be mercifull vnto me a sinner:</hi> whereas the proud Pharisie stood stoutlie, craking of his holynes, as thou doest. Learne of the <note place="margin">Luc. 18.</note> woman of <hi>Chanaan</hi> to be earnest in praier, goe not awaye from <note place="margin">Mat. 15.</note> the Lord, vntil thou feele thy conscience comforted, and mercie promised: for no doubt the Lord will heare such a praier. These out ward things, as kneeling, weeping, &amp; fasting, are good helps &amp; preparations vnto praier: as <hi>Sara</hi> continued three daies in fasting and praier, that the Lord wold deliuer her from that shame: and so <note place="margin">Tob. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Tobie</hi> marketh a generall rule ofit, saying, <hi>praier is good, ioinedwith fasting.</hi> Ecclesiasticus saith. <hi>The praier of him that humbleth him selfe, pearceth the cloudes, &amp; she will not be comforted, vntill she come nigh, nor <note place="margin">Eccles. 35.</note> goe her waie, till the highest God haue respect vntoher.</hi> God graunt vs here to learne to pitie our poore breethren, &amp; thus to prepare our selues to praie for them, that our praier maie be heard in their need. &amp; although I noted afore the disordred life of some leud courtiers, which make so much of their painted sheath, esteeme them-selues more then all the world doth besides, and when they thinke they deale so cunninglie, that they be not seene, manie one espieth them, &amp; laughes full drilie in their sleeues at them: yet now
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14649:9"/>

                  <p>AS a man that is earnestly bent to praier, hath commonly these outward things ioined with all, that were spoken of afore, as sitting, or kneeling, weeping, a greeued minde, sad countenance, fasting and abstinence: so necessarilie he muste haue a charitable minde and pitiful towards his breethren, and an earnest and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie faith towards God: which bothe appeare in Nehemiah: for without these tow his praier cannnot be heard. His louing mind towards his breethren appeareth, in that he leauing all other pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes, so diligentlie <hi>inquireth of their estate, and their countrie, and</hi> disdaineth not to heare them: but it is seene more euidently, when <hi>he weepeth and mourneth, fasteth and forbeareth dainties,</hi> as though he were in miserie with them: but speciallie, when he taketh so great paines and trauaile to doe them good, as appeareth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after throughout this booke. His earnest faith appeareth, in that <hi>he praieth,</hi> and that onelie <hi>to the GOD of heauen,</hi> and with such vehement and meete words, as doe declare his full minde, that he doubted not, but God both could, and would help them. In trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble no man asketh help but ofhim, whom he thinketh will doe him good: And because there is none so merciful to heare, and so willing to help, as god him-selfe is, in al our greifes we must turne vnto the Lord of heauen alone: for other saynte there is none that <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> wil help, or can help. The Apostle saith, that <hi>he which wil come to the Lord, must not onely beleeue that there is a God, but also, that he is a rewarder of them that seake him.</hi> This faith therefore let vs bring with vs when we praie. This faith did continue in Nehemiah, though he had liued so manie yeares amongst the vnbeleeuing Persians: which was a special gift of God to him in such trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some times. In praier let vs aske onely such thinges, as may stand with Gods good pleasure.

For although thou dwellest in thy highe and holie place in heauen, yet thou lookest downe into the earth, to heare the sighing of the poore, and deliuer the oppressed: and though thou be greate and feareful in all thy workes, yet I know thou art great in mercie and rich in goodnes. For although thou hast punished sharplie, yet thou sauest more mercifully. Adam was cast out of Paradice in iustice, &amp; yet had mercy offered vnto him in great plenty.

When we run from thee, thou callest vs againe, and not destroying vs sodenly, tariest for our amendement. When we hate thee, and become thy open enemies, thou remembring thy promise made to Abraham, Dauid, and our fathers, seekest by all meanes to bring vs home againe to thee: though we be vnfaithful, thou art true: though we forget thee, thou remembrest vs. Though we deserue to be cast away from thee without al hope of redemption, yet when thou fatherlie correctest vs, in the midst of thine anger thou rememberest thy mercie, and receiuest vs againe to thee. We graunt, O Lord, that we doe not loue thee, nor keepe thy commaundements as we ought, yet Lord thou that art loue and charitie it selfe, and louest all things that thou hast made, and in thy deare sonne Christ Iesus doest imbrace vs, not looking at our deserts, but at his worthines, who hath fulfilled the lawe for vs, and made vs partakers of thy rightcous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: Lord God heare vs, and haue pitie on vs. O thou Lord God of all mercie, which neuer didst cast anie awaie that fled vnto thee, open they eares, &amp; heare the praiers of me thy humble suter: shal I be the first whom thou wilt not heare?

Our citie lieth waste, the walles vnbuilt, our enemies rush in on euerie side, and we are a laughing stocke vnto them: thou heardst the crying of <hi>Agar</hi> being cast out of her house, thou lookedst at the oppression of Egipt, thou pitiedst the woful sighing of <hi>Anna:</hi> &amp; when thy people were oppressed of any enemies round about them, thou raisedst vp one Iudge or other to deliuer them. Consider, O Lord, I beseech thee, our woful state: we are spoiled on euerie side: marke and hearken to the praier, which I thy poore seruante make vnto thee, which seest al secrets this day, continually crying night &amp; daie with a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple &amp; vnfeined hart, not for mine owne selfe, whom thou hast so well placed in the courte, with plentie of all things, but for my breethren the children of Israel thy seruants, the ofspring of thy deerbeloued <hi>Iacob,</hi> which be in great heauines. While they be in miserie, I cannot be merrie. Their greife is my sorow, and their welfare is my reioysing. I graunt O Lord we haue gricuouslie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended thee: yet haue we not cast thee of, nor forsaken thee to be our Lord: we be thy seruants, though vnthristy, vnthankful, &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, &amp; thou art a God rich in mercie, to all that turne vnto thee. I confesse, O gratious God, that the children of Israell haue sinned against thee, yea not onely they, O Lord, but I &amp; my fathers house haue haynouslie broken thy commaundements, and yet we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire not to obtaine thy fauour againe, as children that haue offended their louing father. There is none of vs free, we plead mercie and not iustice, we stand not in defence of our doings, but yeald your selues into thy merciful hands. While thou giuest vs a hart to praie, we continually beleeue thou wiit heare vs in the end. O Lord correct thou vs after thine owne good will and pleasure, but giue vs not vp to the lust of thy enemies, which blaspheme thee, saying; their God hath forsaken them, their God cannot nor will not help them: they hate vs, not so much for our owne sinnes, as for that we be called thy seruants. O Lord let not thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie name be ill spoken of through our wickednes, rise and defend thine owne cause, cast not awaie thy seruants in thy heauie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure. What vantage canst thou haue in giuing vs ouer to thy foes? they shall laugh when we shall weepe, they will slaunder thy goodnes for our forgetfulnes of thee.

No lawes could rule vs, no saying compell, nor correction could staie vs, but wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie we followed our owne phantasies. There is nothing, o Lord, that thou canst laie to our charge, but we willinglie and franklie confesse our selues guiltie thereof: for we haue neither kept thy commaundements, which thou gauest vs by Moses thy seruant, wherein priuatlie we might learne how to direct our liues, both towardes the our God, and also toward all men: Nor the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Sacraments &amp; sacrifices, which thou appointedst vs to keepe in thy Religion, and in them to worship the, we haue not duelie regarded and kept, but cast them awaie, and followed the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heathen people about vs, and such as we deuised our selues: Our Priestes and Prophets haue taught vs lies and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of their owne heades, yet haue we beene more readie to heare, beleeue, and follow them, then thy holie will and word, declared vnto vs in thy Booke oflife.

                     <p n="6">6. And the king said to me, the Queene sitting by him, how long will thy Iourney be? and when wilt thou returne? And it was thought good in the kings sight: and he sent me: and I appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him a certaine time.</p>

                  <p>THe moneth <hi>Nisan</hi> as it is called in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew here, is the first Moneth of the yeare as the scripture vseth to recken, and answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vnto our <hi>March:</hi> beginning at the first chaunge of the Moone after the 12. day of <hi>March,</hi> when the daies and nights are both of one length. And although manie doubt who this <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was, I take it certen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be him that was called <hi>Longimanus,</hi> long hand, because the one hand was longer then the other: as <hi>Edward the first</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Long-shanks</hi> because of his long leggs. I loue not to fil vp bookes with mouing doubt vnto the vnlearned, for whose cause speciallie I write: &amp; namely such doubts as be harder in searching, then profitable in vnderstanding. The learneder sorte, that list to trie their wits, may search many mens writings and see diuers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: but a most apparant truth simply told, is best for the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Yet in the 4. Cha. of Ezra I haue fully enough opened the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I think after good consideration wilbe best liked of most men. Among many thinges which prooue the good disposition of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> these certaine times that he appointeth of his doing most cleerely declare the same. In the 9. moneth <hi>Nouember,</hi> in the latter end of the yeare, reckning the yeare by the course of the Sun he receiued these heauie newes of the misery of his people and countrie. And in the first moneth of the yeare following (yet both these moneths fell in the 20. yeare of the king <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>) God gaue him this occasion to speak for the releife of them to the king.</p>
                  <p>It oft falleth out that the latter end of the yeare by the course of the Sunne, is the beginning of the yeare by the reigne of the king. As our gratious Q. Elizabeth began her happy reigne in <hi>Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> yet <hi>March</hi> in the yeare following is parte of the same yeare of her reigne, that <hi>Nouember</hi> was in the beginning. Al this while (4. moneths at the least) from <hi>Nouember</hi> to <hi>March</hi> was <hi>Nehemiah sad, weeping, fasting, praying,</hi> &amp; seeking some good occasion, to seeke to the king for the releefe of his country. After this sorte wil good men commend their sutes vnto Princes, first by weeping, fasting &amp; praying vnto God, because they know the Princes heart to be in gods hand to dispose and turne, as he thinketh good: but the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked worldlings that haue not God afore their eyes, nor thinke not God to rule the world and Princes to, seeke cleane contrary wayes, and by rewardes, by him and by her, by flattering and dissembling make their way and breake their sutes vnto Princes.

But because euery one cannot haue accesse to speak vnto the king, &amp; breake his sute him selfe, nor it is not fit that it should so be, it is not amysse to vse the meanes of some good man about the prince to open the sute vnto him symply in the feare of God, committing the successe thereof by earnest prayer, to Gods goodwill and pleasure. And better it shalbe for them thus symply to walke in the feare of god, &amp; to faile in the sute, then by lying, flattery, or briberie, to obtaine it. A hard lesson for Courtiers to follow, but a most true and godly waie.

Not by chaunce (for so nothing falleth out) but by gods greate prouidence, the king had wyne afore him, was drie, and called for drinke. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> also, as God had appointed, stood by, and as his office required, being his cupbearer, toke vp the cup, tasted, and gaue it to the king to drinke, looking verie sadly, whichhe was not wonte, and Princes loue not to haue anie to do so about them: Vppon this sadde looke falleth out all the matter, which otherwaies he durst not open. The king demaundeth <hi>what maketh him so sad: Nehemiah</hi> openeth his griefe: the king asketh, <hi>what he would haue. Nehemiah</hi> maketh his petition: the king graunteth it, and sendeth him tobuilde <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> and giueth him liberally things necessarie, to the doingof it.

Thus of smale occasions God worketh great things, that we may know that he ruleth all things, be they neuer so smale in mans sight. But among many great tokens of Gods prouidence and good wil toward <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi> none is greater, then that he being a prisoner, a straunger borne, and one not of their religion, seruing Idols, but worshiping the true lyuing God, should be called to such a place of credit and worshipp, <hi>to be the kings cupbearer</hi> and taster. None vseth to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to such offices of trust, but such as be thought to be of great honestie, truth and fidelitie. No doubt many of the Persians desy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that office, and disdained that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> a straunger should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy an office of that credit, &amp; authoritie, where he might haue free accesse to the king, and take occasion to moue his sute for himselfe or his friende. Yet this is Gods accustomed goodnes, that when his people be in trouble, he always prouideth some to be about the prince, which both may and will help to defend them. In this long captiuitie, vnder <hi>king Darius</hi> was <hi>Daniel</hi> &amp; his fellowes in great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie with the king: vnder king <hi>Assuerus</hi> were <hi>Ester</hi> &amp; <hi>Mardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,</hi> vnder king <hi>Cyrus</hi> were <hi>Ezra, Zorobabel,</hi> &amp; others: vnder <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi> was <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in great fauour: wich al being Iewes borne, did wonderfully relieue &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort the oppressed people in this great extremitie vnder heathen kings. A strange worke of God, to cause heathen Princes to fauour and defend the religion that they knew not, and to defend that people which their subiects hated. But such a louing lord is our God to vs, that though he punish his owne people sharplie for a tyme, yet he casteth them not away for euer: and if he lay on heauy loade, yet he giueth them strength to beare it. Here may be mooued a harde question on these mens doings, <hi>whither it be lawfull now for a Christian man to serue a heathen Prince or no, as they did then:</hi> let the case stande as it doeth here, and it is easy to answere.

The scripture teacheth no such thing, but all faithfulnes, duetie, and obedience toward all men, so far as we offend not God. But in these dayes, if anie should leaue the companie of Christian people willinglie, and goe serue an infidel king for vantage sake, that were il done, &amp; differeth farre from the case of these good people, and maie not be done, except it were to goe and preach.

Some would rather haue chidd him, and bid him goe out of the Kings presence: (For, Princes maie not haue any occasion of heauines shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, but all deuises that can be to make them mery) yet God would by this means moue the Kings heart to pitie his man, and by graunting his sute, comforte his heauy heart. The King belike was a wise man: for by a heauie countenaunce, he could perceiue the heauines of his heart. A good kinde of reasoning, and seldome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true.

Many thoughts and suspitions rise in good mens hearts, as wel as ill mens, and cast them into great feare: for euery man is subiect to affection of his owne nature. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> might feare lest the king had heard some accusation against him, or had taken some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure with him, or would not graunt his request, or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would hinder his sute, or might lose his office, &amp;c. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no marueil if he were sore afraid: but a strong faith will boldly passe through all such cares, and trusting in God, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his good purpose. <hi>The troubles of the righteous be many,</hi> saith <note place="margin">Psal. 34.</note> Dauid, <hi>but the Lord will deliuer him out of them all.</hi>

For the King will thinke him tosaucie, &amp; the subiect will forget his duety. And to be ouerstrange and afraid, will cause the King to thinke him to be of an ill nature, and not bearing a good heart towards him. Therefore <hi>Nehemtah</hi> not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold with his Prince, with most humble obeysaunce <hi>wisheth the king good life,</hi> as the common phrase of the scripture vseth to speake, &amp; plainly telleth the true cause of his sorow and sad countenance. Here we may learne the duetie of Christians, that liue vnder hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Princes: That is, they may not onely serue them, but ought humbly to obey &amp; reuerence them. For surely this kinde of salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Nehemiah, to pray for the kings life,</hi> was not holy-water of the court from the teeth outward, <hi>Saluta libenter:</hi> but from an vnfeyned heart desiring it. S. Paul who liued vnder Th'emperour <hi>Nero,</hi> as wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a man as euer the earth bare, biddeth to <hi>pray for all kings &amp; them that be in authoritie</hi> (which then were all infidels) <hi>that vnder them we may liue a quiet life with godlines &amp; honestie.</hi> And if thou thinkest such ill men ar not to be praied for, yet for the quietnes of gods Church
<pb facs="tcp:14649:18"/>
thou must pray for them, that God would so rule their hearts, <hi>that vnder them we may liue a peaceable and godlie life.</hi> For that is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that Saint Paul yealdeth, though such wicked men will not learne their owne saluation them-selues. After that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had thus dutifullie behaued him-selfe to the king, so that there could be thought no iust cause of any euil suspicion in him toward the king, then he boldly declareth the cause of his sadnes, and saith, <hi>the Citie where his fathers lay buried lay waste, &amp; the gates were burned.</hi> And is this so greate a cause why <hi>Nehemiah</hi> should be so sad, weepe, faste, and pray so long? had he not seene nor heard of greater Cities and countries then it was, which were destroyed as miserably as it was? <hi>Babylon,</hi> which was much bigger then Ierusalem, was conquered not long afore by <hi>Cyrus: Samaria</hi> their neighbour by <hi>Senacharib, and Salmanasser, &amp;c.</hi> But this Citie had a greater cause to belamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for, then others. For it was taken from wicked men by gods mightie hand, &amp; giuen to gods people. It was increased with many benefites from God, beautified with religion, Priests, a Temple to worship the liuing God in: strengthned by manie worthie Princes and lawes, and was a wonder of the world. It was <hi>the holy Citie,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was dedicated to the Lords seruice: though the people were euill that dwelt in it, and misused it. The gospel saith, <hi>the Deuill tempting Christ our sauiour, tooke him into the holy Citie, &amp; set him on a</hi>

                     <hi>pinacle of the temple:</hi> and Christ our lord foreseeing the destruction of <note place="margin">Luke. 19.</note> it to be at hand, wept for it. This was then the cause of <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> sorrowe, that God was dishonoured, for that this Citie, which was dedicated to his name, and giuen to his people to serue him in, was now defaced, by heathen Princes, his religion decayed, &amp; people subiect to straungers. Azelous man cannot abide anything with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great griefe, that seemeth to deface the glorie of his God. But if these causes were not, yet the natural loue to his countrie had beene sufficient to moue him to teares. For as it is a pitifull sight, to see a Prince or Noble man to be cast from his dignitie, to be spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of his honour, landes, and goods, and become a carter, and driue the plowe, or lie tyed in prison: so surelie, it must needes moue any heathen man, to see the Citie, where he and his elders were borne and buried, to be ouerthrowne, lie open to all enemies, vnfenced with walles or gates, and be inhabited with a few cotte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and no better then the poorest ragged hamlet in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: much more <hi>Nehemiah</hi> must needs be touched for this citie, wich was so famous through out the world. There may be good reasons alledged beside these, why he should weepe for his

Citie and countrie, as, because it was a great reliefe and succour, in all needes, to all that liued in it, from time to time, and a greate strength to the countrie about it. But what is that, <hi>to be sad for the place where his elders were buried?</hi> Is there any holynes in the ground that it is better to be buried there, then els where? Or the deade men aniething the worsse, if they be pulled out of their graues? What is the cause? In deed it was called holie, in diuers places of the Scriptures, as other outward things be, that are appointed and consecrated to a holie vse. S. Mathew sayeth, that <hi>diuers dead bodies</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Chap. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>after the resurrection of our Lord and Master Christ Iesus, rose out of their graues, came into the holie Citie, and appeered to many.</hi> This holines came not by holie-water casting or hallowing of popish Bishopps which halowed Church or Church yeard, but by gods appointing, &amp; choosing it for his dwelling place, where he would be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, as the Psal. teacheth, <hi>The Lord hath chosen Sion, he hath chosen it</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psaline 132.</note> 
                     <hi>for adwelling place for him-selfe: this is my resting place for euer, heere will I dwell, because I haue chosen it.</hi> So on gods behalfe and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it for a place, where he would be worshipped, it was holie, though the wickednes of the people had defiled it, and iustlie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured gods anger to destroy it. Christ Iesus our Lord finding his temple ful of all vsurers, buiers and sellers, gata whip, and draue them out, saying, <hi>my house is a house of praier, but ye haue made it a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>denne of theeues.</hi> So by Gods appointing, it was <hi>a house of prayer,</hi> and by mans misusing of it, <hi>a denne of theeues.</hi> And he seeing the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes of the people in it, wept for it, and said, <hi>Ierusalem, which kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest the Prophetes, and stonest to death them which are sent to thee, how oft would I haue gathered thee, as the henne doeth her chickens vnder her</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>wings, and thou wouldst not.</hi> The Prophets of old time, for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes of the people in it, haue likewise rebuked Ierusalem sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie times, <hi>How is this faithful Citie, which was ful of iustice, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi>

                     <hi>an harlot?</hi> And againe, <hi>heare thou harlot,</hi> speaking to Ierusalem. Thus one thing, by Gods appointing it to a holie vse, may be called <note place="margin">Ezec. 16.</note> holie: and by mans misusing of it, become most vnholie. But the place it selfe maketh nothing holie, as it is written: <hi>God chose not the man for the place sake, but the place for mans sake:</hi> and therefore this Citie did not make the dead men holie that were buried in it, nor anie thing the worsse, if they were buried out of it. Therefore the papists are both wicked, in teaching the people that one place is more holie then another, to be buried in: as in the Church, rather then in the Churchyeard, &amp; neere the high altar, rather then in the body of the Church: and they are theeues also, in picking poore
<pb facs="tcp:14649:19"/>
mens purses for the same. In these were many abuses, as in any one thing. But he that wil keepe these three rules, shall not erre. First, <hi>That he doe not cast out the dead bodies vnburied, to be deuoured of wilde beasts, nor burie them in dunghils, ditches, or such like places, where none else is buried.</hi> Diogenes, when his friends asked him, <hi>How he wolud be buried,</hi> bad them <hi>cast him out, it skilleth not how. Why?</hi> saie they, <hi>the beasts will deuour thee. Nay then,</hi> saieth hee, <hi>lay my stafe by me, and I shall driue them awaie.</hi> A barbarous saying, and meete for a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then man. Yet I thinke the laying of the <hi>metyarde</hi> in the graue with the dead man, came vp on some such like cause, or else to driue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way deuils. Socrates, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was asked the like question, answered more honestly, and bad <hi>burie him so, as were moste easyfor his friends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second is, <hi>to auoid great cost &amp; sumptuousnes, as Shrines, Tombes Tapers, Torches, Candles, mourning-coates, feastings,</hi> &amp;c. which do no good to the dead, &amp; are to chargeable &amp; vnprofitable to their friends. Yet if Ciuil pollicy adde some solemnitie to Princes &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, as their coate Armoure, flagge, sword, heade-peece, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognisaunce, I dare not vtterly condemne it, and yet would wish it more moderatly vsed, then many times it is. As there was difference in them, while they liued, from the common sorte &amp; state, so there may be in their burialls, for polliciessake, but for no religion or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines at al. The third thing to be obserued is, <hi>that no superstition should be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted in them:</hi> wherein the Papists infinitelie offend. As in mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, diriges, trentalls, singing, ringing, holi- water, halowed places, yeares, daies, &amp; moneth, mindes, crosses, pardon-letters to be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, mourners, <hi>de profundis,</hi> by euery lad that could saie it, dealing of money solemnlie for the dead, watching of the corps at home, bell and banner, with manie moe then I can reckon. These three abuses taken awaie, remaineth that comely order, which Christian charitie requireth: as to haue neighbours quietlie to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie the corps to the graue, as it was in <hi>the poore widowes sonne of Naim.</hi> Brotherlie to comfort those that lost their friends, as the <note place="margin">Iuc. 7.</note> Iewes did <hi>Marie &amp; Martha,</hi> for their brother <hi>Lazarus:</hi> to confirme faith in the resurrection of the dead in the selfe same bodie, that <note place="margin">Ioan. 11.</note> there is put in the earth: to prepare them-selues to die daily, not knowing when our course shal come. To praise the Lord, that graunted the man so long a life among vs with honestie, and in the end gaue him a stedfast faith to seeke his saluation onelie in Christ Iesus, who hath conquered death, hel, &amp; sinne, by his owne death, and by his rising from death hath iustified vs, and will raise vs vp from the graue in the end, to liue with him in heauen without

end. The comely vsing ofthese in Gods Church, is a great comfort to all good Christians, and the want of them, a token of Gods wrath and plague. Abraham was promised <hi>burial in his ripe age,</hi> as a blessing from God: Iosias was promised, <hi>that he should be buried</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Tob. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>the dead bodies of his countrie men, that were cruellie slayne.</hi> Thus burial is commended, &amp; to want it was great reproofe. Ieremy threatneth <note place="margin">Icre. 8.</note> them, that for their wicked life <hi>they should be pulled out of their graues.</hi> The place of burial needeth no bishoppes blessing, nor Popish halowing, but euerie comelie place is holy enough, so it be reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for that vse onelie. It is called in the Greeke, <hi>Coimiterion,</hi> that is, a sleeping place, and in the hebrew, <hi>Beth-haiaim,</hi> that is the house of the liuing: thereby to teach vs, that the body sleepeth, &amp; the soules liue, as Salomon saith: <hi>the earth shal goe to the earth from whence it was, and the soule shal returne to him, that gaue it. Abraham bought a feeld to burie his in,</hi> and there was he and his posterity buried: and that was <note place="margin">Gett. 23. 15.</note> a common custome, continued long after by the iudges and kings of Iuda. So <hi>Gedeon,</hi> and generallie the rest were buried. It is said of King <hi>Osias, that he was buried in the feeld,</hi> where the other Kings afore <note place="margin">Iudg. 8.</note> him were buried in a place kept for that vse onelie. And the Gospel <note place="margin">2. Cro. 26.</note> teacheth, that <hi>with the money, which Iudas solde Christ our Lord for, they</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Matt. 27</note> 
                     <hi>bought the potters fielde to burie straungers in.</hi> These places were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times within Cities, &amp; some-times without, as <hi>Iesus Christ our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster was buried in a garden without the citie Ierusalem,</hi> and <hi>he met the</hi>

                     <hi>poore widow of Naim at the gates of the Citie, going farther to burie her sonne.</hi> It was long after, afore they vsed either Church or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeards. Like wise <hi>mourning for the dead</hi> would be bridled, that it be not to much, and seeme to grudge at Gods doings, in taking our friends from vs. <hi>Dauid wept for his childe and praied, whilest it was sick,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Sam. 12. Mat. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>but after it was dead, he wept no more.</hi> Our sauiour <hi>Christ cast the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strels and mourners both out of the dores, when he raised vp the young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in her fathers house.</hi> By which we are taught that we should not daunce with minstrels, (for that is to barbarous, &amp; against nature) nor to be greeued with the death ofour friends, nor desperatlie mourne with the heathen, as though there were no life after this.
<pb facs="tcp:14649:20"/>
                     <hi>I would not haue you ignorant,</hi> saith S. Paul, <hi>of them that sleepe in death, that ye mourne not, as they that haue no hope to rise againe.</hi> Sirach appointeth a reasonable time for reasonable mourning, saying, <hi>mourning for the dead is two or three dases,</hi> and before he addeth, <hi>or seauen daies at the most. The cost that is made for the dead, is rather</hi> as S. Aug. saith, <hi>ful wel a comfort for the liuing, then help for the dead.</hi> For sure it is comfortable to all good folke, to see our freind in his life-time to haue behaued him selfe so honestlie, that his neighbours beare him so good will after his death, that they will see him buried: and it strengthneth our faith of the resurrection, when the bodies are not cast away, as beastes bodies be. And although this generall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of comelynes be most true &amp; comfortable, yet many times the case falleth out so, that manie a good man cannot enioy this kinde of burial. In persecution many good martyrs haue bene deuoured of wylde beastes, many torne in peeces, &amp; hanged on gibbets, manie burned &amp; their ashes cast into the water; yet these good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the worsse for wanting their graue. For the kingdome of God standeth not in outward things, but in true faith in God by Christ. For as it profiteth not an euil ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any thing at al to be solemnly buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: so it hurteth not a good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to want it in these cases, if he cannot <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note> get it. <hi>Euerie one shal receiue then, as he hath done in his life,</hi> &amp; not after his death, nor his costlie burial. We read of <hi>the rich glutton, that he was buried</hi> &amp; no doubt costlie, as all his life was gorgious, but poore <note place="margin">Luc. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>Lazarus</hi> gatt little cost at his death, that could finde so little mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in his life: yet <hi>was the glutton in hell,</hi> for al his pompe: <hi>and poore La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus in Abrahams bosome in ioy.</hi> But among all other foolishnes in Poperie, I cannot but marueile at this, that in their great solemne <note place="margin">Ier. Epi. 30.</note> singing for the dead, they would not vse, but forbid, <hi>Alleluyia,</hi> to be songe. If the Romish Church be the true Church, and all well that they commaund, why should the late Synagogue of Roome deface that, which the best Bishoppes of Roome alowed of? I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom writeth in his 30. Epistle called <hi>Epitaphium Fabiolae,</hi> that <hi>at the buriall of that noble woman, the people of Roome were gathered to the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne funerall, and there the Psalmes did sound aloud, and Alleluyia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with his Eccho on high, did shake the gylded seelings of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. On one side a company of yong men, on another side were old men, which songe forth the prayses and deedes of that good woman. And no marueile said he, if men reioyce ofhir saluation, of whose conuersion the Angels in heauen were glad.</hi> The like is written in the 27. Epistle ad Eusto chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um for her mother <hi>Paula.</hi> In this I note the olde Church of Roome that at such solemne sunerals, they sang <hi>Alleluyia on high,</hi> as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14649:20"/>
doe now on Easter day. Then they praysed god for the dead, for so <hi>Alleluya</hi> signifieth, and now they pray god for the dead, to get money with-all. Then they reioyced of their saluation, &amp; now they weepe for feare of the Popes purgatory. <hi>Blessed are thoy that dio in the lord,</hi> saith Saint Iohn. Why? then they goe not from paines here to miserie there. Why should the new Romish Synagogue mislike that good ancient order? the one of them must needs erre, which manie thinke cannot be, and specially in this our age. There be other controuersies in these our dayes abroad, which might haue beene verie well left vntouched, if the quietnes of Gods Church had bene dutifullie sought, as it ought to be. <hi>As whither the ministers should burie the dead as the common order appointeth:</hi> and <hi>whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther burial-sermons are to be suffered and vsed?</hi> &amp;c. This place giueth no great occasion to intreat of such matters, and therefore I shall let them passe. I loue not contention, but doe earnestlie require e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one in his calling for Gods cause, to seeke peace with all their might, &amp; those that professe Iesus Christ, I desire the Lord that they would ioyne with their Breethren in pulling downe the Romish Antechrist, the common enemy of all Gods doctrine and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, leauing such vnprofitable contentions which breede deuision. And if they haue to many burial sermons in the citie, God graunt vs some moe in the countrie. Thus much haue I spoken by occasion of <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> mourning for the <hi>place of his fathers burial:</hi> not for the losse of the houses, Citie, or walles, or that he was troubled with such superstitious opinions of thinking any holynes in the place, or that the dead folke weare any thing worsse in wanting their coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the earth, but that he was greeued to see the Citie, which God chose him selfe, to be worshiped in, and those good men, whose bones did rest there, or had faithfullie serued the Lord in their life, now to be giuen to heathen mens hands, Gods Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion neglected, the state of the common-wealth and good lawes ouerthrowne, Gods enemies to triumph ouer them, as though their god could not, or would not restore them. This shouldgreeue all Christians in all ages, when they see the glory of the liuing God any waies blemished. God graunt vs this zeale vnfeynedlie.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>And the King sayd:</hi> After that the King vnderstood the cause, of his sorowe and sadde countenance, he both pitied the case, and his mans heuie heart: and God so mooued the King to fauour his sute, that he asked him, <hi>what he wonld haue?</hi> When <hi>Nehemiah</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the kings good inclination towards him, &amp; his sute, afore he would declare his petition, he turned him vnto the God of heauen,
<pb facs="tcp:14649:21"/>
&amp; praied him that he would so guide his tongue, that he should speake nothing, which might iustlie offend the king, &amp; also that he would so moue the Kings heart, that his request might be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. A worthie example for all Christians to follow in their sutes making to the Prince. He goeth not to anie great man, nor to anie other which was in fauour with the king, to desire him to speake for him, to commend his cause, to perswade the King to graunt his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest: which he might lawfullie haue done. Also he offereth no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, nor like pleasure to any man, but turneth him to the God of heauen as the cheifest gouernour of all goodnes: which setteth vp rulers, &amp; putteth downe Kings, and is King of Kings, and praieth him to prosper his sute. He praieth to no Idols nor saintes, though he liued among that Idolotrous nation: for he knew they could not help him, but faithfully called on the liuing God, which his good fathers had worshiped of olde time. This prayer was not so much in speaking or kneeling, but a lifting vp of his minde towards God and desiring him to further his sute. <hi>Anna</hi> made like prayer, when <hi>she powred out her sorow before the Lord, mouing her lippes, but speaking</hi>

For it falleth out oft, that in great sorow a man cannot let a teare fall, the heart being oppressed with griefe, and yet he at another time will weepe tenderlie: So in prayer oft times, the more earnestlie that a man prayeth, the lesse he can speake, his heart being so earnestlie giuen to call on the Lord. As when Moses was in great heauines, and prayed for the children of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, being in that great distresse, God sayd vnto him, <hi>why criest thou vnto me?</hi> and yet there is not one worde written, that he cried, or <note place="margin">

Let no man then excuse him selfe, &amp; say, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray, except he were in the Church, or in his Chamber alone: for in all places he may lift vp his minde to God, though he were in the market or Mountaine, and with hartie prayer, though he speake not at all, desire the Lord to heare him, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth here, in the presence of the King, and manie others: and no doubt if he pray in faith, and for such things as further the glorie of God, the Lord will heare him.

But God so mooued the Kings heart, that he had no suspition of any such enterprise by <hi>Nehemiah</hi> his faithfull and trustie seruant. With such modestie Princes would be dealt withal, and not roughly, nor vnreuerentlie: for so <hi>Nehemiah</hi> doeth here most dutifullie. Yf ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men had their choise at the Kings hand (now adaies) to aske what they would, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> might haue done here, would they not haue asked Castles, Lands, Offices, and authority for them and their issue, that they might haue bene great men in the world, and not the building of a Citie, which would haue bene a trouble and cost vnto them, rather then any profit, and when they had fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed it, it had not bene their owne, but other should haue enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and they little the better for it? But such is the zeale of them that loue the Lord, that they will seeke to build, and not to pull downe, as many doe, and will preferre all things that may further the glorie of God, though it be with their owne losse, rather then seeke their owne profitte with the hinderaunce of it. <hi>Terentius</hi> a noble-man, Captaine vnder the Emperour <hi>Valens,</hi>

Terentius</hi> being a zealous man in Religion, and perceiuing the greate herisie of the <hi>Arrians</hi> to be much fauored (and the Emperour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe being thought to be infected there-with) could not abide such blasphemie against <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> our Sauiour, put this suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in writing, and with most humble reuerence and earnest desire, required the Emperour <hi>to graunt him his request, &amp; he would think his seruice fully recompensed.</hi> The effect of his supplication was, <hi>that it would please th'emperour to graunt the true christians a Church to serue &amp; worship the Lord Iesus in, seperatlie from the Arrians, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured

God increase the number of such religious men about Princes, and then they will not gape so fast as they doe, to pluck and pull away from god and his ministers al that they may scratch or scrape to the dishonour of God, defacing of his glory, decay of the ministery, Religion, &amp; al good learning: thinking most highly of them-selues, that they be worthie to haue all things, where in deed they deserue least, and the more they get, the lesse ar they satisfied. It is a full contentation to all good men, when they see God glorified in his Church, word, and ministery: for then they know, if they dutifully seeke, that the Lord wil not see them lacke that which shalbe necessarie for them: and they wil content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with that portion, that God giueth them, and will not gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely seeke for other mens things wrongfully, to the dishonour of the high God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>And the king said.</hi> When the King had considered his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, he aduised him-selfe well, and was both lothe to deny him his sute, and also to forgoe so faithfull a seruante, asked him <hi>how long he would be absent, and when he would returne?</hi> So did the Queene to, which sat by the King, they both loued him so well, and would not haue him long from them. A speciall gift of God to see a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger borne, of that Religion and people which were hated of all the world, to be in such fauour with the king and Queene, and to finde such fauour and grace in their sight, that he gaue licence and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther necessary things to build that Citie, which had bene noysome to so many Kings about them. But such is the mercifull goodnes of our God, towards his Church and people, that he will make <note place="margin">Gen. 47.</note> straungers and their enemies to defende and help them: as <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh</hi>

It will make anie good nature afraid to speake to a King, but much more in the presence of so manie estates, who might be hinderers of his sute, and counsel the King to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. But when God will pitie his people and haue things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he will so mooue Kings harts that nothing shall hinder that he will haue done: and so the King did graunt him his request, gaue him leaueto goe build that Citie, and sent him away honorablie, and rewarded him liberallie, as followeth. <hi>Nehemiah appointed the King a time of his returne to him againe,</hi> but when, it is not here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: yet such a time as the King was content withal. In the last chapter of this booke it appeareth, that <hi>in the twelft yeare following Nehemiah returned vnto the King,</hi> &amp; yet gat licence againe to goe to Ierusalem. But whither this was the time that he appointed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, it is not written, and therefore vncertaine, and being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written, and vncertaine, it is not so necessarie to be knowne, nor curiouslie to be searched, but we maie content our-selues to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt of it, as of all vncertaine, vnwritten, and vnnecessarie trueths.</p>

                     <hi>NEhemiah</hi> was a glad man that the King had graunted his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, &amp; sleepeth not his purpose, nor letteth the time slip, but
<pb facs="tcp:14649:23"/>
with al diligence prepareth things necessarie for his iourney. And first because the iorney was long, and daungerous for enemies that hated him and all the Iewes, lest he should haue some displeasure done him by the way, he desyreth the King that his Counsell and Secretaries might giue him a passeporte, and graunt him men to conduct him safely into Iewry. A bolde request for so meane a subiect, being but <hi>the Kings cupbearer,</hi> a straunger, and borne of that people and countrie, which all the world hated. What could haue bene done more for the noblest man in the countrie, or for the best seruitour the King had? I cannot tell whither it is to be more marueiled at, that either he durst aske it, or that the King would graunt it. But <hi>Nehemiah</hi> perceiued Gods good will and the Kings fauour toward him, &amp; was bolde to aske: God prospered his sute that the king graunted his request. And as afore, so here marke also, that he doeth not boldly and rashly appoint the King what he should doe, but with all modesty referreth his request vnto the Kings wisdome and discretion, to graunt or deny, and sayth: <hi>if it be thought good to the King.</hi> Againe he doeth not with bribes or flattery procure the Kings letters to be signed priuily (as many doe, that make vnhonest sutes, and would not haue their matter debated by the wiser sorte, lest so it might be denied) but he requireth, <hi>that they which are appointed for that purpose,</hi> and doe such things by good aduise, as Chancellours and Secretaryes, <hi>might giue him letters to the Captaynes beyond the Riuer Euphrates</hi> (for that is ment by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, because it was more notable then any other Riuer in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and did deuide the Kingdome of Persia from other countries about it) ouer which into Iewry he might passe. It might be thought straunge to some, that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> here asketh not onely of the King his letters of passeporte, but also a number of souldyers to conduct him safely into Iewry. For <hi>Ezra</hi> when he had licence of <note place="margin">Ezra. 8.</note> the King to take the same iourney and buyld the temple, neither as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, nor had any to conduct him safely on his way, (though the daunger was as great then, and he was afraid as well as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was now.) why should <hi>Nehemiah</hi> aske now, seeing he serued and trusted in that same God, that <hi>Ezra</hi> did, and was as earnest and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in Religion as he was? why should this be lawfull or commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable in the one, and not in the other? Causes may be rendered di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. There was difference in the persons and times. <hi>Ezra</hi> was a Priest, cunning in the lawe, and had oft taught boldely afore the King and his nobles, how sure and safe they were from all daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that put their trust in God alone: and if he should haue after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14649:23"/>
bene afraid, he should haue seemed to haue spoken vntruly afore, and his God should not haue bene thought able or willing to defend his people that trusted in him. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was a courtier and in great fauor with the King, &amp; had not so openly and boldly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Gods prouidence and care towards his people as <hi>Ezra</hi> had (though he beleeued it as faithfully as the other did) and therefore might more boldly without reproche of his God, or his doctrine and saings, aske it. Yet this proueth not that Preachers may not at any tyme require a safe conduct of Princes, to whom it belongeth to prouide in daungerous times that passage by the hie way may be safe and quiet. <hi>Paul,</hi> as we reed, <hi>when the Iewes had sworne that they would neither eat nor drinke, vntil they had killed him, desyred an vnder</hi>

Againe in that great and long storme that <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; his fellowes were in on the sea, where they looked for nothing but to be drowned, the Angell of God <note place="margin">Act. 27.</note> tolde <hi>Paul, that god had giuen him the liues of all that were with him in the ship &amp; none of them should perish:</hi> yet afterward when the maryners would haue cunningly conueied them-selues out of the ship, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence to haue cast anker, <hi>Paul tolde the high Captaine, that if he suffered them to goe out of the ship, they should all perish:</hi> &amp; this he did not saie, as doubting of the Angels true message, nor of gods good will and mightie hand, able to deliuer them, but to teach vs that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though god haue made vs promisse of his mercy we may not tempt him, lie downe and sleepe carelesly, but diligently to looke for &amp; vse such helps &amp; meanes as god hath apointed vs to worke by: god worketh al goodnes in vs him selfe, &amp; yet hath appointed means for vs to vse &amp; doe such things the which we may in no case neglect, &amp; yet al praise is due to him, whatsoeuer we doe: for it is he that both ordeyneth the end of all things how they shal come to passe, and also the meanes how they shal be brought to passe, &amp; prospereth al them that forsaking them-selues vse such meanes &amp; hang on him knowing the beginning, middest, &amp; end to be ruled &amp; com to passe as he appointed. God inspired the Apostles with all knowledge of the scriptures sodenly, which were vnlearned &amp; neuer went to the schoole: yet male not we thinke, that we will be learned after the same sorte without studie and praier: for then we tempt God, refusing such helps as he hath appointed for vs to come to lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:14649:24"/>
by. And though we studie and pray neuer so much, yet we shal vnderstand nothing, vntil he giue vs his holy spirit, the school<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master of all trueth, to lighten our mindes, and giue vnderstanding of his holie will. We be like <hi>an axe in the carpenters hand,</hi> which though it be a good one, yet the praise of the good worke that is <note place="margin">Esa. 10.</note> done with it, is to be giuen to the man, and not to the axe. Such things be we in gods hand, by whom he worketh his will and glory (though not vnsensible, as dead things be, yet as vnable to worke any good thing without him, as the axe is without the carpenter.) for <hi>of our selues we are not able to thinke a good thought,</hi> as the Apostle saith, that all praise may be his, that blesseth and prospereth both vs <note place="margin">2. Corinth. 3.</note> and the meanes, that he hath appointed for vs to worke by, and bringeth it to a good end. We must thinke likewise of Gods doings and our selues in all other things, sinne except, that he worketh all in all, yet not without vs: that all maie saie with <hi>Dauid: Not vnto vs O Lord, not vnto vs, but vnto thy name giue all praise and glorie.</hi> Thus <note place="margin">

But this general rule being kept, that Gods glorie be not defaced by doing of it, it maie be done of all men at all times. <hi>Paul wrought for his liuing,</hi> when he preached, which others did not, nor are bound to doe: and he might haue liued of his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching as well as others did: yet the time was such, and the people so peeuishlie bent, to sclaunder the Gospel of God, that Paul for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare to vse that libertie which God gaue him, and would not be thought to preach for gaines, but wrought for his liuing, would not be chargeable to any man. Such was the case here, that <hi>Ezra</hi> might not aske help, and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> might.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>And letters also. Nehemiah</hi> wiselie considering what he wanted yet to the finishing of such a worke as he went about, perceiued he should neede timber, and therefore desired the Kings letters of warrantie to <hi>Asaph keeper of his woodes, that he might deliuer him such trees, and so manie, as would serue his purpose, both for the building of the gates, the towres of the Pallace, neere to the Temple, the Citie walles, and the house that he should dwel in him selfe.</hi> And here we shall see the King worthie great praise, though he was but barbarous, that for pollicies sake, and wealth of his countrie, both preserued his woods, and set a keeper ouer them, that they should not be wilfully wasted. A good example for Princes, to foresee the like in their countries in all ages: for common-wealths cannot stand without the vse of woods in manie kind of things. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> is also much
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14649:24"/>
to be commended, that although he was in so great authoritie and fauour with the King, yet he would not take of his woods without his licence and warrant, as manie doe. If these tow things were kept in this land, that both the Princes woods and others to should be preserued, faithful keepers set ouer them, and none deliuered without sufficient warrant, we should not finde the great lacke that we generally doe. What spoile hath bene made of woods in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce, wise men haue noted, but few gone about to amend it, though manie haue lamented it. What common dealing hath bene practised to get such lands of the Prince and other men as were well woodded into their hands, and when they had spoiled the woods, rackt the rents, &amp; deepely fined the tenants, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne the same land into the Princes hand againe, or sel it ouer to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and get as much, it is to well knowne throughout the Realme, and to the hurt of manie at this daie. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> could aske nothing so much, but the King did graunt it speedelie, God did so mooue the Kings heart and prospered <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> doings, in so much that he giueth all the praise to God alone, and saith, <hi>the hand of his God was good toward him, to set forward his good purpose of building Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. Nehemiah</hi> knew well that God was the common God of all people and nations, both by creation, and gouernement of them: but because he seemed to fauour him more then he did other, in giuing him boldnes to open his griefe vnto the king: wisdome to make his humble sute without offence vnto the King, and so good successe to haue all things graunted that he required of the King so vnlooked for, he calleth him <hi>his God,</hi> as if he loued or cared more for him, then for the rest of the world. This is the common vse of the Scripture to call him <hi>the God of Abraham, Isaac, Iacoh, Dauid, and Daniel,</hi> because he did both deliuer them out of such troubles, as none else could or would, or anie hath bene so oft and wonderfullie deliuered, as they were: and also did so blesse and prosper them and their doings, as the common sorte of men were not wont to be. So they that see their owne miserie, and how litle goodnes, but rather punishment they deserue at Gods hand, when they see the Lord pitie them, remember them, help them, and blesse them, they conceaue by and by such a loue toward God that it would please him to looke vpon them, that for ioy they burst out into teares, they call him their God, because they feele his good will and fauour so much toward them, and more then to other, yea much more then they could deserue, or be bolde to looke for at his hands. And as one man vseth to help
<pb facs="tcp:14649:25"/>
another, by putting forth his hand to raise him that is fallen, to giue him such things as he wanteth, and to put awaie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him from such things as may hurt him: so it is called the good hand ofGod, when he either bestoweth his blessing and good things vpon vs, or when he putteth away such daungers and euils from vs, as might hurt vs, as it were with his mightie and mercifull hand.</p>

Nehemiah</hi> hath now taken his leaue at the Court, and looseth no time, but when he had prouided all things necessarie for his iourney, he speedeth him selfe for ward and thinketh all time lost, that is not bestowed in releeuing his countrie being in such miserie. A straunge example to see a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier leaue that wealth, ease and authoritie that he was in &amp; go dwel so farr from the court, where commonly it falleth out that he which is out of sight is out of minde and sone forgotten, in an olde torne and decaied citie, a rude people, and poore countrie, where he should not liue quietly for his enemies, but take paines to build him selfe a house, and the Citie where he would dwell: to toyle and drudge, like a poore labouring man, that should worke for his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, yea and many times to be sore assaulted of his enemies, both openlie and priuilie, to the great daun ger of his life, as the rest of the booke following will declare.

                  <p>The king did not onelie deale thus liberallie with <hi>Nehemiah</hi> at his departure, but also honorably <hi>sent him away with captaines &amp; horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> safelie to conduct him on his iourney, that none should hurt him by the way. And where the king vsed him so courteouslie, no doubt the rest of the court shewed him much curtesy: for courtyers must needes like and mislike, whatsoeuer the King seemeth to like or mislike, to set vp or pull downe. Courtyers commonly, when the King speaketh, haue lost both sense and witte: for if the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14649:25"/>
King seemeth to fauour any thing, they all, as men without vnderstanding, saie it must needes be so. If the King will not giue eare to heare a matter, they are all deafe and cannot abide to heare speake of it: If the King will not see it, they all crie out, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie with it. So that it is hard to tell, whither is in more misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble case the king or such dissemblers: for if the King haue no iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him selfe, he shall haue no help of such, and they like witlesse men dare not speake a trueth. Happie is that Prince therefore, that hath wise counsellours about him, which will due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifullie enforme him of matters vprightlie, wiselie debate the matter with him, without all double dealing, as the other sorts doe.

But thus mercisullie doeth our Lord God deale with his Church and people, that in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie age he hath some about the Prince, that both can and will speake and be heard, though not for all generallie in their rage and persecution, yet for many, as occasion serueth, which shalbe deliuered from such tyranny, to glorifie their God for his mercy: though many willingly spend their liues patiently, to the praise of the same God eternallie. But no rage shalbe so greate to roote out Gods chosen, but the Lord will euer preserue a number, euen by help of their enemies openly to worship and serue him, in despite of all their foes.</p>

These two points may wel agree to the papists, and all enemies of gods trueth, for they will lurcke priuely vntill time serue them to shew their cruelty and then they will rage feirselie: and so wil slaues and seruants, <note place="margin">Prouerb. 30.</note> that come to authority fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> base degree. <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>there be three things that trouble the world,</hi> where of <hi>the first is a seruant, when he com meth to be a ruler:</hi> for then he waxeth so proud &amp; cruell, that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth what he was, he disdaineth al men but him self.

As the building of this <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had manie enemies, so the repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the heauenly <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by the preaching of the glorious Gospel of Christ Iesus hath manie moe. The malice and enuy of worldlings against all those that set vp the kingdome of Christ, and pull downe the pride of mans heart, is so great, that it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be satisfied. If malice had not blinded these men, what harme was it to them, to see the Iewes doe well, and God worshipped there. The <hi>Iews</hi> neuer went about to inuade or conquere their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and yet they could not enioy their owne countrie without much trouble of these enuyous people. Enuie euer disdaineth to see other doe wel, and specially such as liue well and serue the lord Christ, and is glad of other mens mischeif and harme: for then they thinke none shall be able to withstand their pleasures and deuises. The people of <hi>Canaan</hi> when they heard of <hi>Iosua</hi> and the <hi>Israelites</hi> comming with so great courrage to possesse their cou ntrie, were so dismaied, that <hi>their courage melted away like wax at the fire.

When our sauiour Christ was crucified and buried, his disciples were sad and the Iewes reioyced: but when Christ had conquered death, and was risen againe, then the disciples were gladde, and the Iewes were sadde. Thus one thing worketh diuersly in diuers men. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> was glad, that he had found such fauour with the King, to build <hi>Ierusalem: Sanballat</hi> and his fellowes were as sory that any should doe it.

                     <hi>Nehemiah</hi> hath now done with the court, and is come to Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, which he so much desyred: he was wearie of the noyse and solemnitie of the court, and thought he should liue more qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly in his countrie, but it falleth out cleane contrary: for his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and daunger is double to that it was a fore: and he commeth from the Court to the cart, &amp; from a plesaunt life to a carefull. After his long Iourney <hi>he resteth him-selfe and his companie three dayes,</hi> knowing the weaknes of mans bodie to be such, that it cannot continually endure labour, but must be refreshed with ease and rest. Thus must good men in authoritie not ouerlay their seruants with continuall labour, but let them haue reasonable time of rest: for God made the Sabboth day, that both man and beast might rest and not be opressed with continuall toyling: such a consideration he had of mans weaknes. we do not reed of any great solemnitie that the Iewes vsed to wel-come him with all, being their countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and comming from the court so honorably with such a band of men to conduct him, and being in so great fauour with the King: it is like if that there had bene any such thing, itwould haue beene declared, as well as his estate was in the Court afore. It was but a hard beginning, to haue <hi>Sanballat and Tobias,</hi> two ofthe greatest men in the countrie to lowre so at his commyng, and no greater reioycing made of his countriemen, for whose sake he tooke all those paynes: but nothing can discourage him: on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde he goeth with his purpose.</p>
                  <p>These three dayes though he rested with his body, his minde was not yet quiet, he was still deuising how he might best and speedely goe about his buylding: how he might open to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triemen the cause of his commyng, how he might persuade them to ioyne with him in that worke, and to declare vnto them the Kings commission and good will towarde him, and what fauour he found in the court. For they might well doubte if they should enterprise so great a worke, without the Kinges li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, they might runne into great displeasure, seeing they had so manie enemies in the countrie about them, that with all their might had sought the hinderaunce of that buylding
<pb facs="tcp:14649:28"/>
so many yeares. They them-selues had lien so long in dispaire, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their owne busines, sought their owne gaines, and cared not for building their owne Citie, nor sought any waies how to doe it: they had almost so farre forgotten their God, oppressed the poore, and fallen to so great wickednes (as appeereth hereafter) that they had no care ofReligion in the most parte of them.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. <hi>And I rose in the night.</hi> After that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had thus long debated with him selfe how this worke should be taken in hand, he could not sleep, but <hi>riseth in the night, taketh a few of his men with him on foote, and he him selfe on his Mule, and rideth round about Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, veweth the walles in what place they were worst destroyed, and how they might most speedelie be repayred.</hi> If he had taken his vew in the daie time, euerie man would haue stood gazing on him, wondering what he went about, &amp;haue hundered it: and not vnlike some would haue bene offended at him, and his enemies round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but would, as much as they durst or could, haue stopped his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise. The night therefore was thought to be the quietest time to do this in, and he is content to breake his sleepe for the furtherance of this great good worke. A good example for al men, &amp; especially for those that be in authoritie in the common-wealth, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was now: and for those that haue the charge of Gods Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto them, not to be idle, euen in the night season to break a sleepe, yea watch all night if neede be, to set forward the building of Gods house and Citie. The phisitian will watch with his patient all night, if neede be. The good Captaine will not sleepe all the night long, though he haue sett his watch afore, but he will some-times at the second watch, some-times at the third, arise and see whither his watch-men be fallen on sleepe and what they doe, or whither any enemies drawe neere or no: so should euerie Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an priuatlie for him selfe breake his sleepe, lift vp his minde vnto the Lord, call vpon him by faithfull praier, call for mercie at his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlie goodnes, commend him selfe &amp; al gods people to his grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous protection, desiring that all stumbling blockes, which be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of his glory, may be taken away: but speciallie those that be negligent to watch a whole night in praier, deuising what waies Gods glorious name, gospel, and Religion may best be increased, his kingdome enlarged, Christ glorified, and Antechrist confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

And that this vewing of the walls might be more secretly done, he chooseth the night season rather then the day to doe it in, a few men to wait on him, rather then many, no moe horsse then his owne, &amp; all the rest on foote, for making noise: many men and horsses would sone haue bene espied, one troubled another, made a great noise, &amp; haue bewrayed his counsell, which he kept so secret to him selfe that he tould it not to any man what he went about: and ifhe had gone alone, he might haue fallen into some daunger oflife, hauing none to help him. The night is the quietest tyme to deuise things in, for then all things be quiet, euery man keepeth his house, and draweth to rest, no noyse is made abroade, the eies are not troubled with looking at many things: the senses are not drawne away with phantasies, and the mynde is quiet. Many men would haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the doings of such things to other men, and would haue trusted them to haue vewed the walls, and after to haue certified him of their doings, in what case they were, and how they might most speedelie be repayred: but <hi>Nehemiah</hi> lest he should haue wrong information giuen him, though he was a man of great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, did not disdaine to take the paines him-selfe, breake his sleepe, and rode about the walls him-selfe, to teach vs, that nothing should be thought painfull at any time, nor disdainfull to anie man, of what estate so-euer he were, to set forthe the building of Gods Citie and dwelling place, which euerie man ought to doe in <note place="margin">2.

In that <hi>he telleth no man, what he went about, &amp; that God had put it in hismind to doe it,</hi> he declareth that it was not his owne deuice, nor came from any man, but God him-selfe was the mouer of it, &amp; therefore was more earnestlie to be followed. He that will learne to keepe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell in deede, let him learne of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> here to tell no man, not to his dearest friend. Manie will come to his friend and say, I can tell you a secret matter, but ye must keepe in counsell and tell no body: what folishnes is this that thou wouldst haue another to keepe thy counsell secret to him selfe &amp; thou thy selfe canst not keepe it secret to thy selfe, wouldst thou haue another man to doe that for thee, which thou wilt not do for thy selfe? Keepe thine owne counsel, and then thou shalt not neede to feare lest other men bewray thee. And if thou wouldst haue another ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to keepe thy counsel he wil thinke thou shouldst not haue told it thy selfe, and then it had bene safe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: but in telling him, he telleth another friend, &amp; he sayeth to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14649:29"/>
him as thou saidst to thy friendafore. I can tel you a thing that was told me secretly, but you must keepe counsel &amp; tell no body: so with going from friend to friend, it will be knowne to al men. Therefore the surest &amp; onely way to haue counsell kept secret, is to follow <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> here, and tel it to no man, though he be thy deare freind: for he hath other friends to tell it to, as thou didst tell it him. If any doe marueil why <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was thus earnest in this building, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused no paines nor ieoperdy, but with courage went through them all, he telleth a sufficient cause here him selfe, and sayeth, <hi>his God had put it in his heart to doe it.</hi> He taketh not the glorie of it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but giueth all the praise to God alone, as we must doe in all good things. Whensoeuer God putteth any good thing into mans heart to doe, he driueth him so forward, that he cannot eat, sleepe, nor rest quietly, vntill it be done, he thinketh all time long and lost, that is not bestowed on it: therefore they that be so colde in their worke, that they care not whither it goe forward or not, are not moued by God.

and al the gates that should be shut, were burned to ashes. Orighteous God, and miserable people. God of his mercie fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde them by his Prophets, <hi>that if they fell from him, and serued other Gods, these mischiefes should fall on them:</hi> but they blinded in their owne affections, beleeued it not. O stony hart, learne here how vile a thing sin is in Gods sight: for, not onely the man thatdoeth sin, is punished, but the earth, the countrie, the stones, the walls, the citie, trees, corne, cattel, fish, fowle, and al fruits, &amp; other things that god made for mans necessitie, are perished, punished &amp; turned into an other nature for the sinne of m an: yea, &amp; not onely worldlie things, but his <hi>holy Temple, law, word, &amp; religion, the arke of God, the Cherubins, the pot with Manna, the mercy seate, Aarons rod,</hi> with all therest of his holy Iewels, were giuen vnto the wicked Nabuchadnezzers hand, for the disobedience of the people: &amp; God will rather suffer his ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enemies to enioy his wonderful benefits, then his flattering friends. When <hi>Adam</hi> had sinned, the earth, which afore was decked with al good fruits, brought forth weeds to punish the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> withal. For the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes of <hi>Sodom,</hi> God not onely cruellie destroied the people in it, but to this day that pleasant ground, which afore was like paradise is now barren, full of filthie mire, slitche, tarre, &amp;c. and the aire of it so pestilent, as diuers doe write, <hi>that if any birdes slie ouer it, it kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth</hi>

                     <hi>them. The whole countrie of Iewrie,</hi> a plentifull land, <hi>flowing with milke and honie,</hi> of his owne nature, by the disobedience of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple became a barren land, as <hi>Dauid</hi> teacheth in his psalme. <hi>The lord turneth a fruit full ground into a barren, for the wickednes of the dwellers in it. Ierusalem</hi> was not onely destroyed now thus pitiously by the <hi>Babilonians,</hi> but after ward by <hi>Vespasian</hi> the Emperour, and had not one stone left standing on another, and the Iewes driuen out ofit, who now liue scattered through the world, abhorred of all good men, and vnder Gods heauie rodde, for crucifying the Lord Iesus Christ the sonne of God, and their continual despising of him. Let euerie man therefore learne reuerently in the feare of God to liue: for sinne will not onely be punished with euerlasting death in the world to come, but euen in this life man him-selfe is plagued, and all things that should serue or pleasure him, shalbe turned to his destruction, because he would not serue his God as he ought to do.</p>
                  <p>What can be a more righteous iudgement of God, then so to order things, that no creature of God shal serue a wretched man, which will not serue not feare the Lord his God and creator.

house wherein thou dwellest, the earth whereby thou liuest, which neuer sinned, for the sinne of thee wretched man. O consider how God abhorreth sinne and disobedience of his word, that he could neuer be pacified, but by the death of his owne deare sonne Christ Iesus for thy sinnes. O miserable man, consider thy wretched state: thy sinnes pulled thy Lord Christ from heauen to hell, from ioy to paine, thou causedst him to be whipped, and hanged on a tree, thrust to the heart with a speare, by his blood to saue the: thou cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedst him to die that thou mighst liue. If thou shouldest deale thus with another man thy fellow, what wouldest thou thinke thou hadst deserued? And when thou hast thus misused thy Lord and Christ, the sonne of God, crucifiing him againe, and yet continuest <note place="margin">Hebr. 10.</note> in sinne, contemning his commaundements, <hi>treading the sonne of God vnder thy feete, and esteeming the blood of his eternall Testament as a prophane thing,</hi> how canst thou looke vp vnto him? how canst thou hope for mercie? Wicked men are so horrible in Gods sight, that the Angels in heauen abhorre them, the creatures on earth disobey them, good men flie their companie, and diuels in hel pull them vnto them: and yet malice hath so blinded them, that they cannot turne vnto the Lord. But whatsoeuer there is in vs, O God, forget not thou thy selfe, shew thy selfe a God stil, though we forget thee. As thou louedst vs, when we were thine enemies, so loue vs still now, whom thou hast made thy freinds, and bought so dearely, and turne vs, good God, that we may loue thee. Remember, O Lord, wherof we be made: from the earth we came, on the earth we liue and delightin earthly things: vnto the earth we shall returne: thou canst not looke for heauenly things to come from so vile a matter, this earthly nature cannot be chaunged, but by thy heauenly spirit: deale not with vs therefore, O Lord, in iustice, as we deserue, but in thy great mercie, which is our sure saluation, and let thy manifold mercie deuoure our manifold miserie, that our manifold sinnes be not laid to our charge. Gratious God forgiue vs: as our miserie is endlesse, so is thy mercie, &amp; much more large then we can thinke. As we see God deale in his anger with this Citie, for the sinne of the people that dwelled in it, so he will deale with all obstinate breakers of his law in all ages and places, without respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. The <hi>walls of the citie</hi> may well be compared to the Magistrats, which both defend the people from their enemies, and also gouern the Citizens within: as the walls keepe out other from inuading, so they keepe in the inhabitants from straying abroade: &amp; <hi>the gates of the Citie</hi> may well be compared vnto the ministers, which open
<pb facs="tcp:14649:32"/>
the dore of life to all penitent persons, by the comfortable prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of mercie promised in Christ, &amp; shut heauen gates against al reprobate and impenitent sinners, by terrible thundring of his vengeance, threatned to such in his worde. <hi>The walls are destroied, and the gates burned,</hi> when the rulers and ministers doe not their duetie, but care for other things. And as this wretched people had iustly for their disobedience neither walls left to keepe out the enemie, nor gates to let in their friends, but all were destroied, so shall all godles people be left without godly Magistrats to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne them, and liue in slauerie vnder tyrants that oppresse them, and also without comfortable Ministers to teach them, and be led by blinde guides that deceiue them, and so <hi>the blinde lead the blinde, &amp; both fall in to the ditch,</hi> to their vtter and endles destruction. They be not worthie to haue either Magistrate or preacher, that will not obey lawes, nor beleeue the worde. This <hi>Osee</hi> the Prophet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told them should fall on them saying: <hi>The people of Israell should sit manie daies without a Prince, without sacrifice, and Image, without the Ephod and Teraphin: and yet in the end they should returne vnto their God.</hi> But they feared not these threatnings then, no more then we doe now: yet as they fell on them then, so will they fall on vs now. After that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had thus diligentlie vewed the walls, and the breaches of them, he was more able to render a reason, and talke with the rulers how they might be repaired. A good rule for all those that haue anie charge commited to them, that they should first priuatlie consider the things they haue to doe them-selues, and then shal they be more able to consider who giueth best coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel for the doing of it. Rashely to enter on it, a wise man will not, nor open his minde to others, vntil he haue aduised him-selfe priuatelie first what is best to be done: and so shall he be best able, both to render a reason of his owne doings, and also to iudge who giueth best aduise.</p>

                     <hi>NEhemiah</hi> not onely like a Godly zealous man is diligent to set forward this worke, but also like a verie wise man, sheweth in his doings the chiefe properties of him, that hath weightie matters committed vnto him. He that hath great matters to doe, must be faith ful and trustie, and also secret, and keeping counsel close: as the Poet saieth; <hi>Fide &amp; taciturnitate est opus.</hi> And where euerie sorte must be made priuie in such a worke, hitherto he had opened it to neuer a one.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. <hi>And I saied vnto them.</hi> After <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had thus long kept his purpose secret and diligentlie vewed the walls how great the breach was, how it might be best and speedelie repaired, and was able to talke with all sorts, and render a reason of his doings to euerie one both high and lowe in authoritie, to the common sort of the Iewes, to the workemen, Priests, and Rulers: he now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth the matter vnto them all, &amp; in few words, after <hi>he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the miserie that they were in, and how that famous Citie laie open to all enemies to inuade,</hi> to their great shame, exhorteth and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them to fall to the building of the walls, and liue no more in such shame and reproch, as they had done, but recouer their olde estimation againe, <hi>for he had found fauour both in Gods sight and the Kings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There be two kind of reasons to perswade a man to doe anie thing: the one is, if he declare how hurtfull and shameful it is to doe or suffer such a thing to be done or vndone. The other reason is, to open vnto him what good help and encouraging there is to set it forward. <hi>The shame was great,</hi> that for their great sinne and disobedience gods people, who craked so much of their good god, should liue in such slauerie vnder infidels, as though their God could not, or would not deliuer them. The hope to prosper well in this building was great, for that <hi>both God &amp; the King had shewed great tokens of their goodwills</hi> for the furtherance of this good worke. Both these kindes of perswasions he vseth here: his words be not manie, but effectual. For as the shame was, to loose their Citie, so the glorie shold be greater in recouering it: &amp; wise men vse &amp; loue few words; for either those will serue good men, or moe will not. The wofull sight of those broken wals, &amp; this miserable slauery of the people in it, were sufficient to mooue a stony heart to pitie, though neuer a word were spoken by anie man: but those weightie reasons well considered, made them all to fall to worke with great courage. What man had so litle feeling of God and honestie, that would not help to build Gods Citie and their owne countrie. Those
<pb facs="tcp:14649:33"/>
that loue to heare them-selues talke, and with many words to couller their ill meaning, may here learne how a simple trueth plainlie tolde in few words, worketh more in good mens hartes then a faire painted tale that hath litle trueth, and lesse good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in it. An honest matter speaketh for it selfe, and needeth no coullouring, and he that vseth most flatering &amp; subtill words, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth wise men mistrust the matter to be ill. A few words well pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, are much better, then a long vnsauerie tale.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. <hi>And I tolde them.</hi> After that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had brieflie set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, the miserie they liued in, the cruell destruction of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> which God chose for him selfe to dwell in, and what shame it was for them, not to recouer by weldoing that which their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for their wickednes lost: he now declareth vnto them, as a ful reason to perswade any man that would be perswaded, and saieth; <hi>both the hand of his God was gratious toward him in this enterprise, and the Kings words were very comfortable.</hi> When a man hath both God and the king of his side, what needeth he more? who can hurt him? what should he doubt or be afraid of: what would he haue further? God had giuen him such a fauour in the Kings sight, that as soone as he asked licence <hi>to goe &amp; build the Citie where his fathers lay buried</hi> it was graunted: and the liberalitie and good will of the King was so great, that he graunted him both souldiers, safelie to conduct him to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and also commission to his officers, for tymber to this great building. What should they mistrust or doubt of now? There wanted nothing but a good will and courage on their side: if they would rise and worke lustelie, no doubt the worke would be finished speedelie. <hi>Nehemiah:</hi> still calleth him <hi>his God,</hi> as though God heard his prayer onely, and moued the kings heart to giue him licence to build this Citie, which many diuerse times had wished and laboured for, and could not get it. He thought this to be so great a blessing of God, that he can neuer be thankfull enough for it, and therefore calleth him <hi>his God.</hi> He that loueth his God ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestlie, reioyseth in nothing so much, as when he seeth those things prosper, whereby Gods glorie may be shewed forth. He ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth more for that, then for his owne pleasure &amp; profit. And when such things goe backward, it greeueth him more then anie worldly losse that can fall vnto him selfe. And though some wauering worldlings may say: the King might die, or chaunge his good wil from them, and god many times, when he hath giuen a good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning for a while, yet in the end he cutteth it of &amp; by this meanes discourage other from this worke, &amp; will them not to medle: The

time might chaunge, and then they might be blamed: and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> although he was in great fauour with the King at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, yet being absent long from the Court, might sone bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: others that beare him no good will, might creepe in fauour and bring him into displeasure (for in the Court commonly, out of sight out of minde:) These and such other reasons would soone withdraw dissemblers from their good furtherance of this worke: Yet God so wrought with them all, that they all boldly tooke this worke in hand, and finished it. God of his great goodnes, for the better exercising of our faith, hath thus ordered the course of things that although when we looke into the world, we shall finde many things to withdraw vs from doing our dueties to his maiestie, yet, by his holy spirit, he hath giuen vs faith and hope of his promised goodnes, that nothing should discourage vs from doing our due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: for we haue him on our side, that hath all things at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, and whose purpose none can withstand. Let the world therefore wauer neuer so much: Let it threaten neuer such crueltie, let it counsel and persuade as crastily as it can, to medle in no such matters of God: Yet good men cannot be quiet, vntill they haue shewed their good will to the vttermost of their power, for the furtherance of Gods worke, and obedience of his will. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 12.</note> when he was bidden to <hi>leaue his countrie and kinsfolke, and goe into that place that God would shew him,</hi> might haue manie reasons to stay him: as that he could not tell, how to liue when he came there, that he should want the comfort of his friends, liue amongst stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and those that would rather hurt him, then help him: yet none of these could stay him, but he would follow whether the Lord would lead. <hi>God badde him sacrifice his sonne Isaac, hauing no issue, and yet promised him that in his seede all nations should be blessed. Abraham</hi> could not tell how these two should stand together, both to kill his <note place="margin">Gen. 22.</note> sonne, and to haue issue of him: yet <hi>he doubted not in faith,</hi> but rather <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> then his promise should not be true, God would raise him from death, to beget and raise vp seed after him. When <hi>Isaac,</hi> going to besacrificed, <hi>asked his father where the sacrifice was that should be killed (for he had the wood on his back) and the fire in his hand: Abraham,</hi> not doubting, though not knowing how, where, nor when it should be done, said, <hi>God will prouide him-selfe a sacrifice, my sonne:</hi> and proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">Gen. 22.</note> to sacrifice his sonne, vntil the Angel staied him, <hi>and shewed him a Ramme in the bushes,</hi> which he should offer vnto the Lord in stead of his sonne.

question how they should liue, or defend them-selues against so many enemies, or how they should teach others, that neuer went to schoole them-selues to learne: but obeying his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and beleeuing his promise, went forth boldly, and did their message diligently, and God blessed their doings wonderfully. When they came againe vnto him, and tolde him how well they had sped, he asked them, <hi>whither they wanted any thing by the way, while they were in his seruice?</hi> and they said, nay. Thus good men will not be withdrawne from seruing their God, though many world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Luke. 22.</note> reasons might withdraw them: and God will so encrease their faith to goe forwarde, that nothing shal discourage them. They wil rather stick to Gods promise, then any cunning practise of man. A good beginning is a great reason to persuade a man, that God will giue good successe vnto the end. <hi>Dauid</hi> comforteth him-selfe to kill <hi>Goliath, because he killed a Lion and a Beare, when he was young, keeping sheepe.</hi> God neuer doeth anything in vaine, but when his faithfull seruants take things in hand of meere loue and duty to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">1. Sam. 17.</note> his glorie, he euer bringeth it to good effect. The good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse that God hath giuen vs afore, should persuade vs that he will giue vs more. Hipocrites, faint harted souldiers, dubble dealers, and those that be not grounded vppon a sure faith &amp; hope of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed goodnes, oft faile of their purpose, through their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault. God hath promised nothing to such dissemblers, &amp; those that trust him, he neuer faileth. Let al those therefore that feare the Lord vnfeinedly, boldly begin the Lords worke, continue it sted fastly, looke for the mighty furtherance of the same faithfully, &amp; no doubt they shal haue it. Who euer to this day trusted in the Lord in vaine, but he had good successe in his doings? Let no man mistrust Gods goodnes to further those good things that he taketh in hand: let vs worke diligentlie, and commit the successe to him boldly, no doubt he will bring it to good passe. When they had well conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> words and his good counsel, they cast all perils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and said, <hi>lett vs rise and buyld those decaied walles.</hi> Let vs linger no longer, but speedely fall to labour, and recouer that with our diligence, that our fathers lost by disobedience. Now they buskle and bowne them-selues to this worke, they spit on their hands, and take better hold then afore, they buckle them-selues to labour with courage, not to be driuch from it any more. So much can a few words, spoken in the feare of God vprightlie by some man, at some times doc, that cannot be gotten at other times by many persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Aggeus,</hi> when they had lien many yeares on sleepe, forgeting
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14649:34"/>
the buylding of Gods house, with like few words so encouraged them to worke, that they finished the Temple in foure yeares, which afore had lyen almoste 40. yeares vnlooked at. So can God make them earnest in a shorte time, when pleaseth him, which afore had bene colde and negligent. And this courage that they gather now, camerather by gentle persuasions, then by fearefull threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings: for good natures are moued rather with the glad tidings of the Gospel, then sharpnes of the law. The law threatneth correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the gospel promiseth blessings: the law killeth, the gospel quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: the law breedeth feare, the gospel bringeth loue: the law casteth downe, the gospell reareth vs vp: the law laieth our sinne to our charge, the gospel saith, Christ hath paied the price for our reconciliation. A gentle kinde of preaching is better to winne weake myndes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> terrible thundring of vengeaunce: yet is the law most necessarie to be taught, to pull downe froward hearts, and bring them to knowledge of them-selues. I see diuers of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets terribly threaten the wickednes of their tyme, yet I see none of them, that doeth so mightely dissuade them from their vngodlie life, as <hi>Aggeus</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> with their milde dealing, bring so many to repentaunce: Both be good and necessarie, but the gospel more comfortable, and the law fearefull. feare maketh a man ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tymes to flie from ill, but loue maketh him willingly to do good. Salomon saith, <hi>loue is as strong as death:</hi> for as all things yeald vnto <note place="margin">Cant. 8.</note> death, so nothing is to hard or painfull for him that loueth, but he will aduenture at all perils, vntil he get the thing that he loueth. S. <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> Paul saith, <hi>who shal seperate vs from the loue of Christ Iesus? Shall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, anguish, persecution, hunger, nakednes, Ieoperdie, or the sworde?</hi> if thou wouldst haue a man earnest in any thing, rather draw him to it by loue, then driue him to it by feare: bring him once to loue it ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, and nothing shall make him afraid to stand to it manfully. Feare maketh men colde, discourageth them, and many tymes tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them to hatred. That preacher therefore which will winne most vnto God shal rather doe it by gentelnes, then by sharpnes, by promise, then by threatnings, by the gospel, then by the law, by loue, then by feare: though the law must be enterlaced to throw downe the malice of mans hart, the flesh must be bridled by feare and the spirit comforced with louing kindnes promised. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> vseth both the law and the Gospel to persuade them withal.</p>
                  <p>The 17. verse laieth afore them <hi>the misery they were in, to liue vnder heathen, &amp; strange Princes, the pitiful sight of their broken wal, their gates burned,</hi> wherby they liued in continual danger of the enemy round

about them to be spoyled &amp; murthered: the shame was no lesse them the losse, that they could not repaire and recouer by their wel doing that their fathers lost, &amp; they had dwelled so many yeares in it since king Cyrus gaue them licence to goe home againe: all which were the heauie burthens &amp; cursse of the law. But this verse setteth afore them the gratious goodnes of God and the King, which had giuen great tokens of their good wil &amp; fauour toward the worke of their meere mercie: &amp; so both the lawe and the gospel laide afore them, the miserie taken awaie, and mercie offered vnto them, they should most thankfully receaue the goodnesse promised, &amp; auoid the great burthen of miserie, that they so long had borne. This kinde of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching is verie meete to be followed of all preachers, and those that shall speake vnto a people, where all sorts of states ar to be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: sor these kinds of reasons touch all sorts of men: and if it be done in the feare of God, it wil worke as it did then. Those be the best schollers that wil learne withont the rod: yet none so good but at times he needeth the rod: and a wise schoolemaster wil make such choyse of his schollers, whom he wil haue learned, that he shall profit more with gentlenesse then crueltie: and such asses as must continuallie haue the whip, are meeter to be driuen from the schoole to the Cart, then by their loytring to hurt others.</p>

Their duetie is, not to suffer Gods enemies to inuade or hurt, sclaunder or blaspheme those, that they haue charge ouer, but draw the sword, if neede be, to driue awaie such wolues and punish such wicked tongues.

                     <pb facs="tcp:14649:38"/>
to do such things. They serued no Idoles nor false gods, they needed not to be ashamed of their master, the God of heauen was their Lord and they his people, he was their master and they his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, he their King, and they his subiects: they would goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with their worke, they must haue a Citie to dwell in to serue their God, who would defend them in this their well doing: these men had no authoritie to stoppe or forbid them to worke, they had nothing a do in Ierusalem, nor any authoritie, they would not obey them, but with all diligence applie this worke vntill it be finished. The Apostles, when they were forbidden, preached, and would not obey, but said, <hi>they must obey God that bad them.</hi> Thus must all they, that take Gods worke in hand, confesse it to come from God, and that he blesseth their doings, that all the praise may be his, and that they of them-selues be weake &amp; vnable to doe such things, without his special grace and assistance. All good men in such enterprises will saie with <hi>Dauid; Not vnto vs O Lord, not vnto vs, but vnto thy name giue all the glorie.</hi> If these wicked men had had anie worldy shame or feare of God in them, they would haue <note place="margin">Psal. 125.</note> quaked &amp; trembled, as the good men reioiced to haue God on their side to further them: so they, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they heard <hi>the god of heauen</hi> named to be against them, and that it was his doing, they would haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken their Idoles, and haue furthered this building, or at lest haue sitten still, and not hindered it. For who is able to withstand his will, or hinder that he will haue forward? The Deuils in hell quake and tremble at the naming and considering of Gods Maiestie, but these wicked Imps not onelie now, but sundrie times, as appeereth hereafter in this booke, most cruellie, spitefullie, and craftelie goe forward in their olde malice, and by all meanes seeke the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of this building. So farre worse is a Deuil incarnate in an ill man, then by him-selfe in his owne nature. When the Deuill will worke anie great mischiefe, he taketh commonlie one man or other, Angel or creature to doe it by, knowing that he shall doe it more easily that waie, then if he should attempt it by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Howe is euerie murther, false witnesse, whoredome, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beric, &amp;c, committed, but when the Deuill stirreth vp one man against another? Let euerie good man therefore take heed vnto him-selfe, how he yoaldeth vnto sinne. For in that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he maketh him-selfe a slaue to the Deuill, and his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to worke by, One Deuill, will not offer that villany to another Diuell, to make him his slaue, but if he canne bring man vnto it, there is his reioycing. Take heede therefore, O man.

In that they confesse them selues to be <hi>the seruants of the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:</hi> it is as much to say, as they wrought not for them-selues nor at their owne appointment, nor for their owne profit: they wrought for their masters cause, and for his glorie. Good seruants in al their doings will seeke their masters profit and praise, not their owne: they liue not for them-selues but al the profit of their doings retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to their masters. If they take any thing to them-selues more then their master giueth them, they be theeues vnto him, they doe him no true seruice. Let all the builders of Gods house therefore, whether they be rulers in the common wealth, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was now, or of the learned sort in the ministrie, or els where, not onely confesse in words, that they be <hi>seruants to the God of heauen,</hi> but most humblie, simplie, and boldlie shew it in their deeds, that they seeke their masters praise and glorie, the common profit of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and not their owne: that they worke for him, and not for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, &amp; that they serue him not for any worldlie respect, or gaine, or honour, but vprightlie for conscience sake serue and obey him, yeald al praise to his glorious name, taking nothing to them-selues and being not afraid to goe foreward in his building for any brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, knowing that all the pride of mans heart, which setteth vp him-selfe against the God of heauen, is vile and vaine: and that their God wil defend his seruants and confound his foes. It is no rebellion against Princes to doe that which God commaundeth: for Princes them-selues are bound as wel as other meaner degrees to serue the Lord God of heauen with all their might and maine: and vnto the same God they must make account of their doings as all other must. For this building they had the Kings commission, and therefore it was no treason to doe it. It is more glorious to be called <hi>Gods seruants,</hi> then to haue all the titles of honour and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie that the world can giue. He that serueth the Lord trulie is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of sinne, hell, death, and the deuil, and by the assistance of gods holie spirit shall not be ouercome of them, but shall ouercome and conquere them: which is greater honour, then any worldly Prince can giue.

This Citie God him-selfe did choose for his people to dwell in, and serue him. Ye be Idolaters, &amp; worship not the true God of heauen: if ye wil be building, build ye <hi>Samaria</hi> your owne head Citie: ye are no Citizens here, nor haue anie freedome, libertie, or priuiledge graunted vnto vs, ye be none of our corporation, nor denizens, ye shall haue nothing to doe here.

For when the land was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided by lot and measure by <hi>Iosue,</hi> ye had no parte appointed for you: vnder the lawe ye doe not liue, but haue liued after your owne deuise, nay, ye beare such hatred vnto vs, that ye will not willingly eate, drinke, nor keepe company with vs friendly: let vs alone, trouble vs not, get you hence, &amp; let vs fall to our building a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine It is no small blessing of god whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he calleth any to be a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his house, for both in this world his name shalbe had in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall remembrance, and he is written in the Booke of life, where no death canpreuaile. <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>the righteous man shalbe had in perpetuall remembrance:</hi> and Saint <hi>Ihon</hi> saith, that <hi>he that is not found written in the booke of life, shal be cast into the sierie lake.</hi> The builders <note place="margin">Psalm. 112.

Ill men and troublers of Gods building haue their names written in this boke to. What more blessed then is he that hindereth?

these, except they required it. But <hi>Nehemiah</hi> a wise man would neither be afraid of them, as open enemies, nor receiue them into his fellowship, as feined friends. Wherein he teacheth al true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians how to behaue them-selues in building of Gods house. That is neyther to feare the one, nor to receiue the other. S. <hi>Paul saith, be not yoked with infidels, what hath rightousnes to doe with vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, light with darknes, or Christ with Belial?</hi> Gods people are knit togither with two bonds, the one is Christ their head, who giueth life to al members of the bodie, the other is brotherlie loue among them selues. But neither of these can be found in Idolaters, for they neither take Christ for their head and liue by him, nor they loue not Christians as their breetheren, but dissemble with God and man. All Christians haue <hi>one God, one father, one baptisme,</hi> one Religion, one law to liue vnder, and one heauenlie kingdome to looke for: but Infidels and hipocrites haue manie Gods, al Religions be alike vnto them, they liue as they list, and that is their law and will, to goe to heauen after their owne deuise, if they can get it. Yet they haue a delite to thrust them-selues in among Gods people, pretending a loue vnto them, where in deede it is for no good will, but to learne their secret counsels and purposes, that by such meanes they maie betraie them when occasion serueth. But wise builders will admit them into no fellowship nor friendship, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> here vtterlie <note place="margin">Ezra. 4.</note> refuseth them, and will haue nothing to doe with them. But this case is more plainlie propounded to <hi>Ezra,</hi> and there I haue spoken more largelie of it and: <hi>Ezra</hi> plainlie determineth the matter there who so list to reede and consider.

not driue them out or destroy them as they were commaunded, <hi>but suffered them to dwel among them, to their great shame &amp; harme: for they were euer like thornes in their sides, to prick &amp; hurt them,</hi> as it is written, Iosue 23. Whereby we learne, that, as the <hi>Iebusites</hi> Gods enemies could not fully be conquered vntil Dauid came, no more could the kingdome of Sathan be cleane ouerthrown, vntill Christ Iesus the King of glory was borne of the seede of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who conquered sin, hel, &amp; the deuil, and possessed the holy hill Sion, and made his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple citizens of the heauenlie Ierusalem. And like as they suffered the <hi>Iebusits</hi> to dwell amongst them to their great harme, so sinne remaineth in our mortall bodies conquered in deede, that it doeth not reigne ouer those that serue the Lord, yet not cleane taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but left for our exercise, who hauing our mortal enemie dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling within vs, should fight against sinne vnder the banner of faith in Christ Iesus, who onelie hath, can, and will continuallie defend his people, subdue their enemies, and giue his children the victorie. How King <hi>Dauid</hi> wanne this Citie from the <hi>Iebusits,</hi> is fullie decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the 2. of Sam. 5. chapter. And how Christ Iesus the Sonne of God conquered the whole kingdome of Sathan, sinne, death, and hell, the whole historie of the gospell declareth. And as king <hi>Dauid</hi> when he had reigned 33. yeares noblie in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> died with great victorie, so Christ Iesus our Lord and graundcaptaine, after he had preached the kingdome of his father, gat this noble victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie against death and all his enemies in the 33. yeare of his age, by suffering death, and triumphantlie ascending into heauen, where he reigneth a glorious King for euer. After that <hi>Dauid</hi> had recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this Citie from the <hi>Iebusites,</hi> it was continually called <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> (which is by interpretation, <hi>the Lord he will see Salem</hi>) alluding to both the olde names ioyned togither, <hi>Iebus, Salem,</hi> &amp; chaunging one letter onelie. In the gospel it is called <hi>the holie citie,</hi> as <hi>when the deuil tempted Christ he tooke him into the holie Citie, and set him on a pinacle</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>of the temple,</hi> which name it gate rather of the holie law, word and Sacrifices that were taught there and offered, then of that wicked and vnholie people, <hi>that denied the Lord of life, and required Barrabas to be deliuered.</hi> But when it was destroied by the Romanes, <hi>and not one stone left standing on another,</hi> as Christ foretold it should be, <hi>Elius Adrianus</hi> the Emperour for vaine glorie, builded a new Citie and called it after his owne name <hi>Elia</hi> or <hi>Capitolina.</hi> And when the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then had gotten it from the Christians, <hi>Pope Vrbane</hi> the second kept a councell in Fraunce, and by his flattering friers stirred vp all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to recouer the holie land againe, more like a superstitious Iewe
<pb facs="tcp:14649:42"/>
putting holinesse in the place, which then was inhabited with wicked people, then like a true preacher of true holinesse. But it cost manie Princes their liues, lands, and goods, and yet not reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered: wherof <hi>England</hi> felt his parte, when King <hi>Richard</hi> the first went thither, and was taken prisoner, paid a great Raunsome to the impouerishing of the Realme. As God gaue this Citie and people falling from him into his enemies hands: so will he cast vs vp, if we frowardly forsake him. This Citie <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> aster that it was recouered from the <hi>Iebusites,</hi> was inlarged and fortified by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, Salomon, Ozias, and Ezechias,</hi> and other good kings, and had within it two chiefe hils, <hi>Sion,</hi> where the Kings Palace was built, &amp; <hi>Moria</hi> where the temple was. And after when the people encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, other two hils were taken into it, <hi>Acra</hi> and <hi>Bethera,</hi> as <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth. It had three wardes and walles within it. Within the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermost wall was the Kings Palace, and Temple, and the Preists lodging: in the midle ward were the Prophets &amp; noble-men, their schooles, Leuits and Doctors. By which we are taught how to place and esteeme learning and learned men, schooles, vniuersities, and preachers, which are not now much regarded. In the vttermost dwell the Citizens, marchants and artificers. It was then. 4. miles about, and after enlarged to 6. It was most glorious in the time of our sauiour Christ: for <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Agrippa</hi> had made great cost on it, and <hi>Christ wept for it. Dauid</hi> in the 48. Psalme describeth the beautie and strength of this Citie, and biddeth them <hi>goe round about it, marke and behold it, and count the towers of it, that were manie: that the Lord might be praised for it:</hi> The vttermost wall had towres 90. The midle wall had towres 14. And the innermost wall had towres 60. In the whole 164. towres, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> and others doe write. But I take it that it was so rather in the time of Christ, then of <hi>Dauid,</hi> or of this building now: for as it increased in wealth, beautie, and strength, so it did in pride, riotousnes, superstition, contempt ofGod, &amp; al wickednes, so that this last and vtter destruction was at hand, for refusing, crucifying, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demning the sonne of god their sauiour. When-soeuer the scripture speaketh of any going to this Citie, it saieth commonly they <hi>went vp to Ierusalem,</hi> because it was built so on hils, that on what side soeuer thou camest in thou sholdst goe vp an hill; which though it seeme a small matter to be noted, yet God which doeth nothing in vaine, as he did by other outward things teach that grosse people heauenly things, as here in this clyming vp to this earthly citie they left worldly things beneath them in the vallies: so they that would pray vnto the Lord or seeke
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14649:42"/>
the heauenlie <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> must climbe vp by faith into heauen to the mercie seat and throne of grace, casting awaie all worldly cares and leauing that behind. <hi>The common</hi> opinion is, that <hi>Adam</hi> our first father dwelt and was buried here in this Citie. And the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth, that good father <hi>Abraham offred his sonne Isaac on the mount Moria,</hi> where Salomon built the temple. Which all were <note place="margin">Genes. 22.</note> figures that Christ Iesus the new <hi>Adam</hi> should be buried in the same place where the old <hi>Adam</hi> was, to restore to vs that life which old <hi>Adam</hi> had lost: and should offer his pretious bodie on the tree for our redemption, a sweeter sacrifice then <hi>Isaac,</hi> or anie bloodie sacrifice, that was offered in the temple of Salomon. It is comfortable to consider, and wonderfull to behold, how the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God hath made the circumstances of our destruction by <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; saluation by Christ Iesus to agree. <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice, a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of pleasure, offended God, &amp; was cast out for his disobedience, and we all his posteritie: <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> was buried in a garden, and hath by his death restored to vs life againe. By the intising of a woman man fell from God, and by a woman that blessed seede Christ Iesus was borne, and reconciled vs to his father againe. By a pleasant apple was man deceiued, but by Christ hauing bitter gall giuen him to drinke, man was saued. In that garden had <hi>Adam</hi> all pleasant things freelie giuen him: and in this garden without the Citie had Christ our Lord all cruel and spitefull torments that could be deuised: that we should goe forth to suffer with him, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking the daintie pleasures of this Citie. In the temple no sinne could be forgiuen without shedding of the blood of some sacrifice and in this world is no pardon of our wickednes without the blood of Christ Iesus the innocent lambe of God. And <hi>as by the fall of one man Adam we all were condemned, so by the rising from death of one man Christ Iesus we are iustified.</hi> By the corruption of our father <hi>Adam</hi> we all did perish, and by the Innocencie of our brother the Lord Christ we al be sanctified. Why should not the goodnes of the one profit vs as much as the illnes of the other did hurt vs, or rather much more blesse vs being the immortall sonne of the liuing God, and the other being but a mortall man made of the earth? And as they that had anie sute to the King, or sacrific e to be offred by the Priest, first entred in at the vttermost gate, where the common sort of Citizens dwelt, &amp; then through the second where the Leuits &amp; learned men were, and lastlie in at the innermost gate, where the King and his palace, the hie Priest and the temple were built: so they that will goe to the great King and hie Priest of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie
<pb facs="tcp:14649:43"/>
                     <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> must first enter the vttermost gates where al sorts of Christians are borne into this world, and then be brought to the second, to be intructed by the ministers in the lawe of the Lord, and receyued into the Church, and there nourished by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God: which being diligentlie done, he may boldlie enter at the Innermost gate to the Kings Palace and temple, to make his humble sute, pray and offer his bodie a liuelie sacrifice to God the father by Christ Iesus his sonne, King of Kings, and Lord of the heauens, who also is our <hi>high Priest and Archbishop,</hi> that offred vp that sweete sacrifice of his owne blood for our silthie and stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king sinnes. For as the king and the Priest dwelled both togither in the Innermost warde and on the high hils: so our King and high Priest Christ Iesus hath taken vnto him-selfe the kingdome and priesthood, and <hi>by his holie spirit made vs a king lie priest hood to God his father: Kings,</hi> that we might by him conquere the kingdome of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than: <hi>and Priests,</hi> to mortifie and kill the silthie lusts of our flesh <hi>and offer our soules a liuing and holie sacrifice to serue him.</hi> For as no sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice could be offred any where, but in this onelie Temple of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, so no prayer nor thankefull sacrifices can bee offered vnto him, but in the name of Christ Iesus his sonne and our Lord. Lastlie as God of his iustice for the wickednes and superstition both of the Princes, Priests, and the people, destroyed the kingdome, law, and priesthood of Moses, neuer to be built orrestored againe, though the Iewes sundrie times attempted it, and with great sommes of money would haue gotten licence to haue yearelie come and lamented the destruction of it: Yet both Emperour <hi>Elius Adrianus</hi> to withdraw them from it, <hi>built a new Citie in another place, called it</hi>

Many of these things are well no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Wolphius</hi> and other learned men: and because there is diuers times occasion giuen in this Chapter to speake of these figures and spirituall comparisons, I haue once for all set them downe

the Colossians. 4. Chap. And the. 2. Thessalonians. 3. So that where we see this boldnes in preaching ioyned with wisdome and discretion, we maie perswade our selues that it is the gift of God in such a man, and aboue the nature of man to doe it. This lesson is giuen to all good builders of Gods spirituall house, that <hi>they should not feare him that will kill the bodie, and cannot hurt the soule: but feare him that can cast both bodie and soule into hell.</hi> And Saint Iohn saieth in the Reuelat. 21. that <hi>those which be fearefull, shall haue their parte in the burning lake of brimstone, with murtherers, adulterers, and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> And by the example of <hi>Eliasib</hi> and the Priests which disdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to be admonished and learne their duetie of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> comming from the courte, we shall learne humblenes of minde, <note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> and not disdaine to be admonished of our duetie at meane mens <note place="margin">Reuelat. 21.</note> hands. They are not offended at him, nor thinke him sawcie to counsell and teach them, which were teachers of others, but are content to ioyne in this worke with him and the rest, yea boldlie to begin and giue good example to the rest, as their duetie was, and to incourage others. So no estate must disdaine to be warned of his duetie, and to be encouraged though it be by meane men: for all sorts high and lowe, learned &amp; vnlearned are fearefull and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of them-selues, vntil God stirre them vp by his word, holie spirit, and messenger. And reason it was that as they were shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards to the people, so they should build the <hi>sheep-gate</hi> which was at the East-end of the Citie where the temple was, in the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most wall where the sheepe came in that were offered in sacrifice, and whereof they had their partes, according to the law. This gate maie well be compared to Christ Iesus, who sought the lost sheepe and was sacrificed as a lambe, and is the gate whereby one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie we enter, &amp; his shepheards must be the builders of it, and bring the people into the folde. Many good lessons might be plucked out of the interpretation of the names herein contemed, and what were signisied by them, but those be meeter for the learned, which can by order of learning keepe them selues in compasse, and applie all things to the rule of faith, then to the vnlearned which haue not that iudgement. And where the men of Iericho ioyne with the hie Priest in this building, it teacheth that not onely priests &amp; Citizens must build Gods Citie but also countriemen, yea those that dwelt farthest of and be lest regarded, must put to their helping hand. It is commendable in both, that neither the Priests refused their aide, and they that dwelled farthest of were the first that came to worke. So must all that be of Gods houshould help to build, euen the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plest
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14649:44"/>
and basest as well as the best: for as he is God of all, so he will haue all to serue and worship him. If either <hi>Nehemiah</hi> or any other had taken this worke in hand alone, it would haue bene thought great arrogancie in them, &amp; others would haue disdained that they should haue all the praise of so great a building alone. Common things would be done with common consent, and the common aide of them to whome it perteineth would not be refused. <hi>Iericha</hi> was the first citie that <hi>Iosue</hi> ouerthrew for their wickednes, and it is now the first that commeth to help this building. So great a change commeth when god turneth the hearts of the people. Without this gate was that watring place or sheep-poole, whereof S. Iohn wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the 5. cap. and where the sheepe were washed, that came to be offered.</p>

If a man would stand on figures and allegories, this gate may well signifie Christ, who made his Apostles and Preachers fishers of men, who by him brought and daily bring them into this spirituall Ierusalem: for he is onely the doore whereby all must enter into the Lords citie. These men like good builders leaue nothing vndone that might fortifie that gate, for they set on not onely the doores, but also bolts and lockes. So must Gods Church be made strong by lawes, discipline, and authoritie, that rauening Lions, nor filthie Swyne rush not in, and disquiet or deuour Gods people: and the holesome doctrine must be confirmed with strong arguments, and reasons against false teachers. Much controuersie there is now about disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which euery man graunteth to be necessarie, and desireth to haue: but whether this that is so vehemently vrged be the right way to strengthen the Church, as stronger doores, lockes, and barrs, that should keepe out all rauening wolues and wild beasts, or they be like to spiders copwebs that wil catch a weak flie, &amp; let the great drones burst thorow, I leaue it to the consideration of the wise: I wilbe no partaker of these troublesome contentions.

A shrewd triall for a sort of poore people, which were but lately restored to their countrie, and yet not well setled in it, to see the greatest ruler in the countrie to be so angrie to ward them, to scorne and mocke them. If God had not strengthned them, it would haue made them to leaue their worke for feare &amp; runne away.

The Pharisies disdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Christ our Lord, because they see their doctrine decay and his receiued. And what maketh such a stur this day in the Church, but that the Pope and his partakers see their Kingdome decay and the trueth appeare? These be written for our learning, that we should not discourage our selues in these miserable times, but boldlie stand &amp; continue to the end. <hi>Sanballat,</hi> after that he had thus chafte in him-selfe, and also had scorned and scoft at their doings, he is so sore vexed in his minde, that he cannot hold in, but bursteth out into blustring bigge words, and saith openlie before his fellowes &amp; country men, which were of the same mind, &amp; superstition that he was, &amp; it might be more fearfull to the Iewes, to discourage them, <hi>he speaketh</hi> and braggeth it out <hi>before the Souldrers,</hi> which were set there to represse all mischieu ous attempts and enterprises that any should take in hand.

And thus he saieth, <hi>what doe these beggerlie Iewes,</hi> these slaues, Pesantes, and villanes, what goe they about? what meane they? will they take in hand such a building as no mightie Prince is able to finish? and that manie noble Kings afore them could scarse in many yeares performe, will they on a sudden bring it to perfection? But if they be so foolish to thinke that they can fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish it themselues, are the heathen people so mad to stand by, looke on and laugh, and suffer them to goe forward with this building which hath beene of old tyme a great enemy vnto them, and may be now againe, if they be suffered to worke still? Doe they thinke the Gentiles so foolish, that they foresee not their meaning, or doe they think them such Cowards that they dare not, or so impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent &amp; vnable that they cannot hinder and ouerthrow this worke, or so vnwilling to helpe their countrie, that they will suffer them to goe forward in it? Nay I warrant you, ye shall finde them stout men, ready and willing to defend their countrie, and will not suffer such runnagates to strengthen themselues against them. Shall they offer their old sacrifices? shall they restore their old Religion, in dispite of vs and our Countrie, and goe about to draw others to their Religion? Shall they vse their old accustomed solemne daies their great assemblies, and haue it for well done? Nay let them as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure them-selues we shal finde them otherwaies occupied, we shall hold their nose to the grindstone: they shall not haue leisure to praie and to be merie as they looke for. <hi>They worke</hi> so lustelie <hi>as though they would finish it in one daie,</hi> afore their neighbours should espie them, but they shall finde it farre otherwise: we foresee their meaning well ynough, we wil be heauie neighbours to them: it shall not fall out as they looke for. Manie Kings afore them were busie to builde, some one place, and some another, and in manie yeares, but these braggers goe to it so greedelie, as though they could finishit in a day or two. A sorte of beggerlie vagabonds and proud beggers take this worke in hand, as though they were able to goe thorough with it. What will they doe? will they glew the olde stones togither againe? when will they get new stone? The old ones are burnt to powder, knocked in peeces, and will not serue for anie building againe. They shal finde it another maner of worke to finish, then they looke for.

Let euery man therefore that will walke vprightly in the feare ofGod, take heede how he once giue place to any wickednes: for if the deuill get a little entrance into thee, he will drawe the cleane away with him, if God be not more mercifull to holde thee.

But good men are oft lest to them-selues without help or comfort at mans hand, as the Iewes were here now: and the Church ofGod hath bene from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning subiect to such dangers and shalbe to the end, that Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie may more euidentlie shine in defending ofit, in despite of all their foes. The Metaphor, or kind of speech that is vsed here, when he faith, <hi>a salue was come on the walls of Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> is taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons who when they heale wounds, ioyne the flesh togither againe, which afore was cut in sunder: so the new breaches of the walls,
<pb facs="tcp:14649:57"/>
which afore lay gaping open, were now ioyned togither and made sound, as though it were one whole sound wall. And as it was such a griefe to these wicked men, to heare tell onelie that the walls went well forward in repairing: so is it at this daie the greatest griefe that Gods enemies can haue, when they heare tell that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion goeth forward in anie countrie: then they conspire, both by them-selues and their friends, and speciallie by that <hi>bastard Tobias,</hi> their Pope, so much as in them lieth, though it be with fire and sword, or anie other cruel deuice, to ouerthrow it.</p>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14649:57"/>
and by humble praier submit themselues to their God, who neuer failed them in all assaies. <hi>Praier</hi> is a sure anker in all stormes, and they neuer perish that humbly flie vnto it, &amp; faithfullie cleaue vnto it. <hi>Praier</hi> is a salue for all sores, yea it healeth not onelie bodie and soule, but euen hard stony walles. No kinde of carthly phisicke that God hath made is good for all kinde of folke at all times, &amp; all kinde of diseases: but this heauenlie phisicke of praier in wealth&amp; woe, in plentie and pouertie, in prosperitie and aduersitie, in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and in health, in warre and peace, in youth and age, in life and death, in mirth and sadnes, yea in all things &amp; times, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, middest, &amp; ending, praier is most necessarie &amp; comfortable. Happy is that man that diligently vseth it at al times. But he that will so effectuallie pray that he may obteyne the thing he desireth, must first prostrate him-selfe in the sight of his God, as this people did, for so the Hebrew word here signifieth forsaking him-selfe, as vnable to help him-selfe, condemning him selfe as vnworthle to receiue such a blessing at the Lords hand: and yet nothing doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but that his God that neuer forsaketh them, that vnfeinedlie flie vnto him, will deale with him in mercie and not in iustice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer him and comfort him, not for anie goodnes that he findeth in him, but of his owne meere pitie, loue, grace and mercie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he maie shew him selfe a glorious God, a present help and succour to all afflicted and oppressed mindes. He that findeth any thing in himselfe to help and comfort him selfe withall nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not to praie, but he that seeth and feeleth his present want &amp; necessitie, he will beg earnestlie, craue egerlie, confessing where his reliefe is to be had. No man will praie for that thing which he hath or thinketh him selfe to haue, but we euer aske, desire, beg, &amp; pray for that we want. Let vs therefore in all our supplications and praiers vnto the Lord, first confesse our beggerlie pouertie and vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes to help our selues, the want of his heauenlie grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlie assistance, &amp; then our gratious God wil plenteously powre his blessings into our empty soules, &amp; fill them with his grace. If we be full alreadie, there is no rowme left to take any more: therefore we must know our selues to be emptie and hungrie, or else we shal not earnestlie desire this heauenlie comfort from aboue, which is requisite in all praier. For he that asketh coldlie, getteth nothing. And the more that we confesse our owne weaknes, our want, and vnablenes, the more we confesse our God to be almightie, rich in mercie, possessing all things in his owne hands, and dealing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to his poore people, where he seeth them neede, and sending the rich emptie away. And as we must thus cast downe our selues in
<pb facs="tcp:14649:58"/>
our selues by faith to our God, &amp; to praie to no other, but vuto the liuing Lord, that made heauen and earth, as this people doeth, and therefore call him <hi>their God.</hi> For if we seeke help at any other, we mistrust him, we doe not faithfully beleeue on him, &amp; then we shall not be heard of him. <hi>Call on me in the daie of thy trouble, saith thy God,</hi>

But these men did not onely pray to their God, but according to their duetie they put them-selues in a readines to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues against their enemies, which is lawfull for all men to doe. It is not sufficient to pray, and then to neglect such meanes as God hath appointed vs to vse for our defence and comfort, no more then it is to saie when he hath praied, I will liue without meat, and drinke, and God him-selfe shall feede me. For as the Lord hath taught vs to pray, <hi>giue vs this day our daily bread,</hi> so he hath comman ded vs to worke for it, and saieth, <hi>he that doeth not labour, let him not</hi>

They had a stronger God to defend them, then any deuill could be to hurt them, or ouerthrow their worke. So praier and Gods prouidence destroyeth not pollicie but maintayneth it, and when they be ioyned togither god blesseth them both, as his owne ordinance. They knew well how true it was that <hi>Dauid</hi> said, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Lord defend the Citie, the watch-men watch in vaine that keepe</hi>

Thus must good Captains learne to ioyne praier with pollicie, if they looke to obteine the victorie, and not trust in horsse, Speare, shield, or other kinde of weapons.

How common this kinde of dealing hath bene, I leaue it to the consideration of others. And for that diuers haue fallen to a great sobrietie and liued orderlie since they learned Religion, God is to be praised, and God encrease the number. They be not made Souldiers to doe wrong, but to correct them that offer wrong:
<pb facs="tcp:14649:59"/>
they enter not that trade to liue without law, but to bring them in obedience that offend the law. They may not thinke the Princes coffers to be at their disposition, but must content them-selues with wages and that portion that is alotted to them. He that dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth other waies getteth it vniustlie, &amp; though he thinketh he dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth so cunninglie that it cannot be espied, yet the righteous Lord wil punish it in this world to his shame, &amp;, if he be not more merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, most greeuouslie in the world to come.

                  <p n="10">10. <hi>And Iudas said.</hi> This gappe was not so soone stopt, but there bursteth forth another worsse then that. Open enemies can doe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle harme, if the other parties within be true amongst them-selues. But if the souldiers within the Citie fall at a Mutinie among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, disobey their captaine, discourage their fellowes, or worke anie treason, drawing parties togither, then the daunger within is greater, then anie can be without. The greatest parte of the tribe of Iuda now waxe faint-hearted, drawe backe, discourage their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, murmure against the Captaines, and would gladlie leaue working. A perilous practise in such a daungerous time, and able to ouerthrow all. One coward in an armie breaking the aray, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning awaie or discouraging the rest, maie easelie discomfet the whole armie. But here come now a great companie, not of the meanest sort, but <hi>of the Kings tribe of Iuda</hi> and they murmure, they discourage, they disswade, and hinder the worke, as much as they maie. The <hi>Israchtes</hi> in <hi>Egipt,</hi> when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> encreased their labour, because <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> would haue them deliuered, they crie out on Moses &amp; Aaron for their weldoing. When they were come out of Egipt and wanted their fleshpottes, they crie out of Moses <note place="margin">Exod. 16.</note>

and <hi>Aaron,</hi> which brought them out, and would returne againe into <hi>Egipt.</hi> The spies that were sent afore to bring word what a people and countrie they should come vnto, were faint-hearted, and discouraged the rest, saying, <hi>the men were great Giants, their Cities stronger then they could conquere, though the ground was fruitfull and pleasant of it selse.</hi> Thus Sathan neuer ceaseth to deuise something to ouerthrow Gods building.</p>
                  <p>The reasons that <hi>Iudas</hi> alledgeth, were great, and able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade any man: first <hi>the workmen were wearie,</hi> say they, their shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders aked with bearing so manie heauie burthens, their strength was gone, they were not able to beare anie more. Secondlie, <hi>there was much morter to carie awaie,</hi> both of the olde rubbish of thebro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken walls, and also new morter to be brought in for the new buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. The Hebrew word will serue for both, which I had rather follow, though some learned applie it onelie to the olde rubbish of the olde walls, and some to the new morter, to be caried for the new building. This troubled <hi>Nehemiah</hi> more then anie bragges of his enemies abroade. For of these he looked for help, and of the others none. These should haue comforted him, and now they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort. Now he must first pacifie and please the men, then he must comfort them and also stirre them vp to their worke, lest o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers should faint and fall awaie as well as they. It is an easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to begin a good worke, but a speciall gift to stand in all stormes and continue to the end. The proud Papist at this daie, at whose hands no goodnes is to be looked for, neyther toward God nor good man, doeth not hinder the building of Gods Church and preferring of his gospell, so much as these faint-hearted Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, white liuered Hipocrites, double dissemblers, and seruers of time.</p>

S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Actes of the Apostles asketh, <hi>why they would goe about to lay that yoke of Moses Ceremonies on the necke of the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which neyther they nor their fathers were able to beare?</hi> And if that might be trulie said then, of those ceremonies which came from God himselfe, how much more may it be verified now on those which come from the Pope, the father of all superstition. The dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dealing of wyly wordlings is such, that it is to be feared this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish rubbish will neuer be cleane rubbed of. For we euer keepe some Romish roume in store to turne our selues on, so oft as the world shall turne. And this olde <hi>Iudas</hi> may well be a figure of the latter <hi>Iudas,</hi> that betraied our master Christ, and al other such hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crits, which being faint hearted would betraie the building and builders that Gods Citie should not be finished. There is great stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>who shall be Peters successour in authoritie,</hi> but I feare <hi>Iudas</hi> hath more followers, which cowardlie and greedelie for a little money hinder, betraie, and vndermine, both the faithfull builders and building. If it be heynous treason to betray one man, whom thou owest dutie, reuerence, and faithfull seruice vnto: it must needes be much more heynous in a Citie, a Campe, a Church, or anie so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, where faithfulnes should be found, to deceiue, runne awaie, deale dissemblinglie, or to disswade, discourage, and withdraw anie or manie from their dutifull obedience, labour, diligence, and faithfull dealing, to the dishonour of God, the ouerthrow of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and hurt of his people. God for his mercie sake roote out all desperat <hi>Iudases</hi> from among all faithful companies, that they may not discourage others, and speciallie from among the flocke of Christ, whom he hath so dearlie bought, that the Lords building may goe forward lustelie. What these Romish rubbish be, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leaue it to other mens considerations, then by blotting of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and filling mens eares with such filthines, stand to rehearse them: but among many I thinke none worsse, then manie lewde dispensations, which such idle lubbers seeke for, whereby their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is vndone. But manie a good builder will not build on the sand, but dig to the sad earth, and the good husband will plucke vp the weedes afore he sow good Corne: so surelie in Gods Church ill doctrines, Ceremonies, Customes, and Superstitions, must be roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, afore good Lawes, Orders, wholsome doctrine, &amp; gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can take place.</p>

God endued man when he made him with such a maiestie in his face afore he fell to sinne, that all creatures did reuerence and feare him: and although sinne hath much defaced and blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out that Noble Maiestie and grace that God endued him with, yet it is not vtterly disgraced and taken awaie, but some sparke and Relique remaineth at this day, that no wilde nor venemous beast dare looke a man in the face boldlie, and hurt him: but will giue place for the time, and seeke how he may priuilie wound or

It is good wisdome therfore for euery man, that shall be in daunger of anie such hurtfull beastes, allwayes to looke them in the face, and beware when he turneth his eie from them, that they sodenlie and subtillie leape not on him and hurt him.

Thus is Gods prouidence &amp; care for his people, when they vnderstand not their owne daunger, to be praised, and this naturall loue that these <hi>Iewes</hi> bareto their Countrie and Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, in fore-warning them to defend them-selues, is to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of all good men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Demeratus</hi> of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> was vniustlie banished his countrie: yet when he heard that the <hi>Athenians</hi> would make warre against his countrie, he gaue his countrie-men warning of it, that they might be in a readinesse to defend them-selues. When the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites had made the Golden calfe, and God in his anger would haue destroyed them, <hi>Moses</hi> falleth to prayer, though they oft rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> against him, and <hi>desireth the Lord to pardon them, or els to put him out of his booke.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul wisheth to be accursed from Christ so that he might winne his breethren the Iewes to the Lord Christ,</hi> though <note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> they oft sought his death.</p>
                  <p>Thus good men wil forget displeasures done vnto them, and be readie alwaies to help and comfort their Countrie, and speciallie those that be of the houshold of faith. This may be a comfort to all good men, that as God opened this conspiracie to his people at this time, by the Iewes that dwelt farre from them, so his father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie care neuer faileth them that loue him, but he will defend and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer them: for he maketh his enemies, if they be made priuie of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie such mischiefe, so babling, that they will open it, eyther for vaine Glorie, briberie, malice, or else their owne consciences doe accuse them that they cannot quiethe suffer such a mischiefe to be wrought. And although they were thus oft and out of all corners warned of this conspiracie, yet they could scarselie be brought, manie of them, to beleeue anie such thing to be attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it was so horrible and incredible. Good men iudge others to be like them selues simple, and plaine dealers, and cannot easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie be perswaded that anie man would goe about such a mischiefe. But the gospel teacheth, that we should <hi>be wise as serpents, &amp; as simple as doues:</hi> the serpent is wise to saue his owne head, and hide him
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:14649:63"/>
selfe vntill the daunger be past, and the doue will not crastelic de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise anie harme to anie other: so the man of God must be wise as the serpent, and not be carelese of his saftie, (for God hath giuen him reason to defend him selfe and foresee mischiefes and prouide for them) nor he must not be craftie to hurt others, as the doue is not: but he must rather thinke, that the wicked men, whom Sathan hath so possessed, will leaue nothing vndone that may ouerthrow the good, &amp; therefore they ought to be as wise, circumspect, &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to defend them-selues &amp; their countrie from such mischiefes by all honest meanes, as the other shall be busie to deuise or doc them anic harme, or else they shallbe guiltie of their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and manie others, which cannot be defended in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, nor the Lord can alowe it in iustice, being hurtfull to so manie.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. <hi>I set in the lowe places. Nehemiah</hi> by leauing the Court where he liued in case, is now come to a goodlie bargaine. First he was master of the worke, set euerie man in order, that none loyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nor wrought otherwyes then he was appointed, and that none troubled his fellowes, dayly dabling in the mire, morter, and clay, as long as he might, and yet would not be wearie, with great displeasure and grudging of those that should be his friends and helpers, but now is become a warrier, is driuen to put on armour, keepe watch and ward night and daie, and ouersee them him selfe, to sett his people in aray, and appoint them their standing places, giuing them their weapons, and teaching them what they should doe. Such reward shall they haue that sorsake the world and will build Gods house and Citie: God and the world cannot be friends: and that maketh so few Courtiers to tread this trodde. <hi>Moses</hi> being brought vp in <hi>Pharaos</hi> house, and might haue bene called as sonne to <hi>Phàraos daughter, refused the Court, and chose to be in trouble with his</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Hebrew. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>breethren the Iewes, and serue the Lord, rather then to haue all the dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Court,</hi> liuing in Idolatrie and displeasure of God. I know not many courtiers which might thaue liued in the court with such fauour &amp; authoritie, &amp; would not, to set by these two men. God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the number &amp; make many earnest folowers of them. <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> now like a good Captaine <hi>setteth some of his souldiers in trenches</hi> that they could not be seene be-low, where the walls were lowest, that if any entred there, they should be entrapped by and by: <hi>some he setteth on the top of the walls with their bowes,</hi> that they might both be seene far of, &amp; so make the enemy afraied to come neere, when they should see them in such readines, &amp; also that they might shoot
<pb facs="tcp:14649:64"/>
farre of at them, and hurt them afore they could assault the walls. And like a wise Captaine <hi>he setteth all of one kindred together,</hi> that one should be true to another, as kinsfolkes will rather then Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. It hath bene a common practise with vs of late to take the souldiers of one countrie from their Captaine whome they know and loue, and put them to a straunger whome they know not, what goodnes hath come of it, let wise men iudge: in my opinion little or none, except it were the priuate profit of the Captaine. But sure it is not without great cause that the holie ghost declareth here the order that <hi>Nehemiah set them in by their kinreds togither,</hi> teaching vs that nature will moue one kinsman to be truer in al daungers to an other of his kinred, rather then to a stranger: and that one kinsman will open his griefe to his freind, and take comfort at his hand, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to him whome he knoweth not. He cannot be bold with a straunge Captaine, nor a straunge souldier, and that discourageth him, and casteth downe his spirits: but when neighbours, freinds, and Cosinnes are togither vnder a Captaine, whom they loue and know, it imboldneth them, they cleaue togither like Burrs, if one be in daunger the rest will not forsake him, where as straungers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man seeketh to saue him-selfe, and careth not for his fellow, but letteth him shift for him selfe, as he may. This godly Example of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in placing friends togither is to be followed, rather then the priuate profit of one Captaine. How strangely straunge Captaines haue vsed their straunge souldiers it is straunge to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and pitie it is to see the souldier how vnwilling he is to serue among straungers, and manie times doeth serue but slowly. I haue seene when a meane gentleman hath gone to the warrs, his renants would striue who should goe with him first, &amp; if he refused anie to goe, he thought his master loued him not: but now by this deuiding of neighbour fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neighbour, friends &amp; friends from other, neither the gentleman that cannot haue his trustie men about him, nor the souldier hauing not such a Captaine and fellowes as he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, trusteth, &amp; knoweth, both the master &amp; the man seeketh by al means to tarie at home, &amp; so the worst men are thrust out to serue which is to be lamented. God amend it. It is possible some will think me to saucie to enter into matters wherein I am not skilled: but that forceth not, the trueth must be spoken, though some doe grudge, and this Example of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> shall defend me, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is saied to the contrary. The scripture teacheth generally euery man his duety what kinde of life soeuer he liue, &amp; God wil require that euery man should frame him-selfe to that rule: therefore the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14649:64"/>
preacher may enter into consideration of euery mans duetie so farr as the scripture leadeth him, euen to the controulling of the mint, as master <hi>Latimer</hi> of worthie memorie, being found fault withall for medling in such matters, alledged the Prophet saying: <hi>thy siluer</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Esai. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>is turned into drosse.</hi> When <hi>Iohn Baptist beganne to baptize, and all sorts of people resorted vnto him,</hi> amongst whome came the souldiers too, <note place="margin">Luk. 3.</note> he taught both the souldiers and all the rest how to behaue them selues in their kinde of life, if they would receiue the gospel. Here may be noted also what simple kinde of weapons were then vsed in the warrs, and how many cruel and subtill deuises we haue of late deuised one to kill another. Here is none other mentioned but <hi>the sword,</hi> if they ioyned handstroks: <hi>the Speare,</hi> to push them away if they scaled the walls: <hi>and the bowe</hi> to shoote a far of, to keep them from comming neere the walls. What glorie this Realme hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with these weapons, and specially by the Bowe, all Chronicles declare, and all nations for that feared vs: but how in shooting the old gloric of this land is decaied, and gaming and alehouses haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to the hurt of the youth, wasting of their monie, weakning of their strength, and decaie of this worthie exercise, good men la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and few goe about to amend. <hi>Shooting</hi> is a speciall thing, not giuen to al men and nations, but chiesly to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> first while their kingdome stoode: then to the <hi>Persians,</hi> who yet can doe som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with it, and then to the English men, who haue wrought great feats by it. Few histories make any mention of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries that could or did vse it much in the warres, and if there were some few among them that could doe something in it, it was to small purpose or none in the battail. Looke at our neighbours rounde about vs, euen to the <hi>Scottish</hi> man which goeth neerest vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, and comming both of one Auncetor, and it will easilie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare how true it is.

afore rehearsed, which were long afore this time, will testifie. By the which the Auncientie of the scripture appeereth afore all other learning: and yet the Papist will stand on his Auncientie and saie, they haue all olde learning on their side, where their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Popes were but yesterday, in comparison of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which were elder then any of these by three thowsand yeares: but such lewd Doctrine is meete to come from them that will not obey the trueth. <hi>The Persians loued shooting so well, that they set an Archer on their Coyne of Gold which was of great vallour,</hi> as we doe the Angel: and as we vse to saie, when a man hath great sutes and cannot be so well heard as he would wish, that he must make Angels to speake for him, and they cannot be saied nay, which thing by report is too common and true at this day: so <hi>the King of Persia, being offended at Agesilaus, gaue the Athenians thirtie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand peeces of this great Coyne of Gold of theirs:</hi> which thing when <hi>Agesilaus</hi> vnderstoode, he saied merilie, but yet truely, that <hi>he was driuen awaie with thirtie thowsand Bowmen</hi> (meaning their coyne of Gold, which had an Arhcer coyned on it) <hi>and how should he a poore man be able to withstand so manie Archers.</hi> No more truelie then our men can say Angels nay. For the feats of warr done by our Elders in this land with Bowemen, I referr it to be considered by our owne Chronicles. But I will not enter into a full discourse of this matter, it belongeth not so much to our purpose: this short touching of it shall suffice now. Who so listeth to see more of the commendation of it in time of peace, may reade that learned Booke which Master <hi>Askame</hi> wrote of it.</p>
                  <p>As these <hi>Samaritans</hi> ceased not continually to hinder the building of this earthly <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> so Sathan by his members, <hi>Papists, and Arrians,</hi> &amp;c. ceaseth not in euerie age to hinder the comfortable building of Christs Kingdome and spirituall Ierusalem, by all meanes that he can deuise: and neuer more feirselie then now in our daies. But as God stirred vp <hi>Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> then, to defend and encourrage the people to goe forward with their building, notwithstanding their cruell assaults, so the Lord stirreth vp some few to stand in defence of this trueth, and Gods enemies winne not at their hands so much as they looke for.</p>
                  <p>And as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> here <hi>setteth the People in order by their Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reds, with their Swords, Speares, and Bowes, to defend the workemen,</hi> so should good Magistrates place euerie where stout Souldiers, of one doctrine, and Religion, in dued with the speciall gifts

of the holie Ghost, as knowledge of tongues, discerning of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Doctrines, able to confute the false, and defend the trueth, with gifts of vtterance, Eloquence, and persuading, and with gouernment, to bridle the vnrulie and troublesome folke, that the flock of Christ Iesus which he bought so dearelie, be not drawne awaie headlong by deuillish Doctrine, from their <hi>Lord and Shepheard of their soules the Lord Christ.</hi> God for his mercie sake stir vp the hearts of Magistrates, and speciallie Courtiers, to set this example before them-selues, and diligentlie to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, that we be not found more negligent in this our free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie vnder the light of the Gospell in seruing our God faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie, then these poore Iewes were vnder the Ceremonies of Moses after their Captiuitie. A lamentable case to see how bold and earnest these Iewes were against so manie feirce ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and how colde, negligent, and carelesse, we that beare the names of Christians be.

We are lulled on sleepe, we wallow in wealth, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get thee, we seeke our owne aduauncement in the world, and care little or nothing for the aduauncement of thy Kingdome, thy glorie, thy people, and the wholesome doctrine of saluation, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs in thy holie word.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. <hi>Andwhen I sawe them, Irose and saied to the Nobles.</hi> After that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had thus, like a good Captaine, set the people in aray by their kinreds, appointed them their standing places and weapons, and conueied him-selfe into some corner to breath, and refresh him-felfe, he looked about him, and behold, <hi>Sanballat, Tobias,</hi> and their fellows were at hand, appeared in sight, and Marched forward in Battaile aray toward the walls stoutlie, to dash them out of countenaunce, if it had beene possible. But then <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> though he was wearie and satte downe to rest him-selfe, besturred him, rose vp quicklie, forgatte that he was wearie, plucked vp his spirits, and called the Nobles, officers, and the people together: and because the time would not suffer him to vse manie words, the enemies drawing so neere, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a short, but a pithie oration to them, and in effect so much as could haue bene spoken in a long time and at leisure: and all to this end, to imbolden them <hi>to cast away the feare of man, and feare the mightie Lord of hostes, in whose hand it was to dispose as he thought good: and not onely that, but the honestie of the cause was such, that they could not, without great shame and reproch, leaue it vndefended, so farre as
<pb facs="tcp:14649:66"/>
their powre would stretch.</hi> They fought against infidels for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce of God his true Religion, they fought for their bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, for their sonnes, their daughters, their wiues, houses, life, lands, and goods. They had of late bene in captiuitie, they felt the smart what it was to liue vnder straunge Princes: God had mercifullie restored them to their countrie againe, and prospered well the beginning of their buildings, and should they now cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardlie flie awaie, loose all that they had gotten, fall into their owne slauerie, liue among Idolaters, their wiues and children to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners afore their face? He that had any blood in him, &amp; cyther fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God, or loued his countrie and people, would first step out in so good a cause, manfullie defend it spend his blood in it, would striue who should be the first and foremost to giue the onset, not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but that mightie God, who had so prospered their doings hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, would with good successe finish it to their great comfort &amp; perpetuall commendation. <hi>Ioab</hi> vseth the same reason to Abisai and his Souldiours, <hi>tofight for their people and countrie.</hi> God neuer fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them that faile not them-selues: doe thou thy duetie, and no doubt God wil fill out the rest.

But in Gods cause when those that should be furtherers of it, waxe colde, and eyther will not, or dare not, then those whom God do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus earnestly moue, may, and ought, so much as in them is, encourage all sortes of men, manfully to goe forward in seruing the Lord. And whereas feare is a great hinderer of al wel doing, he beginneth to pluck away that block first, which being remoued, boldnes must needes follow and take place. Feare not saith he their braggs, their sterne countenance, &amp; proud lookes, their glistering armour, their great bands of souldiers, their mighty captaines, their long speares, &amp; sharp swords, they are cowards, their heart faileth them, they are like mules with golden Trappers, and costly foote-cloth, which outwardly shew brauely vnto the eie, but vnderneath are slow Asses and dull beasts. So these big boasting Thrasones and vaunting <hi>Milites gloriost</hi> make a shew of great matters as though they would and could pull downe all, destroy all afore them at their pleasure, where in dede they be faint harted lubbers and dare do nothing, as it appeereth here after. Our god is an almighty Lord at whose looke the earth quaketh and the deuils tremble: and these wretches be vile wormes meat, mortall men, Gods enemies, and

children of darkenesse. Our God alone is strong ynough for all the deuils in hell, and out ofhell, withall their members and partakers. Why should ye be afraid to fight in his quarrel? <hi>he hath done what he wil in heauen, earth, and hel,</hi> as the Psa. saith. All things bend when he doth beck, &amp; all be at his call and commandement. Shrink not from this Captaine &amp; he will defend you, manfullie fight vnder his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and the victorie shall be yours. The worst that the wretches can doe you is to hurt the bodie: but our God teacheth vs to <hi>feare him that casteth both bodie and soule into hell fire.</hi> Remember the old graund Captaine of our fathers, <hi>Moyses,</hi> when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (with a mightie power chased them to the red Sea, where the people were afraid and saw no remedie but either leape into the Sea and be drowned, or els tarie Pharaoh and be killed) call to remembraunce <hi>I say,</hi> what <hi>Moses</hi> in the like distresse and ieopardie then, that ye be now in, said vnto them in few words. <hi>Standstil,</hi> saith Moses, <hi>behold and marke the</hi>

The greeuous punishment which is threatned to feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, is the second and euerlasting death bothe ofbodie and soule: which, whosoeuer hath any true feare of God in him, will tremble &amp; quake when he thinketh on it: be not therefore afraid of them, but plucke vp your stomaches and boldlie stand in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that Citie, which the Lord God hath giuen you to serue him in. <hi>To fight for sonnes, daughters, wiues and houses,</hi> I thinke it were an easie matter to perswade anie man: for they be our flesh and bones, and we be readie ynough to such matters: and surelie not without a cause: for both the law of god &amp; the law ofnature bindeth vs to defend them in their wel doings. <hi>Moses</hi> in his law saieth, that <hi>if thou traueyling by the way doe sinde thine enemies asse fallen in the mire vnder his load, thou shalt not passe by but help him vp:</hi> surelie <hi>the meaning of this</hi> law was not for the asse, but as Saint Paul alledging the like law, <hi>thou shalt not mussle the mouth of the oxe that treadeth out the corne,</hi> sayed; <hi>Had God care for the Oxe? Nay verely, but for you it is writen</hi>

                     <hi>that ye should feede your painful teachers which labour for you as the Oxe.</hi> So, I say, this law was not made for the Asse his sake, but euen for thy enemie, who is ouerloden, as the Asse was, and speciallie those, to whom thou art bound by nature: for else thou art worsse then an infidel.</p>
                  <p>But in this matter men are sone resolued what to doe: there is a harder matter in mens minds, that is, <hi>whether we should fight for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as these men did, or no.</hi> We see great troubles in manie countries against their Princes in our days for religion, and many doubt what they may do herein. Let the case stand as these mens did, &amp; it is sone answered. These <hi>Samaritans, Sanballat</hi> and his fellowes, were no Princes, but subiect to <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> as the Iewes were, nor had anie authoritie ouer them: they were Gods enemies, and did the Iewes wrong, that would not suffer them to goe forward with that buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which the King had giuen them licence and commission to do. Therefore they might iustlie defend them selues against such theeues. Further here is to be noted also that they defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues onelie &amp; doe not inuade the other, offering anie violence to them, but would quietlie enioy their owne, if they might. And this is a greate difference in the warrs, whether a man stand to defense of him selfe &amp; his people in any cause, or doe inuade others and offer them wrong. Defending a mans selfe is alowed by all lawes in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie causes, and yet in religion by flying, and not by drawing the sword against his Prince: but to rebell and draw the sword against thy lawfull Prince for religion, I haue not yet learned, nor cannot alow off it, nor I cannot see how so manie martirs in all ages would haue submitted them selues to death willinglie, if they might haue fought for it. <hi>Peter drew his sword to cut of Malchus eare,</hi> and would haue fought for his master: but Christ Iesus bad him <hi>put vp his Sword:</hi> for if the matter stoode by fighting, <hi>he could aske his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie father, and he would giue many thousands of Angels to fight for him.</hi> The Prophet biddeth the <hi>Israelites in their captiuitie in Babilon pray</hi>

Therefore as Christ ouercame his enemies by suffring, so they that be Christes shall get the victorie by pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entnes &amp; bearing the crosse, not by rebelling &amp; drawing the sword.

As <hi>Nehemiah</hi> therefore here <hi>encourageth the Nobles, Rulers, and people, manfullie to stand in defence of their countrie, Citie, wiues, children, breethren, and howses, against their enemies:</hi> so in the spirituall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ, must the Preachers &amp; Pastors encourage all sorts from the highest to the lowest, manfully to stand to that wholsome doctrine of saluation, which they haue bene taught out of Gods holie booke, and not be afraid nor chaunge with euerie blast of winde, and turne with the world, as all sorts in this land haue done, to the offence of Gods maiestie, and their great reproch, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ofthose that were the heades and should haue bene staies to others. Religion is not a thing at the pleasure of Princes, to chaunge as they list (though the outward circumstances in it may be chaunged by them) but it is the vnchaungeable will and determinate pleasure of the almightie Lord of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, decreed by high Court of parlament in heauen, afore the world was made, and declared vnto man by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles, in such times as his infinite wisdome thought meete, and cannot be altered by anie man nor authoritie in anie age. <hi>I am God, and am not chaunged, saith the Lord, my thoughts and my waies are not like your thoughts and waies</hi> which are euer changeable and vncertaine, but I am euer one and chaunge not. Stick therfore fast vnto that Lord which shrinketh not a waie from his people, but manfully deliuereth them, &amp; by suffering we shall haue the victory, as our Captaine Christ Iesus had: for <hi>if we suffer with him,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>we shall reigne with him.</hi> In bearing his crosse and sufferance then standeth our conquest, not in Rebelling; in dying to him, and not liuing to our selues. Marke now the mightie hand of God figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for his people, and the cowardly harts ofthese boasting brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, how sone they come to nought: <hi>they but hard tell that the Iewes vnderstoode their conspiracie, how they thought to haue come sodenlie &amp; murthered them, &amp; that they were readie in armoure to withstand and defend them-selues against them, their harts faile them, they runne away, lay downe their weapons,</hi> and the Lord defeated their whole purpose and deuises. Thus lightheads they had, that when they heard tell that the Iewes went forward with this building, they prepare them selues to fight with them, and when they heard tell that they were readie to defend themselues, they runne a waie. Such rashe heades haue wicked men alwaies, vnconstant, and changing with euerie winde: but <hi>Nehemiah</hi> is euer one man, constant and bolde in well doing, and goeth forward in building Gods Citie, notwithstanding all their braggs.

These and such other terrible exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples may teach men to be wise and that they take nothing in hand against the Lord, though it be neuer so wiselie deuised: for it shall proue true that the Prophet saith: <hi>there is no wisdome, no foresight, no counsel against the Lord.</hi> All shal be ouerthrowne, and the more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it is, the sooner it shall be cast downe: none can stand against him: he onely is wise, and all other that haue it not from him, be fooles. Good men may also learne here not negligentlie to looke to them-selues, nor to goe nakedlie without weapon, to yeald them selues into their enemies hands: for soe they may be guiltie of their owne death. <hi>A weapon boods peace,</hi> as the common saying is: for God hath made the weapon to defend the bodie, as he made the meat to feede the bodie: and these braggers like theues will set on no man, that they see weaponed, and wil stand against them, but on those that be naked or faint harted, they will be cruel. God requireth not such peakishnesse in a man, that he suffer him-felfe to be wounded, that by the law of nature aloweth euery man to defend him-selfe with weapons against such theeues, if peace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwaies be had.</p>
                  <p>Now that their enemies were vanquished and fled away, they brag not of their strength and courage, they goe not to the Tauern to tosse potts, and boast of their great victorie, but in the feare of god returne to the walls, &amp; euerie man falleth to his worke againe. Thus we learne here both in the spirituall battell against Sathan &amp;

All histories declare that the greatest Kingdomes which came to great powre and authoritie by taking paines, by painfull battells, by suffering hunger and cold, euen the same, when they fell to idlenes, wallowing in wealth and riotous feasting &amp; daintines, they lost their former glory faster then they wonne it.

Thus must the men of God neither be rash in attempting things vnaduisedlie, nor negligent in proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding things necessary for their defense, or desperatly feare the brags and powre of the enemie: but in the feare of god stand to their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full defense, committing the successe to the almightie, whose wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ruleth al things at his pleasure, who defendeth his people, &amp; no power can withstand him.</p>

and pray continually, that we be not taken napping. These yong men stood not naked, but had Armour of all sorts, both to defend them-selues, and to hurt the enemie: to shoot and smite farr of, and keepe them that they drew not neere: so must euerie christian in his spirituall battell against Sathan and his members <hi>put on the whole spirituall armour of God, which S. Paul teacheth him, that he may quench the sierie dartes of Sathan,</hi> and not stand naked of Gods grace, trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his owne strength. It is maruell to see, how <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> being so long a Courtier, is now become so cunning a souldier on the sodaine, being not vsed to it afore: <hi>he setteth the yong men before, to beare the brunt of the battell,</hi> as most strong and able to beare it: and <hi>the rulers come behinde,</hi> as being wise men to direct &amp; teach the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sort what they should doe, &amp; how to behaue them-selues. yong heads of them-selues are vnskilful, and therefore it is necessarie they should be directed by others: so that when youthfull courage is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by the sage counsell of the wise and auncient ruler, the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel wil fal out wel. Tullie saied well, <hi>parum sunt arma foris nisisit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silium domi:</hi> and as it were determining, whether strength or wisdom in the warrs be more profitable, he saieth; <hi>Cedant armatoge, concedat laurea linguae.</hi> Courage and strength without wisdom is foolish rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and wisdome without courage &amp; strength, is feareful coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines: ioine them together, &amp; they make a perfect souldier. And here the wise ruler commeth behinde in a place of more safetie, and as it were a thing more necessary in the warres to saue a wise captaine &amp; Counseller, then to saue the strong &amp; lustie souldier. The strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that a man is, wanting wisdome, the sooner he ouerthroweth him-self: as a tree that the wind hath shaken loose at the roote, the higher &amp; greater that it is, the sooner it is ouerthrowne.

Let Christian men looke into this notable example, &amp; be ashamed of themselues, that are afraid of euerie blast of winde. And where these people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnder the dark shadowes, &amp; heauy burthen of <hi>Moses</hi> law, would take these paines for building an earthly City, to serue their God in: yet we, that liue vnder that blessed light of the Gospel so plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously powred on vs, lie loytering &amp; will not open our eies to see the light, nor put forth our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, to receiue that, which is so freely offered to vs, that it would fal into our mouthes, if we would gape.

                     <hi>He keepeth the Trumpet by himselfe</hi> at his elbowe, to blowe when and after what sort he would commaund: &amp; good reason it should be so: for he that was appointed to be the chiefe builder by the Kings commission, reason would that he should haue the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the chiefe things that belonged thereto, at his discretion. And euerie one would not be trusted with such a charge, as the <hi>Trumpet</hi> was: for some were hollow-hearted, bewrayed his secrets to <hi>Sanballat,</hi> and his fellowes, and receiued letters from them. Some gaue ill counsell, and would haue had him to haue left of his worke: as appeered by <hi>Iudas</hi> afore in this Chapter, and by <hi>Semias Noadia,</hi> &amp;c. in the 6. Chapter. The <hi>Trumpet</hi> is a thing of such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in the warres, that if it be not in the hand both of a skilfull and trustie man, he may discomfite the whole host on a sudden. Therefore he trusteth him-selfe best with that charge. <hi>Moses com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the blowing of the Trumpet vnto the sonnes of Aaron,</hi> as a thing <note place="margin">Num. 10.</note> of great trust and importance, and they were counted as men of better credit then other, for their vocation sake: though now, I cannot tell how euerie common man is put to that office, though his credit be not much. God in his Law made such a count of the <hi>Trumpet</hi> in the warres, that <hi>he appointed yearly a solemne feast and holie-day of the Trumpets,</hi> to put them in remembrance how oft he had giuen them the victorie by sounding the <hi>Trumpet,</hi> that they should not brag of their owne strength, and policie, as though they had conquered all by their owne power, but praise the Lord of hostes, who vanquished their enemies, and reioyce in him. Yet now I cannot tell how it falleth out, euerie thing being turned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie waies, the <hi>Trumpet</hi> is vsed at great feastes and solemnities, to make vs merie rather then to stirr vs vp to anie praising of the Lord for his blessings bestowed vppon vs, or to put vs in remembrance of the last <hi>Trumpe,</hi> when <hi>the dead shall arise out of their graues,</hi> and the Lord shall come in his Maiestie to iudge the world. These were good lessons to thinke on, at the sounding of the <hi>Trumpe,</hi> and not onely for mirth, and solemnitie, to striue who shall blow the lowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and be the meriest, though mirth is not ill.</p>

In warrs, and speciallie in daungers, manie words are not to be vsed, but briefly the captaines &amp; souldiours are to be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of their duetie, &amp; encouraged to go forward boldlie. So <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah</hi> telleth them here of their daunger: for the compasse of the walles was great, the laborers were not manie, and yet those that were, were scatered on euerie corner of the walls: one farre from another, so that when anie assault was made, one should not, nor could not be readie for to help another in any short time. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of the walls at this time is thought by good writers to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine miles about, and yet was enlarged as much afterward by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod.</hi> Manie thousands would not serue to manne such a ground, to keepe out the enemie, but while they defended one peece, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would be assaulted. Thus in peace he prouideth against daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to come, as all wise men will: for els oft it will be to late if such good foresight benot had. A wise man should not say, <hi>had I wist this or that,</hi> I woul haue prouided for this&amp; that: prouide for the worst&amp; the best wil saue it selfe: and if the worst fall not out, thou hast more to thanke God of. Possibly some man would thinke <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to bolde or rather sawcie, that he being a straunger and new come, would take in hand to teach the nobles and rulers what they had to doe: but surelie he that with reason will consider all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, shall easilie perceiue that neither he passeth the bounds of modestie &amp; duetie, nor taketh more on him, then he had authority giuen him to doe. The king by commission appointed him to be the chiefe doer at this building, as appeereth hereafter, &amp; therefore he presumed no farther then he lawfullie might: and in manie ofthe rulers he perceiued either a coldnes or fearefulnes to set forward this worke, so that if he had taried on their leisure, litle or nothing should haue bene done at al. So in gods cause a man must be bold &amp; blush not, &amp; if he see them slow that should be forward, he may and ought with modestie to put them in remembrance of their dutie, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> doeth here, neither chiding nor reuiling them, but bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly, godly, quietly &amp; modestly encourage them, telling them the daunger that hangeth ouer them, if they do not wisely prouide for it, &amp; manfully withstand it. <hi>A man forewarned, is halfe armed, as th s common saying is.</hi>

And all this is to let vs see, that all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God do worke all things himselfe, &amp; as he hath appointed, so they fall out, yet he worketh them not without vs: we must not be idle, we must shew our diligence and due obedience to our God that hath made vs, and commaunded vs to exercise our selues in these things, and yet, <hi>when we haue done allwe can,</hi> all the praise must be giuen to him, <hi>and we must say, we be vnprofitable seruants. We be as an axe in the Carpenters hand,</hi> where the axe may not claime the praise of well doing from his Master that worketh with it: and though the axe be a dead instrument without life or feeling, and man hath life, witt, and reason giuen him, to doe things withall, yet is man as vnable to worke his owne saluation without the free mercie and speciall grace of God, as the axe is vnable to build the house without the direction and ruling of the Carpenter. <hi>Crearis, sanaris, saluaris, quid horum tibi ex te homo?</hi> saieth Bernard. Let euery man be diligentand a painfull labourer in his vocation, and worke his owne saluation, as farr as an instrument may, not loytering,

nor liuing vnprofitably, thinking that God wil bring such things to passe if we lie downe and sleepe: but the chiefe praise &amp; effect must be'giuen in all good things to God alone. The Lord hath promised nothing to idle bellies, and vnto him that laboreth to serue his god faithfully, he hath promised his sure aide, &amp; will surely performe it. Adam in paradise was not suffred to be idle, euen in his innocencie afore he sinned: and shal we misers that haue so oft &amp; greeuously offended our mercifull God, thinks to liue as we list at our ease? <hi>Iosue</hi> at his death putteth the people in rememberaunce <hi>how the Lord had fought for them, and driuen out their enemies,</hi> and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <note place="margin">Ios. 23.</note> them still to serue their God faithfullie, and forsake strange Gods, he promiseth them, that <hi>if they will so doe, the Lord will fight for them still,</hi> &amp; so did <hi>Moses</hi> afore him. Gods bare promise by his word is surer then any promise made by man, though you haue neuer so manie good sureties and bonds with forfetures, and it be sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">Exod. 14.</note> and deliuered, and deuised as cunninglie as law can thinke. God is trueth it selfe, and therefore cannot lie, and what so euer he promiseth, he performeth: for else he should be vntrue, like a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable man, which cannot be. God graunt vs such Captaines as <hi>Moses, Iosue, and Nehemiah</hi> were, that with like persuasions they may encourage their Souldiers. For surely if they went to the field with like minde, faith, reuerence, &amp; due obedience vnto the Lord, that these Godlie men did, the same God liueth still, and would blesse their enterprises, as he did the other: for he is not wearie of well doing and releeuing his people.</p>

Such earnest Zeale the Lord powreth into his seruants, when he will declare his maiestie and mercie to the world. For as the greedie marchant for loue of him selfe runneth by sea and land, so far as sea or land will carie him, to encrease his worldlie goods, so he that is infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with this spirit of iealousy toward gods house, wil go through thick and thinne with wisdome, feareth no daungers, and wil suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer neyther open enemie to inuade, nor flattering friend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the deare Spouse of his Lord and master, but manfullie wil stand in defence against all sorts, deale they neuer so cunningly. I cannot tel whether is more diligent &amp; praise worthy, the <hi>souldiers</hi> or the <hi>workemen.

a good peece of the day is spent afore he come at his worke, then must he haue his breakfast, though he haue not earned it, at his accustomed houre, or els there is grudging &amp; murmuring: when the clocke smiteth, he wil cast downe his burthen in the mid-waie, and what-soeuer he is in hand with, he will leaue it as it is, though manie times it is marred afore he come againe: he may not loose his meat, what daunger soeuer the worke is in. At noone he must haue his sleeping time, then his beuer in the after-noone, which spendeth a great parte of the day: and when his houre commeth, at night, at the first stroke of the clock hecasteth downe his tooles, leaueth his worke, in what need or case soeuer the worke standeth. The common souldier thinketh long while his course is to watch&amp; warde, it is colde standing on the walls, he must to the Ale-house, refresh him-selfe with gaming, swearing, whooring, or elsse he thinketh him-selfe no bodie: he thinketh it shame to liue honestlie in order. Thus all sorts are out of order: and though Abbeyes be gone, yet the Abbey-lubbers which will worke vntill they be cold, eate vntill their bellie ake, and sleepe vntill their bones ake, are too common in euerie house. A lither daies worke is thought with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie no sinne, but a pastime, and yet is it theeuerie to take the daies wages, and doe not a good daies worke for it. Saint <hi>Paul biddeth seruants obey their Masters, not onely when they stand by and looke on,</hi>

                     <hi>but in their absence, and where they see them not.</hi> What is more hard in these daies, then to finde a faithfull true seruant? Good masters complaine and finde great lack, though manie be better rewarded then they deserue. It is lamentable to see: the stones in the wall many times beare witnes of the murmuring of the one ag ainst the other. The seruanthe will write on the wall, <hi>Fidelis seruus perpetuus Asinus:</hi> The master wil answere, deserue and then desire: and both misliking the one and the other, when the seruant cannot haue that he gapeth for, then he taketh bribes, and the master must winck at it, because he will not otherwaies preferr him, so both being to blame, both procure Gods anger towards them. <hi>Beda</hi> considering the great troublesthat fell on the building of this second Temple &amp; wals, asketh <hi>why it should fall out so now, rather then in the building of the tabernacle by Moses, or the first temple by Salomon, which both were finished with great quietnesse:</hi> and when he hath mused on it long, he saith, <hi>that it fared with this outward Temple as it doeth with euerie par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man, that is the spirituall Temple of the Lord.</hi> when God made man in his innocencie, it had bene easie for him to haue stood, ifhe had would: but after that he fell, it was much harder to restore him

againe. It is harder to repaire an old rotten house, then to build a new: And to make an old man strong, then a young. God made <hi>Adam</hi> with a word easilie, and breathed life into him: but after that <hi>Adam</hi> fell, what trouble and miserie fel afore he could be restored? Christ Iesus must come downe from heauen vnto the earth, nay into Hell, to pull vs out of hell: he must be accused, whipped, scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, falslie condemned, thrust to the heart with a speare, die, and be buried, ascend vnto his father againe, open heauen gates, which afore our sinnes had locked vp, and abide manie moe sorowes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we could be restored into Gods fauour againe, and folow him where he sitteth on the right hand of his father. So it is an easie matter to enter into Gods Church by Baptisme, but if thou fall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, how hard it is to rise againe, daylie experience teacheth. We mustrepent, fast, pray, giue almes, forsake our selues, condemne our selues, with bitter teares and trembling worke our saluation, stand in continual warr against the deuil, the world, and our owne affection: which thingsto do, are more common in our mouthes, then in our liues, and more doe talke of them, then practise them.

A good Captaine will so prouide both for day &amp; night in peace &amp; warre, that the enemie, who is euer to be feared, euen when he pretendeth most quietnes and friendship, and when he seemeth to flee, retireth ost on a sodaine, to see whether there be anie pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er remaining to hold him out: he will forsee, I say, that the enemie haue no vantage against him, but euerie place be well manned and fensed to withstand him. <hi>He willeth the people therefore that euery man shall watch in the street afore his owne dorewith his seruants,</hi> that no mischiefe fell out within the Citie, where so manie hipocrites and hollow-hearted people and vnwilling folke of all sorts to further this worke did dwell. The outward enemie might do much harme, but inward treason might ouerthrow all in a short time. For the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemie the watch of the wal would be able to withstand him, &amp; giue warning to the rest for aide: and if any practise were within the Citie, the watch in the streetes might suppresse it for a time, vntill more aide came.

God for his mercie raise vp some, that though not with that fulnes of spirit, yet with such courage and measure of grace, as shall please him to giue, some one may, in ielousie of spirit, take in hand the repayring of the olde ruinous walls of Gods Church, house, and Citie, that both the

outward and inward enemie, which haue wrongfully possessed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded, and wasted the Lords inheritance, may be vanquished and suppressed: and Gods Children may in quietnes of minde worship and serue the Lord our God, as he hath taught vs. After all this wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and warding, he is not wearie, but, <hi>we will to our worke againe,</hi> saith he, <hi>as soone as the day peepes.</hi> Who could or would haue taken these paines but he? it would haue discouraged anie man but him. But <hi>Nehemiah</hi> knew well that Sathan neuer ceaseth to trouble the Lords flocke: and though slothfull Idlenes be meetest for him to worke by, yet he forsaketh not the painfull labouring man, and will assault him like wise. Let euerie man therefore take heede how he standeth, and see that he fall not: for Sathan refuseth no sort of men to ouerthrow them, no time, nor place he disdaineth, but is glad if he can deuour the poorest simple sheepe of the Lords, if he cannot meete with a better pray. The people are worthie no lesse praise, then the rulers: for they are as readie to obey, as the other to commaund, and so ioyning to gither in the feare of God, brotherlie loue, and due obedience to their rulers, this worke goeth forward, and God blesseth their labour.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Iohn.</note> 
                     <hi>came to ouerthrow the workes of the deuil:</hi> so the deuil ceaseth not by al meanes to ouerthrow, or at the least, so much as in him is, to hinder by his partakers, the building ofGods house, &amp; the setting forth of his glorie. And to declare the vehemency ofthe crie, the holy ghost noteth it by such a word in the Ebrew, as signifieth those vprores &amp; outcries which are made in Rebellious or Seditious Riots, or els ofsuch as crie out for great grief &amp; anguish ofheart. <hi>The parties that make their crie, are the common people and women,</hi> of which it is hard to tell, whether of them is often more importune in outcrying, &amp; many times without iustcause. The people if they smart a litle, &amp; haue not their owne wils fulfilled, are ready to exclame, &amp; women can weep
<pb facs="tcp:14649:76"/>
and howle when they list, and the basest sort are the worst. <hi>The parties against whome they crie, be the Iewes their countrie-men,</hi> bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in kindred, and professing one religion. If this oppression and cruel dealing had bene by straungers, where no mercie is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie shewed nor looked for, it would haue bene lesse marueiled at, and lesse it would haue greeued them: but to be entreated cruelly by their countriemen, kinsmen, &amp; those that serued the same God, and professed the same Religion that they did, and at whose hands they looked for aid and comfort: this was thought so straunge, that it would make anie astonied to heare tell of it. With these circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances the holy ghost setteth out the greatnesse of the cry, to make it more horrible in mens sight, &amp; so the more easilie to bring them to repentaunce, and make them ashamed of their cruel dealings. When the deuil preuayled not by <hi>Sanballat</hi> and his fellowes, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow the building, he setteth now on the poore common sort and wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to crie out against their rulers, thinking by this meanes to ouerthrow all, rather then to procure anie remedie orreliefe for them: Though God of his accustomed goodnesse (turning oft our wicked doings to the setting forth of his Glorie) by this meanes wrought their deliueraunce and libertie. Such is the wisdome of our God, that by our foolishnesse he declareth his mightie powre, wisdome &amp; maiestie: &amp; our ill dealing sheweth forth his iustice &amp; mercie, &amp; that against our wil &amp; meaning.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>And there were that said.</hi> The cause of their Crie is set forth in these 4. verses following: <hi>Hunger, need, oppression, pinching pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and pining penurie,</hi> made them so to crie out. And this is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a fault in our daies in the preaching of the gospel. Some of the pooter sort, though they had not lands and goods, yet God, as he vseth commonlie, had blessed them more then the richer sort with children so manie, that they could not tell how to gett bread for them, except they should sell them as slaues: and where they were free borne, they should now become bond, and be vsed as beastes. What a griefe that is to a good father, that loueth his childe deere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the feare of God, to be driuen, by the vnmercifull dealing of the rich, to sell his owne children for bondmen, I leaue it to the consideration of those that be natural and louing Parents: for none can expresse the greatnes of that griefe, but he that hath bene pinched with it and felt the smart of it. When <hi>Iacob should send litle Beniamin into Egipt with his breethren for corne,</hi> it was long or he could be brought to it and he almost had rather died for hunger, then let him goe from him. What a loue had <hi>Dauid</hi> toward his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14649:76"/>
wicked sonne <hi>Absolon,</hi> euen in the midst of his rebellion, and <hi>what charge gaue he to his captaines, that they should not kill him?</hi> Such is the <note place="margin">2. Sam. Ca. 18.</note> loue of natural Parents towards their children, that they will loue them, and cannot cast them of, euen in their ill doings, though manie times the children be most vnthankeful. Libertie is a thing that euerie man naturallie desireth and by all meanes seeketh for, therefore bondage must needes be such a thing as euery man doeth abhorre and slie from: yet <hi>hunger</hi> is such a thing, that it will breake stonie walls, and rather then a man will beare it continuallie, he will sell landes, goods, wife, children, yea him-selfe, to be slaues for euer. Nay <hi>hunger</hi> is so pinching a paine, <hi>that a woman will eate her owne childe, as in the siege of Ierusalem in Samaria, and Saguntine,</hi> yea a man his owne flesh, rather then he will die for hunger. <hi>Hunger</hi> of all thinges maie not be abidden what inconuenience soeuer fall out after. Consider then what miserable case these poore men were in, that had so manie children, and could get no bread to put in their mouthes: and wicked men, the richer sort, were they, that had brought them to this pouertie, and now would not releeue them in this their extremitie. We read of <hi>a Bishoppe of Mentz in Germanie called Hatto, who had great store of corne and would not releeue the pcore with it in time of great dearth, but let the rats eate it, in reuenge of which, God raised so manie Rats about him, that they droue him from house to house to saue his life: and where he had a strong towre in the midst of the great riuer of Rhene, which yet standeth there to be seene in the middest of the riuer, he thought him selfe sure if he could slie thither: notwithstanding the Rats swam after him thither and there deuoured him, and it is called the Rats tower at this daie.</hi> Salomon saieth, <hi>he that hideth vp his corne, shalbe cursed among</hi>

                     <hi>the people, but blessing shalbe on them that sell it.</hi> God graunt the richer sort pitifull hearts to open their barnes and pursse to the reliefe of the poore, that they maie escape Gods plague and mans cursse.</p>

                     <hi>3. And there were some that sayd.</hi> Thus farre goeth the cry of the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest sort: now followeth another company, that crie as fast, but they are not altogether so poore. They were pinched with hunger, but <hi>they had some lands, vineyards, and houses to lay to pledge, that they might haue some corne to fill their bellies withall.</hi> These men were hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerbitten also: for though they had land, yet they were not able to store it, nor husband it, as husbandry required: and therefore had no profit by it. And like ynough they were such as <hi>Aggeus</hi> the Prophet complained on, saying: <hi>that euerie man buildeth for him
<pb facs="tcp:14649:77"/>
selfe faire houses and Gods house lay vnbuilt, and therefore God plagued them. They had sowen much, and reaped litle, their corne wasted in their Barnes, and their grapes consumed awaie in the winepresse.</hi> These daies were like the time of <hi>Micheas</hi> the Prophet, who crieth out against the rulers for their oppressing of the poore so extreamlie, saying, <hi>they plucke of their skinnes frrom them, and their slesh from their bones.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mich. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>And they eate also the flesh of my people, and flay of their skinne from them, and they breake their bones, and choppe them in pieces, as for the pot, and as slesh within the caldron.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>And there were some that said.</hi> Yet commeth another sort, but they were in some better case, for they had some corne, and no money, and they crie out as fast as the rest. The King of <hi>Persia,</hi> although they had giuen the Iewes licence to goe home to build their Temple and Citie, yet they laid a great taske on them, which they should paie in token of their subiection, and recompence for their liberties sake.</p>
                  <p>The Rulers and chiefe of the Iewes had ingrossed vp in their hands vnmercifullie all the corne and money that could be come by, so that litle or nothing could be gotten to fill their bellies, and to pay the kings tribute withall: therefore <hi>these men must pledge their lands and vineyeards toget some money for this purpose.</hi> O miserable wretches, that had thus miserablie oppressed their poore bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and countriemen, who had taken as much paines as they or more for the defence of their countrie, building of their Temple and Citie: and now in their great neede could finde no comfort nor reliefe at their hands.</p>
                  <p>But these be no new things in the world, for <hi>Amos</hi> the Prophet complaineth likewise of the opression that the richer sort vsed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the poore in his time. <hi>When will this moone passe away,</hi> saie they, <note place="margin">

They liue in penury &amp; hunger, &amp; so do we. They be oppressed with their Rulers, &amp; so be we. Their flesh is partched with toiling in the heat, &amp; frosen vp with cold, and so is ours. Their bellies cleaue to the verie back for hunger, and so doe ours. There
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14649:77"/>
is no strength nor courage left in them, no more is there in vs. They be wearie of their liues, and so be we. They haue not where with to fil their bellie, and couer their back, &amp; no more haue we. They pine away for sorow, and so doe we. They haue nothing left but skinne and bones, and those will scarse cleaue together for sorow, and in the same case be we. If they get a pennie with great labour, one or other is readie to snatch it from them, and so it is with vs. As their children liue in as great slaueric and miserie as their fathers, so doe our children liue as miserablie as we doe. There is no respect of age nor youth neither there nor here, but all kindes of sorow are laide vppon vs without mercie: If this sorow were laide on vs alone we could better beare it, but when we see our children, young infants that cannot help them-selues, to be wrapt in the same miserie that we be, and can help neyther them nor our selues, it doubleth and tripleth our sorow, and yet both is remediles, endles, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortles.</p>
                  <p>These be straunge things which were laid to their charge for their vngentle dealing: butloe, marke and consider farther, and these dealings that folow are much worsse: monsters in nature, and things intollerable, both afore God and man. This word <hi>loe, marke or behold, Ecce,</hi> euer betokneth throughout the scripture some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thing eyther verle good or verie ill, that is spoken of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatlie afterward, and such a one as commonlie falleth not out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men: And the holie Ghost of purpose vseth to marke such notable things with this word <hi>Loe, Ecce,</hi> marke or behold, to put men in remembrance, and awake them to the consideration of the weightie matterthat followeth, that they should not lightlie passe ouer it, but deeplie marke &amp; consider it. Marke the greatnes of this oppression and vnmercifull dealing of the richer sort toward vs their poore breethren and countriemen, of the same religion and seruing the same God that they doe, &amp; haue taken as much paines in building the Temple, Citie, and defending our countrie as they haue done or more: and yet can finde no mercie at their hands, but are made their slaues. For <hi>behold in straunge countries, where our bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren dwell, straungers take their sonnes and daughters by force and make them bond-men and slaues: but we are brought into such miserie, that we our selues are driuen by necessitie through the oppression of our rulers, against our will, &amp; willingly to bring &amp; offer our sons &amp; daughters to them to be their bond-seruants, slaues, and vsed as beasts at their commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we and they may liue, though it be in great miserie, rather then perish for hunger or penurie.</hi> And that ye may see the thing to be true
<pb facs="tcp:14649:78"/>
and not feigned, <hi>some of our daughters are in bondage to them alreadie.</hi> It is a great griefe to parents, to see their owne children taken by straungers &amp; made slaues in their owne sight: but it is a greater grief for fathers to be so cruellie delt with in their owne countrie, at their friends hands and countrie-men, that they shall be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led willinglie, though against their wills to sell their children for slaues, or else die for hunger. At straungers hands, and speciallie if they be of another religion, no man looketh for anie fauour, and if anie doe come, it is more then looked for, and so much the more welcome, when it commeth: but at a friend and countrie-mans hand, where all courtesie is to be looked for, and to finde none but all extremitie, is a griefe aboue all griefes, and mans hart can neuer digest it. It is against God, against nature, and common reason, which teacheth all gentlenes to such: nay it is worsse then beastli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: for one beast will not deale so cruellie with another of his owne kinde and one theefe will not robbe another: therefore to be spoiled and robbed by them of whom they should be defended &amp; releeued, it is a griefe that passeth all sorowes. But if these sorowes could haue an end, or there were anie hope to haue release of them in time, we could take it the better, and haue some comfort: but all hope is taken away, for we haue no powre left, we haue nothing to help our selues withall, we haue wrastled as long as we might, and made shift as long as it would be, but now we are able to beare it no more, we haue nothing left, all is spent and gone, and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deuise where to get anie more: our houses, our lands and vineyeards other men haue cruellie gotten from vs, and vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie doe keepe them, &amp; haue no regard to help vs in this our great and extreame necessitie. We can doe nothing, but crie out on hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, but they hardned their harts and stopt their eares that they will not heare nor pitie vs. Mercie is gone, crueltie, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, and greedines carie them away, that both forget God and themselues. This was the miserable state of that time: a man would haue thought that the miserie, slauerie, and bondage, that they them-selues were in oflate, vnder heathen princes, in strange coun tries, and so late being restored through Gods free and vndeserued goodnes to their owne countrie with libertie, great gifts and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie, to build their temple and Citie, should not haue bene so sone forgotten, but as they then would haue bene glad of some releefe, succor, &amp; courtesie to be shewed vnto them at straungers hands, so they should now shew the like vnto their breethren and countrimen. But such is the wickednes of mans hart, that the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14649:78"/>
more mercies we receiue at Gods hand, the more vnthankefull we be, and such is the malice of <hi>Sathan</hi> against God, his Church and people, that when the Lord of his owne free will and vndeserued goodnes bestoweth his mercie vpon his seruants, the Deuill by his membres and all deuises possible, goeth about to ouerthrow and withdraw all sorts of men, so much as in him is, to a forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of such merciful goodnes bestowed vpon them, and maketh them vnmercifull to their breethren, which haue receiued so great mercie at the Lords hand. Religion is the chiefest help that God hath giuen vs to knowe him by, to bridle our ill affections and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires withall, to make vs loue one another, and set forth his glorie: aud yet if we looke into our selues in these daies, we shall finde that there was neuer greater crueltie, oppression of the poore, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, and dissembling in Gods cause, and vnmercifulnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men, in this land, then hath bene since the beginning of the reforming of Religion amongst vs: yea, and that is more wonderful, of such as would pretend to be fauourers of Religion. Hypocrites, as they vse nothing well, so they misuse Religion, for a cloake to worke their owne wil and pleasure by, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing of all good Religion. Things be fresh in memorie, and cannot be forgotten of them that will not willinglie be blind: but they that list to reede, may see in that worthie Father master <hi>Latimers</hi> Sermons manie such things opened, that then were preached, &amp; would to God they were now reformed, or not fallen to worsse and more shameful dealings, without hope of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As for begging or buiyng good things at the Kings hand, then selling the woods, surueying the land, to the vttermost acre or roods of land, inhaunsing of rents to the highest, from twentie pounds to an hundreth, racking the Tenants by intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fines and Incomes, <hi>Sine fine,</hi> euerie 5. or 7. yeare commonlie, laying load on them, to carie and recarie whatsoeuer is to be done, paying neuer a pennie for their labour, ride and runne, when he is commaunded, &amp;c. Then turne it into the Princes hand againe, get as much, and vse it as ill or worsse, This practise hath bene so common, and declared by diuers, that few can be ignorant of it, and manie crie out on it at this day, but remediles. Yet this is not the worst: if there be anie broken title of the land that maie make question in the Law, or if there be anie daunger of waters or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie charges, reparations, &amp;c. then it is meete for the Prince by exchaunge. When it is rackt to the highest, and a good thing gotten in steede of it, yet that the Prince shall not be thought to
<pb facs="tcp:14649:79"/>
haue an ill bargaine, he will desire to be fermer of it him selfe after the same rate, to stop mens mouthes for a time. As it is reason, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, and Godlie, that the Prince should liberallie reward and encourage the good seruitor: so is it reason againe, that the Princes goodnesse, nor the subiect be misused. Master <hi>Latimer</hi> did freelie speake of these things, not without blame, as peraduenture this wil be to: but would to god this had bene vsed only in the Princes state: but he that will looke abroade and see, shal finde the like to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in meane mens doings. As for pulling downe of Townes, turning tillage to pasture, and turning out the tennants, as <hi>Achab</hi> did to <hi>Naboth</hi> for his vineyeard, that they maie haue elbow roume, make them large demeans or set a shepheard and his dogg, where so manie haue dwelt, and that a poore man may not dwel so neere a man of worship: these be so common among the meanest sort of Purchasers, that men neede not to studie where to finde them. Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Rents &amp; taking vnreasonable fines &amp; gressans, is thought no faulte, it is so common: but some are waxen so cunning, that it is straunge to thinke of. A land-lord is hungrie, and needes must haue fines euen of the poorest sort: and because he wil be thought to deale mercifullie, this waie is deuised. The poore man hath no money, and yet he must pay: his goods, and speciallie his sheepe, though they be few, shall be preised, and according to the rate out of those goods the fine shalbe raised. And that some pitie shalbe thought to be shewed, the poore man shall haue his goods againe by the price, to pay his fine withall, and for occupying of those his owne goods he shall pay a yearlie rent or interest, as it were an vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: and this dealing is thought greate courtesie. <hi>Solon, when he was asked, why, among the other good lawes that he made, he made not one for him that killed his father? He answered, because he would not put men in remembrance, that there was any such a mischiefe, that could come into mens heads:</hi> So I feare the opening of these things shal giue occasion to some ill men, but not to the good, to learne the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises. So readie we be to learne that that is ill. The law in deede o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth sin what it is, that a man should flie from it, and not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for ignorance.

and the Spider gathereth poyson on the same flowres that the Bee gathereth honie: So on the holie word of God &amp; his blessed lawes, which he made for our health and saluation, ill men gather death and damnation, through their owne wickednesse, and no fault in the law nor law-maker. As the <hi>Israelites</hi> cried out in this time iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie on their Rulers for this great oppression, so it is to be feared that in our daies there is no lesse cause to crie aloud, that God may heare, when man will not. There be foure things that crie for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geaunce out of heauen vnto the Lord, and the scripture vseth the same word of crying with them, which for memorie sake are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in these two verses:

Though they be seruants here, yet they be children of the same God, and bought by the same price that their masters be: &amp; therefore ought of dutie to be vsed with Christian and brotherlie charitie, as thou wouldst be, if thou were so. There be other sorts of cruell oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, but not so common as these: As cosening, by cunning dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to creepe into mens bosomes, to be Fcoffies of trust, Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of will, Gardians ofinfants, and these plaie best be trust, but they trust them-selues best, and goe awaie with all. Cariers of corne, victuals, and other commodities out of the realme, to make a dearth within the realme, yea, and oft to seede our enemies, and enrich them-selues, by procuring licenses to carie them out, are to well knowen how hurtfull they be through all countries. As for Ingrossers, forestallers, regraters, leasemongers, they are thought honest me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The lawyers of both sorts by feeding their Clients with

faire words, and the Questmongers with sluttish shifts, making them beleeue their matter to be good, and with long delayes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouerish the suters: and if he come to be Iudge in the same matter afterward, wherein he was a counseller afore, he saith, I spake then as a counseller, &amp; now I must speake as a Iudge, and thinketh that he hath spoken good reason: as though God had made it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full at any time, or in anie case to beare false witnes or speake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes. The Phisitian and the Apothecarie deale so cunninglie, that no man espieth them, and yet be as ill. The cleargie that will take the profit &amp; refuse the paines, Lie at his ease from his charge, and let his sheepe hunger, are not better then the rest. Pen-clearks, shirifs, bailifs, &amp; summoners are not worthie to come to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, for they can returne <hi>Non est inuentus,</hi> when they stand and talke with him: and make cunning delayes, vntill they make men pay double fees for expedition. Worst of all commeth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cutpursse the vsurer and his broker, he standeth on his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he sitteth highest on the benche, and looketh bigge; nay it is crept vnto meane mens dealings, he speaketh courteouslie, and dealeth cruellie: he defendeth his doings to be charitable, when he eateth vp house, lands, and goods, turneth infants a begging, and ouerthroweth the whole kinred: Captaines conuey as cunninglie as Iugglers with leger-demaine. Merchants and Artificers are so honest that they may not be touched: they haue so few faults, that they cannot be told, and yet there could neuer be lawes enough made to bridle them, but they will creepe out. When receiuers are become deceiuers, controulers be pollers, Auditors searchers, and Customers looke through their fingers and keepe their olde cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome: And generallie, <hi>euerie man is a Theefe in his occupation,</hi> as the common prouerbe saith, <hi>there is craft euen in daubing:</hi> it is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that as the course of a streame being stopt, it gathereth a great damme, and being let sodenlie goe, it ouerthroweth all in his way: so Gods anger being staied a time, the windowes in heauen being opened, it wil powre downe on our heads plentifullie. How should Gods plague be farre from vs, when these crie vengeance daily? the theefe by the high way is not so ill as anie of those, that deale not vprighthe in their vocation. For against a theefe a man may fight for his pursse wittinglie, and saie, master theefe gramercie. If a man consider in how litle Tents, Shops, Offices, and houses those men dwell, and how great gaines they get, he shall easilie see where the profitablest ground lieth in the Realm.

If euery one wold amend one, al should be wel streight: but euerie one would amend another, see other mens faults, but not his owne, and therefore all lie still as they did, nothing amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and euery one maketh courtesie who shall beginne. <hi>Sophonie</hi> the Prophet complaineth of his time, and saith, <hi>Thy rulers are roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Lions, thy iudges are rauening wolues in the euening, and will not leaue the bones vntill morning: thy prophets are lewd and vnconstant, thy Priests haue desiled the holy place, &amp; broken thy law.

In the meane time we may mourne, and turne vnto the Lord, that he may forgiue vs, and receiue vs in his manie and great mercies, for we are full of manie &amp; great miseries. The pride of weomen is through the fault of men, therfore they be blameles: God amend vs all. It is written that <hi>Ioseph</hi> in <hi>Egipt</hi> vsed the people <note place="margin">Gen. 47.</note> almost of like sort that they doe here, and yet is he praised and these iustlie reproued: which possiblie some marueile at, not vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the diuersitie of their doings. <hi>Ioseph laid vp corne in the time of plentie, when euerie man had ynough:</hi> these men did it at al times, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect, in plentie and scarsitie. <hi>Ioseph brought the monie into the Kings cofers, to serue the common wealth:</hi> these men laid it vp in their owne Cofers, to their owne priuate vse. <hi>Ioseph bought their cattell for such price as they were worth:</hi> these men pay not the iust price for anie thing they take. <hi>Ioseph buieth their land and maketh the people bond vnto the King, restoring them againe the land, the King finding the seede to sowe, the people onelie laboring to till the ground. And where we</hi>

thinke we deale courteously if we let them sow to halfes: the <hi>Egipti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> haue the fourth part for their labour, and paie the king the fift part of the encrease for the land and seede, but these men kept all in their owne hands. <hi>Ioseph bought not the Priests lands, but gaue them alowance of such things as they wanted out of the kinges store:</hi> and these men like vnto our daies, if they can scrape anie thing from the Church, that is a pastime among all other to laugh at, and thought best gotten. So much more is a minister of Gods gospell thought meeter to be spoiled by these cutpursses, then <hi>Ioseph</hi> thought meet to doe to those Idolatrous priests. <hi>Ioseph opened his barnes in time of dearth and sold liberallie to the needie:</hi> these men the greater that the neede was, the faster they lockt it vp, vntill they had their desire of the poore. <hi>Ioseph restored their land and tooke but the fift part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease:</hi> these men restore nothing, and yet take interest. As this cruell dealing toward their breethren and countrie-men, was thought straunge to be found amongst this people, in the time that God had shewed to them such great mercies, in restoring them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to their countrie, giuing them the liberty to build their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Citie, with great gifts, liberalitie, and fauour of the kings, vnder whom they were bondmen and slaues: So it is much more marueil, that among Christians, in the time of the gospell, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But this is the common practise of Sathan, that in no age, people, nor countrie, he can be quiet to see Gods kingdom set vp and florish, and his powre fall: but he will rage, storme, besturre him, and by all deuises that may be, and by all powre that he can ouerthrowit. And seeing this is no new thing but hath fallen out diuers times afore, let vs not now be astonied nor dismaied at it, nor murmure and grudge against the doctrine of our saluation, so mercifullie offred vnto vs, as though it were not the true word of God, because men liue so far contrarie to that which is taught, and they openlie professe. The deuill is content, when he cannot ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the trueth of the doctrine, to deface it so much as he can, with the ill life of those that professe it. But the gospell teacheth vs what to doe in this case, saying; <hi>doe as they say, but doe not as they doe:</hi> The doctrine is good, though they be ill. The trueth and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines of Gods word hangeth not on our life and doings, but our <note place="margin">Math. 23. 3.</note> life and doings should be reformed by Gods word: for that <hi>it is a Lanterne to our feete, and a light to our stepps,</hi> that we may know when we be in the right way and how to come into it.

If they of Rome teach and require actuall restitution, it is no worke of supererogation: they doe no more but their dueties. If we should fasle in this cleare point, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue great condemnation at almightie Gods hands. I confesse that a man is good (&amp; therefore iustified in Gods sight) before he doth goodworkes: but with-all I set downe this, that goodworkes doe followe him that is truelie iustified, and that such as haue oppressed, or iniured anie man, shall not be pardoned at Gods hands, vnlesse they make actuall restitution, if they be able to doe it.

                           <p n="7">7. And my heart within me aduised me, and I chidd the Noble men and the rulers and I said vnto them: euerie one of you ley burdens on your breethren, and I assembled a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation against them.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. And I said vnto them we haue redeemed our breethren the Iewes which were sold to the Gentiles, as far as we were able, &amp; will ye sell your breethren againe, and shal they be sold to vs? and they held their tongue and found not a word to speake.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. And I sayd, the thing that ye doe is not good, ought ye not to walke in the feare of God, for auoyding the slaunder of the heathen which hate vs?</p>
                           <p n="10">10. Both I, my breethren, and my seruants, lent them money and corne: I pray you let vs leaue of these burthens.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. I pray you this day restore them their land, their vinyeards, their Oliue gardens, and their houses: and the hundreth parte of money, and of the corne, and of the wine, and of the oyle, which ye doe exact of them.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. And they said, we wil restore them againe, &amp; we will require no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them: we will doe as thou hast sayd: aud I called the Priests, &amp; did sweare them to doe according to these words.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. And I also did shake my lapp and said, let God thus shake eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man which mainteineth not this worde out of his house and his labour: and after this manner let him be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Magistrates are mortall Gods, &amp; God is an immortal magistrate: therefore as the merciful God hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in his holie habitation in heauen the crie of the miserable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed people in earth, so should euerie Godlie Ruler heare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the pitiful crie of the oppressed being his breethren, seeing he is Gods Lieutenant, &amp; hath the sword &amp; lawe in his hand to bridle such ill doers, and must not for fauour, gifts, nor feare, suffer it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amended: els he doeth not his dutie vnto the mighty Lord who set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him in that place, gaue him the authoritie, and wil aske a straight ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how he hath vsed it to the reliefe of the oppressed. <hi>Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> hearing this open outcrie of the people, and fearing the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience

that might follow of it, dealeth wiselie. First, as iustice requireth, <hi>he is verie angrie at it,</hi> and yet with wisdome bridleth his affection, that he doeth not rashlie punish them, but after due consultation within him selfe, and good aduise taking, first with words shraplie rebuketh them, and after by authority compelleth them, not onelie hence forth to leaue their cruel dealing, but also to restore that which they had so wrongfullie gotten. Some be of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that a magistrate should not be moued with anger in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his office, but giue euerie man fayre words, passe ouer matters slowly, please all men though he doe them litle good: but the truth being well considered, it may be iudged otherwise. <hi>Lactantius</hi> writeth A booke <hi>De Ira Dei,</hi> wherin he proueth <hi>that God him-selse is angrie, and euerie anger is not sinne.</hi> If God then be angrie against sinne, whie may not a good man in Gods cause then doe the same? Hate not the man, but his ill doing, be not angrie without a iust cause vnaduisedlie, keepe not thy anger long, that it grow not into hatred, let it be no more, nor no lesse, then the fault deserueth, &amp; let it be without raging, fuming, fretting, Swelling, and rauing, and disquieting of bodie or minde, not for malice of reuenging, but for pitie or iustice to correct and amend: and Anger well qualified is not ill. <hi>Phinees being angrie with the filthie whordome committed openly and vnpunished by those that were in Authoritie, tooke his Sword, killed</hi>

Iesus Christ</hi> our Lord was angrie <hi>when he whipt the buiers and sellers out of the Temple.</hi> Saint Marke sayeth, <hi>he looked on them round about with anger.</hi> Euerie anger therefore is not ill. This is not spoken to giue liberty to anger, for we are to ready to it by nature, but rather to bridle it, seeing it standeth on so narrow a point to keepe measure in. This qualifying of anger is declared in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as that it should not continue. S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, <hi>let not the Sunne set vpon your anger.</hi> And that it should not be rash lie without cause, nor more then the cause requireth, the gospell te acheth, saying, <hi>he that is angrie with his brother without a iust cause, is guiltie of iudgement.</hi>
