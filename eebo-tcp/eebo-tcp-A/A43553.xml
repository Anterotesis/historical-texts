            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:55011:3"/>
thoughts was eſteemed <hi>unſeaſonable.</hi> The reaſons why I have no ſooner publiſhed theſe Relations, and thoſe which have inforced me to do it now, are laid down in the following Preface, ſufficient (as I hope) both to excuſe and juſtifie me with ingenuous men. But for my boldneſſe in giving them the countenance of your Lordſhips name, I ſhall not ſtudy other reaſons then a deſire to render to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſome acknowledgement of thoſe many fair expreſſions of eſteem and favour, which your Lordſhip from my firſt coming to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> hath vouchſafed unto me. Your known abilities in moſt parts of learning, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the great reſpects you have for thoſe which pretend unto it, encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned you to embrace ſuch opinion of me, as was more anſwerable to your

own goodneſſe then to my deſert, and to cheriſh in me thoſe Proficiencies, which were more truly in your ſelf. And for my part, I alwaies looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Lordſhip as a true Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> devoted zealouſly to her Forms of worſhip, the ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxies of her Doctrine, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoliciſm of her Government; which makes me confident that theſe pieces will not prove unwelcome to you, in which the ſuperſtitions &amp; innovations of the two oppoſite parties, are with an equal hand laid open to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips view. Nor ſhall you find in theſe Relations, ſuch matters of compliance only with your Lordſhip in point of Judgement, as promiſe ſatisfaction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your intellectuall, and more noble parts; but many things which may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford you entertainments of a different
<pb facs="tcp:55011:4"/>
nature, when you are either ſpent with ſtudy, or wearied with affairs of more near importance. For here you have the principalleſt Cities and faireſt Provinces of <hi>France</hi> preſented in as lively colours, as my unpoliſhed hand could give them; the Temper, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and Affections of the People, generally deciphered with a free and impartial Pen; the publick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole, in reference to the Court, the Church, and the Civil State, deſcribed more punctually then ever heretofore in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue; ſome obſervations intermingled of more ancient learning, but pertinent and proper to the buſineſſe which I had in hand.

            <head>The Authors Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may ſeem ſtrange unto the Reader, that after ſo large a volume of <hi>Coſmography,</hi> in which the world was made the ſubject of my Travels, I ſhould deſcend unto the publiſhing of theſe <hi>Relations,</hi> which point at the eſtate only of ſome neighbouring places: or that in theſe declining times of my life and fortunes, I ſhould take pleaſure in communicating ſuch <hi>Compoſitions,</hi> as were the products of my youth, and therefore proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly not able to endure the cenſure of ſeverer age. And to ſay truth, there are ſome things in this <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication,</hi> whereof I think my ſelf obliged to give an account to him that ſhall read theſe papers, as well for his ſatisfaction as mine own diſcharge; as namely touching the occaſion of theſe ſeveral Journeys, my different manner of proceeding in theſe Relations, the reaſons why not publiſhed ſooner, and the impulſions which have moved me to produce them now.</p>
            <p n="2">II. For the two firſt, the Reader may be pleaſed to know, that as I undertook the firſt Journey, in the company of a private friend, only to ſatisfie my ſelf in taking a brief view of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and delights of <hi>France;</hi> ſo having pleaſed my
<pb facs="tcp:55011:6"/>
ſelf in the ſight thereof, and in the obſervation of ſuch things as were moſt conſiderable, I reſolved to give my ſelf the pleaſure of making ſuch a character and deſcription of them, as were then moſt agreeable to my preſent humour, at what time both my wits and fancies (if ever I was maſter of any) were in their predominancy. I was then free from all engagements, depending meerly on my ſelf, not having faſtned my relations upon any one man, in order to my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture preferment in Church or State, and therefore thought of nothing elſe then a ſelf-complacency, and the contentment of indulging to mine own affections. This made me to take that liberty in deciphering the tempers, humours, and behaviours of the <hi>French</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion generally, which to a grave judgement may ſeem too luxuriant, and to have more in it of the <hi>Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,</hi> then is conſiſtent with an equall and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all character. But in the midſt of ſo much folly (if the Reader ſhall vouchſafe it no better name) there is ſuch a mixture of more ſerious matters, as makes the temperature of the whole be more delightfull; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſaying of <hi>Horace</hi> in his Book <hi>de Arte Poetica:</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Omne tulit punctum, qui miſcuit utile dulci.</l>
            </q>
            <p>That is to ſay,</p>
            <q>
               <l>He hits on every point aright,</l>
               <l>Who mingleth profit with delight.</l>
            </q>
            <p n="3">III. The other Journey being undertaken almoſt four years after, in attendance on the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> is
<pb facs="tcp:55011:6"/>
faſhioned after a more ſerious and ſolemn manner. I had then began to apply my ſelf to the Lord Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and was reſolved to preſent the work to him, when it was once finiſhed, and therefore was to frame my ſtyle agreeably unto the gravity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedneſſe of ſo great a Prelate. My deſign was to let him ſee in the whole body and contexture of that diſcourſe, that I was not altogether uncapable of mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſuch publick buſineſſe, as he might afterwards think fit to entruſt me with; and it ſucceeded ſo well with me, that within a ſhort time after he recommended me unto his Majeſty for a Chaplain in ordinary, and by degrees employed me in affairs of ſuch weight and moment, as rendred my ſervice not unuſefull to the Church and State; however miſtaken by ſome men, who think all matters ill conducted, which either paſſe not through their own hands, or are not managed by their ſiniſter and precipitate counſels. This makes the ſtyle and language of the ſecond Journey to be ſo different from the firſt. The indiſcretion would have been impardonable, if I had come before ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in ſo light a garb, as might have given him a juſt occaſion to ſuppoſe, that I had too much of the Antick, and might be rather ſerviceable to his recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then to be honoured with employments of more weight and conſequence.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. If it be asked, why theſe Relations were not publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed aſſoon as they paſſed my hands, and might be thought more ſeaſonable, then they are at this preſent; the Anſwer in a manner may prevent the queſtion. The laſt diſcourſe, being written, and intended purpoſely as a Preſent to that great Prelate whom before I ſpoke of, could not with any fitneſſe, be communicated to the
<pb facs="tcp:55011:7"/>
publick view without his conſent. For having tendred it unto him, it was no more mine, and not being mine, I had no reaſon to diſpoſe otherwiſe of it, as long as the property thereof was veſted in him by mine own free act. But he being laid to ſleep in the bed of peace, I conceive my ſelf to have gotten ſuch a ſecond right therein, as the <hi>Granter</hi> hath many times in Law, when there is no Heir left of the <hi>Grantee</hi> to enjoy the gift, and conſequently to lay any claim unto it. And being reſolved, upon the reaſons hereafter following, to publiſh the firſt of theſe two Journals, I thought it not amiſſe to let this alſo wait upon it, ſecond in place, as it had been ſecond in performance and courſe of time.</p>
            <p n="5">V. So for the firſt Journey, being digeſted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto writing for mine own contentment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the thought of pleaſing any body elſe; the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it by me did as much conduce to the end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, as if it had been publiſhed to the view of others. And I had ſtill ſatisfied my ſelf in enjoying that end, if the importunity of friends (who were willing to put themſelves to that charge and trouble) had not drawn ſome copies of it from me. By means whereof it came unto more hands then I ever meant it, and at the laſt into ſuch hands, by which it would have been preſented to the publick view without my conſent; and that too with ſuch faults and errors, as <hi>Tranſcripts</hi> of neceſſity muſt be ſubject to when not compared with the Original, or peruſed by the Author. And had it hapned ſo, as it was like enough to happen, and hath hapned ſince, the faults and errors of the Copy, as well as of the Preſſe, would have paſſed for mine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I muſt have been thought accomptable for thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:55011:7"/>
tranſgreſſions which the ignorance and unadviſedneſſe of other men would have drawn upon me. And yet there was ſome other reaſon, which made the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Journal when firſt finiſhed by me, not ſo fit nor ſafe, nor ſo conducible to ſome ends, which I had in view. I had before applyed my ſelf unto his Majeſty, when Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> by Dedicating to him the firſt Eſſayes of my <hi>Coſmographie;</hi> and thereby opened for my ſelf a paſſage into the Court, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſhould have a minde to look that way. And at the time when I had finiſhed theſe <hi>Relations,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> party there were as conſiderable for their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as it was afterwards for their power: and the diſcourſe faſhioned with ſo much liberty, and touching (as it might be thought) with ſo much <hi>Gayete de coeur</hi> upon the humours of that people, might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured me no good welcome; and proved but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome harbinger, to take up any good lodging for me in that place, when either my ſtudies ſhould enable, or my ambition prompt me to aſpire unto it. Which cauſes being now removed, I conceive the time to be more ſeaſonable now, then it was at the firſt, and that theſe papers may more confidently walk the open ſtreets, without giving any juſt offence to my ſelf or others.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. For though perhaps it may be ſaid, that I have made too bold with the <hi>French,</hi> and that my character of that people, hath too much of the <hi>Satyriſt</hi> in it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was intimated; yet I conceive that no ſober minded man either of that Nation or of this, will finde himſelf aggrieved at my freedome in it. The <hi>French</hi> and other forein Nations make as bold with us, not ſparing to lay open our wants and weakneſſes, even
<pb facs="tcp:55011:8"/>

            <p n="8">VIII. In the next place it may be ſaid that this ſhort Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall deſerves not to be called <hi>A SURVEY OF THE STATE OF FRANCE,</hi> conſidering that it only treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of ſome particular Provinces, and of ſuch Towns and Cities only in thoſe Provinces, as came within the compaſſe of a perſonal view. But then it may be ſaid withall, that theſe four Provinces which I paſſed thorow, and deſcribe, may be conſidered as the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome</hi> of the whole, the abſtract or compendium of the Body of <hi>France:</hi> the Iſle of <hi>France</hi> being look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on as the mother of <hi>Paris, Picardie</hi> as the chiefeſt <hi>Granary,</hi> and <hi>La Beauſe</hi> as the nurſe thereof; as <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi> is eſteemed for the Bulwark of all <hi>France</hi> it ſelf by reaſon of that large Sea-coaſt, and well fortified Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, wherewith it doth confront the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And if the rule be true in <hi>Logick</hi> (as I think it is) that a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination may be taken from the nobler parts; then certainly a <hi>Survey</hi> of theſe four Provinces, the nobleſt and moſt conſiderable parts of all that Kingdome, may be entituled without any abſurdity the Survey of <hi>France.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55011:9"/>
For beſides that which hath been ſpoken, it was in theſe four Provinces that <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. did lay the ſcene of his long war againſt the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> as if in keeping them aſſured or ſubjected to him the ſafety of the whole Kingdome did conſiſt eſpecially. For though the war was carried into moſt other Provinces as the neceſſity of affairs required, yet it was managed in thoſe Provinces by particular parties. Neither the King himſelf, nor the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> (the heads of the contending Armies) did act any thing in them except ſome light velitations in <hi>Champagne,</hi> and one excurſion into <hi>Burgundie;</hi> the whole deciſion of the quarrels, depending principally, if not wholly, in the getting of theſe. The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> had not elſe made ſo long a march from the Court of <hi>Bruxels,</hi> to raiſe the Kings Army from the ſiege of <hi>Roven;</hi> nor had the King muſtered up all his wit and power to recover <hi>Amiens,</hi> when dexterouſly ſurprized by a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> ſtratagem. And if it be true, which the <hi>French</hi> generally affirm of <hi>Paris,</hi> that it is the Eye, nay the very Soul of all <hi>France</hi> it ſelf; I may with confidence affirm, that I have given more ſight to that Eye, more life and ſpirit to that Soul, then hath been hitherto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated in the Engliſh. Tongue. The Realm of <hi>France</hi> ſurveyed in the four principal Provinces, and the chief Cities of the whole, gives a good colour to the <hi>title,</hi> and yet the title hath more colour to inſiſt upon, then the deſcription of theſe Cities, and thoſe principal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, can contribute towards it. For though I have deſcribed thoſe four Provinces only in the way of Chorography, yet I have took a general and <hi>a full Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the State of</hi> France, in reference to the Court, the Church, and the Civil State, which are the three
<pb facs="tcp:55011:10"/>
main limbs of all <hi>Bodies Politick,</hi> and took it in ſo full a manner, as I think none, and am aſſured that very few have done before me.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. If it be ſaid that my ſtay was not long enough to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me exact and punctual in my obſervations: I hope it will be ſaid withall, that the leſſe my ſtay was, my diligence muſt be the greater, and that I husbanded my time to the beſt advantage. For knowing that we could not ſtay there longer, then our money laſted, and that we carried not the wealth of the <hi>Indies</hi> with us, I was reſolved to give my ſelf as little reſt, as the neceſſities of nature could diſpenſe withall; and ſo to work my ſelf into the good opinions of ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal perſons of that nation, who were beſt able to inform me, as might in ſhort ſpace furniſh me with ſuch inſtructions, as others with a greater expence both of time and money could not ſo readily attain. By this accommodating of my ſelf unto the humours of ſome men, and a reſolution not to be wanting to that curioſity which I carryed with me, there was nothing which I deſired to know (and there was nothing which I deſired not to know) but what was readily imparted to me both with love and chearfulneſſe. <hi>Cur neſcire pudens prave quam diſcere mallem?</hi> I alwaies looked upon it as a greater ſhame to be ignorant of any thing, then to be taught by any body; and therefore made ſuch uſe of men of both Religions, as were moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to acquaint me with the counſels of their ſeverall parties. Nor was I purſe-bound when I had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſee any of thoſe Rarities, Reliques, and matters of more true antiquity, which either their Religious Houſes, Churches, Colledges, yea, or the Court it Self could preſent unto me.

In the laſt place it may be ſaid that many things have hapned both in the Court and State of <hi>France,</hi> many great revolutions and alterations in the face thereof, ſince I digeſted the Relation of this Journey for my own contentment; which makes this publication the more unſeaſonable, and my conſent unto it ſubject to the greater cenſure: which notwithſtanding I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the diſcourſe will be as uſefull to the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Reader, as if it had gone ſheet by ſheet from the <hi>Pen</hi> to the <hi>Preſſe,</hi> and had been offered to him in that point of time when it took life from me. The learned labours of <hi>Pauſanias</hi> in his Chorography of <hi>Greece,</hi> are as delightful now to the ſtudious Reader, as formerly to the beſt wits of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Athens.</hi> Nor need we doubt, but that the deſcription of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> by <hi>Lewis Guicciardine,</hi> and of the Iſles of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> by our famous <hi>Camden,</hi> will yeeld as great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and contentment to future Ages, as to the men that knew the Authors. The Realm of <hi>France</hi> is ſtill the ſame, the temperature of the air and ſoyl the ſame, the humours and affections of the people ſtill the ſame; the Fractions of the Church as great, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as Regal or deſpotical now, as when the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was amongſt them. The Cities ſtand in the ſame places which before they ſtood in, and the Rivers keep the ſame channels which before they had, no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>natural</hi> parts of that great body, and not much in the <hi>politick</hi> neither.

and a Cardinal favourite, as they are at this preſent. The King in his Majority then, but not much verſed or ſtudied in his own concernments, as he is at this preſent; the Realm divided then into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and factions (though not into the ſame factions) as it is at this preſent; and finally, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> then in as high eſteem, by reaſon of the alliance then newly made between the Princes, as they can poſſibly be now, by reaſon of the late concluded peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Nations. Nor hath there hapned any thing not reconcilable to the preſent times, but the almoſt miraculous birth of the King and his Brother after 20 years barrenneſſe, and the mariage of the Monſieur with <hi>Montpenſiers</hi> Daughter, contrary to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall expectation of all that people, and for the firſt (I think I may be bold to ſay) of the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. Theſe reaſons as they may excuſe this publication, in reference to the work it ſelf, ſo there is one which ſerves to juſtifie it in reſpect of the Author; that is to ſay, the manifeſting of this truth to all which ſhall peruſe theſe papers, that he is ſtill of the ſame Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and opinion in matters of Religion, Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the government of holy Church, of which he was 30 years agoe, when the Relation of the firſt Journey was faſhioned by him; that he hath ſtood his ground in all thoſe revolutions both of Church and State, which have hapned ſince; that he now holds no other <hi>Tenets,</hi> then thoſe to which he hath been principled by education, and confirmed by ſtudy; and finally that ſuch opinions as he holds, be they right or wrong, he brought to the Court with him, and took not from thence.

In the Relation of the ſecond Journey, I finde no miſtakes, requiring any Animadverſions, as written in a riper judgement, and with greater care, becauſe intended to a perſon of ſuch known abilities. Nor was I leſſe diligent in gathering the materials for it, then carefull that it might be free from miſtakes and errors; not only informing my ſelf punctually in all things which concerned theſe Iſlands, by perſons of moſt knowledge and experience, in the affairs and ſtate of either, but with mine own hand copying out ſome of their Records, many whole Letters from the Councel and Court of <hi>England,</hi> the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>Genevian</hi> Diſcipline obtruded on both Iſlands by <hi>Snape</hi> and <hi>Cartwright,</hi> the Canons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by King <hi>James</hi> to the Iſle of <hi>Jarſey,</hi> beſides many papers of leſſe bulk and conſequence, out of all which I have ſo enlarged that diſcourſe, that if it be not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it comes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near it. Certain I am that here is more delivered of the affairs of theſe Iſlands and on their accompt, then all the Authors which have ever written of them being layed together, can amount unto. For in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of this part, I have took a <hi>full ſurvey</hi> of thoſe Iſlands which I went to viſit, together with ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in Religion as have hapned there, both when they were under the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Biſhops of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> as ſince they have diſcharged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the power of both. The Reformation there being modelled according to the <hi>Genevian</hi> Plat-form, occaſioned me to ſearch into the beginning, growth, and progreſſe of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> government with the ſetling of it in theſe Iſlands; together with the whole body of that Diſcipline as it was there ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb facs="tcp:55011:14"/>
and ſome ſhort obſervations on the text thereof, the better to lay open the novelty, abſurdity, and ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents of it. That done I have declared by what means and motives the Iſle of <hi>Jarſey</hi> was made conformable in point of diſcipline and devotion to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and given the Reader a full view of that body of Canons which was compoſed and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for regulating the affairs thereof in ſacred mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and after a ſhort application tending to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of my main deſign, do conclude the whole.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I am to tell the Reader, that though I was chiefly drawn to publiſh theſe <hi>Relations</hi> at this preſent time, for preventing all impreſſions of them, by any of thoſe falſe copies which are got abroad; yet I am given to underſtand, that the firſt is coming out (if not out already) under the Title of <hi>France painted out to the life:</hi> but <hi>painted</hi> by ſo ſhort a <hi>Penſil,</hi> as makes it want much of that <hi>life</hi> which it ought to have. By whom and with what <hi>colour</hi> that piece is <hi>painted</hi> thus without my conſent, I may learn hereafter. In the mean time, whether that Piece be printed with, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my name unto it, I muſt proteſt againſt the wrong, and diſclaim the work, as printed by a falſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect copy, deficient in ſome whole Sections, the diſtribution of the books and parts, not kept according to my minde and method, deſtitute alſo of thoſe <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications</hi> and <hi>Corrections,</hi> which I have given unto it on my laſt peruſal in this general Preface; and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly containing but one half of the work which is here preſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

The winde faire and high, able, had it continued in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55011:26"/>
that point, to have given us a waſtage as ſpeedy as our longings. Two hours before night it came about to the Weſtward, and the tide alſo not befriending us, our paſſage became tedious and troubleſome. The next day being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the glory of God in the memory of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> we took the benefit of the ebb to aſſiſt us againſt the wind; this brought us out of the ſight of <hi>England,</hi> and the floud enſuing compelled us to our Anchor.</p>
                     <p>I had now leaſure to ſee Gods wonders in the deep; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders indeed to us which had never before ſeen them: but too much familiarity had made them no other then the Sailers playfellowes.

                        </gap>oſe and fell according to the time and note of the Billow, that her violent agitation might be imagined to be nothing but a nimble Galliard filled with Capers. This nimbleneſſe of the waves and correſpondency of our Bark unto them, was not to all our company alike pleaſing: what in me moved only a reverend and awfull pleaſure, was to others an occaſion of ſickneſſe, their heads gidie, their joynts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled, their ſtomachs loathing ſuſtenance, and with great pangs avoiding what they had taken; in their mouths no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might have been ſo frequent as that of <hi>Horace,</hi>

Whether it be, that the noiſome ſmels, which ariſe from the ſaltneſſe and tartneſſe of that region of waters, poyſoneth the brain; or that the ungoverned and unequall motion of the ſhip, ſtirreth and unſetleth the ſtomach, or both; we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture with the Philoſophers, rather then determine. This I am ſure of, that the Cabbins and Decks were but as ſo many Hoſpitals or Peſthouſes filled with diſeaſed perſons, whileſt I and the Mariners only made good the Hatches. Here did I ſee the Scalie nation of that Kingdom ſolace themſelves in the brimme of the waters, rejoycing in the ſight and warmth of the day; and yet ſpouting from their mouths ſuch quantity of waters, as if they purpoſed to quench that fire which gave it. They danced about our Veſſell, as if it had been a moving May pole; and that with ſuch delightfull <hi>decorum,</hi> that you never ſaw a meaſure better troden with leſſe art.

                           <hi>NORMANDY</hi> in generall; the Name and bounds of it. The condition of the Antient <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and of the preſent. <hi>Ortelius</hi> character of them examined. In what they reſemble the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Norfolk.</hi> The commodities of it, and the Government.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe next ebb brought us in ſight of the Sea-coaſt of <hi>Normandy,</hi> a ſhore ſo evenly compaſſed and levelled, that it ſeemeth the work of Art, not Nature; the Rock all the way of an equall height, riſing from the bottom to the top in a perpendicular, and withall ſo ſmooth and poliſhed, that if you dare believe it the work of Nature, you muſt alſo think, that Nature wrought it by the line, and ſhewed an art in it above the imitation of an Artiſt. This wall is the Northern bound of this Province; the South parts of it being confined with <hi>Le Mainde la Beauſſe,</hi> and <hi>L' Iſle de France;</hi> on the Eaſt it is divided from <hi>Picardie</hi> by the River of <hi>Some;</hi> and on the North it is bounded with the Ocean, and the little River <hi>Crenon,</hi> which ſevereth it from a corner
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55011:27"/>
of <hi>Britain.</hi> It extendeth in length from the beginning of the 19 degree of longitude, to the middle of the 23. <hi>Viz.</hi> from the Cape of St. <hi>Saviour</hi> Weſt, to the Port-town of St. <hi>Valerie</hi> Eaſt. For breadth, it lyeth partly in the 49, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the 50 degree of Latitude; ſo that reckoning 60 miles to a degree, we ſhall finde it to contain 270 <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles in length, and 60 <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles in breadth, where it is narroweſt.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt the Antients it was accounted a part of <hi>Gallia Cellica;</hi> the name <hi>Neuſtria.</hi> This new title it got by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving into it a new Nation. A people which had ſo terribly ſpoyled the Maritine Coaſts of <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Belgium,</hi> that, <hi>A furore Normannorum,</hi> was inſerted into the Letanie. Originally they were of <hi>Norway,</hi> their name importeth it. <hi>Anno</hi> 800, or thereabouts, they began firſt to be accounted one of the Plagues of <hi>Europe:</hi> 900 they ſeated themſelves in <hi>France</hi> by the permiſſion of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Balde,</hi> and the valor of <hi>Rollo</hi> their Captain. Before this, they had made themſelves maſters of <hi>Ireland,</hi> though they long held it not, and <hi>anno</hi> 1067 they added to the glory of their name by the conqueſt of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> You would think them a people not only born to the warres, but to victory. But, <hi>Ut frugum ſemina mutato ſolo degenerant, ſic illa genuina feritas eorum, amoenitate mollila eſt; Florus</hi> ſpake it of the <hi>Gaules</hi> removed into <hi>Aſia:</hi> it is apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Norwegians</hi> tranſplanted into <hi>Gallia:</hi> yet fell they not ſuddenly, and at once into that want of courage which now poſſeſſeth them. During the time they continued <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they attempted the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> with a fortune anſwerable to their valour. Being once oppreſſed by the <hi>French,</hi> and in ſlaved under that <hi>Monarchie;</hi> they grew pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently creſt-faln; and at once loſt both their ſpirits, and their liberty.</p>
                     <p>The preſent <hi>Norman</hi> then, is but the corruption of the Antient; the heir of his name, and perhaps his poſſeſſions, but neither of his ſtrength, nor his manhood. <hi>Bondage,</hi> and a fruitfull ſoil, hath ſo emaſculated them, that it is a loſt labour to look for <hi>Normans</hi> even in <hi>Normandy.</hi> There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth nothing almoſt in them of their progenitours, but the remainders of two qualities, and thoſe alſo degenerated,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55011:28"/>
if not baſtards; a <hi>penurious pride,</hi> and an <hi>ungoverned doggedneſſe.</hi> Neither of them become their fortune, or their habite; yet to theſe they are conſtant. Finally, view him in his rags and dejected countenance, and you would ſwear it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that theſe ſnakes ſhould be the deſcendents of thoſe brave <hi>Heroes,</hi> which ſo often triumphed over both Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, foiling the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and vanquiſhing the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, perchance, their courage is evaporated into wit, and then the change is made for the better. <hi>Ortelius</hi> would ſeem to perſwade us to this conceit of them; and well might he do it, if his words were Oracles: <hi>Le gens</hi> (ſaith he, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Nation) <hi>ſont des plus accorts &amp; ſubtils, d' eſprit de la Gaule.</hi> A character, for which the <hi>French</hi> will little thank him; who (if he ſpeak truth) muſt in matter of diſcretion give precedency to their Vaſſals. But as <hi>Imbalt</hi> a <hi>French</hi> leader ſaid of the <hi>Florentines</hi> in the fifth book of <hi>Guicciardine, Non ſapeva dove conſiſteſſe lingegne tanto celebrate de Fiorentini;</hi> ſo may I of the <hi>Normans.</hi> For my part I could never yet find, where that great wit of theirs lay. Certain it is, that as the <hi>French</hi> in generall, are termed the Kings Aſſes, ſo may theſe men peculiarly be called the <hi>Aſſes of the French,</hi> or the <hi>verieſt Aſſes of the reſt.</hi> For what with the unpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable rents they pay to their Lords on the one ſide, and the immeaſurable taxes laid upon them by the King on the other, they are kept in ſuch a perpetuated courſe of drudgery, that there is no place for wit or wiſdome left amongſt them. Liberty is the Mother and the Nurſe of thoſe two qualities; and therefore the <hi>Romans</hi> (not unhappily) expreſſed both the conditions of a <hi>Freeman,</hi> and a <hi>diſcreet and modeſt perſonage,</hi> by this own word <hi>Ingenuus.</hi> Why the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould lay a greater burden on the backs of this Nation, then their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, I cannot determine. Perhaps it is, becauſe they have been twice conquered by them, once from King <hi>John,</hi> and again from <hi>Henry</hi> VI. and therefore undergo a double ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude. It may be, to abate their naturall pride and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe. Likely alſo it is, that being a revolting people, and apt to an apoſtaſie from their allegiance, they may by this meanes be kept impoveriſhed, and by conſequence diſabled
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55011:28"/>
from ſuch practiſes. This a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman of good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding told me, that it was generally conceited in <hi>France,</hi> that the <hi>Normans</hi> would ſuddenly and unanimouſly betray their Countrey to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> were the King a <hi>Catholick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>—But there is yet a further cauſe of their beggerli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and poverty, which is their litigiouſneſſe and frequent going to law (as we call it.) <hi>Ortelius,</hi> however he failed in the firſt part of their character, in the concluſion of it hath done them juſtice. <hi>Mais en generall</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ils ſont ſcavans au poſſible en proces &amp; plaideries.</hi> They are prety well verſed in the quirks of the Law, and have wit more then enough to wrangle. In this they agree exactly well with the Inhabitants of our Country of <hi>Norfolk: ex infima plebe non pauci reperiuntur</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Camden) quin ſi nihil litium ſit, lites tamen ex ipſis juris apicibus ſerere calleant.</hi> They are prety fellowes to finde out quirks in Law, and to it they will whatſoever it coſt them. Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> ſpake not this at randome or by the gueſſe. For beſides what my ſelf obſerved in them at my being once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, in a Colledge progreſſe, I have heard that there have been no leſſe then 340 <hi>Niſi prius</hi> tryed there at one Aſſizes. The reaſon of this likeneſſe between the two Nations, I conjecture to be the reſemblance of the ſite, and ſoil; both lie upon the Sea with a long and a ſpacious Coaſt; both enjoy a Countrey <hi>Champain,</hi> little ſwelled with hils, and for the moſt part of a light and ſandy mould. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to no more particulars, if there be any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Provinces, it is only this, that the Countrey of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the people of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> are ſomewhat the richer.</p>
                     <p>For, indeed, the Countrey of <hi>Normandie</hi> is enriched with a fat and liking ſoil; ſuch an one, <hi>Quae demum votis avari agricolae reſpondet,</hi> which may ſatisfie the expectation of the Husbandman, were it never ſo exorbitant. In my life I never ſaw Corn-fields more large and lovely, extended in an equall levell almoſt as far as eye can reach. The Wheat (for I ſaw little Barley) of a fair length in the ſtalke, and ſo heavy in the ear, that it is even bended double. You would think the grain had a deſire to kiſſe the earth its mother, or that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55011:29"/>
it purpoſed by making it ſelf away into the ground, to ſave the Plough-man his next years labour. Thick it groweth, and ſo perfectly void of weeds, that no garden can be imagined to be kept cleaner by Art, then theſe fields are by Nature. Paſture ground it hath little, and leſſe Meddow, yet ſufficient to nouriſh thoſe few Cattel they have in it. In all the way between <hi>Dieppe</hi> and <hi>Pontoyſe,</hi> I ſaw but two flocks of Sheep, and them not above 40 in a flock. Kine they have in ſome meaſure, but not fat nor large, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe there were no living for them. The Nobles eat the fleſh, whilſt the Farmer ſeeds on Butter and Cheeſe, and that but ſparingly. But the miſerable eſtates of the <hi>Norman paiſant,</hi> we will defer till another opportunity. Swine alſo they have in prety number, and ſome Pullen in their back ſides; but of neither an exceſſe. The principall River of it is <hi>Seine,</hi> of which more hereafter; and beſides this I ſaw two rivulets <hi>Robee</hi> and <hi>Renelle.</hi>

                     <p>In matter of Civill Government, this Countrey is directed by the court of <hi>Parliament</hi> eſtabliſhed at <hi>Roven.</hi> For matters Military, it hath an Officer like the Lieutenant of our ſhires in <hi>England,</hi> the Governor they call him. The preſent Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is Mr. <hi>Le duc de Longueville,</hi> to whom the charge of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince was committed by the preſent King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. <hi>anno</hi> 1619. The Lawes by which they are governed are the Civill or Imperiall, augmented by ſome Cuſtomes of the <hi>French,</hi> and others more particular which are the <hi>Norman.</hi> One of the principal'ſt is in matters of inheritance; the <hi>French</hi> cuſtome giving to all the Sons an equality in the eſtate, which we in <hi>England</hi> call <hi>Gavelkind;</hi> the <hi>Norman</hi> dividing the eſtate into three parts, and thereof allotting two unto the eldeſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a third to be divided among the others. A law which the <hi>French</hi> count not juſt: the younger brothers of <hi>England</hi> would think the contrary. To conclude this generall diſcourſe of the <hi>Normans;</hi> I dare ſay it is as happy a Country as moſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> were it ſubject to the ſame Kings, and governed by the ſame Laws, which it gave unto <hi>England.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>JUne</hi> the 30. at 6 of the clock in the morning, we landed at <hi>Dieppe,</hi> one of the Haven-towns of <hi>Normandy;</hi> ſeated on an arme of the Sea, between two hils, which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it in the nature of a Bay. This ſecureth the Haven from the violence of the weather, and is a great ſtrength to the Town againſt the attempts of any forces which ſhould aſſault it by Sea. The Town lying within theſe mountains, almoſt a quarter of a mile up the channell. The Town it ſelf is not uncomely, the ſtreets large and wel paved, the houſes of an indifferent height, and built upright without any jettings out of one part over the other. The Fortifications, they ſay, (for we were not permitted to ſee them) are very good and modern; without ſtone, within earth: on the top of the hill, a Caſtle finely ſeated, both to defend the Town, and on occaſions to command it. The Garriſon conſiſteth of 60 men, in pay no more, but when need requireth, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hath authority to arme the Inhabitants. The preſent Governour is the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> who alſo is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the province, entruſted with both thoſe charges
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55011:30"/>
by <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. <hi>anno</hi> 1619. An action in which he ſwarved ſomewhat from the example of his father; who never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the military command of a Countrey (which is the office of the Governour) and the cuſtody of a Town of war or a Fortreſſe, unto one man. The Duke of <hi>Biron</hi> might hope as great a curteſie from that King, as the moſt deſerving of his Subjects. He had ſtuck cloſe to him in all his adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, received many an honourable ſcar in his ſervice; and indeed, was both <hi>Fabius</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> the Sword and Buckler of the <hi>French</hi> empire. In a word, he might have ſaid to this <hi>Henry,</hi> what <hi>Silius</hi> in <hi>Tacitus</hi> did to <hi>Tiberius, Suum militem in obſequio manſiſſe, cum alii ad ſeditiones prolaberentur; neque du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raturum Tiberii imperium, ſi iis quoque legionibus cupido novandi fuiſſet:</hi> yet when he became <hi>petitioner</hi> to the King for the Citadell of <hi>Burg,</hi> ſeated on the confines of his government of <hi>Bourgogne,</hi> the King denied it. The reaſon was, becauſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of Provinces which command in chief, <hi>ought not to have the command of Places and Fortreſſes</hi> within their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There was alſo another reaſon &amp; more enforcing, which was, that the Petitioner was ſuſpected to hold intelligence with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> whoſe Town it was. The ſame <hi>Henry,</hi> though he loved the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> even to the envy of the Court; yet even to him alſo he uſed the ſame cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore when he had made him Governor of <hi>Xain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roigne</hi> and <hi>Angoulmois,</hi> he put alſo into his hands the Towns of <hi>Metz</hi> and <hi>Boulogne;</hi> places ſo remote from the ſeat of his Government, and ſo diſtant one from another, that they did rather diſtract his power, then increaſe it.</p>
                     <p>The Kings of <hi>England</hi> have been well, and for a long time verſed in this maxime of eſtate. Let <hi>Kent</hi> be one of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and <hi>Hampſhire</hi> the other. In <hi>Kent</hi> at this time the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> (or as the <hi>French</hi> would call him, the Governor) is the Earl of <hi>Mountgomerie;</hi> yet is <hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle in the hands of the Duke of <hi>Buckhingham;</hi> and that of <hi>Quinborough</hi> in the cuſtody of Sir <hi>Edward Hobby:</hi> of which the one commandeth the Sea, and the other the Thames, and the Medway. In <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> is the Earl of <hi>South-Hampton:</hi> but the government of the Town and Garriſon of <hi>Porteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> is entruſted to the Earl of <hi>Pembroke:</hi> neither is

                     </p>
                     <p>But King <hi>Lewis</hi> now reigning in <hi>France,</hi> minded not his Fathers action; when at the ſame time alſo he made his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Mr. <hi>Luines</hi> Governor of <hi>Picardie,</hi> and of the Town and Citadell of <hi>Amiens.</hi> The time enſuing gave him a ſight of this State-breach. For when the Dukes of <hi>Eſpernon, Vendoſme, Longueville, Mayenne</hi> and <hi>Nemours,</hi> the Count of <hi>Soiſons</hi> and others, ſided with the Queen Mother againſt the King; the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> ſtrengthned this <hi>Dieppe;</hi> and had not Peace ſuddenly followed, would have made it good, maugre the Kings forces. A Town it is of great importance, King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. uſing it as his <hi>Aſylum</hi> or City of refuge, when the league was hotteſt againſt him. For, had he been further diſtreſſed, from hence might he have made an eſcape into <hi>England;</hi> and in at this door was the entance made for thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> forces which gave him the firſt ſtep to his throne. The Town hath been pillaged and taken by our <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt, in his war againſt <hi>Philip Auguſtus;</hi> and in the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our affaires in <hi>France,</hi> it was nine monthes together beſieged by the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> but with that ſucceſſe, which commonly attendeth a falling <hi>Empire.</hi> The number of the Inhabitants is about 30000, whereof 9000 and upwards are of the Reformation, and are allowed them for the exerciſe of their religion, the Church of <hi>Arques,</hi> a Village ſome two miles diſtant; the remainders are Papiſts. In this Town I met with the firſt <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which ever I yet ſaw, more then in my Books. <hi>Quos antea audiebam, hodie vidi Deos,</hi> as a barbarous <hi>German</hi> in <hi>Vellejus</hi> ſaid to <hi>Tiberius.</hi> The Gods of <hi>Rome,</hi> which before I only heard of, I now ſaw, and might have worſhipped. It was the <hi>Hoaſte,</hi> as they call it, or the <hi>Sacrament reſerved,</hi> carryed by a couple of <hi>Prieſts</hi> under a <hi>Canopie,</hi> uſhered by two or three torches, and attended by a company of boyes and old people which had no other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. Before it went a Bell continually tinkling, at the ſound whereof all ſuch as are in their houſes, being war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that then their God goeth by them, make ſome ſhew of reverence; thoſe which meet it in the ſtreet, with bended
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55011:31"/>
knees and elevated hands doing it honour. The <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> of this Bell make an uſe more religious, and uſe it as a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or watch-peal to avoid that ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eet through which they hear it coming. This invention of the Bell hath ſomewhat in it of <hi>Tureiſme,</hi> it being the cuſtome there at their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall</hi> houres, when they hear the criers bawling in the ſteeples, to fall proſtrate on the ground whereſoever they are and kiſſe it thrice, ſo doing their devotions to <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The carrying of it about the ſtreets hath, no queſtion, in it a touch of the <hi>Jew,</hi> this ceremony being borrowed from that of carrying about the Arke on the ſhoulders of the <hi>Levites.</hi> The other main part of it which is the <hi>Adoration,</hi> is derived from the <hi>Heathens,</hi> there never being a people but they, which afforded divine honors to things in animate. But the people indeed, I cannot blame for this Idolatrous devotion, their conſciences being perſwaded, that what they ſee paſſe by them, is the very body of their Saviour. For my part, could the like belief poſſeſſe my underſtanding, I could meet it with greater reverence, then their Church can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn me. The Prieſts and Doctors of the people are to be condemned only, who impoſe and inforce this ſin upon their hearers. And doubtleſſe there is a reward which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth them for it. Of ſtanding it is ſo young, that I never met with it before the year 1215. Then did Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> ordain in a Councell holden at <hi>Rome,</hi> that there ſhould be a <hi>Pix</hi> made to cover the Bread, and a Bell bought to be rung before it. The Adoration of it was enjoyned by Pope <hi>Honorius, anno</hi> 1226. both afterward encreaſed by the new ſolemn feaſt of <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> day, by Pope <hi>Urban</hi> the IV. <hi>anno</hi> 1264. and confirmed for ever with multitudes of pardons, in the Councell of <hi>Vienna,</hi> by <hi>Clement</hi> the V. <hi>anno</hi> 1310. Such a punie is this great God of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. Lactantius</hi> in his firſt Book of <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> againſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> taxeth the wiſe men of thoſe times of infinite ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculouſneſſe, who worſhipped <hi>Jupiter</hi> as a God, <hi>Cùm eun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem tamen Saturno &amp; Rhea genitum confiterentur,</hi> Since them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo perfectly knew his originall.

This converted me from my former Hereſie, and made me apprehend life in them: but it was ſo little, that it ſeemed only enough to carry them to the next pack of hounder. Thus accommodated we bid farewell to <hi>Dieppe,</hi> and proceeded with a ſpace ſo ſlow, that me thought our journey unto <hi>Roven</hi> would prove a moſt perfect embleme of the motion of the ninth ſphere, which is 49000 years in finiſhing. But this was not our greateſt miſery. The rain fell in us through our tilt, which for the many holes in it, one would have thought to have been a net. The durt brake plentifully in upon us, through the rails of our Chariot: and the unequall and ill proportioned paſe of it, ſtartled almoſt every bone of us. I proteſt, I marvell how a <hi>French</hi> man durſt adventure in it. Thus endured we all the diſeaſes of a journey, and the danger of three ſeverall deaths, drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, choaking with the mire, and breaking on the wheel; beſides a fear of being famiſhed before we came to our Inne, which was ſix <hi>French</hi> miles from us.

Deſpair of finding there either Bedding or Victuals, made me juſt like the fellow at the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, who when he might have been reprieved on condition he would marry a wench which there ſued for him, having viewed her well, cryed to the hangman <hi>to drive on his Cart.</hi> The truth is, <hi>I' eſchappay la tonnnere et rencheus en l' eſchair,</hi> according to the <hi>French</hi> proverb; I fell out of the frying-pan into the fire. One of the houſe (a ragged fellow I am ſure he was, and ſo moſt likely to live there) brought us to a room ſomewhat of kindred to a Charnel-houſe, as dark and as dampiſh. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it was paved with brick at the bottom, and had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Orchards a prety hole, which in former times had been a window, but now the glaſſe was all vaniſhed. By the little light which came in at that hole, I firſt perceived that I was not in <hi>England.</hi> There ſtood in this Chamber three beds, if at the leaſt it be lawfull ſo to call them; the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them was of ſtraw, ſo infinitely thronged together, that the wool-packs which our <hi>Judges</hi> ſit on in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were melted butter to them: upon this lay a medley of flocks and feathers ſowed up together in a large bag; (for I am confident it was not a tick) but ſo ill ordered, that the knobs ſtuck out on each ſide, like a crab-tree cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell. He had need to have fleſh enough that lyeth on one of them, otherwiſe the ſecond night would wear out his bones. The ſheets which they brought us, were ſo courſe, that in my conſcience no Mariner would vouchſafe to uſe them for a ſail; and the coverlet ſo bare, that if a man would undertake to reckon the threads, he need not miſſe

one of the number. The napperie of the Table was ſutable to the bedding, ſo foul and dirty, that I durſt not conceive it had been waſhed above once; and yet the poor clothes looked as briskly as if it had been promiſed for the whole year enſuing, to ſcape many a ſcouring. The napkins were fit companions for the clothes, <hi>Unum ſi noveris, omnes noſti.</hi> By my deſcription of this <hi>Inne,</hi> you may gueſſe at the reſt of <hi>France;</hi> not altogether ſo wretched, yet is the alteration al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inſenſible.</p>
                     <p>Let us now walke into the <hi>Kitching,</hi> and obſerve their proviſion. And here we found a moſt terrible execution committed on the perſon of a pullet; my Hoſteſſe (cruell woman) had cut the throat of it, and without plucking off the feathers, tore it into pieces with her hands, and after took away skin and feathers together, juſt as we ſtrip Rabbets in <hi>England:</hi> this done, it was clapped into a pan, and fryed into a ſupper. In other places where we could get meat for the Spitte, it uſeth to be preſently broached, and laid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly over the fire; three turns at the moſt diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, and bringeth it to the Table, rather ſcorched then roaſted. I ſay where we could get it, for in theſe raſcally Innes, you cannot have what you would, but what you may; and that alſo not of the cheapeſt. At <hi>Pontoyſe</hi> we met with a Rabbet, and we thought we had found a great purchaſe; larded it was, as all meat is in the Countrey, otherwiſe it is ſo lean, it would never endure roaſting. In the eating it proved ſo tough, that I could not be perſwaded, that it was any more then three removes from that Rabbet which was in the Ark. The price half a Crown <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</hi> My companions thought it over deer, to me it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very reaſonable; for certainly the graſſe which fed it, was worth more then thrice the money. But to return to <hi>Toſtes.</hi>

                     <p>And it it time; you might, perchance, elſe have loft the ſight of mine Hoſteſſe, and her daughters. You would have ſworne at the firſt bluſh, they had been of a bloud; and it had been great pity had it been otherwiſe. The ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Horace, Omatre pulchra filia pulchrior,</hi> was never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable as here. Not to honour them with a further
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55011:33"/>
character, let it ſuffice that their perſons kept ſo excellent a <hi>decorum</hi> with the houſe and furniture, that one could not poſſible make uſe of <hi>Tullies Quàm diſpari dominaris domina.</hi> But this is not their luck only. The women not of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi> alone, but generally of all <hi>France,</hi> are forced to be contented with a little beauty; and ſhe which with us is reckoned with the vulgar, would amongſt them be taken for a Princeſſe. But of the <hi>French</hi> women, more when we have taken a view of the Dames of <hi>Paris;</hi> now only ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of their habit and condition. Their habit in which they differ from the reſt of <hi>France,</hi> is the attire of the head, which hangeth down their backs in the faſhion of a Vail. In <hi>Roven</hi> and the greater Cities, it is made of linen, pure and decent; here, and in the Villages, it cannot poſſible be any thing elſe then an old diſh-clout turned out of ſervice, or the corner of a tablecloth reſerved from waſhing. Their beſt conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not alwayes viſible. They ſhew it only in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, or when you are ready to depart, and that is their beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging; you ſhall have about you ſuch a throng of thoſe ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces, and every one whining out this <hi>dity, Pour les ſervants,</hi> that one might with greater eaſe diſtribute a dole at a rich mans Funerall, then give them a penny. Had you a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to give them unasked, their importunity will prevent your ſpeedieſt bounty. After all this impudent begging, their ambition reacheth no higher then a <hi>Sol;</hi> he that giveth more out-biddeth their expectation, and ſhall be counted a ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift.</p>
                     <p>But the principall ornaments of theſe Innes, are the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervants, the raggedeſt regiment that ever I yet looked upon. Such a thing as a <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> was never heard of amongſt them, and good clothes are as little known as he. By the habit of his attendants, a man would think himſelf in a Gaol; their clothes either full of patches, or open to the skin. Bid one of them wipe your boots, he preſently hath recourſe to the curtains, with thoſe he will perhaps rub over one ſide, and leave the other to be made clean by the gueſt. It is enough for him, that he hath written the coppy. They wait al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with their hats on their heads, and ſo alſo do ſervants before their maſters: attending bare-headed, is as much out
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55011:33"/>
of faſhion there, as in <hi>Turkey:</hi> of all <hi>French</hi> faſhions, in my opinion, the moſt unfitting and unſeeming. Time and much uſe reconciled me to many other things, which at the firſt were offenſive; to this unreverent cuſtome, I returned an enemy. Neither can I ſee how it can chooſe but ſtomach the moſt patient, to ſee the worthyeſt ſigne of liberty uſurped and profaned by the baſeſt of ſlaves. For ſeeing that the <hi>French paiſantrie,</hi> are ſuch infinite ſlaves unto their Lords and Princes, it cannot be, but that thoſe which are their ſervants, muſt be one degree at the leaſt, below the loweſt condition.</p>
                     <p>Certainly among the antients, this <hi>promiſeuous covering</hi> of the head, was never heard of. It was with them the chief ſign of freedome, as is well known to thoſe which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with Antiquity. The <hi>Lacones</hi> a people of <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſus,</hi> after they had obtained to be made free denizens of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> in ſigne of their new-gotten liberty, would never go into the battail <hi>niſi pileati,</hi> but with their hats on. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Africans,</hi> as it is written in <hi>Alexander ab Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro,</hi> the placing of a hat on the top of a ſpear, was uſed as a token to incite the people to their liberty, which had been oppreſſed by Tyrants; <hi>Per pileum in haſta propoſitum, ad liberta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem proclamari.</hi> But amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> we have more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety. The taking off of the hat of <hi>Tarquinius Priſcus</hi> by an Eagle, and the putting of it on again, occaſioned the <hi>Augur</hi> to propheſic unto him the Kingdom, which fell out accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. In their ſword playes, when one of the Gladiators had with credit ſlain his adverſary; they would ſometimes honour him with a Palm, ſometimes with the Hat. Of theſe the laſt was the worthyer, the Palm only honouring the Victor, this alſo enfranchizing the receivers; therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred commonly on him which had killed moſt men in the Theatres. Hence the complaints of <hi>Tertullian, lib. de Spectacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, cap. 21. Qui inſigniori cuiquam homicidae leonem poſcit, idem gladiatori atroci rudem petat (rudis</hi> was an other token of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſement) <hi>&amp; pileum praemium conferat.</hi> In their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Forum,</hi> or <hi>Guildhall,</hi> when they purpoſed to manumit any of their ſervants; their cuſtome alſo was, after the <hi>Lictor</hi> or <hi>Sergeant</hi> had regiſtred the name of the party manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55011:34"/>
to ſhave his head and give him a cap, whence according to <hi>Roſinus, ad pileum vocare,</hi> is to ſet one at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>

In the Univerſities of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> this cuſtome is ſtill in force; the putting on of the cap being never performed, but in the ſolemn <hi>Comitia,</hi> and in the preſence of all ſuch as are either auditors or ſpectators of that dayes exerciſe. When I was <hi>Regent,</hi> the whole houſe of <hi>Congregation</hi> joyned together in a Petition to the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> to reſtore unto us the <hi>jus pileorum,</hi> the licence of putting on our Caps, at our publick meetings; which pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, time and the tyranny of the <hi>Vicechancellors,</hi> had taken from us. Among other motives, we uſed the ſolemn form of creating a Maſter in the Acts, by putting on his cap: and that that ſigne of liberty might diſtinguiſh us which were the <hi>Regents,</hi> from thoſe boyes which we were to govern: which requeſt he graciouſly granted. But this <hi>French</hi> ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cineſſe hath drawn me out of my way.

                        <hi>JUly</hi> the firſt we ſet on for <hi>Roven.</hi> In 10 hours our Cart dragged us thither, the whole journey being in all ſix leagues <hi>French:</hi> admirable ſpeed! About three of the clock in the afternoon we had a ſight of the Town, daintily ſeated in a valley on the River <hi>Seine.</hi> I know not any Town better ſituate, <hi>Oxford</hi> excepted, which indeed it much reſembleth; I mean not in bigneſſe, but ſituation: It ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on all ſides evironed with mountains, the North ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and hath a large and pleaſant walk of meadowes by the river ſide, to the South-eaſt-ward; as <hi>Oxford</hi> hath towards <hi>Eveley.</hi> It is ſeated on the principall river of <hi>France,</hi> diſtant from the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of that Country 50 miles <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or thereabouts; as <hi>Oxford</hi> on the <hi>Thames,</hi> and from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> Watered alſo it is with two ſmall rivulets, <hi>Robee</hi> and <hi>Renelle,</hi> as the other with <hi>Charwell</hi> and <hi>Eventode.</hi> The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, that <hi>Oxford</hi> is ſeated ſomewhat higher on the ſwelling of an hill, and a little more removed from thoſe mountains which environ it: and that the rivers which run through ſome part of <hi>Roven,</hi> do only waſh the precincts of the other. The buildings are in ſome places wood, in ſome ſtone, in other both; the houſes without juttings or
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55011:35"/>
overlets, four ſtories high, and in the front not very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull. The moſt promiſing houſe which mine eye met with, was that of Mr. <hi>Boniface,</hi> who being of obſcure parents, and having raiſed himſelf a fortune in the wars, againſt the <hi>League,</hi> here built a receptacle for his age. It is faſhioned after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of new buildings in <hi>London,</hi> compoſed all of dainty white ſtone, ſquare and poliſhed. On the partition between the firſt ſtory and the ſecond, it hath theſe words engraven, <hi>Vi &amp; Virtute. Martis opus. Tentanda via. Amore &amp; armis: a motto</hi> ſutable to his riſing.</p>
                     <p>The other buildings of note are the bridge (for I as yet omit the Houſe of Parliament and the Churches) and the Town wall by it. The bridge, whilſt it was all ſtanding, was thought to have been the faireſt and ſtrongeſt piece of that kinde in all <hi>France.</hi> It conſiſteth of twelve arches, large and high: there now remain but ſeven of them, the reſt being broken down by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the falling of their affairs in <hi>France,</hi> the better to make good the Town againſt the <hi>French.</hi> The river is here about the breadth of the <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>nes</hi> at <hi>Fulham.</hi> Between the River and the Town wall, is the Exchange or meeting place of the Merchants, paved with broad and even peble. In breadth up to the wall-ward 30 yards, in length 100; a fine walke in fair weather. All along the banke ſide lay the ſhips, which by reaſon of the broken bridge come up thither, and on occaſions higher: a good turn for <hi>Paris.</hi> The wall for the length of 100 yards, is as ſtraight as one may lay a line, of a juſt height, and compoſed of ſquare and excellent ſtones, ſo cunningly laid, that I never ſaw the ſides of a Noble mans houſe built more handſomely. But it is not only the beauty of the wall which <hi>Roven</hi> delighteth in, there muſt ſomewhat alſo be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of ſtrength: to which purpoſe it might ſerve indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently well, were there ſome addition of earth within it. It is well helped on the outſide by the breadth and depth of the ditches; but more by St. <hi>Katherines</hi> fort ſeated on a hill at the Eaſt ſide of it. A Fort, which were it ſtrengthned according to the modern art of fortifying, would much aſſure the Town, and make it at once, both a ſlave and a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The <hi>Marſhall D' Ancre,</hi> when he was <hi>Lieutenant</hi> here
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55011:35"/>
for the Queen mother, began to fortifie this mountain, <hi>Quilleboeuſe,</hi> and other places of importance; but upon his death they were all raſed: what were his projects in it, they know beſt which were acquainted with his ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Certainly the jars which he had ſowen amongſt the Princes one with the other, and between them and the King: ſhew that they were not intended for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                     <p>There are in <hi>Roven</hi> 32 Pariſh Churches, beſides thoſe which belong to Abbies and Religious houſes, of which the moſt beautifull is that of St. <hi>Audoin</hi> or <hi>Owen,</hi> once Archbiſhop of this City. The ſeat and Church of the Archbiſhop is that of <hi>Noſtre dame,</hi> a building far more gorgeous in the outſide, then within. It preſents it ſelf to you with a very gracious and majeſticall front, decked with moſt curious imagery, and adorned with three ſtately Towers. The firſt <hi>La tour de beurre</hi> (becauſe it was built with that money which was raiſed by Cardinall Dr. <hi>Amboyſe,</hi> for granting a diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to eat butter in the Lent): and a third built over the porch or great door, wherein is the great Bell ſo much talked of. Within it is but plain and ordinary, ſuch as common Cathedrall Churches uſually are, ſo big, ſo faſhioned. Behinde the high Altar, at a pillar on the left had, is the remainder of the Duke of <hi>Bedfords</hi> Tomb: which for ought I could diſcerne, was nothing but an <hi>Epitaph</hi> ſome three yards high in the pillar. I ſaw nothing in it, which might move the envie of any Courtier to have it defaced, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it were the title of <hi>Regent du Royaume de France,</hi> which is the leaſt he merited.</p>
                     <p>Somewhat Eaſtward, beyond this is our Ladies Chappell, a prety neat piece, and daintily ſet out. There ſtandeth on the top of the ſcreen, the image of the Virgin her ſelf, between two Angels. They have attired her in a red mantle, laced with two gold laces, a handſome ruffe about her neck, a vail of fine lawne hanging down her back, and (to ſhew that ſhe was the Queen of heaven) a crown upon her head: in her left arme ſhe holds her ſon in his ſide-coat, a black hat and a golden hatband. A jolly plump Ladie ſhe ſeemeth to be, of a flaxen hair, a ruddy lip, and a chearefull complexion.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55011:36"/>
Twere well the Painters would agree about limming of her, otherwiſe we are likely to have almoſt as many Ladies, as Churches. At <hi>Noſtre dame</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhe is taught us to be browne, and ſeemeth ſomewhat inclining to melancholie. I ſpeak not of her different habit, for I envie not her changes of apparell Only I could not but obſerve how thoſe of St. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres</hi> Church, <hi>en la Fue</hi> St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> have placed her on the top of their Skreen, in a Coape, as if ſhe had taken upon her the zeal of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and were going to make a bloudy ſacrifice of her Son. They of <hi>Noſtre dame</hi> in <hi>Amiens,</hi> have erected her <hi>Statua</hi> all in gold, with her Son alſo of the ſame mettle in her armes; caſting beams of gold round about her, as the Sun is painted in its full glory: ſtrange Idolatries! On the contrary, in the Pariſh Church of <hi>Tury,</hi> in <hi>La Beauſſe,</hi> ſhe is to be ſeen in a plain petticoat of red, and her other garments correſpondent. In my minde this holdeth moſt proportion to her eſtate, and will beſt ſerve to free their irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from abſurdity. If they will worſhip her as a nurſe, with her childe in her arme, or at her breſt, let them array her in ſuch apparell, as might beſeem a Carpenters wife; ſuch as ſhe may be ſuppoſed to have worn before the world had taken notice, that ſhe was the mother of her Saviour. If they needs muſt have her in her eſtate of glory, as at <hi>Amiens;</hi> or of honour (being now publickly acknowledged to be the <hi>bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt among women)</hi> as at <hi>Paris,</hi> let them disburden her of her child. To clap them thus together, is a folly, equally worthy of ſcorne and laughter. Certainly had ſhe but ſo much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to make choice of her own clothes, I doubt not but ſhe would obſerve a greater <hi>decorum.</hi> And therefore I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the <hi>Capuchins</hi> of <hi>Boulogne,</hi> who in a little ſide-chappell conſecrated unto her, have placed only a handſome fair looking-glaſſe upon her Altar, the beſt ornament of a female cloſet: why they placed it there, I cannot ſay, only I conceive it was, that ſhe might there ſee how to dreſſe her ſelf.</p>
                     <p>This Church is ſaid to have been built (I ſhould rather think repaired) by <hi>Raoul</hi> or <hi>Rollo,</hi> the firſt Duke of <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi> ſince it hath been much beautifyed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> when they were Lords of this Province. It is the ſeat of an
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55011:36"/>
Archbiſhop, a Dean and fifty Canons. The Archbiſhop was inſtituted by the authority of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, during the ſitting of the Councell of <hi>Arles. Anidian</hi> who was there preſent, being conſecrated the firſt Archbiſhop. The Biſhops of <hi>Sees, Aurenches, Conſtance, Bayeux, Lyſieux</hi> and <hi>Eureux,</hi> were appointed for his Dioceſans. The now Archbiſhop is ſaid to be an able Scholar, and a ſound Stateſman; his name I enquired not. The revenues of his Chair are ſaid to be 10000 crowns: more they would amount to, were the Countrey any way fruitfull of Vines; out of which the other Prelates of <hi>France</hi> draw no ſmall part of their <hi>intrada.</hi>

It is not above nine years agone, ſince a <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Gaſcoyne</hi> took occaſion to kill his wife, which done, he fled hither into <hi>Normandy;</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt acquainted the <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>Noſtre dame</hi> with his deſire, put himſelf to the ſentence of the Court, and was adjudged to the wheel. <hi>Aſcenſion-day</hi> immediately coming on, the <hi>Canons</hi> challenged him, and the Judge, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, cauſed him to be delivered.

                        <hi>JUly</hi> the ſecond we take our farewell of <hi>Roven,</hi> better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated then we came thither; yet not ſo well at I deſired. We are now preferred <hi>ab Aſinis ad equos,</hi> from the Cart to the Waggon. The <hi>French</hi> call it a Coach, but that matters not; ſo they would needs have the Cart to be a Chariot. Theſe Waggons are the ordinary inſtruments of travell in thoſe Countries; much of a kin to <hi>Graveſend</hi>'s barge. You ſhall hardly finde them without a knave or a Giglot. A man may be ſure to be merry in them, were he as certain to be wholeſome. This, in which we travelled, contained ten perſons, as all of them commonly do; and amongſt theſe ten, one might have found <hi>Engliſh, Scots, French, Normans, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> a jolly medley; had our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons been as different as our Nations, I ſhould have thought my ſelf in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> or <hi>Poland;</hi> if a man had deſired to have ſeen a Brief or an Epitome of the World, he would no where have received ſuch ſatisfaction, as by looking on us. I have already reckoned up the ſeveral Nations, I will now lay open the ſeverall conditions. There were then to be found amongſt theſe ten paſſengers, men and women, Lords and ſerving men, Scholars and Clowns, Ladies and Chambermaids, Prieſts and Laie-men, Gentlemen and Artificers, people of all ſexes and almoſt all ages. <hi>If all the learning in the world were loſt, it might be found again in Plutarch,</hi> ſo ſaid <hi>Budaeus.</hi> If all the Nations in the world had been loſt, they might have been found again in our Waggon, ſo I. Seriouſly I think our
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55011:38"/>
Coach to have been no unfit repreſentation of the Ark. A whole world of men and languages might have grown out of it.</p>
                     <p>But all this while our Waggon joggeth on, but ſo leiſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it gave me leave to take a more patient view of the Countrey, then we could in the Cart. And here, indeed, I ſaw ſufficient to affect the Countrey, yea to dote on it, had I not come out of <hi>England.</hi> The fields ſuch as already I have deſcribed, every where beſet with Apple-trees, and fruits of the like nature. You could ſcarce ſee any thing which was barren in the whole Journey. Theſe Apples are both meat and drink to the poor <hi>Paiſant.</hi> For the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is ill provided with Vines (the only want I could obſerve in it) and Beer is a good beverage at a Gentlemans table, Sider then, or Perry are the poor mans Claret; and happy man is he, which once or twice a week can aſpire ſo high a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove water. To proceed, through many a miſerable Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage <hi>(Burghs</hi> they call them) and one Town ſomewhat big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the reſt, called <hi>Equille;</hi> we came that night to St. <hi>Claire 10 French</hi> miles from <hi>Roven,</hi> a poor Town god wot, and had nothing in it remarkable, but an accident. There dwelt a monk there, grown into great opinion for his ſanctity, and one who had an eſpeciall hand upon ſore eyes; yet his ability herein was not generall, none being capable of cure from him but pure Virgins. I perſwade my ſelf <hi>France</hi> could not yield him many patients: and yet from all parts he was much ſought unto. Hope of cure and a charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion, which they had of themſelves, had brought to him divers diſtreſſed Damoſels; which, I am confident, had no intereſt in his miracle. In the ſame Inne (Alehouſe I ſhould ſay) where we were to be harbored, there had put in a whole convoy of theſe <hi>Ladies errant, Pilgrims</hi> they called themſelves, and had come on foot two dayes journey to cleer their eye-ſight. They had white vailes hanging down their backs, which in part covered their faces; yet I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by a glimpſe, that ſome of them were paſt cure. Though my charity durſt allow them maids, it was afraid to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them Virgins: yet ſo far I dare aſſure them they ſhould recover their ſight, that when they came home, they ſhould
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55011:39"/>
ſee their folly. At that time, what with too much watching on ſhipboard, what with the tartneſſe of the water, and the violence of the winde, working upon me for almoſt 40 houres together whilſt I lay on the Hatches: mine eyes had gotten a rheum and a redneſſe: my Hoſteſs (good woman) perſwaded me to this holy Eye-wright, but I durſt not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Not that I had not as good a title to my Virginity as the beſt there: but becauſe I had learned what a grievous ſentence was denounced on <hi>Ahaziah</hi> king of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for ſeeking help of <hi>Belzebub</hi> the god of <hi>Eckron.</hi> When I hap to be ill, let my amendment come on Gods name. <hi>Mallem ſemper profanus eſſe, quam ſic religioſus,</hi> as <hi>Minutius Foelix</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Sacrifices. Let my body rather be ſtil troubled with a ſore eye, then have ſuch a recovery to be a perpetuall eye-ſore to my conſcience. Rather then go in Pilgrimage to ſuch a Saint, let the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts count me for an Heretick. Beſides, how durſt I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine in him an ability of curing my bodily eyes, who had for above 70 years been troubled with a blindneſſe in the eyes of his ſoul?—<hi>Thou fool</hi> (ſaid our Saviour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the like caſe) <hi>firſt caſt out the beam out of thine own eye, and then ſhalt thou ſee clearly to caſt out the mote out of thy brothers eye.</hi>

                     <p>The next morning <hi>(July</hi> 3) I left my pilgrims to try their fortunes, and went on in our journey to <hi>Paris,</hi> which that day we were to viſite. My eyes not permitting me to read, and my eares altogether ſtrangers to the <hi>French</hi> chat, drave my thoughts back to <hi>Roven;</hi> and there nothing ſo much poſſeſſed me, as the ſmall honour done to <hi>Bedford</hi> in his monument. I had leaſure enough to provide him a longer Epitaph, and a ſhorter apologie againſt the envie of that Courtier, which perſwaded <hi>Charles</hi> the VIII to deface the ruines of his Sepulchre: Thus.</p>

in its limited ſenſe, and as a part only of the whole, for when <hi>Meroveus,</hi> the Grandchild of <hi>Pharamond,</hi> firſt King of the <hi>Franci</hi> or <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> had taken an opportunity to paſſe the <hi>Rhine,</hi> having alſo during the wars between the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Gothes,</hi> taken <hi>Paris;</hi> he reſolved there to ſet up his reſt, and to make that the head City of his Empire. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try round about it, which was of no large extent, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be called <hi>Francia,</hi> or <hi>Terra Francorum,</hi> after the name of his <hi>Frankes</hi> whom he governed. In this bounded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained ſenſe, we now take it, being confined with <hi>Normandy</hi> on the North, <hi>Champagne</hi> on the Eaſt, and on the Weſt and South with the Province of <hi>La Beauſſe.</hi> It is incircled in a manner with the <hi>Oyſe</hi> on the Northwards, the <hi>Eure</hi> on the Weſt, the <hi>Velle</hi> on the Eaſt, and a veine riveret of the <hi>Seine</hi> towards the South; but the principall environings are made by the <hi>Seine,</hi> and the <hi>Marne</hi> a river of <hi>Campagne,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute that part hereof which commonly and <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>This Iſle, this portion of <hi>Gaul,</hi> properly and limitedly ſty led <hi>France,</hi> was the ſeat of the <hi>Francs</hi> at their firſt coming hither, and hath ſtill continued ſo. The reſt of <hi>Gallia,</hi> is in effect rather ſubdued by the <hi>French,</hi> then inhabited; their valour in time having taken in thoſe Countries which they never planted: ſo that if we look apprehenſively into <hi>Gaule,</hi> we ſhall finde the other Nations of it, to have juſt cauſe to take up that complaint of the King of <hi>Portugall</hi> againſt <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> for aſſuming to himſelf the title of <hi>Catholick King of Spain; Ejus tam non exigua parte penes reges alios,</hi> as <hi>Mariana</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth it. Certain it it, that the leaſt part of all <hi>Gallia</hi> is in the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Normans, Britons, Biſcaines</hi> or <hi>Gaſcons,</hi> the <hi>Gothes</hi> (of <hi>Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Provence) Burgundians,</hi> and the ancient <hi>Gaules</hi> of <hi>Poictou,</hi> retaining in it ſuch fair and ample Provinces. But it is the cuſtome (ſhall I ſay) or fate of leſſer and weaker Nations, to loſe their names unto the ſtronger: as wives do to their husbands, and the ſmaller ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to the greater. Thus we ſee the little Province of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55011:42"/>
                        <hi>Poland</hi> to have maſtered and given name to the <hi>Pruteni, Mazovii,</hi> and other Nations of <hi>Sarmatia Europaea;</hi> as that of <hi>Moſco</hi> hath unto all the Provinces of <hi>Aſiatica.</hi> Thus hath <hi>Sweden</hi> conquered and denominated almoſt all the great <hi>Peninſula</hi> of <hi>Scandia;</hi> whereof it is but a little parcell: and thus did the <hi>Engliſh Saxons</hi> being the moſt prevailing of the reſt, impoſe the name of <hi>Engliſh</hi> on all the people of the <hi>Hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchie.</hi>

                     <p>And good reaſon the vanquiſhed ſhould ſubmit themſelves as well unto the appellation, as the laws of the victor. The <hi>French</hi> then are poſſeſſors of ſome parts of old <hi>Gallia,</hi> and maſters of the reſt; poſſeſſors not of their Cities only, but their conditions. A double victory, it ſeemeth, they enjoyed over that people, and took from them at once, both their qualities and their Countries. Certainly whoſoever will pleaſe to peruſe the Commentaries of <hi>Julius Caeſar, de bello Gallico;</hi> he will equally gueſſe him an Hiſtorian and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; yea he will rather make himſelf believe, that he hath prophecied the character of the preſent <hi>French,</hi> then delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red one of the antient <hi>Gaule.</hi> And indeed, it is a matter wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy both of wonder and obſervation, that the old <hi>Gaules,</hi> being in a manner all worne out, ſhould yet have moſt of their conditions ſurviving in thoſe men, which now inhabit that region, being of ſo many ſeverall Countries and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. If we dive into naturall cauſes, we have a ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto the powerfull influence of the heavens; for as thoſe celeſtiall bodies conſidered in the generall, do work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all ſublunary bodies in the generall, by light, influence and motion; ſo have they a particular operation on parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.

Their attempts on <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Millain</hi> (to omit their preſent enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe on <hi>Genoa)</hi> are manifeſt proofs of it; neither will I now ſpeak of the battail of <hi>Poicteirs,</hi> when they were ſo forward in the onſet, and furious in the flight. <hi>Vt ſunt Gallorum ſubita ing enia,</hi> ſaith <hi>Caeſar:</hi> &amp; I think this people to be as hare-brained as ever were the other. <hi>Juvenal</hi> calleth <hi>Gallia, foecunda cauſidicorum:</hi> and among the modern <hi>French</hi> it is related, that there are tryed more law-cauſes in one year, then have been in <hi>England</hi> fince the Conqueſt. Of the antient <hi>Germans,</hi> the next neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and confederates of the <hi>Gaules, Tacitus</hi> hath given us this note, <hi>Diem noctemque continuare potando nulli probrum;</hi> and preſently after, <hi>De jungendis affinitatibus, de bello denique &amp; pace, in convivis conſultant.</hi> Since the time of <hi>Tacitus</hi> hath <hi>Germanie</hi> ſhifted almoſt all her old inhabitants, and received new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies of <hi>Lombards, Sueves, Gothes, Sclavonians, Hunns, Saxons, Vandals,</hi> and divers other Nations not known to that writer.

If the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have borrowed any thing of this humor, it is not to be thought the vice of the Countrey, but the times. To go yet higher and further, the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Anacharſis</hi> (and he lived 600 and odd yeers before Chriſt) noted it in the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that at the beginning of their feaſts, they uſed little goblets, and greater towards the end, when they were now almoſt drunken, <gap reason="foreign">

other graces which ſet them out in the ſight of the World; and no marvell theſe were not nationall conditions, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall endowments. I conclude then this digreſſion with the words of <hi>Barklay, Haeret itaque in omni gente vis quaedam inconcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, quae hominibus pro conditione terrarum, in quibus naſoi contigerit, ſua fata diviſerit.</hi>

                     <p>The preſent <hi>French</hi> then, is nothing but an old <hi>Gaule</hi> moulded into a new name, as raſh he is, and as head ſtrong, and as hare brain'd. A nation whom you ſhall win with a ſeather, and loſe with a ſtraw. Upon the firſt ſight of him you ſhall have him as familiar as your ſleep, or the neceſſity of breathing. In one houres conference, you may indeer him to you, in the ſecond unbutton him; the third pumps him drie of all his ſecrets, and he gives them you as faithfully, as if you were his ghoſtly father, and bound to conceal them <hi>ſub ſigillo confeſſionis:</hi> when you have learned this, you may lay him aſide, for he is no longer ſerviceable. If you have an humor of holding him in a further acquaintance, (a favour of which he confeſſeth, and I believe him, he is unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy:) himſelf will make the firſt ſeparation. He hath ſaid over his leſſon to you, and muſt now finde out ſome body elſe to whom to repeat it. Fare him well, he is a garment whom I would be loath to wear above two days together, for in that time he will be thread-bare. <hi>Familiare eſt homini om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia ſibi remittere,</hi> ſaith <hi>Velleius</hi> of all; it holdeth moſt properly in this people. He is very kind-hearted to himſelf, and thinketh himſelf as free from wants, as he is full: ſo much he hath in him of the nature of a <hi>Chinoy's,</hi> that he thinketh all men blind but himſelf. In this pride of ſelf-conceitedneſſe he hateth the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> loveth not the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the <hi>German;</hi> himſelf is the only Courtier, and compleat Gentleman; but it is his own glaſſe which he ſeeth in, out of this conceit of his own excellency, and partly out of a ſhallowneſſe of brain; he is very liable to exceptions. The leaſt diſtaſt that can be, draweth his ſword, and a minutes pauſe ſheathes it to your hand. If afterwards you beat him into better manners, he ſhall take it kindly and cry <hi>ſerviteur.</hi> In this one thing they are wonderfully like the Devill. Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or ſubmiſſion maketh them inſolent, a little reſiſtance

putteth them to their heels, or makes him your Spaniel. In a word (for I have held him too long) he is a walking vanity in a new faſhion.</p>
                     <p>I will now give you a taſte of his table, which you ſhall finde in a meaſure furniſhed; (I ſpeak not of the <hi>Paiſant:)</hi> but not in ſo full a manner as with us. Their Beef they cut out in ſo little chops, that that which goeth there for a laudable diſh, would be thought here to be an Univerſity commons, new ſerved from the hatch. A loine of Mutton ſerves amongſt them for three roaſtings, beſide the hazard of making pottage with the rump. Fowle alſo they have in good plenty, eſpecially ſuch as the King ſound in <hi>Scotland.</hi> To ſay truth, that which they have is ſufficient for nature and a friend, were i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> not for the Miſtreſſe of the Kitchin-wench. I have heard much fame of <hi>French</hi> Cooks, but their skill lyeth not in the handling of Beef or Mutton. They have (as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have all this Nation) good fancies, and are ſpeciall fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes for the making of puffe-paſtes, and the ordering of banquets. Their trade is not to feed the belly, but the palat. It is now time you were ſet down, where the firſt thing you muſt do, is to ſay your own Grace; private Graces are as ordinary there, as private Maſſes: and from thence I think they learned them. That done, fall to where you like beſt. They obſerve no methods in their eating, and if you look for a Carver, you may riſe faſting. When you are riſen, if you can digeſt the ſluttiſhneſſe of the cookery, (which is moſt abominable at firſt ſight) I dare truſt you in a Garriſon. Follow him to Church, and there he will ſhew himſelf moſt irreverent and irreligious; I ſpeak not this of all, but of the generall. At a Maſſe in the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> Church in <hi>Paris,</hi> I ſaw two <hi>French Papiſts,</hi> even when the moſt ſacred myſtery of their faith was celebrating, break out into ſuch a blaſphemous and Atheiſticall laughter, that even an <hi>Ethnick</hi> would have hated it. It was well they were known to be <hi>Catholicks;</hi> otherwiſe ſome <hi>French</hi> hot-head or other, would have ſent them laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Pluto.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>French</hi> language is, indeed, very ſweet and delectable. It is cleared of harſhneſſe, by the cutting off, and leaving out the conſonants, which maketh it fall off the tongue very vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubly;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55011:44"/>
yet in my opinion, it is rather elegant then copious, and therefore is much troubled for want of words to find out periphraſes. It expreſſeth very much of it ſelf in the action. The head, body, and ſhoulders concurre all in the pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of it; and he that hopeth to ſpeak it with a good grace, muſt have ſomewhat in him of the <hi>Mimick</hi> It is inriched with a full number of ſignificant Proverbs, which is a great help to the <hi>French</hi> humor of ſcoffing; and very full of courtſhip, which maketh all the people complementall. The pooreſt Cobler in the Village hath his Court-cringes; and his <hi>eau be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſte de Cour,</hi> his court holy water, as perfectly as the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi>

                     <p>In the Paſſados of their court-ſhip, they expreſſe themſelves with much variety of geſture, and indeed, it doth not misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them. Were it as graticus in the Gentlemen of other Nations as in them, it were worth your patience; but the affectation of it is ſcurvy and ridiculous. <hi>Quocunque ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis artificio corpus inflectant, putes nihil iſta institutione magis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venire. Vicinae autem gentes ridiculo errore deceptae, ejuſdem venustatis imitationem ludicram faciunt &amp; ingratam:</hi> as one happily obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at his being amongſt them. I have heard of a young Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, ſon to a great Lord of one of the three <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Kingdoms, that ſpent ſome years in <hi>France</hi> to learn faſhions. At his return he deſired to ſee the King, and his father procured him an entervenie. When he came within the Preſence-chamber, he began to compoſe his head, and carry it as if he had been ridden with a Martingall: next he fell to draw back his legs and thruſt out his ſhoulders, and that with ſuch a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe apiſhneſſe, that the King asked him if he meant to ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him out of his chair, and ſo left him to act out his comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the hangings. In their courtſhip they beſtow even the higheſt titles, upon thoſe of the loweſt condition. This is the vice alſo of their common talk. The begger begetteth <hi>Monſieurs</hi> and <hi>Madams</hi> to his ſons and daughters, as familiarly as the King. Were there no other reaſon to perſwade me, that the <hi>Welch</hi> or <hi>Britains</hi> were the deſcendants of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> this only were ſufficient, that they would all be Gentlemen.</p>

His diſcourſe runneth commonly upon two wheels, <hi>treaſon</hi> and <hi>ribaldrie.</hi> I never heard people talke leſſe reverently of their Prince, nor more ſawcily of his actions. Scarce a day paſſeth away without ſome ſeditious Pamphlet printed and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, in the diſgrace of the King, or of ſome of his Courtiers. Theſe are every mans mony, &amp; he that buyeth them is not coy of the Contents, be they never ſo ſcandalous; of all humors the moſt baſe and odious. Take him from this (which you can hardly do, till he hath told all) and then he falleth upon his ribaldry. Without theſe crutches, his diſcourſe would never be able to keep pace with his company. Thus ſhall you have them relate the ſtories of their own uncleanneſſe, with a face as confident, as if they had no accidents to pleaſe their hearers more commendable. Thus will they reckon up the ſeverall profanations of pleaſure, by which they have diſmanned themſelves; ſometimes not ſparing to deſcend to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. A valiant Captain never gloried more in the number of the Cities he had taken, then they do of the ſeverall women they have proſtituted.

                     <p>I Am come to the <hi>French</hi> Women, and it were great pity they ſhould not immediately follow the diſcourſe of the men, ſo like they are one to the other, that one would think them to be the ſame, and that all the difference lay in the apparell. For perſon, they are generally of an indifferent ſtature, their bodies ſtraight, and their waſtes commonly ſmall: but whether it be ſo by nature, or by much reſtraining of theſe parts, I cannot ſay. It is ſaid, that an abſolute woman ſhould have (amongſt other qualities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite) the parts of a <hi>French</hi> woman from the neck to the girdle; but I believe it holdeth not good, their ſhoulders and backs being ſo broad, that they hold no proportion with their midles; yet this may be the vice of their apparell. Their hands are, in mine opinion, the comlieſt and beſt ordered part about them, long, white and ſlender. Were their faces anſwerable, even an <hi>Engliſh</hi> eye would apprehend them lovely: but herein do I finde a <hi>pretty contradictorie.</hi> The hand, as it is the beſt ornament of the whole ſtructure, ſo doth it moſt diſgrace it. Whether it

be that ill diet be the cauſe of it, or that hot bloud wrought upon by a hot and ſcalding aire, muſt of neceſſity by ſuch means vent it ſelf, I am not ſure of. This I am ſure of, that ſcarce the tithe of all the maids we ſaw, had her hands and arme wriſts free from ſcabs, which had over-run them like a leproſie. Their hair is generally black, and indeed, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what blacker then a gracious lovelineſſe would admit.

Such everlaſting talkers are they all, that they will ſooner want breath then words, and are never ſilent, but in the grave; which may alſo be doubted. As they are endleſſe in their talk, ſo alſo are they regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of the company they ſpeak in. Be you ſtranger or of their acquaintance, it much matters not; though indeed, no man is to them a ſtranger.

Nay, I have heard a Gentleman of good credence relate, that being at a tilting, he ſaw a Courtier going to remove a boy, which very roguiſhly looked under a Ladies clothes: but when her Ladiſhip perceived his intention, ſhe hindred him with this complement, <hi>Laiſſe, Monſeuir, laiſſe, les yeuxne ſont pas larrens;</hi> the boyes eyes would ſteal nothing away; a very mercifull and gentle Lady.

                     <p>Being a people thus prone to a ſuddain familiarity, and ſo prodigall of their tongue and company, you would ſcarce imagine them to be coy of their lips.

This notwithſtanding could not but amaze me, that they who in their actions were ſo light and wanton, ſhould yet think themſelves modeſt, and confine all laſciviouſneſſe unto a kiſſe.

                     <p>Upon this ground your <hi>French</hi> Traveller, that perhaps may ſee their Hoſteſſe kiſſed at <hi>Dover,</hi> and a Gentleman ſalute a Lady in the ſtreets of <hi>London;</hi> relateth at his coming home, ſtrange <hi>Chimera's</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> modeſty.

I remember I met in <hi>Paris</hi> with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Doctor and the Maſter of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there, who complained much of the laſciviouſneſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> women: and how infamouſly every <hi>French</hi> Taylor that came from us, reported of them: withall, he proteſted, that it did not grieve him much, becauſe he thought it a juſt judgement of God upon our Nation, that all the married men ſhould be cuckolds. A ſtrange piece of Divinity to me who never before had heard ſuch preaching: but this was the reaſon of the Doctrine: In the old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Maſſe-book called <hi>Secundum uſum Sarum,</hi> the woman at the time of marriage, promiſeth her future husband to be <hi>bonny and buxom at bed and at board, till death us depart, &amp;c.</hi> This being too light for the gravity of the action then in hand, and in mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſomewhat leſſe reverend then a Church duty would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; the reformers of that book thought good to alter: and have put in the place of it, <hi>to love, cheriſh and obey.</hi> That this was a ſufficient aſſurance of a conjugal faith, he would not grant; becauſe the promiſe of being <hi>Buxom</hi> in bed was excluded. Beſides he accounted the ſuppoſed diſhoneſty of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> wives, as a vengeance plucked down upon the heads of the people, for chopping and changing the words of the holy Sacrament: (for ſuch they eſteem the form of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55011:48"/>
Matrimony) though his argument needed no anſwer, yet this accutation might expect one: and an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (though not of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Faith) thus laid open the abuſe; and ſeemed to ſpeak it out of knowledge. When the <hi>Monſieurs</hi> come over full purſed to <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>French Pandars,</hi> which lie in wait for ſuch booties, grow into their acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: and promiſe them the embraces of ſuch a Dame of the City, or ſuch a Lady of the Court; women perchance famed for admirable beauties. But as <hi>Ixion</hi> amongſt the Poets expected <hi>Juno,</hi> and enjoyed a cloud: ſo theſe begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led wretches in ſtead of thoſe eminent perſons mentioned to them, take into their boſomes ſome of the common proſtitutes of the Town.

                     <p>I Have now done with the <hi>French,</hi> both men and women: a people much extolled by many of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Travellers, for all thoſe graces which may enoble &amp; adorn both ſexes. For my part, having obſerved them as well as I could,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55011:50"/>
and traced them in all their ſeveral humors: I ſet up my reſt with this propoſition, that <hi>there is nothing in them to be envied but their Countrey.</hi> To that indeed I am earneſtly, and I think not unworthily affected: here being nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which may be required, to raiſe and reward ones liking. If nature was ever prodigal of her bleſſings, or ſcattered them with an over-plentiful hand; it was in this Iſland: into which we were entred, as ſoon as we paſſed over the bridge of <hi>Pontoyſe.</hi> The firſt part of it, which laſted for three leagues; was upon the plain of a mountain: but ſuch a mountain, as will hardly yeeld to the beſt valley in <hi>Europe,</hi> out of <hi>France.</hi> On both ſides of us the Vines grew up in a juſt length, and promiſed to the husbandman a thriving vintage. The Wines they yeeld are far better then thoſe of <hi>Normandy,</hi> or <hi>Gaſcoyne;</hi> and indeed the beſt in the whole Continent, thoſe of <hi>Orleans</hi> excepted: yet what we ſaw here, was but as a bit to prepare our ſtomachs; leſt we ſhould ſurfeit in the valley.</p>
                     <p>Here we beheld nature in her richeſt veſtiments. The fields ſo interchangeably planted with Wheat and Vines, that had <hi>L. Florus</hi> once beheld it, he would never have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto <hi>Campania</hi> the title of <hi>Cereris &amp; Bacchi certamen.</hi> Theſe fields were diſperſedly here and there, beſet with Cherry trees; which conſidered with the reſt, gave unto the eye an excellent object. For the Vines yet green; the Wheat ready for the ſithe; and the cherries now fully ripened, and ſhewing forth their beauties through the vails of the leaves: made ſuch a various and delightſome mixture of colours, that no art could have expreſſed it ſelf more delectably. If you have ever ſeen an exquiſite Moſaical work, you may the beſt judge of the beauty of this valley. Add to this, that the River <hi>Seine</hi> being now paſt <hi>Paris;</hi> either to embrace that flouriſhing ſoyle, or out of a wanton deſire to play with it ſelf, hath divided it ſelf into ſundry leſſer channels; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides its ſeveral windings and turnings: ſo that one may very juſtly, and not irreligiouſly, conceive it to be an Idea, or repreſentation of the Garden of <hi>Eden:</hi> the river ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ſeparating it ſelf, to water the ground. This valley is of a very large circuit; and as the <hi>Welch men</hi> ſay of <hi>Angleſey.

                     <p>It is called the Valley of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> from the Town or Caſtle of <hi>Montmorency</hi> ſeated in it: but this town nameth not the Valley only. It giveth name alſo to the ancient family of Dukes of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> the antienteſt houſe of Chriſtendome. He ſtileth himſelf <hi>Le primier Chriſtian &amp; plus viel Baron de France:</hi> and it is ſaid that his anceſtors received the Faith of Chriſt by the preaching of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Paris.</hi> Their principal houſes are that of <hi>Chantilly,</hi> and <hi>Ecquoan,</hi> both ſeated in the Iſle: this laſt being given unto the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Dukes Father, by King <hi>Henry</hi> 4. to whom it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated by the condemnation of one of his Treaſurers. This houſe alſo (and ſo I leave it) hath been obſerved to have yeelded to <hi>France,</hi> more Conſtables, Marſhals, Admirals, and the like officers of power and command, then any three other in the whole Kingdome. Inſomuch that I may ſay of it, what <hi>Irenicus</hi> doth of the Count <hi>Palatines,</hi> the name of the Countrey only changed: <hi>Non alta Galliae eſt familia, cui plus debeat nobilitas.</hi> The now Duke, named <hi>Henry,</hi> is at this preſent Admiral of <hi>France.</hi>

                     <p>The moſteminent place in all this Iſle is <hi>Mont-martre,</hi> emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent I mean by reaſon of its height; though it hath alſo enough of antiquity to make it remarkable. It is ſeated within a mile of <hi>Paris,</hi> high upon a mountain: on which many of the faithfull, during the time that <hi>Gaule</hi> was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh, were made Martyrs. Hence the name. Though <hi>Paris</hi> was the place of apprehenſion and ſentence, yet was this Mountain commonly the ſcaffold of execution: it being the cuſtome of the ancients, neither to put to death, nor to bury within the wals of their Cities. Thus the <hi>Jewes</hi> when they cruciſied our Saviour, led him out of the City of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> unto Mount <hi>Calvarie:</hi> unto which St. <hi>Paul</hi> is thought to allude, Heb. 13. ſaying, <hi>Let us. therefore go forth

to him, &amp;c.</hi> Thus alſo doth St. <hi>Luke</hi> (to omit other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) report of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> Act. 7. <hi>And they caſt him out of the city, and ſtoned him.</hi> So in the ſtate of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Veſtall Virgin having committed ſornication, was ſtifled in the <hi>Campus ſceleratus;</hi> and other malefactors thrown down the <hi>Tarpeian</hi> rock: both ſituate without the Town. So alſo had the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> a place of execution, from the praecipice of an hill, which theycalled the <gap reason="foreign">

As they permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not executions of malefactors within their wals: ſo neither would they ſuffer the beſt of their Citizens to be buried within them. This was it which made <hi>Abraham</hi> to buy him a field wherein to bury his dead: and thus we read in the 7. of <hi>Luke,</hi> that the widow of <hi>Naims</hi> ſon was <hi>carried out to be buried.</hi> This cuſtome alſo we find amongſt the <hi>Athenians, Corinthians,</hi> and other of the <hi>Grecians, Qui in agris ſuis</hi> (as ſaith <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro) aut in fundo ſubur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bano, ſeu in avito &amp; patrio ſolo corpora humari conſuevere.</hi> Amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> it was the faſhion to burn the bodies of the dead, within their City. This continued till the bringing in of the Lawes of <hi>Athens,</hi> commonly called the Lawes of the 12. Tables: one of which Lawes runneth in theſe words, <hi>In urbe ne ſepelito, neve urito.</hi> After this prohibition, their dead corps were firſt burned in <hi>Campus Martius;</hi> and their urnes covered in ſundry places in the fields. The fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent urnes or ſepulchral ſtones, digged up amongſt us here in <hi>England,</hi> are ſufficient teſtimonies of this aſſertion. Beſides we may finde in <hi>Appian,</hi> that the chief reaſon why the rich men in <hi>Rome</hi> would not yeeld to that Law, called <hi>Lex Agraria,</hi> or the Law of dividing the <hi>Roman</hi> poſſeſſions equally among the people, was, becauſe they thought it an irreligious thing that the Monuments of their forefathers ſhould be ſold unto others. The firſt that is regiſtred to have been buried in the City, was <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour. Afterwards it was granted as an honourary to ſuch as had deſerved well of the republick: and when the Chriſtian Religion prevailed, and Church-yards, thoſe dormitories of Saints were conſecrated; the liberty of burying within the wals, was to all equally granted.</p>

On this ground it not being lawful to put to death or bury, within the Town of <hi>Paris;</hi> this Mountain was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate to thoſe purpoſes. Then was it only a Mountain; now it is enlarged unto a Town: it hath a poor wall, an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey of <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monks, and a Chappel called <hi>La Chapelle des Martyrs;</hi> both founded by <hi>Lewis</hi> the 6. called the Groſſe. Amongſt others, which received here the Crown of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, none more famous then St. <hi>Denis</hi> (ſaid to be <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius Areopagita)</hi> the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Paris; Rusticus</hi> his Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt; and <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> his Deacon. The time when, under the reign of <hi>Domition;</hi> the perſon by whoſe command, <hi>Feſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus</hi> Governor of <hi>Paris;</hi> the crime, for not bowing before the Altar of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and offering ſacrifice unto him. Of St. <hi>Denis</hi> being the patron or tutelary Saint of <hi>France,</hi> the Legend reports ſtrange wonders. As namely, when the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner had ſmitten off his head, that he caught it between his armes; and ran with it down the hill as faſt as his legs could carry him; half a mile from the place of his execution, he ſate down and reſted: and ſo he did nine times in all, even till he came to the place where his Church is now built. There he fell down and died, being three <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles from <hi>Mont-martre:</hi> and there he was buried together with <hi>Ruſtious,</hi> and <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> who not being able to go as faſt as he did, were brought after him by the people. <hi>O im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudentiam admirabilem &amp; vere Romanam!</hi> and yet ſo far was the ſucceeding age poſſeſſed with a belief of this miracle, that in the nine ſeveral places where he is ſaid to have reſted there are erected ſo many hanſome Croſſes of ſtone; all of a making.</p>
                     <p>To the memory of this Saint, did <hi>Dagobert</hi> the firſt build a Temple: and the times enſuing improved it to a Town. Afterwards in honour of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> and becauſe it lay neer <hi>Paris;</hi> ſome of the following Kings beſtowed a wall upon it. A wall it is of a large circuit, and very much unpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the Town, which ſtandeth in it, for all the world like a <hi>Spaniards</hi> little face in his great ruffe, or like a ſmall chop of Mutton in a large diſh of pottage at the three penny Ordinary. Thus was the Town built (as you ſee) by natural means: but it was not ſo with the Temple. Unleſſe that be worth a miracle, both in the building, and in the conſecrating of it: I will not give a ſtraw for it.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55011:52"/>
Thus, then ſaith the ſtory. <hi>Diagobert</hi> afterwards King of <hi>France,</hi> during the life of <hi>Clotoyre</hi> the ſecond his Father, had cruelly ſlain <hi>Sadraſegille</hi> his governour. To avoid the fury of his Father, much incenſed with that unprincely action; he was compelled to wander up and down <hi>France</hi> hungry and thirſty. And ſo he went, and he went, (for this tale ſhould be told in the ſame ſtile, that wenches tell theirs by the fire ſide) till he came to the Sepulchre of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> where he laid down and ſlept: and then there appeared unto him a fine old man, with a ſtaffe in his hand, and he told him that his father was dead, and that he ſhould be King, and he prayed him of all loves, that when he came to be King, he would build a Church there, in the honour of St. <hi>Denis.</hi> He had an hard heart, that could deny ſo ſweet an old man ſo little a courteſie, for ſo much good newes, and I trow the King was more kinde then ſo. And ſo when the Church was built, the Biſhop was ſent for in all haſte to bleſſe it. But it chanced that the night before the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Biſhop was to bleſſe it, there came to the Town an ugly Leper, and the fouleſt that ever was ſeen: and this Leper would needs lie in the Church. And when he was there, about twelve a clock at night, our Saviour came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church in garments as white as the driven ſnow, and there came with him the Apoſtles, and the Angels and the Martyrs, and the ſweeteſt Muſick that ever was heard in the world. And then Chriſt bleſſed the Church, and ſaid unto the Leper, that he ſhould tell the Biſhop that the Church was already bleſſed, and for a token of it, he gave the Leper his health, who preſently became as fine a ſweet youth as one ſhould ſee in a ſummers day. <hi>Auditum admiſſi riſum teneatis?</hi> you may laugh if you pleaſe, but I'le aſſure you this is the ſtory: neither is it a jot the leſſe authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick becauſe of the ſtile. Such ridiculous ſtuffe, did the Fryers and Munks of thoſe times invent to pleaſe and blinde the people. So prone were our Anceſtors to believe as Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, what ever was delivered unto them by theſe Impoſtors. <hi>Majoribus noſtris tam facilis in mendaciis fides fuit, ut temere credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derint etlam monſtroſa miracula: &amp; quicquid famae licet fingere, illis erat libenter laudire.

                     <p>But (to omit the additions of the Legend) true it is, that <hi>Dagobert</hi> the firſt, was the founder of the Church: which was after rebuilt and beautified by the 25. Abbot of it, called <hi>Sugger,</hi> in the reign of King <hi>Lewis</hi> the ſixth. A reverend and comely fabrick, certainly it is; dark, as the Churches of thoſe times commonly were: and none of the pooreſt. It maintaineth 262 Monks and an Abbot, whoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ngle reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue is thought to be worth 10000 Crowns and upwards. The preſent Abbot is <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lorrein,</hi> ſon to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> a young Gentleman of ſome 14 years of age, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts: but of him more hereafter. The Abbot of it, among many other priviledges, hath a full power upon the lives, goods, and honours of his vaſſals: and hath a voice in the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> as full and binding as any of the Counſellors there ſitting. As for the Church it ſelf, it is in height 80 foot, 100 in breadth; and in length 300. The high Altar, under which the bodies of St. <hi>Denis</hi> and his two fellow-Martyrs, are ſaid to be buried; is a very rich and excellent work: the Crucifix which ſtandeth over it, being all of pure gold, enchaſed with divers Pearls and precious Stones of great value. Before it hangeth a ſilver Lamp con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually burning: and if you look about it, you ſhall ſee the richeſt and the faireſt glaſſe for painting, in all <hi>France;</hi> that of <hi>Amiens</hi> only excepted. One thing further I will note in this Church, before I come to to the Tombes and reliques; which is, how <hi>Henry</hi> 4. in this Church ſaid his firſt Maſſe, after his laſt reconcilement to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And good reaſon I have to ſay his laſt. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been firſt brought up in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faith, he was by his Mother made a Proteſtant. At the maſſacre of <hi>Paris,</hi> fear of death or impriſonment, turned him Papiſt: liberty again made him an Hugonot. In this vein he continued till the year 1595. and then once more re-emboſom'd himſelf into the <hi>Roman</hi> Synagogue; which was the time we now ſpeak of. <hi>Quo teneam nodo mutantem Protea vultum?</hi> The only <hi>Proteus</hi> in matters of faith in our times. Doctor <hi>Perne</hi> was a Diamond to him.</p>

It is now time I ſhould ſhew you the Reliques; but you muſt firſt ſtay till the Clerk hath put on his Surplice. I have heard of a blinde Prieſt that could never mumble over his Maſſe handſomely without his ſpectacles. This fellow and his ſurplice is juſt like him. I perſwaded my ſelf that the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice without the Clerk, could marſhall the Reliques, as well as the Clerk without the Surplice. As ſoon as he was ſadled for his journey, he putteth himſelf into his way; and followed it with a pace ſo nimble, that there was no keeping of him company: his tongue ran ſo faſt, that the quickeſt eye there, was fain to give him over in plain ground: the fellow that ſheweth the Tombs at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> being no more to be compared to him, for the volubility of his chops, then a Capuchin to a Jeſuite: yet as we learned afterwards of him (when he was out of his road) they were thus diſpoſed. On the right hand of the Altar, (not the high Altar above mentioned) there are ſaid to be kept one of the Nails which faſtned our Saviour to the Croſſe. 2. A piece of the Croſſe it ſelf. 3. Some of the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> Milk. 4. The arm of St. <hi>Simeon</hi> ſet in a caſe of gold. And 5. The reliques of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> reſerved in a little chappel, all of gold alſo; and built in the faſhion of the <hi>Noſtre dame in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> On the left, there was ſhewed us the head of St. <hi>Denis</hi> and a part of his body. But I miſtake my ſelf, it was not the head, but the portraiture of it in gold; the head being ſaid to be within it; by his repreſentation he ſeemeth to have had a very reverend and awfull countenance: though I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf that the rich Crown and Miter which he there weareth (and certainly they are of a high value) never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longedto him in his life. On each ſide of the head are two Angels ſupporting it, all of gold alſo: both which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the head and ornaments ſupported, are reported to be the work of one <hi>Eloy, le plus artificiel orfeure de ſon temps,</hi> the cunningeſt Goldſmith of his time; who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was made Biſhop of <hi>Noyon,</hi> and Sainted.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Reliques I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when I come to the holy Chappel in <hi>Paris;</hi> ſomewhat now of the honour due unto the memory of Martyrs. I am none of thoſe that think the memories of thoſe Heroes of

the primitive times, not to be honoured in the duſt; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would I aſſault their <hi>ſhrines</hi> with an irreverent finger: on the other ſide, they ſhall never have my prayers directed to them, nor my devotions; nor can I think it lawfull to give the remnants of them any bodily obſervance. Though I do and will honour, I dare not worſhip them. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath cut out a mid way between the <hi>Papiſt</hi> and the <hi>Zelot,</hi> in the 8 Book of his moſt excellent work <hi>De Civitate dei,</hi> and his path it is beſt, to follow, <hi>Honoramus ſane memorias corum tanquam ſanctorum hominum Dei, qui uſque ad mortem cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum pro veritate certarunt:</hi> and a little after, he ſheweth the end of theſe memorials, <hi>viz. Vt ea celebritate Deo vere gratias de eorum victori is agamus, &amp; nos ad imitationem talium coronarum eorum memoriae renovatione adhortemur.</hi> One relique there is of which this uſe cannot poſſibly be made; and what do you think that ſhould be, but the Lanthorn which <hi>Judas</hi> uſed when he went to apprehend his Maſter? a prety one it is (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) richly beſet with ſtuddes of Cryſtall, through which all the light cometh; the main of it being of a ſubſtance not tranſparent. Had it been ſhewed me within the firſt <hi>century</hi> of years after the paſſion, I might, perhaps, have been fooled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a belief; for I am confident it can be no older.

                     <p>From the <hi>reliques</hi> of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> proceed we to thoſe of <hi>Kings;</hi> and amongeſt thoſe there is nothing which will long detain an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man. He that hath ſeen the tombs at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> will think theſe to be but trifles, if he conſider the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, or the riches and the magnificence. The chief of thoſe many mean ones which are there, are thoſe of <hi>Henry</hi> II. and <hi>Katharine de Medices</hi> his wife, in a little Chappell of their own building; both in their full proportion, and in their royall habiliments, exceeding ſtately. There is alſo a neat tomb of the ſame <hi>Henry,</hi> built all of braſſe, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by four braſſe pillars: his Statua of the ſame mettle placed on the top of it, and compoſed as if at his prayers. The reſt are more in tale then weight. But the chief beauties of this Church, are in the treaſurie, which it was not my happineſſe to ſee. As I am informed, the moſt remarkable

things in it are theſe, The Swords of <hi>Joan</hi> the Virgin, <hi>Charles</hi> the great, <hi>Rowland</hi> his couſen, and that of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. when he was Crowned.

And here we paſſed by <hi>Madrit,</hi> ſo called of the King of <hi>Spains</hi> houſe at <hi>Madrit,</hi> after the forme of which it is built. The founder of it was <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, who being taken Priſoner at the battail of <hi>Pavie, ann. dom.</hi> 1525. and thence carryed into <hi>Spain,</hi> had no leſſe then a twelve months time to draw the platforme. A fine Countrey houſe it ſeemed to be; but our journey lay beyond it. One league beyond it lay <hi>Ruall,</hi> a ſmall Town belonging to the Abbey of St. <hi>Denis.</hi> In a corner of this Town the Queen Mother hath a fine ſummer houſe, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly adorned with retired walks, and a moſt curious va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of water-works: for beſides the formes of divers glaſſes, pillars, and Geometricall figures, all framed by the water; there were birds of ſundry ſorts ſo artificially made, that they both deceived the eye by their motion, and the ear by their melodie. Somewhat higher in the middeſt of a moſt delicious Garden, are two Fountains of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable workmanſhip: In the firſt, the portraitures of <hi>Cerberus,</hi> the <hi>Boar</hi> of <hi>Calydon,</hi> the <hi>Nemean</hi> Lyon; and in the navell of it <hi>Hercules</hi> killing <hi>Hydra.</hi> In the other only a <hi>Crocodile</hi> full of wild and unruly tricks, and ſending from

his throat muſick not much different from Organs. Had your eyes been ſhut, you would have thought your ſelf in ſome Cathedrall Church: this melody of the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> and that other of the birds, ſo exactly counterfeiting the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of a well ordered Quire. And now we are come into the Grove, a place ſo full of retired walks, ſo ſweetly and delect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>bly contrived, that they would even entice a man to melancholy, becauſe in them even melancholy would prove delightfull. The trees ſo interchangeably folded one within the other, that they were at once a ſhelter againſt winde and ſun: yet not ſo ſullenly cloſe, but that they afforded the eye an excellent Lordſhip over the Vines and verdure of the earth impriſoned within them: it ſeemed a Grove, an Orchard, and a Vineyard, ſo variouſly interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and mixt together, as if it had been the purpoſe of the Artiſt to make a man fall in love with confuſion. In the middle of this Wilderneſſe was feated the houſe, environed round about with a Moat of running water. The houſe pretty, and therefore little; built rather for a banquet, then a feaſt. It was built and enriched with this variety of pleaſures, by Mr. <hi>de Ponte,</hi> Taylor to King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and was no queſtion the beſt garment that ever he cut out in his life. Dying, he gave it to Mr. <hi>Landerboyne,</hi> once his ſervant, and now his ſon by adoption; of whom the Queen Mother ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a liking to it, bought it; giving him in exchange, an office in the Treaſury worth 400000 crowns to be ſold.</p>

The Town is poor and hath nothing in it remarkable but the name, which it took from St. <hi>Germain</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Auxerre,</hi> who together with St. <hi>Lupus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tropes,</hi> ſailed into <hi>Britain</hi> to root out <hi>Pelagianiſm.</hi> The Caſtle or ſeat Royall is divided into two parts, the old and the new; the old, which is next unto the Town, is built of Bricks, and for forme it is triangular: founded it was at the firſt by
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55011:55"/>
                        <hi>Charles</hi> V. ſince ſtrengthned and beautified by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> when it was in their poſſeſſion: <hi>Francis</hi> I. added to it the upper ſtory and the battlements, and <hi>in memoriam facti,</hi> hath left a Capitall <hi>F</hi> upon every of the Chimnies. The new houſe, diſtant from the old about a furlong, and to which you deſcend by a handſome green Court, was built by <hi>Henry</hi> IV. It conſiſteth of three ſeverall parts, all joyned together, the two outermoſt quadrangular, that in the middle almoſt round and in the faſhion of a <hi>Jewiſh Synagogue.</hi> Here we ſaw the Volatory full of ſundry forain birds, and in one of the lower rooms great ſtore of outlandiſh conies; but theſe were acceſſories. The principall was the majeſty of the houſe, which is, indeed, worth the obſervation. The Palace of the <hi>Loure</hi> ſo much famed, is not to be named in the ſame day with it. The rooms are well ordered, and high roofed, gorgeouſly ſet out with the curioſities of the Painter. In ſome of the Chambers they ſhewed us ſome Poeticall ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons expreſſed by the pencill in the windowes and on the wainſcot, and ſeemed to glory much in them. I confeſſe they might have plentifully poſſeſſed my fancy, had I not ſeen the window of <hi>Gorrambury gallery,</hi> belonging to the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable <hi>Francis Viſcount</hi> St. <hi>Albans;</hi> a window in which all the Fables of <hi>Ovids Metamorphoſis,</hi> are ſo naturally and lively diſſembled, that if ever art went beyond it ſelf, it was in that admirable expreſſion.</p>
                     <p>Let us now take a view of the water-works, and here we ſhall ſee in the firſt water-houſe, which is a ſtately large walk vaulted over head, the effigies of a Dragon, juſt againſt the entrance; an unquiet beaſt that vomiteth on all that come nigh it. At the end toward the right hand is the Statua of a Nymph ſitting before a paire of Organs. Upon the looſing of one of the pipes, the Nymphs fingers began to manage the keyes, and brought the inſtrument to yield ſuch a muſick, that if it were not that of an Organ, it was as like it as could be, and not be the ſame. Unto the diviſion of her fingers, her head kept a porportionable time; jolting from one ſhoulder to the other, as I have have ſeen an old fidler at a Wake. In the ſame proportion were the counterfeits of all ſorts of mils, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> before very eagerly diſcharged their functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55011:56"/>
but upon the beginning of this harmony, they ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſtood ſtill, as if they had had ears to have heard it. At the other end towards the left hand, we ſaw a ſhop of Smiths, another of Joiners, and a backſide full of Sawyers and Maſons, all idle. Upon the firſt command of the water, they all fell to their Occupations, and plyed them luſtily; the birds every where ſinging, and ſo ſaving the Artificers the labour of a whiſtling. Beſides, upon the drawing of a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den courtain, there appeared unto us, two Tritons riding on their Dolphins, and each of them with a ſhell in his hand, which interchangeably and in turns ſerved them in ſtead of trumpets. A very happy <hi>decorum,</hi> and truly Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall.</p>

                     <p>Afterward followes Neptune himſelf, fitting in his Chariot, drawn with four Tortoyſes, and graſping his <hi>tricuſpis</hi> or three forked Scepter in his hand: the water under them repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, all this while, a ſea ſomewhat troubled. 36 ſteps from the front of the houſe we deſcended into this water-houſe; and by 60 more we deſcended into a ſecond of the ſame faſhion, but not of an equall length with the other. At the right hand of this, is the whole ſtory of <hi>Perſeus, Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meda</hi> and the Whale lively acted; the Whale being killed, and the Lady unlooſed from the rock very perfectly. But withall, it was ſo cunningly managed, and that with ſuch a mutuall change of fortune, on the parties of both the comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, that one who had not known the fable, would have been ſore affraid that the Knight would have loſt the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the Lady her life. At the other end there was ſhown unto us,

                     </p>
                     <p>There appeared unto us the reſemblance of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> playing on a treble Viall, the trees moving with the force of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55011:56"/>
muſick, and the wilde beaſts dancing in two rings about him. An invention which could not but coſt K. <hi>Henry</hi> a great ſum of money; one only ſtring of the fidle being by miſchance broken, having coſt King <hi>Lewis</hi> his ſon 1500 Livres. Upon the opening of a double-leaved door, there were exhibited to us divers repreſentations and conceits, which certainly might have been more gracefull, if they had not ſo much in them of the puppet play. By ſome ſteps more we deſcended into the Garden, and by as many more into a Green, which opened into the water ſide; in which the goodlieſt flower and moſt pleaſing to my eyes, was the <hi>ſtatua</hi> of an horſe in braſſe, of that bigneſſe, that I and one of my companions could ſtand in the neck of him. But diſmounting from this horſe, we mounted our own, and ſo took our leaves of St. <hi>Germain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the other ſide of <hi>Paris,</hi> and up the river, we ſaw an other of the Kings houſes, called St. <hi>Vincent</hi> or <hi>Vincennes.</hi> It was beautified with a large part by <hi>Philip Auguſtus, anno</hi> 1185. who alſo walled the Park, and repleniſhed it with Deer. In this houſe have dyed many famous perſonages, as <hi>Philip</hi> the fair, <hi>Lewis Hutin,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the fair; but none ſo much to be lamented as that of our <hi>Henry</hi> V. cut down in the flower of his age, and middeſt of his victories: a man moſt truly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, and the <hi>Alexander</hi> of his times. Not far from thence is an old Caſtle, once ſtrong, but time hath made it now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable. The people call it <hi>Chaſteau Biſeſtre,</hi> corruptly for <hi>Vinceſtre;</hi> which maketh me believe it was built by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> when they were maſters of this Iſle.</p>

                     <p>It hath had in diversages, two ſeverall names; the one taken from the people, the other from the ſituation; the name taken from the people is that of <hi>Paris. J. Caeſar</hi> in his <hi>Commentaries</hi> making mention of the Nation of the <hi>Pariſii,</hi> and at that time calling this City <hi>Urbem Pariſiorum. Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> calleth it by the ſame appellative; for as yet the name of <hi>Paris</hi> was not appropriated unto it. As for theſe <hi>Pariſii,</hi> it is well known that they were a people of <hi>Gallia Celtica;</hi> but why the people were ſo called, hath been queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and that deſervedly.

But I will not ſtand to this <hi>etymologie.</hi> The names of great Cities are as obſcure as thoſe of their founders; and the conjecturall derivations of them are oftentimes rather plauſible then probable; and ſometimes neither. As for the antiquity of it, it is ſaid to be built in the time of <hi>Amaſia</hi> King of <hi>Judah;</hi> but this alſo is uncertain: the beginnings of antient Cities, being as dark and hidden, as the reaſons of their names.

                     <p>The other name of this City, which is indeed the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and was taken from the ſituation of it, is <hi>Lutetia,</hi> from <hi>lutum</hi> dirt; as being ſeated in an exceeding clammy and dirty ſoil.

This name of <hi>Lutetia</hi> continued till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Franks</hi> into theſe parts: who to endeer the nation of the <hi>Pariſii,</hi> and oblige them the more faithfully to do them ſervice, commanded it for ever after to be called <hi>Paris.</hi> But the ſituation of this Town gave it not only the name; it gave it alſo (as the cuſtome of Godfathers in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> a chriſtning gift, which is the riches of it; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, the preheminence. In how delicate and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſoil it is ſituate, I have already told you in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the vally of <hi>Montmorencie</hi> where it ſtandeth. If you will believe <hi>Comines</hi> in the firſt book of his Hiſtories, he will tell you, that <hi>Ceſt la citè que jamais ie veiſſe environneè de meilleux pais et plantureux;</hi> of all the Cities which ever he ſaw, it is environed with the beſt and fruitful'ſt Countrey. The river of <hi>Seine</hi> is alſo, no queſtion, a great help to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of it; for though it be not Navigable unto the Town, yet it giveth free paſſage unto boats of an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent big burden, into which the ſhips are unladen, and ſo their commodities carryed up the water. A profitable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter courſe between the Sea and the City for the Merchants. Of theſe boats there are an infinite company that plie up and down the water, and more indeed, as the ſaid <hi>Comines</hi> is of opinion, than any man can believe that hath not ſeen them.</p>
                     <p>It is in circuite, as <hi>Boterus</hi> is of opinion, 12 miles. Others judge it at 10. For my part, I dare not gueſſe it to be above 8, and yet I was told by a <hi>French</hi> man, that it was in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe no leſſe then 14 leagues within the wals; an untruth bigger then the Town. For figure it is circular, that being, according to <hi>Geometricians,</hi> of all figures the moſt capacious. And queſtionleſſe if it be true, that <hi>Urbs non in moenibus, ſed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55011:58"/>
in civibus poſita eſt; Paris</hi> may challenge as great a circuit as the moſt of <hi>Europe:</hi> it being little inferiour to the biggeſt, for the multitudes of her inhabitants. Joyne the compaſſe and the populouſneſſe together, and you ſhall hear the wiſeſt of the <hi>French</hi> men ſay, that <hi>Que ce qu' eſt l' ame a la raiſon, el la prunelle a l' oeil; cela meſme eſt Paris a la France.</hi> Add to this the verdict of <hi>Charles</hi> V. who being demanded which he thought to be the biggeſt City of <hi>France:</hi> anſwered, <hi>Roven:</hi> and being then asked, what he thought of <hi>Paris:</hi> made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Unpais;</hi> that it was a whole Countrey. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour did well to flatter <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, who asked him theſe queſtions, and in whoſe power he then was; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he might have given men good cauſe to ſuſpect his judgement. The truth is, that <hi>Paris</hi> is a fair and goodly Town; yet withall, it is nothing like the miracle that ſome men make it. Were the figure of <hi>London</hi> altered, and all the houſes of it caſt into a Ring; I dare able it a larger and more goodly Town then <hi>Paris,</hi> and that in the compariſon, it may give it at the leaſt half a mile oddes.</p>
                     <p>For matter of ſtrength and reſiſtance, certain it is that this City is exceeding well ſeated, were it as well fortifyed. It lyeth in a plain flat levell, and hath no hils nigh unto it, from which it can any way be annoyed; and for the caſting and making of rowling-trenches, I think the ſoil is hardly ſerviceable. If Art were no more wanting to the ſtrength of it then Nature, in mine opinion, it might be made almoſt impregnable. <hi>Henry</hi> IV. ſeeing the preſent weakneſſe of it, had once a purpoſe (as it is ſaid) to have ſtrengthned it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the modern art of Fortifications. But it went no further then the purpoſe. He was a great builder, and had many projects of Maſonry in his head, which were little for his profit; and this would have proved leſſe then any. For beſides the infinite ſums of mony which would have been employed in ſo immenſe a work; what had this been in effect, but <hi>to put a ſword into the hand of a mad man?</hi> The mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies and ſedition of this people have made it little infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to <hi>Leige</hi> or <hi>Gaunt,</hi> the two moſt revolting Towns of <hi>Europe.</hi> And again, the <hi>Baricadoes</hi> againſt the perſon of King <hi>Henry</hi> III. and the large reſiſtance it made to himſelf,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55011:59"/>
being weak; were ſufficient to inſtruct him what might be expected from it by his ſucceſſors, when it ſhould be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and inabled to rebellion.</p>
                     <p>The preſent ſtrength of the Town then is not great, the wals being very weak and ruinous; and thoſe other few helps which it hath, being little availeable for defence. The beautifulleſt part of the whole reſiſtance is the ditch, deep, precipitate and broad; and to ſay no more of it, an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ward, were there any thing elſe correſpondent to it. As for the Fort next unto St. <hi>Antonies</hi> gate, called the <hi>Baſtille;</hi> it is in my conceit too little to protect the Town, and too low to command it. When Swords only and Pick-axes were in uſe, and afterwards in the infancie of guns, it did ſome ſervice in the nature of a Fortreſſe: now it ſerveth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally as a priſon for thoſe of the greater ſort, who will permit themſelves to be taken. It is ſaid to be built by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> when they were Lords of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the vulgar are all of this opinion. Others, of the more learned ſort, make it to be the work of one of the Provoſts of the City. <hi>Du Cheſne</hi> calleth him <hi>Hugues Aubriot,</hi> in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> V. when as yet the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had nothing to do here. The word <hi>Baſtille</hi> in generall, ſignifieth a Fortreſſe; the article <hi>la,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed before it, maketh it a name, and appropriateth it unto this building. There are alſo two little turrets, juſt againſt the gallery of the <hi>Louure,</hi> on both ſides of the <hi>Seine,</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the defence of the River; though now they are little able to anſwer that intention: they alſo are fathered on the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but how true I know not. An other place I marked, deſigned perhaps for a Rampart, but imployed at this time only by windmils. It is a goodly mount of earth, high and capacious, ſituate cloſe unto the gate called St. <hi>Martins;</hi> the moſt defenſible part, if wel manned, of all <hi>Paris.</hi> Thus is the ſtrength of this Town (as you ſee) but ſmall; and if <hi>Henry</hi> IV. lay ſo long before it with his Army, it was not becauſe he could not take it, but becauſe he would not. He was loath (as <hi>Biron</hi> adviſed him) to receive the bird naked, which he expected with all its feathers; and this anſwer he gave the Lord <hi>Willougbie.</hi> who undertook to force an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into it.</p>

For the <hi>ſtreets,</hi> they are many of them of a lawfull and competent breadth, well pitched under the foot with fair and large peble. This paving of it was the work of <hi>Philip Auguſtus, anno</hi> 1223. or there abouts; before which time it could not but be miſerably dirty, if not unpaſſable. As it now is, the leaſt rain maketh it very ſlippery and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; and as little a continuance of warme weather, ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and poiſonous. But whether this noiſomeneſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the nature of the ground, or the fluttiſhneſſe of the people in their houſes, or the neglect of the Magiſtrates in not providing a ſufficiency of Scavengers, or all, I am not to determine. This I am confident of, that the naſtieſt lane in <hi>London,</hi> is Frankincenſe and Juniper, to the ſweeteſt ſtreet in this City. The antient by-word was (and there is good reaſon for it) <hi>Il deſtaint comme la fange de Paris:</hi> had I the power of making proverbs, I would only change <hi>il deſtaint</hi> into <hi>il puit,</hi> and make the by-word ten times more Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox.

I know now not how true it is of that City, I am ſure it may be juſtly verified of this. It was therefore not unjudiciouſly ſaid of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, that he thought <hi>Paris</hi> was the ſtrongeſt Town in Chriſtendome; for he took (ſtrong) in that ſenſe as we do in <hi>England,</hi> when we ſay ſuch a man hath a <hi>ſtrong-breath.</hi> Theſe things conſidered, it could not but be an infinite happineſſe granted by nature to our <hi>Henry</hi> V. that he never ſtopped his noſe at any ſtink, as our Chronicles report of him. Otherwiſe, in my conſcience, he had never been able to keep his Court there. But that which moſt amazed me, is, that in ſuch a perpetuated conſtancy of ſtinks, there ſhould yet be found ſo large and admirable a variety. A variety ſo ſpeciall and diſtinct, that any Chymicall noſe (I dare l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſuch abominable and fearfull knives, as would grieve a mans heart to ſee them: and their Glovers, are worſe then they; you would imagine by their Gloves, that the hand for which they are made, were cut of by the wriſt: yet on the other ſide they are very perfect at tooth-picks, beard bruſhes, and (which I hold the moſt commendable art of them) at the cutting of a ſeal. Their Mercers are but one degree removed from a Pedler; ſuch as in <hi>England</hi> we call Chapmen, that is a Pedler with a ſhop.

But concerning the ridiculous bravery of the poor <hi>Pariſian,</hi> take along with you this ſtory: Upon our firſt coming into <hi>Paris,</hi> there came to viſit a <hi>German Lord,</hi> whom we met a ſhip-bord, a couple of <hi>French Gallants,</hi> his acquaintance; the one of them (for I
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55011:61"/>
did not much obſerve the other) had a ſuit of <hi>Turkie grogram</hi> doubled with Taffeta, cut with long ſlaſhes, or carbona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do's, after the <hi>French</hi> faſhion, and belaied with bugle lace. Through the openings of his doublet appeared his ſhirt of the pureſt Holland, and wrought with curious needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work; the points at his waſte and knees, all edged with a ſilver edging; his garters, roſes and hat-band, ſutable to his points; a beaver hat, and a pair of ſilk ſtockins; his cloke alſo of <hi>Turkey grogram,</hi> cut upon black Taffeta. This Lord (for who would have dared to gueſſe him other?) applyed himſelf to me, and perceiving my ignorance in the <hi>French,</hi> accoſted me in <hi>Latine,</hi> which he ſpake indifferently well. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome diſcourſe, he took notice of mine eyes, which were then ſore and ſea-ſick, and promiſed me, if I would call on him at his lodging the next morning, to give me a water, which ſuddenly would reſtore them to their ſtrength and vigor. I humbly thanked his Lordſhip for ſuch an ineffable and immerited favour, in the beſt complement and greateſt obeiſance I could deviſe. It was not for nought, thought I, that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> extoll ſo muth the humanity of this people; nay I began to accuſe the report of envy, as not having publiſhed the one half of their graces and affabilities. <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillum enim virtutum illarum acceperim!</hi> And thus taking my leave of his Honor, I greedily expected the next morning. The morning come, and the hour of viſting his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip almoſt at hand, I ſent a ſervant to fetch a Barber to come trim me and make me neat, as not knowing what occaſion I might have, of ſeeing his Lady or his daughters. Upon the return of the meſſenger, preſengly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth his Altitude, and bidding me ſit down in his chair, he disburdened one of his pockets <hi>(Quis hoc credat, niſi ſit pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſte vetuſtas?)</hi> of a caſe of inſtruments, and the other of a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of linnen.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55011:65"/>
1304. at what time the Scholars having lived formerly diſperſed about the City, began to ſettle themſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this place: and ſo to become a peculiar Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                     <p>The Univerſity was founded by <hi>Charles</hi> the great, <hi>anno</hi> 791. at the perſwaſion of <hi>Alcuine</hi> an <hi>Oxford</hi> man, and the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of venerable <hi>Bede:</hi> who brought with him three of his con diſciples to be the firſt readers there: their names were <hi>Rabbanus Maurus, John Erigena,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Scolus; &amp; Claudus,</hi> who was alſo called <hi>Clement.</hi> To theſe four doth the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Paris</hi> owe its originall and firſt rudiments: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was this the firſt time, that <hi>England</hi> had been the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtreſs unto <hi>France;</hi> we lent them not only their firſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in Divinity and Philoſophy; but from us alſo did they receive the myſteries of their Religion, when they were Heathens. <hi>Diſciplina in Britannia reperta,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Julius Caeſar Com. 6.) atque inde in Galliam tranſlata eſſe exiſtimatur.</hi> An authority not to be queſtioned by any, but by a <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Learning thus new born at <hi>Paris,</hi> continued not long in any full vigour. For almoſt 300 years it was fallen into a deadly trance: and not here only, but alſo through the greateſt part of <hi>Europe: anno</hi> 1160. or thereabouts <hi>Peter Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> the firſt author of Scholaſtical Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and by his followers called the Maſter of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; revived it here in this Town by the favour and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of <hi>Lewis</hi> 7. In his own houſe were the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures firſt read: and after as the numbers of Students did encreaſe, in ſundry other parts of the Town; Colledges they had none till the year 1304. The Scholars till then ſojourning in the houſes of the Citizens, accordingly as they could bargain for their entertainment.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>anno 1304. Joane,</hi> Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> wife to <hi>Philip</hi> the fair, built that Colledge, which then and ever ſince hath been called the Colledge of <hi>Navarre:</hi> and is at this day the faireſt and largeſt of all the reſt. <hi>Nonibi conſtituunt exempla ubi coeperunt, ſed in tenuem accepta tramitem, latiſſime evagandi viam ſibi faciunt:</hi> as <hi>Velleius.</hi> This good example ended not in it ſelf: but incited divers others of the <hi>French</hi> Kings, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to the erecting of convenient places of ſtudy. So that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55011:66"/>
in proceſs of time, <hi>Paris</hi> became enriched with 52 Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. So many it ſtill hath, though the odde forty are little ſerviceable unto learning, for in twelve only of them is there any publick reading, either in Divinity or Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy. Thoſe twelve are the Colledges of <hi>Harcourte. 2. Caillvi,</hi> or the <hi>Petit Sorbonne. 3. Liſſeux,</hi> or <hi>Lexovium. 4 Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courte. 5. Montague. 6. Le Marche. 7. Navarre. 8. De la Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal de Moyne. 9. Le Pleſſis. 10. De Beavais. 11. La Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne. 12. De Clermont,</hi> or the Colledge of the Jeſuites: there are alſo publique readings in the houſes of the four orders of Fryers Mendicants, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> the <hi>Auguſtins,</hi> the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> or <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> and the <hi>Dominicans.</hi> The other Colledges are deſtinated to other uſes. That of <hi>Arras</hi> is converted to an houſe of <hi>Engliſh</hi> fugitives; and there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them hard by the Gate of St. <hi>Jacques,</hi> employed for the reception of the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> In others of them there is lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allotted out to Students, who for their inſtructions have reſort to ſome of the 12 Colledges above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
                     <p>In each of theſe Colledges there is a Rector: moſt of whoſe places yeeld to them but ſmall profit. The greateſt commodity which accreweth to them is raiſed from cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Rents: their preferments being much of a nature with that of a Principal of an Hall in <hi>Oxford;</hi> or that of a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer in an Inne of Chancery in <hi>London.</hi> At the firſt ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their Colledges, they were all prohibited marriage, though I ſee little reaſon for it. There can hardly come any inconvenience or dammage by it, unto the ſcholars un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their charge, by the aſſuming of leaſes into their own hands: for I think few of them have any to be ſo imbezled. <hi>Anno</hi> 1520. or thereabouts it was permitted unto ſuch of them as were Doctors in Phyſick, that they might marry: the Cardinall of <hi>Toute Ville,</hi> Legat in <hi>France,</hi> giving unto them that indulgence. Afterwards in the year 1534. the Doctors of the Lawes petitioned the Univerſity for the like priviledge: which in fine was granted to them, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Court of Parliament. The Doctors of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity are the only Academicals now barred from it: and that not as Rectors, but as Prieſts. Theſe Colledges for their
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55011:66"/>
buildings are very inelegant, and generally little behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the curioſity of the artificer. So confuſed and ſo proportioned in reſpect of our Colledges in <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Exeter</hi> in <hi>Oxford</hi> was ſome 12. years ſince, in compariſon of the reſt: or as the two Temples in <hi>London</hi> now are, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to <hi>Lincolns-Inne.</hi> The revenues of them are ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Fabricks, as mean and curtailed. I could not learn of any Colledge, that hath greater allowances then that of <hi>Sorbonne:</hi> and how ſmall a trifle that is, we ſhall tell you preſently. But this is not the poverty of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>Paris</hi> only: all <hi>France</hi> is troubled with the ſame want, the ſame want of encouragement in learning: neither are the Academies of <hi>Germanie</hi> in any happier ſtate, which occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Eraſmus</hi> that great light of his times, having been in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and ſeen <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to write thus to one of his <hi>Dutch</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, <hi>Vnum Collegium Cantabrigienſe (confidenter dicam) ſuperat vel decem noſtra.</hi> It holdeth good in the neatneſs and graces of the buildings, in which ſenſe he ſpake it: but it had been more undeniable had he intended it of the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues. Yet I was given to underſtand, that at <hi>Tholoze</hi> there was amongſt 20 Colledges, one of an eſpeciall quality: and ſo indeed it is, if rightly conſidered. There are ſaid to be in it 20 Students places, (or fellowſhips as we call them). The Students at their entrance are to lay down <hi>in depoſito</hi> 6000. Florens, or Livres; paid unto him after ſix years, by his ſucceſſor: <hi>Vendere jure poteſt, emerat ille prius.</hi> A pretty market.</p>
                     <p>The Colledge of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> which is indeed the glory of this Univerſity, was built by one <hi>Robert de Sorbonne</hi> of the chamber of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 9. of whom he was very well beloved. It confiſteth meerly of Doctors of Divinity: neither can any of another profeſſion, nor any of the ſame profeſſion not ſo graduated, be admitted into it. At this time their number is about 70; their allowance, a pint of wine, (their pinte is but a thought leſſe then our quart) and a certain quantity of bread daily. Meat they have none allowed them, unleſs they pay for it: but the pay is not much: for five Sols (which amounteth to ſix pence <hi>Engliſh)</hi> a day, they may challenge a competency of fleſh or fiſh, to be ſerved to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55011:67"/>
them at their chambers. Theſe Doctors have the ſole power and authority of conferring degrees in Divinity: the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and other officers of the Univerſity, having nothing to do in it. To them alone belongeth the examination of the ſtudents in the faculty, the approbation, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of the honour: and to their Lectures do all ſuch aſſiduouſly repair, as are that way minded. All of them in their turnes diſcharge this office of reading, and that by ſixes in a day: three of them making good the Pulpit in the forenoon; and as many in the afternoon. Theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors are accounted, together with the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> the principal pillars of the <hi>French</hi> Liberty: whereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are exceeding jealous, as well in matters Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical as Civil. When <hi>Gerſon</hi> Chancellor of <hi>Paris</hi> (he died <hi>Anno</hi> 1429.) had publiſhed a book in approbation of the Councell of <hi>Conſtance;</hi> where it was enacted that the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Councell was greater then that of the Pope: the <hi>Sorborne</hi> Doctors declared that alſo to be their Doctrine. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when <hi>Lewis</hi> the 1, 1. to gratifie Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the 2. purpoſed to aboliſh the force of the pragmatick ſanction; the <hi>Sorbonniſts</hi> in behalf of the Church <hi>Gallican,</hi> and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Paris; Magnis obſiſtebant animis,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Sleidan</hi> in his Commentaries) <hi>&amp; a Papa provocabant ad Concilium.</hi> The Councell unto which they appealed was that of <hi>Baſil;</hi> where that ſanction was made: ſo that by this appeal, they veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their former <hi>Theſis;</hi> that the Councell was above the Pope. And not long ſince, <hi>anno viz.</hi> 1613. caſually mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with a book written by <hi>Becanus,</hi> entituled, <hi>Controverſia Anglicana de poteſtate regis &amp; papae:</hi> they called an aſſembly, and condemned it. For though the main of it, was againſt the power and ſupremacy of the Kings of <hi>England:</hi> yet did it reflect alſo on the authority of the Pope over other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kings by the bie, which occaſioned the Sentence. So jealous are they of the leaſt circumſtances, in which the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of their nation may be endangered.</p>
                     <p>As for the Government of the Univerſity, it hath for its chief directour, a Rector: with a Chancellor, four Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators or Proctors, and as many others, whom they call <hi>Les Intrantes,</hi> to aſſiſt him; beſides the Regents. Of theſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55011:67"/>
the Regents are ſuch Maſters of the Arts, who are by the conſent of the reſt, ſelected to read the publick Lectures of Logick and Philoſophy.

And here it is to be obſerved, that in the <hi>French</hi> Nation, the Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and Intrant, is one year of the Dioceſe of <hi>Paris;</hi> and the following year of the reſt of <hi>France:</hi> the reaſon why that Nation is ſubdivided. Theſe four <hi>Intrantes</hi> thus na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, have amongſt them the election of the Rector: who is their ſupreme Magiſtrate.</p>
                     <p>The preſent Rector is named Mr. <hi>Tarrienus,</hi> of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Harcourte:</hi> a Maſter of the Arts, for a Doctor is not capable of the Office. The honour laſteth only three moneths; which time expired, the <hi>Intrantes</hi> proceed to a new electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: though oftentimes it hapneth that the ſame man hath the leaſe renued. Within the confines of the Univerſity, he taketh place next after the Princes of the bloud: and at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique exerciſes of learning before the Cardinals, otherwiſe he giveth them the precedency. But to Biſhops or Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops he will not grant it upon any occaſion. It was not two moneths before my being there, that there hapned a ſhrewd controverſie about it. For their King had then
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55011:68"/>
ſummoned an aſſembly of 25. Biſhops of the Provinces ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, to conſult about ſome Church affairs; and they had choſen the Colledge of <hi>Sorbonne</hi> to be their Senate-houſe: when the firſt day of their ſitting came, a Doctor of the houſe being appointed to preach before them: began his oration with <hi>Reverendiſſime Rector, &amp; vos ampliſſimi praeſules.</hi> Here the Archbiſhop of <hi>Roven,</hi> a man of an high ſpirit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted him and commanded him to invert his ſtile. He obeyed, and preſently the Rector riſeth up with <hi>Impono tibi ſilentium:</hi> which is an injunction within the compaſſe of his power. Upon this the Preacher being tongue-tied, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie grew hot between the Biſhops and the Rector, both parties very eagerly pleading their own priority. All the morning being almoſt ſpent in this altercation, a Cardinal wiſer then the reſt, deſired that the queſtion might for that time be layed aſide: and that the Rector would be pleaſed to permit the Doctor to deliver his Sermon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it without any praeludium at all. To which requeſt the Rector yeelded, and ſo the contention at that time was ended.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>ſalus academiae non vertitur in iſtis.</hi> It were more for the honour and profit of the Univerſity, if the Rector would leave off to be ſo mindefull of his place, and look a little to his office. For certainly never the eye and utmoſt diligence of a Magiſtrate was wanting more, and yet more neceſſary, then in this place. <hi>Penelopes</hi> ſuitors never behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo inſolently in the houſe of <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> as the <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks</hi> here do in the houſes and ſtreets of <hi>Paris.</hi>

                     <p>An injuſtice more unpardonable, then the greateſt ſin of the Univerſities. But I wrong a good cauſe with an unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary patronage. Yet ſuch is the peccant humour of ſome, that they know not how to expiate the follies of one but with the calumnie and diſpraiſe of all. An unmanly weakneſſe, and yet many poſſeſſed with it. I know it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that in a place of youth and liberty ſome ſhould not give occaſion of offence. The Ark wherein there were eight perſons only, was not without one <hi>Cham,</hi> and of the twelve which Chriſt had choſen, one was a Devill. It were then above a miracle, if amongſt ſo full a cohort of young ſouldiers, none ſhould forſake the Enſign of his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: he notwithſtanding that ſhould give the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cowardize to the whole army; cannot but be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted malitious or peeviſh. But let all ſuch as have evill will at <hi>Sion,</hi> live unregarded, and die unremembred, for want of ſome Scholar to write their Epitaph. Certainly a man not wedded to envie, and a ſpitefull vexation of ſpirit, upon a due examination of the civility of our <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caea,</hi> and a compariſon of them with thoſe abroad, cannot but ſay, and that juſtly, <hi>Non habent Academiae Anglicanae pares, niſi ſeipſas.</hi>

                     <p>The principal cauſe of the rudeneſs and diſorders in <hi>Paris</hi> have been chiefly occaſioned by the great priviledges where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Kings of <hi>France</hi> intended the furtherance and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of learning. Having thus let them get the bridle in their own hands, no marvel if they grow ſick with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlled licenciouſneſſe. Of theſe priviledges ſome are, that no Scholars goods can be ſeized upon, for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his debts: that none of them ſhould be liable to any taxes or impoſitions (a royall immunity to ſuch as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>France:)</hi> that they might carry and recarry their utenſils without the leaſt moleſtation: that they ſhould have the Provoſt of <hi>Paris</hi> to be the keeper and defender of

their liberties, who is therefore ſtiled, <hi>Le conſervateur des pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges royaux de l' Univerſite de Paris, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>One greater priviledge they have yet then all theſe; which is their ſoon taking of degrees. Two years ſeeth them Novices in the Arts, and Maſters of them. So that enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by their degrees an abſolute freedome, before the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and violences of youth are broke in them: they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo unruly and inſolent, as I have told you.

Thoſe pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he preſenteth them to the Rector, and giveth them their Letters Patents ſealed with the Univerſity Seal: which is the main part of the creation.

                     <p>THE Iſle of <hi>Paris,</hi> commonly called <hi>L'Iſle du Palais,</hi> ſeated between the Univerſity and the Town: is that part of the whole, which is called <hi>La Cite,</hi> the City, the epitome and abſtract of all <hi>France.</hi> It is the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and beſt ordered part of all <hi>Paris;</hi> and certainly if <hi>Paris</hi> may be thought to be the eye of the Realm; this Iſland may be equally judged to be the apple of that eye.

                     <p>The fourth and largeſt Bridge, is that which ſtandeth at the end of the Iſle next the <hi>Louure;</hi> and covereth the waters now united again into one ſtream. It was begun to be built by <hi>Katharine</hi> of <hi>Medices,</hi> the Queen-Mother, <hi>anno</hi> 1578. her Son King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. laying the firſt ſtone of it. The fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of it was reſerved unto <hi>Henry</hi> 4. who as ſoon as he had ſetled his affairs in this Town, preſently ſet the workmen about it. In the end of it where it joyneth to the Town, there is a water-houſe which by artificiall engines forceth up waters from a freſh ſpring, riſing from under the river: done at the charge of this King alſo. In the midſt of it is the <hi>Statua</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> 4. all in braſſe, mounted on his barbed Steed, of the ſame mettle. They are both of them very unproportionable unto thoſe which they repreſent: and would ſhew them big enough, were they placed on the top of <hi>Noſtre dame Church.</hi> What minded King <hi>Lewis</hi> to make his father of ſo gigantive a ſtature, I cannot tell. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> at his return from his <hi>Indian</hi> expedition, ſcattered Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, Swords, and Horſebits, far bigger then were ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: to make future ages admire his greatneſſe.

It may alſo chance to happen, that men in the times to come, comparing the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements of this King, with his brazen portraiture: may think that the hiſtorians have as much belied his valour as the ſtatuary hath his perſon.</p>

But who ever laid the firſt foundation, it much matters not: all the glory of the work being now caſt on <hi>Philip Auguſtus;</hi> who pitying the ruines of it, began to build it <hi>anno</hi> 1196. It is a very fair and awfull building, adorned with a very beautiful front, and two towers of eſpeciall height. It is in length 174 paces, and 60 in bredth: and is ſaid to be as many paces high: and that the two towers are 70 yards higher then the reſt of the Church. At your firſt entrance on the right hand, is the effigies of St. <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> with our Saviour on his ſhoulders. A man, the Legend maketh him as well as the Maſon, of a gyantlike ſtature; though of the two, the Maſon's workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is the more admirable: his being all cut out of one main ſtone; that of the <hi>Legendary</hi> being patched up of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fabulous and ridiculous ſhreds: it hath in it four ranks of pillars 30 in rank; and 45 little Chappels, or Maſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſets, built between the outermoſt range of pillars, and the wals. This is the ſeat of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> for ſuch now he is. It was a Biſhoprick only till the year 1622. When Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 15. at the requeſt of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> raiſed it to a Metropolitanſhip. But by this addition of honour, I think the preſent Incumbent hath got nothing, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in precedency or profit. He had before a neceſſary voice in the Court of Parliament, and took place immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately next after the Preſidents, he doth no more now. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had the priority of all the Biſhops, and now he is but the laſt of all the Archbiſhops: a preferment rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall then reall: and perhaps his ſucceſſors may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a puniſhment; for beſides that the dignity is too

unweildy for the revenue, which is but 6000 Livres or 600 <hi>l. Engliſh</hi> yearly: like enough it is, that ſome may come into that Sea of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s minde, who being in a ſmall village of the <hi>Alps,</hi> thus delivered his ambition to his followers, <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem eſſe hic primus, quam Romae ſecundus.</hi> The preſent poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of this Chair, is <hi>Francis de Gondi,</hi> by birth a <hi>Florentine:</hi> one, whom I have heard much famed for a Stateſman, but little for a Scholar. But had he nothing in him, this alone were ſufficient to make him famous to poſterity, that he was the firſt Archbiſhop, and the laſt Biſhop of the City of <hi>Paris.</hi> There is moreover in this Church a Dean, 7 Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and 50 Canons. The Deans place is valued at 4000 Livres, the Dignities at 3000, and the Canons at 2000; no great intrados: and yet unproportionable to the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Dieppe</hi> (as I have ſaid) I obſerved the firſt Idolatry of the Papiſts: here I noted their firſt ſuperſtitions; which were the needleſſe uſe of Holy water, and the burning of Lamps before the Altar.

In this paradox, he hath enemies enough at home, his own Doctors being all for <hi>Alexander,</hi> yet they alſo are not in the right.

Holy-water then is not of ſuch a ſtanding in the Church, as the Papiſts would perſwade us: and as yet I have not met with any, that can juſtly inform me at what time the Church received it; many corruptions they have among them where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of neither they nor we can tell the beginnings.</p>

                     <p>The ſecond ſuperſtition which this Church ſhewed me was the continuall burning of a Lamp before the Altar, a ceremony brought into the Churches (as it is likely) by Pope <hi>Innocent 3. anno</hi> 1215. at what time he ordained that there ſhould a pix be bought to cover the bread, and that it ſhould be therein reſerved over the Altar. This honour one of late times hath communicated alſo unto the virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> whoſe image in this Church, hath a lanthorn <hi>ex dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metro</hi> before it: and in that a candle perpetually burning.

                     </p>
                     <p>But I have kept you too long within the Church, it is now time to go up to the top, and ſurvey the outworks of it. It hath, as we have already ſaid, at the front two Towers of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable beauty; they are both of an equal height, and are each of them 377 ſteps in the aſcent. From hence we could clearly ſee the whole circuite of <hi>Paris,</hi> and each ſeverall ſtreet of it; ſuch as we have already deſcribed, of an orbicular form and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55011:73"/>
neatly compacted. From hence could we ſee the whole valley round about it, ſuch as I have alſo delineated already, though not in ſuch lively colours as it meriteth.</p>
                     <p>In one of theſe Towers there is a ring of Bels, in the other two only, but theſe for worth are equall to all the reſt; the bigger of the two is ſaid to be greater then the Bell of <hi>Roven</hi> ſo much talked of; as being 8 yards and a ſpan in compaſſe, and two yards and a half in depth; the bowl alſo of the clapper being one yard and a quarter round: of a great weight it needs muſt be, and therefore
<q>
                           <l>Multorum manibus grande levatur onus,</l>
                        </q>
there are no leſſe then four main ropes, beſides their ſeverall tale-ropes, to ring it. By reaſon of this trouble it is never rung, but in time of thunders, and thoſe no mean ones nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, leſſer bels will ſerve to diſperſe the leſſer tempeſts; this is uſed only in the horrider claps, and ſuch as threaten a diſſolution of nature. But how well, as well this as the ſmaller bels diſcharge that office, experience would tell us were we void of reaſon; yet ſo much do the people affiance themſelves to this conceit of the power of them, that they ſuppoſe it inherent to them continually, after the Biſhop hath baptized them; which is done in this manner. The bell being ſo hanged that it may be waſhed within and without, in comes the Biſhop in his Epiſcopall robes, attended by one of his Deacons, and ſitting by the Bell in his chaire ſaith with a loud voice the 50, 53, 56, 66, 69, 85, and 12 <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> or ſome of them: then doth he exorcize ſeverally the ſalt and the water, and having conjured theſe ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents into an Holy-water, he waſheth with it the Bell, both on the inſide and the outſide, wiping it dry with a linnen cloth, he readeth the 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, and 150 <hi>Pſalms;</hi> he draweth a croſſe on it with his right thumb dipped in hallowed oyl, <hi>(Chriſme</hi> they call it) and then prayeth over it. His prayer finiſhed, he wipeth out that croſſe, and having ſaid over the 48 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> he draweth on it with the ſame oyl, ſeven other croſſes, ſaying, <hi>Sanctificetur &amp;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55011:74"/>
conſecretur Domine campana iſta, in nomine, &amp;c.</hi> After another prayer, the Biſhop taketh the Cenſour, and putting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it Myrthe and Frankincenſe, ſetteth it on fire, and putteth it under the Bell that it may receive all the fume of it. This done, the 76 <hi>Pſalm</hi> read and ſome other prayers repeated, the Bell hath received his whole and entire Biptiſme, and theſe virtues following, <hi>viz. Ut per illius tactum procul pellantur omnes inſidiae inimici, fragor grandium, procella turbinum, impetus tempeſtatum, &amp;c.</hi> For ſo one of the prayers reckoneth them preſcribed in the <hi>Roman Pontificall,</hi> authorized by <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. A ſtrange piece of Religion that a Bell ſhould be Baptized; and ſo much the ſtranger, in that theſe inanimate bodies can be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Church, by no other miniſtry then that of the Biſhop; the true Sacrament being permitted to every hedge Prieſt.</p>
                     <p>Not farre from the Weſt gate of this Church of <hi>Noſtre dame,</hi> is the <hi>Hoſtel dieu,</hi> or <hi>Le grand Hoſpital de Paris;</hi> firſt founded by St. <hi>Lewis, anno</hi> 1258. it hath been ſince beautifyed and enlarged, <hi>anno</hi> 1535. by Mr. <hi>Anthony Pratt</hi> Chancellour of <hi>France,</hi> who augmented the number of Hoſpitalers; and gave fair revenues for the maintaining of Chirurgeons, Apothecaries, and Religious men among them. Since that time, the <hi>Provoſts</hi> and <hi>Eſchevins</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> have been eſpeciall Benefactors unto it. At the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into it, you come into their Chappell, ſmall, but handſome and well furniſhed; after, you paſſe into a long gallery, having four ranks of beds, two cloſe to the two wals, and two in the middle. The beds are all ſutable one to the other; their Valence, Curtains and Rugs being all yellow. At the right hand of it, was a gallery more then double the length of this firſt, ſo alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. At the further end of this a door opened into another Chamber, dedicated only to ſick women: and within them another room, wherein women with childe are lightned of their burden, and their children kept till ſeven years of age, at the charge of the Hoſpitall. At the middle of the firſt gallery towards the left hand,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55011:74"/>
were four other ranks of beds, little differing from the reſt, but that their furniture was blew; and in them there was no place for any but ſuch as were ſomewhat woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and belonged properly to the Chirurgeon. There are numbred in the whole Hoſpitall no fewer then 700 beds (beſides thoſe of the attendants, Prieſts, Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries, <hi>&amp;c)</hi> and in every bed two perſons. One would imagine that in ſuch a variety of wounds and diſeaſes, a walke into it, and a view of it, might ſavour more of curioſity, then diſcretion, but indeed it is nothing leſſe; for beſides that no perſon of an infectious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is admitted into it: which maketh much for the ſafety of ſuch as view it; all things are there kept ſo cleanly, neatly and orderly, that it is ſweeter walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there then in the beſt ſtreet of <hi>Paris,</hi> none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
                     <p>Next unto theſe ſucceedeth <hi>La Sancte Chappelle,</hi> ſituate in the middle of the <hi>Palais;</hi> a Chappell famous for its forme, but more for its Reliques. It was founded by <hi>Lewis</hi> IX. vulgarly called St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> 1248. and is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two parts, the upper and the lower, the lower ſerving for the keeping of the Reliques; and the upper for celebrating the Maſſe. It is a comely ſpruce Edifice without, but far more curious within; the glaſſe of it for the excellency of painting, and the Organs for the richneſſe and elaborate workmanſhip of the caſe, not giving way to any in <hi>Europe.</hi> I could not learn the number of <hi>Chanoins,</hi> which are maintained in it, though I heard they were places of 300 Crowns revenue. As for their Treaſurer, <hi>Le Threaſururier,</hi> ſo they call their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; He hath granted him by eſpecall priviledge li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to wear all the Epiſcopall habits, except the Croſier-ſtaffe; and to bear himſelfe as a Biſhop within the liberties of his Chappell. In the top of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Chappell (it is built almoſt in forme of a <hi>Synagogue)</hi> there hangeth the true proportion (as they ſay) of the Crown of thornes: but of this more when we have gone over the Reliques. I was there divers times to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55011:75"/>
have ſeen them, but (it ſeemeth) they were not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to an <hi>Huganots</hi> eyes; though me thinketh, they might have conſidered, that my money was Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique. They are kept, as I ſaid, in the lower Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and are thus marſhalled in a Table, hanging in the upper; know then that you may believe that they can ſhew you the crown of thornes, the bloud which ran from our Saviours breſt, his ſwadling cloutes, a great part of the Croſſe (they alſo of <hi>Noſtre dame</hi> have ſome of it) the chaine by which the <hi>Jewes</hi> bound him, no ſmall peece of the ſtone of the Sepulchre, <hi>Sauctam toelam tabulae inſertam,</hi> which I know not how to <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Some of the Virgins milke, (for I would not have thoſe of St. <hi>Denis</hi> think, that the Virgin gave no other milk, but to them) the head of the Lance which pierced our Saviour, the purple Robe, the Sponge, a piece of his Shroud, the napkin wherewith he was girted when he waſhed his Diſciples feet, the rod of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the heads of St. <hi>Blaſe,</hi> St. <hi>Clement,</hi> and St. <hi>Simeon,</hi> and part of the head of <hi>John Baptiſt.</hi> Immediately under this recitall of theſe Reliques (and venerable ones I durſt ſay they were, could I be perſwaded there were no impoſture in them) there are ſet down a <hi>Prayer</hi> and an <hi>Anthem,</hi> both in the ſame Table; as followeth.</p>

The dignity and eſteem of it abroad, made <hi>ſedentarie</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> appropriated to the long robe. The <hi>Palais</hi> by whom built, and converted to ſeats of Juſtice.

This Court the main pillar of the Liberty of <hi>France. La Tournelle,</hi> and the Judges of it. The five Chambers of <hi>Enqueſtes</hi> ſeverally inſtituted, and by whom.

                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Court of Parliament was at the firſt inſtituted by <hi>Charles Martell</hi> Grandfather to <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> at ſuch time as he was <hi>Maire</hi> of the <hi>Palace,</hi> unto the laſſe and rechleſſe Kings of <hi>France.</hi> In the beginnings of the <hi>French</hi> Empire, their Kings did juſtice to their people in perſon: afterwards baniſhing themſelves from all the affaires of State, that burden was caſt upon the ſhoulders of their <hi>Maiors;</hi> an office much of a nature with the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55011:77"/>
                        <hi>Charles Martell,</hi> he partly weary of the trouble, partly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent about a buſineſſe of an higher nature, which was, the eſtating the Crown in his own poſterity; but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to endeer himſelf to the common people, ordained this Court of Parliament, <hi>anno</hi> 720. It conſiſted in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of 12 <hi>Peers,</hi> the <hi>Prelates</hi> and noble men of the beſt faſhion, together with ſome of the principalleſt of the Kings houſhold. Other Courts have been called the Parliaments with an addition of place, as of <hi>Paris,</hi> at <hi>Roven, &amp;c.</hi> this only <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the Parliament. It handled as well cauſes of eſtate, as thoſe of private perſons. For hither did the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of neighbour Princes repaire, to have their audience and diſpatch; and hither were the Articles agreed on, in the nationall <hi>Synods</hi> of <hi>France</hi> ſent to be confirmed and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified; here did the ſubjects tender in their homages, and Oaths of fidelity to the King; and here were the appeals heard of all ſuch as had complained againſt the <hi>Comites,</hi> at that time the Governours and Judges in their ſeverall Counties. Being furniſhed thus with the prime and choyceſt Nobles of the Land, it grew into great eſtimation abroad in the world; inſomuch that the Kings of <hi>Sicilie, Cyprus, Scotland, Bohemia, Portugall,</hi> and <hi>Navarre,</hi> have thought it no diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement unto them to ſit in it; and which is more, when <hi>Frederick</hi> II. had ſpent ſo much time in quarrels with Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> IV. he ſubmitted himſelf and the rightneſſe of his cauſe to be examined by this Noble Court of Parliament. At the firſt inſtitution of this Court, it had no ſetled place of reſidence, being ſometimes kept at <hi>Tholoza,</hi> ſometimes at <hi>Aix la Chappelle,</hi> ſometimes in other places, according as the Kings pleaſure, and eaſe of the people did require. During its time of peregrination, it was called <hi>Ambulatoire,</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the moſt part the Kings Court, as the lower <hi>ſphaeres</hi> do the motion of the <hi>primum mobile;</hi> but <hi>Philip le bel</hi> (he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his reign <hi>anno</hi> 1286) being to take a journey into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and to ſtay there a long ſpace of time, for the ſetling of his affaires in that Countrey, took order that this Court of Parliament ſhould ſtay behind at <hi>Paris;</hi> where ever ſince it hath continued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:55011:78"/>
Now began it to be called <hi>Sedentaire</hi> or ſetled, and alſo <hi>peua peu,</hi> by little and little to loſe much of its luſtre. For the chief Princes and Nobles of the Kings retinue, not able to live out of the aire of the Court, withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the troubles of it; by which means at laſt it came to be appropriated to them of the Long robe, as they term them, both Biſhops and Lawyers. In the year 1463. the Prelates alſo were removed by the command of <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. an utter enemy to the great ones of his Kingdome, only the Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and Abbot of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> being permitted their place in it: ſince which time the Profeſſors of the civill law have had all the ſway in it, <hi>Et cedunt arma togae,</hi> as <hi>Tully.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The place in which this Sedentarie Court of Parliament is now kept, is called the <hi>Palace,</hi> being built by <hi>Philip le bel,</hi> and intended to be his manſion or dwelling houſe. He began it in the firſt year of his reign, <hi>anno</hi> 1286. and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards aſſigned a part of it to his Judges of the Parliament: it being not totally and abſolutely quitted unto them till the dayes of King <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. In this the <hi>French</hi> Subjects are beholding to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> by whoſe good example they got the eaſe of a Sedentarie Court: our Law courts alſo removing with the King, till the year 1224. when by a Statute in the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it was appointed to be fixt; and a part of the Kings Palace in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> allotted for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Within the verge of this <hi>Palais</hi> are contained the ſeven Chambers of the Parliament; that called <hi>La grande Chambre;</hi> five Chambers of Inquiſition, <hi>Des Enqueſtes;</hi> and one other called <hi>La Tournelle.</hi> There are moreover the Chambers, <hi>des aides, des accomptes, de l' edict, des monnoyes,</hi> and one called <hi>La Chambre Royall;</hi> of all which we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak in their proper places: theſe not concerning the common government of the people, but only of the Kings revenues. Of theſe ſeven Chambers of Parliament, <hi>La grande Chambre</hi> is moſt famous; and at the building of this houſe by <hi>Philip le bel,</hi> was intended for the Kings bed. It is no ſuch beautifull piece as the <hi>French</hi> make it, that of <hi>Roven</hi> being far beyond it; although indeed it much excell the

faireſt room of Juſtice in all <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> ſo that it ſtandeth in a middle rank between them, and almoſt in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions as <hi>Virgil</hi> betwixt <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Ovid.</hi>

                     <p>It conſiſteth of ſeven <hi>Preſidents, 22 Counſellours,</hi> the Kings <hi>Atturney;</hi> and as many <hi>Advocates</hi> and <hi>Proctours</hi> as the Court will pleaſe to give admiſſion to. The <hi>Advocates</hi> have no ſetled ſtudies within the <hi>Palais,</hi> but at the Barre; but the <hi>Procureurs</hi> or <hi>Attorneys</hi> have their ſeverall pews in the great Hall, which is without this <hi>Grande Chambre,</hi> in ſuch manner as I have before deſcribed at <hi>Roven:</hi> a large building it is, fair and high roofed: not long ſince ruined by a caſualty of fire, and not yet fully finiſhed. The names of the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are Mr. <hi>Verdun,</hi> the firſt Preſident, or by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, <hi>Le Preſident,</hi> the ſecond man of the Long robe in <hi>France.</hi> 2. Mr. <hi>Sequer,</hi> lately dead, and likely to have his ſon ſucceed him, as well in his Office, as in his Lands. 3. Mr. <hi>Leiger.</hi> 4. Mr. <hi>Doſambe.</hi> 5. Mr. <hi>Sevin.</hi> 6. Mr. <hi>Baillure.</hi> And 7. Mr. <hi>Meiſme.</hi> None of theſe, neither Preſidents nor Counſellors, can go out of <hi>Paris,</hi> when the Lawes are open, without leave of the Court: it was ordained ſo by <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. <hi>anno</hi> 1499. and that with good judgement; Sentences being given with greater awe, and buſineſſes managed with greater majeſty when the Bench is full: and it ſeemeth indeed that they carry with them great terror; for the Duke of <hi>Biron,</hi> a man of as uncontrouled ſpirit, as any in <hi>France,</hi> being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to anſwer for himſelf in this Court, proteſted, that thoſe ſcarlet roabs did more amaze him, then all the red caſſocks of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the left hand of this <hi>Grande Chambre,</hi> or <hi>Golden Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre</hi> as they call it; is a Throne or ſeat Royall, reſerved for the King, when he ſhall pleaſe to come and ſee the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Juſtice amongſt his people; at common times it is naked and plain, but when the King is expected, it is clothed with blew-purple Velvet, femied with <hi>flowers de lys;</hi> on each ſide of it are two formes or benches, where the <hi>Peers</hi>
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:55011:79"/>
of both habits, both Eccleſiaſticall and Secular, uſe to ſit and accompany the King. But this is little to the eaſe or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Subject, and as little availeable to try the integrity of the Judges; his preſence being alwayes foreknown, and ſo accordingly they prepared. Far better then is it, in the <hi>Grande Signeur,</hi> where the <hi>Divano,</hi> or Councell of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> affairs holden by the <hi>Baſſas,</hi> is hard by his bed-chamber which looketh into it: the window which giveth him this entervenue is perpetually hidden with a curtain on the ſide of the partition, which is towards the <hi>Divano;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Baſſas</hi> and other Judges cannot at any time aſſure themſelves that the Emperor is not liſtning to their ſentences: an action in which nothing is <hi>Turkiſh</hi> or <hi>Mahometan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The authority of this Court extendeth it ſelf unto all cauſes within the juriſdiction of it, not being meerly ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall. It is a law unto it ſelf, following no rule written in their ſentences, but judging according to equity and conſcience. In matters criminall of greater conſequence, the proceſſe is here immediately examined, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of it by the inferior Courts; as at the arraignment of the Duke of <hi>Biron:</hi> and divers times alſo in matters perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. But their power is moſt eminent in diſpoſing the affaires of State, and of the Kingdome. For ſuch preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives have the <hi>French</hi> Kings given hereunto, that they can neither denounce War, nor conclude Peace, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent (a formall one at the leaſt) of this Chamber. An alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Lands of the Crown, is not any whit valid, unleſſe confirmed by this Court: neither are his Edicts in force, till they are here verified: nor his Letters Patents for the creating of a Peer, till they are here allowed of. Moſt of theſe, I confeſſe, are little more then matters of form, the Kings power and pleaſure being become boundleſſe; yet ſufficient to ſhew the body of authority which they once had, and the ſhadow of it, which they ſtill keep; yet of late they have got into their diſpoſing one priviledge belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing formerly to the <hi>Conventus ordinum,</hi> or the Aſſembly of three Eſtates, which is the conferring of the regency or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of their King during his minority. That the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the three Eſtates formerly had this priviledge is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55011:79"/>
by their ſtories. Thus we finde them to have made Queen <hi>Blanche</hi> Regent of the Realm, during the nonage of her ſon St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> 1227. That they declared <hi>Philip de Valois</hi> ſucceſſor to the Crown, in caſe that the widow of <hi>Charles le bel,</hi> was not delivered of a ſon, 1357. As alſo <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Burgogne,</hi> during the Lunacy of <hi>Charles</hi> VI. 1394. with divers other. On the other ſide we have a late example of the power of the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> in this very caſe. For the ſame day that <hi>Henry</hi> IV. was ſlain by <hi>Ravilliao,</hi> the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment met, and after a ſhort conſultation, declared <hi>Mary de Medices,</hi> Mother to the King, <hi>Regent</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> for the government of the State, during the minority of her ſon, with all power and authority. Such are the words of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, Dated the 14 of <hi>May</hi> 1610.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be ſaid but that this Court deſerveth not only this, but alſo any other indulgence, whereof any one member of the Common-wealth is capable. So watchfull are they over the health of the State, and ſo tenderly do they take the leaſt danger threatned to the liberty of that Kingdom, that they may not unjuſtly be called, <hi>patres patriae.</hi> In the year 1614. they ſeized upon a diſcourſe written by <hi>Suarez</hi> a Jeſuite, Entituled, <hi>Adverſus Anglicanae ſectae errores:</hi> wherein the Popes temporall power over Kings and Princes is aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: which they ſentenced to be burnt in the Palace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard by the publick hangman. The year before they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted the ſame puniſhment upon a vain and blaſphemous diſcourſe penned by <hi>Gaſper Scioppius,</hi> a fellow of a moſt deſperate brain, and a very incendiary. Neither hath <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> himſelf, that great <hi>Atlas</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, eſcaped much better: for writing a book concerning the temporall power of his Holineſſe, it had the ill luck to come into <hi>Paris,</hi> where the Parliament finding it to thwart the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and royalty of the King and Countrey, gave it over to the Hangman, and he to the fire. Thus it is evident that the titles which the <hi>French</hi> writers give it, as the <hi>true Temple of French Juſtice,</hi> the <hi>bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The next Chamber in eſteem is the <hi>Tournelle,</hi> which hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all matters criminall. It is ſo called from <hi>tourner,</hi> which ſignifieth to change or alter; becauſe the Judges of the other ſeverall chambers give ſentence in this, according to their ſeverall turns; the reaſon of which inſtitution is ſaid to be, leſt a continuall cuſtome of condemning, ſhould make the Judges leſſe mercifull, and more prodigall of bloud: an order full of health and providence. It was inſtituted by the above named <hi>Philip de bel,</hi> at the ſame time when he made the Parliament <hi>ſedentarie</hi> at <hi>Paris;</hi> and beſides its pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and originall imployments, it receiveth appeals from, and redreſſeth the errors of the Provoſt of <hi>Paris.</hi> The other five Chambers are called <hi>Des Enqueſtes,</hi> or <hi>Camerae in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitionum;</hi> the firſt and antienteſt of them was erected alſo by <hi>Philip le bel,</hi> and afterwards divided into two by <hi>Charles</hi> VII. Afterwards the multitude of Proceſſes being greater then could be diſpatched in theſe Courts, there was added a third. <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt eſtabliſhed the fourth for the better raiſing of a ſum of money which then he wanted; every one of the new Counſellors paying right deerly for his place. The fifth and laſt was founded in the year 1568. In each of theſe ſeverall Chambers there are two Preſidents, and 20 Counſellors, beſides Advocates and Proctours <hi>ad placitum.</hi> In the <hi>Tournelle,</hi> which is an aggregation of all the other Courts, there are ſuppoſed to be no ſewer then 200 officers of all ſorts; which is no great number conſidering the many cauſes there handled. In the <hi>Tournelle,</hi> the Judges fit on life and death; in the Chamber of <hi>Enqueſts,</hi> they examine only civill affaires of eſtate, title, debts, or the like. The pleaders in theſe Courts are called <hi>Advocates,</hi> and muſt be at the leaſt <hi>Licentiates</hi> in the ſtudy of the Law. At the Parliaments of <hi>Theloza</hi> and <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> they admit of none but Doctors. Now the forme of admitting them is this: In an open and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Court, one of the aged'ſt of the Long roab preſenteth the party, which defireth admiſſion, to the Kings Attorney generall, ſaying with a loud voice, <hi>Paiſe a cour recevoir N. N. licencie</hi> (or <hi>Docteur) en droict civil, a la office d' Advocate;</hi> This ſaid, the Kings Attorney biddeth him hold up his hand, and ſaith to him in Latine, <hi>Tu jurabis obſervare omnes regias con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudines;</hi>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:55011:80"/>
he anſwereth <hi>Juro,</hi> and departeth. At the Chamber door of the Court, whereof he is now ſworn an Advocate, he payeth two crowns; which is forth with put into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon treaſury appointed for the relief of the diſtreſſed wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of ruined Advocates and Proctoms; <hi>Hanc veniam peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſque damuſque,</hi> it may be their own caſes, and therefore it is paid willingly. The higheſt preferment of which theſe Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates are capable is that of Chancellor, an office of great power and profit: the preſent Chancellor is named Mr. <hi>d' Allegre,</hi> by birth of <hi>Chartres.</hi> He hath no ſettled Court wherein to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his authority, but hath in all the Courts of <hi>France</hi> the Supream place whenſoever he will vouchſafe to viſite them. He is alſo Preſident of the Councell of Eſtate by his place; and on him dependeth the making of good and ſacred laws, the adminiſtration of Juſtice, the reformation of ſuperſtuous, and abrogation of unprofitable Edicts, &amp;c. He hath the keeping of the Kings great ſeal, and by virtue of that, either paſſeth or putteth back ſuch Letters patents and Writs as are exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him. He hath under him, immediately for the better diſpatch of his affaires, four Maſters of the Requeſts and their Courts. Their office and manner of proceeding, is the ſame which they alſo uſe in <hi>England;</hi> in the perſons there is thus much difference, for that in <hi>France,</hi> two of them muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually of the Clergy. One of their Courts is very antient, and hath in it two Preſidents, which are two of the Maſters; and 14 Counſellors. The other is of a later erection, as being founded <hi>anno</hi> 1580. and in that, the two other of the Maſters and eight Counſellors give ſentence.</p>
                     <p>Thus have I taken a view of the ſeverall Chambers of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> and of their particular juriſdictions, as far as my information could conduct me. One thing I noted further, and in my mind the faireſt ornament of the Palace, which is the neatneſſe and decency of the Lawyers in their apparell; for beſides the faſhion of their habit, which is I allure you, exceeding pleaſing and comely, themſelves by their own care and love to handſomeneſſe, add great luſtre to their garments, and more to their perſons. Richly dreſt they are, and well may be ſo, as being the ableſt and moſt powerfull men under the Princes and <hi>la Nobleſſe,</hi> in all the Countrey; an
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55011:81"/>

                     <p>WE have diſcharged the King of one Palace, and muſt follow him to the other, where we ſhall finde his reſidence. It is ſeated at the Weſt ſide of the Town or <hi>Ville</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> hard by <hi>Portenufue,</hi> and alſo by the new bridge. A houſe of great fame, and which the Kings of <hi>France</hi> have long kept their Court in. It was firſt built by <hi>Philip Auguſtus, anno</hi> 1214. and by him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for a Caſtle: it firſt ſerving to impriſon the more potent of the Nobles; and to lay up the Kings treaſury. For that cauſe it was well moated, ſtrengthned with wals and drawbridges, very ſerviceable in thoſe times. It had the name of <hi>Louure, quaſi L'oeuure,</hi> or the work, the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, by way of excellency. An etymologie which draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nigher to the ear, then the underſtanding, or the eye; and yet the <hi>French</hi> writers would make it a miracle. <hi>Du Cheſne</hi> calleth it, <hi>Superbe baſtiment, qui n'a ſon eſgal en toute la Chriſtientè;</hi> and you ſhall hear it called in an other place, <hi>Bestiment qui paſſe, aujourd hui en excellence et en gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, tous les autres.</hi> Brave elogies, if all were gold that gliſtered. It hath now given up its charge of money and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55011:82"/>
great priſoners to the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> and at this time ſerveth only to impriſon the Court. In my life, I never ſaw any thing more abuſed by a good report, or that more belyeth the rumors that go of it. The ordinary talk of vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar travellers, and the big words of the <hi>French,</hi> had made me expect at the leaſt ſome prodigie of architecture; ſome ſuch Majeſticall houſe as the Sunne <hi>Don Phoebus</hi> is ſaid to have dwelt in, in <hi>Ovid.</hi>

                     <p>Indeed I thought no fiction in Poetry had been able to have paralleld it: and made no doubt but it would have put me into ſuch a paſſion as to have cryed out with the young Gallant in the Comedy, when he had ſeen his ſweet-heart, <hi>Hei mihi qualis erat? talis erat qualem nunquam vidi;</hi> But I was much deceived in that hope, and could finde nothing in it to admire, much leſſe to envie. The Fable of the Mountaine which was with childe, and brought forth a mouſe; is queſtionleſſe a fable: this houſe and the large fame it hath in the world, is the morall of it. Never was there an houſe more unſutable to it ſelf in the particular examination of parts, nor more unſutable to the character and eſteem of it in the generall Survey of the whole.</p>
                     <p>You enter into it over two draw bridges, and through three gates, ruinous enough, and abundantly unſightly. In the Quadrangle you meet with three ſeverall faſhions of building, of three ſeverall ages, and they ſo unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyned one to the other, that one would half believe they had been clapped together by an earthquake. The South and Weſt parts of it are new, and indeed Princelike; being the work of <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, and his ſon <hi>Henry.</hi> Had it been all caſt into the ſame mould, I perſwade my ſelf that it would be very gracious and lovely. The other two are of an ancient work, and ſo contemprible, that they diſgrace the reſt; and of theſe I ſuppoſe the one fide
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55011:82"/>
to be at the leaſt 100 years older then his partner: ſuch is it without. As for the inſide, it is far more gracefull, and would be pleaſing at the entrance, were the Guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber reformed. Some <hi>Hugonot</hi> architect, which were not in love with the errours of Antiquity, might make a pretty room of it; a <hi>catholick</hi> Carpenter would never get credit by it: for whereas the provident thrift of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers intended it (for the houſe would elſe be too narrow for the Kings retinue) both for a room of ſafety and of pleaſure, both for bill-men and dancers; and for that cauſe made up ſome ſix ranks of ſeats on each ſide; that ſparingneſſe in the more curious eyes of this time, is little Kinglike: Countrey wenches might with indifferent ſtomach abuſe a good Galliard in it, or it might perhaps ſerve with a ſtage at one end to entertain the <hi>Pariſians</hi> at a play, or with a partition in the middle, it might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two prety plauſible Cockpits; but to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the nature it now is, either to ſolace the King and Lords in a dance, or to give any forain Ambaſſador his welcome in a Maske, is little ſutable with the Majeſty of a King of <hi>France.</hi> The Chambers of it are well built, but ill furniſhed; the hangings of them being ſomewhat below a meanneſſe; and yet of theſe there is no ſmall ſcarcity. For, as it is ſaid of the <hi>Gymnoſophiſts</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> that <hi>Una Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus &amp; manſioni ſufficit &amp; ſepulturae:</hi> ſo may we of this Prince, the ſame Chamber ſerveth for to lodge him, to feed him, and alſo to confer and diſcourſe with his Nobility. But like enough it is that this want may proceed from the ſeverall Courts of the King, the <hi>Monſieur,</hi> the Queen Mother and the Qeen Regoant, being all kept within it.</p>
                     <p>Proceed we now to the two Galleries, whereof the firſt is that of the Queen Mother, as being beautified and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned exceedingly by <hi>Katbarine de Medices,</hi> mother to <hi>Henry</hi> III. and <hi>Charles</hi> IX. It containeth the pictures of all the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and the moſt loved of their Queens, ſince the time of St. <hi>Lewis.</hi> They ſtand each King oppoſite to his Queen, ſhe being that of his wives which either brought him moſt eſtate, or his fucceſſors. The tables are all of a juſt length, very fair, and according to my little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55011:83"/>
with the Painter, of a moſt excellent workmanſhip, and which addeth much grace to it, they are in a manner a perfect Hiſtory of the State and Court of <hi>France</hi> in their ſeverall times. For under each of the Kings pictures, they have drawn the portraitures of moſt of thoſe Lords whom valor and courage in the field enobled beyond their births. Under each of the Queens the lively ſhapes of the moſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Ladies, whoſe beautie and virtue had honored the Court. A dainty invention, and happily expreſſed. At the further end of it ſtandeth the laſt King and the preſent Queen Mother; who fill up the whole room. The ſucceeding Princes, if they mean to live in their pictures, muſt either build new places for them, or elſe make uſe of the long Gallery built by <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and which openeth into that of the Queen Mother. A Gallery it is of an incredible length, as being above 500 yards long, and of a breadth and height not unporportionable; a room built rather for oſtentation then uſe, and ſuch as hath more in it of the majeſty of its founder then the grace. It was ſaid to have been erected purpoſely to joyn the <hi>Louure</hi> unto the Houſe and Garden of the <hi>Tuilleries,</hi> an unlikely matter that ſuch a ſtupendious building ſhould be deſigned only for a cleanly conveyance into a Summer houſe: others are of an opinion that he had a reſolution to have made the houſe quadrangular, every ſide being correſpondent to this which ſhould have been the common Gallery to the reſt. Which deſign had it taken effect, this Palace would at once have been the wonder of the world, and the envy of it. For my part, I dare be of this laſt minde, as well becauſe the ſecond ſide is in part begun, as alſo conſidering how infinitely this King was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to building. The <hi>Place Daulphin,</hi> and the <hi>Place Royall,</hi> two of the fineſt piles in <hi>Paris,</hi> were erected partly by his purſe, but principally by his encouragement. The new Bridge in <hi>Paris</hi> was meerly his work; ſo was alſo the new Palace, and moſt admirable waterworks of St. <hi>Germans en lay.</hi> This long Gallery and the new Peſt houſe oweth it ſelf wholly to him; and the houſe of <hi>Fountainebleau,</hi> which is the faireſt in <hi>France,</hi> is beholding to him for moſt of its beauty; add to this his Fortifications beſtowed on the <hi>Baſtile;</hi>
                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:55011:83"/>
his walling of <hi>Arles;</hi> and his purpoſe to have ſtrengthned <hi>Paris</hi> according to the modern art of Towns: and you will finde the attribute of <hi>Parietaria</hi> or wall flower, which <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> ſcoffingly gave unto <hi>Trajan</hi> for his great humour of building, to be due unto this King; but ſeriouſly and with reverence.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the generall love he had to building, he had alſo an ambition to go beyond example, which alſo induceth me fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to believe his intent of making that large and admirable quadrangle above ſpoken of, to have been ſerious and reall. For to omit others, certain it is, that he had a project of great ſpirit and difficulty, which was to joyn the <hi>Mediterranean ſea</hi> and the <hi>Ocean</hi> together; and to make the Navigation from the one to the other through <hi>France,</hi> and not to paſſe by the ſtraight of <hi>Gibraltare.</hi> It came into Councell, <hi>anno</hi> 1604, and was reſolved to be done by this means: The river <hi>Garond</hi> is Navigable from the <hi>Ocean</hi> almoſt to <hi>Tholoza;</hi> and the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> openeth it ſelf into the Land by a little River, whoſe name I know not, as high as <hi>Narbonne.</hi> Betwixt theſe two places was there a Navigable channell to have been digged, and it proceeded ſo far towards, being actuated, that a workman had undertaken it, and the price was agreed upon. But there ariſing ſome diſcontents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> about the building of the Fort <hi>Fluentes</hi> in the Countrey of the <hi>Griſons;</hi> the King not knowing what uſe he might have of Treaſure in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, commanded the work not to go forward. However he is to be commended in the attempt, which was indeed Kinglike, and worthy his ſpirit: praiſe him in his heroick purpoſe and deſigne.

                     <p>But the principal beauty, if I may judge of this ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired Palace of the <hi>Louure,</hi> is a low plain room, paved under foot with bricks, and without any hangings or tapeſtrie on the ſides; yet being the beſt ſet out and furniſhed to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of any in <hi>France.</hi> It is called, <hi>La Salle des Antiques,</hi> and hath in it five of the antienteſt and venerableſt pieces of all

For this Nation generally is regardleſſe of Antiquity, both in the monuments and ſtudie of it, ſo that you ſhall hardly find any ancient inſcription, or any famous ruine ſnatched from the hand of time, in the beſt of their Cities or Churches. In the Church only of <hi>Amiens</hi> could I meet with an ancient character, which alſo was but a <hi>Gothiſh Dutch</hi> letter, and expreſſed nothing but the name and virtue of a Biſhop of the Church on whoſe tomb it was. So little alſo did I perceive them to be inclined to be Antiquaries, that both neglects conſidered, <hi>Si verbis audacia detur,</hi> I dare confidently aver, not only that the Earl of <hi>Arundels</hi> Gardens have more antiquities of this kind, then all <hi>France</hi> can boaſt of; but that one <hi>Cotton</hi> for the Treaſury, and one <hi>Selden</hi> (now Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> is dead) for the ſtudy of the like antiquities; are worth all the <hi>French.</hi> As for theſe five pieces in <hi>La Salle des Antiques,</hi> they are I confeſſe worthy obſervation, and reſpect alſo, if they be ſuch as our Trudgemen enforme us. At the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end of it is the Statua of <hi>Diana,</hi> the ſame, as is ſaid, which was worſhipped in the renowned Temple of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> and of which <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Silverſmith and his fellow artiſts, cryed out <gap reason="foreign">

On the left hand of us we had a ſide-glance of the royall houſe of <hi>Boys</hi> St. <hi>Vincennes,</hi> and the Caſtle of <hi>Biſeſtre;</hi> and about ſome two miles beyond them we had a ſight alſo of a new houſe lately built by Mr. <hi>Sillery</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of the Kingdome, a pretty houſe it promiſed to be, having two baſe Courts on the hither ſide of it, and beyond it a park; an ornament whereof many great manſions in <hi>France</hi> are altogether ignorant.</p>
                     <p>Four leagues from <hi>Paris,</hi> is the the Town of <hi>Montliberrie,</hi> now old and ruinous: and hath nothing in it to commend it, but the carkaſſe of a Caſtle: without it, it hath to brag of a large and ſpacious plain; on which was fought that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable battail between <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11. and <hi>Charles le hardie,</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgogne,</hi> a battail memorable only for the running away of each Army: the field being in a manner emptied of all the forces, and yet neither of the Princes victorious. <hi>Hic ſpe celer, ille ſalute,</hi> ſome ran out of fear to die, and ſome out of hope to live: that it was hard to ſay, which of the Souldiers made moſt uſe of their heels in the combat. This notwithſtanding, the King eſteemed himſelf the conquerour, not that he overcame, but becauſe not vanquiſht. He was a Prince of no heart to make a warriour, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55011:86"/>
was to him almoſt hugged as victory. It was <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonies</hi> caſe in his war againſt the <hi>Parthians:</hi> a Captain whoſe Launce King <hi>Lewis</hi> was not worthy to bear after him. <hi>Craſſus</hi> before him had been taken by that people: but <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> made a retreat, though with loſſe, <hi>Hanc ita<expan>

Yet was King <hi>Lewis</hi> is ſo puffed up with this conceit of victory, that he ever after ſlighted his enemies: and at laſt ruined them, and their cauſe with them. The war which they undertook againſt him, they had entituled the war of the Weal publick: becauſe the occaſion of their taking armes was for the liberty of their Countrey and people: both whom the King had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond meaſure oppreſſed. True it is, they had alſo their particular purpoſes; but this was the main, and failing in the expected event of it, all that they did, was to confirm the bondage of the Realm, by their own overthrow. Theſe Princes once disbanded, and ſeverally broken; none durſt ever afterwards enter into the action; for which reaſon King <hi>Lewis</hi> uſed to ſay that he had brought the Kings of <hi>France, Hors pupillage,</hi> out of their ward-ſhip: a ſpeech of more brag then truth. The people I confeſſe, he brought into ſuch terms of ſlavery; that they no longer merited the name of ſubjects, but yet for all his great boaſt, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of <hi>France</hi> are to this day the Kings Guardians. I have already ſhewn you much of their potency. By that you may ſee that the <hi>French</hi> Kings have not yet ſued their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, as our Lawyers call it. Had he alſo in ſome meaſure broken the powerableneſs of the Princes, he had then been perfectly his words-maſter; and till that be done, I ſhall ſtill think his ſucceſſors to be in their pupillage. That King is but half himſelf which hath the abſolute command only of half his people.</p>
                     <p>The battail foughten by this Town, the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple impute to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and ſo do they alſo many others which they had no hand in. For hearing their Grandames talk of their wars with our nation, and of their many fields which we gained of them; they no ſooner hear of a pitched field; but preſently, (as the nature of men in a fright
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55011:87"/>
is) they attribute it to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> good ſimple ſouls, <hi>Qui nos non ſolum laudibus noſtris ornare velint, ſed onerare alienis,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> in his Philippicks. An humour juſt like unto that of little children, who being once frighted with the tales of <hi>Robin Goodfellow,</hi> do never after hear any noiſe in the night, but they ſtraight imagine, that it is he which maketh it; or like the women of the villages neer <hi>Oxford,</hi> who having heard the tragicall ſtory of a duck or an hen killed, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Univerſity: no ſooner miſſe one of their chickens, but inſtantly they cry out upon the Scholars. On the ſame falſe ground alſo, hearing that the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whileſt they had poſſeſſions in this Countrey, were great builders; they beſtow on them without any more adoe, the foundation and perfecting of moſt of the Churches and Caſtles in the Countrey. Thus are our Anceſtors ſaid to have built the Churches of <hi>Roven, Amiens, Bayon, &amp;c.</hi> as alſo the Caſtles of <hi>Bois,</hi> St. <hi>Vincennes,</hi> the <hi>Baſtile;</hi> the two little forts on the river ſide by the <hi>Louure:</hi> that of St. <hi>Germans;</hi> and amongſt many others, this of <hi>Mont l'Hierrie,</hi> where we now are; and all alike: as for this Caſtle, it was built during the reign of K. <hi>Robert, anno</hi> 1015. by one of his ſervants, named <hi>Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald:</hi> long before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had any poſſeſſions in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. It was razed by <hi>Lewis</hi> the Groſſe, as being a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer of rebels in former times; and by that means, as a ſtrong bridle in the mouth of <hi>Paris:</hi> nothing now ſtanding of it, ſave an high Tower, which is ſeen a great diſtance round about, and ſerveth for a land mark.</p>
                     <p>Two leagues from <hi>Mont l'Hierrie</hi> is the Town of <hi>Caſtres;</hi> ſeated in the fartheſt angle of <hi>France,</hi> where it confineth to <hi>La Beauſe.</hi> A Town of an ordinary ſize, ſomewhat bigger then for a Market, and leſſe then would beſeem a City, a wall it hath, and a ditch; but neither ſerviceable further then to reſiſt the enemy at one gate, whileſt the people run away by the other: nothing elſe remarkable in it, but the habit of the Church, which was mourning: for ſuch is the faſhion of <hi>France,</hi> that when any of the Nobles are buried, the Church which en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

hanging it round with cloth is not for their profits: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this counterfeit ſorrow feareth no theef; and dareth out-brave a tempeſt: he for whom the Church of <hi>Caſtres</hi> was thus apparelled, had been Lord of the Town: by name, as I remember, Mr. St. <hi>Benoiſt;</hi> his Armes were Argent, three Creſſants, Or, a Mullet of the ſame; but whether this Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let were part of the Coat, or a mark only of difference, I could not learn. The like Funeral Churches, I ſaw alſo at <hi>Toſtes</hi> in <hi>Normandie;</hi> and in a village of <hi>Picardie,</hi> whoſe name I minde not, <hi>Nec operae pretium.</hi> And now we are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the confines of <hi>France;</hi> a poor river, which for the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of it, you would think to be a ditch; parting it from the Province of <hi>La Beauſe.</hi>

The antient inhabitants of this Province, and the reaſon of the name I could not learn amongſt the people: neither can I finde any certainty of it in my books with whom I have conſulted. If I may be bold to go by conjecture, I ſhould think this Countrey to have been the ſeat of the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locaſſt,</hi> a people of <hi>Gaule Celtick</hi> mentioned by <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his Commentaries.

                     <p>The ſame night, we came to <hi>Estampes,</hi> a Town ſituate in a very plentiful and fruitful ſoyl; and watred with a river of the ſame name, ſtored with the beſt crevices. It ſeemeth to have been a town of principall importance; there being five wals and gates in a length, one before another: ſo that it appeareth to be rather a continuation of many towns to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, then ſimply one. The ſtreets are of a large breadth; the building for ſubſtance are ſtone; and for faſhion as the reſt of <hi>France.</hi> It containeth in it five Churches, whereof the principal, which is a Colledge of <hi>Chanoins,</hi> is that of <hi>Noſtre dame;</hi> built by King <hi>Robert:</hi> who is ſaid alſo to have foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Caſtle; which now can ſcarſely be viſited in its ruines. Without the town, they have a fine green medow, daintily ſeated within the circlings of the water; into which they uſe to follow their recreations. At my being there, the ſport was dancing; an exerciſe much uſed by the <hi>French,</hi> who do naturally affect it. And it ſeemeth this natural inclination, is ſo ſtrong and deep rooted; that neither age nor the abſence of a ſmiling fortune can prevail againſt it. For on this dancing green, there aſſembled not only youth and Gentry, but age alſo and beggery. Old wives which could not put foot to ground without a Crutch, in the ſtreets; had here taught their feet to hoble; you would have thought by the cleanly conveyance of their bodies that they had been troubled with the <hi>Sciatica:</hi> and yet ſo eager in the ſport, as if their dancing daies ſhould never be done. Some there were ſo ragged, that a ſwift Galliard would almoſt
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55011:88"/>
have ſhaked them into nakedneſs: and they alſo moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to have their carkaſſes directed in a meaſure. To have attempted the ſtaying of them at home, or the perſwading of them to work, when they had heard the Fiddle, had been a task too unwieldy for <hi>Hercules.</hi> In this mixture of age and condition, did we obſerve them at their paſtime; the rags being ſo interwoven with the ſilke, and wrinkled browes ſo interchangeably mingled with freſh beauties: that you would have thought it, to have been a mummery of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. As for thoſe of both ſexes, which were altogether paſt action; they had cauſed themſelves to be carried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their chairs, and trod the meaſure with their eyes! The Inne which we lay in was juſt like thoſe of <hi>Normandy;</hi> or at the leaſt ſo like as was fit for ſiſters; for ſuch you muſt think them.

                     <p>All the difference between them lay in the morning: and amongſt the maid-ſervants. For here we were not troubled with ſuch an importunate begging as in that other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Theſe here had learned a more neat and compendious way of getting money; and petitioned not our ears, but our noſes. By the rhetorick of a poſie, they prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the purſe; and by giving each of us a bundle of dead flowers tacked together, ſeemed rather to buy our boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then to beg them. A ſweeter and more generous kinde of Petitioning then the other of <hi>Normandie;</hi> and ſuch as may ſeem to employ in it ſome happy contradiction. For what elſe is it, that a maid ſhould proffer her ſelf to be deflowred without prejudice to her modeſty: and raiſe to her future husband an honeſt ſtock, by the uſury of a kindneſs? Refreſhed with theſe favours, we took our leave of <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> and the dancing miſcellany: jogging on through many a beautifull field of corn, till we came unto <hi>Augerville</hi> which is ſix leagues diſtant. A Town of which I could not obſerve, nor hear of any thing memorable; but that is was taken by <hi>Montacute</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury;</hi> as he went this
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55011:89"/>
way to the ſiege of <hi>Orleans;</hi> and indeed, the taking of it was no great miracle, the wals being ſo thin, that an arrow would almoſt as ſoon make a breach in them as a Canon. The ſame fortune befell alſo unto <hi>Toury,</hi> a place not much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it in ſtrength or bigneſs: only that it had more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence (as <hi>Savage</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman once ſaid) in the wals of bones, which were within it, then in the wals of ſtones which were without it.—This Town ſtandeth in the middle way betwixt <hi>Fſtampes</hi> and <hi>Orleans:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a fit ſtage to act a dinner on; and to it we went. By that time we had cleared our ſelves of our pottage, there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon us three uncouth fellowes, with hats on their heads like covered diſhes. As ſoon as ever I ſaw them, I caſt one eye on my cloak, and the other on my ſword: as not knowing what uſe I might have of my ſteel, to maintain my cloth. There was great talk at that time of Mr. <hi>Soubiſes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in armes: and I much feared that theſe might be ſome ſtraglers of his Army: and this I ſuſpected by their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, which were very theeviſh and full of inſolences. But when I had made a ſurvey of their apparel, I quickly altered that opinion; and accounted them as the excrement of the next priſon: deceived alike in both my jealouſies; for theſe pretty parcels of mans fleſh, were neither better nor worſe, but even arrant fidlers: and ſuch which in <hi>England</hi> we ſhould not hold worthy of the whipping-poſt. Our leave not asked, and no reverence on their parts performed, they abuſed our ears with an harſh leſſon: and as if that had not been puniſhment enough unto us, they muſt needs add to it one of their ſongs. By that little <hi>French</hi> which I had gathered, and the ſimpring of a <hi>fille de joy</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> who came along with us; I perceived it was bawdy; and to ſay the truth, more then could be patiently endured by any but a <hi>French</hi> man. But <hi>quid facerem,</hi> what ſhould I do but endure the miſery? for I had not language enough to call them Rogues handſomely; and the villains were inferiour to a beating: and indeed not worthy of mine or any honeſt mans anger.

They were a knot of raſcals ſo infinitely below the ſeverity of a ſtatute, that they would have diſcredited the ſtocks; and to have hang'd them, had been to hazard the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the gallowes. In a year you would hardly finde out ſome vengeance for them, which they would not injure in the ſuffering: unleſs it be not to hearken to their ribaldry, which is one of their greateſt torments.

                     <p>Among the Ancients I have met with three kindes of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt that which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, or morall; becauſe it ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the affections. <hi>Boetius</hi> whom we account the Claſſical author in this faculty, calleth it <hi>Lydian,</hi> becauſe in much uſe with thoſe of that Nation, at this day we may call it <hi>Italian,</hi> as being generally a peculiar muſick to that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This is the muſick which <hi>Eliſha</hi> called for, to invite unto him the ſpirit of Propheſie, 1 King. 3. 15. and this is it which is yet ſung in our Churches. A practice which we derive from the ancients, however ſome of late have oppoſed it: and which is much commended by S. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> this being the uſe of it; <hi>Ut per oblectamenta aurium, infirmior animus in pietatis affectum aſſurgat.</hi> The ſecond kinde the artiſts call <gap reason="foreign">

which as the Poet hath it, doth <hi>ſaxa movere ſono.</hi> The third ſort is that which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, conſiſting alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of ſhort notes, or <hi>Tribrachys. Ariſtotle</hi> calleth it <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>WEE are now come into the Countrey of <hi>Orleans,</hi> which though within the limits of <hi>La Beauſe,</hi> will not yet be an entire County of it ſelf. It is a dainty and pleaſing Region, very even and large in the fields of it, inſomuch that we could not ſee an hill, or ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the ground within eye-ſight. It conſiſteth in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different meaſure of Corn, but moſt plentifully of Vines; and hath of all other fruits a very liberall portion; neither is it meanly beholding to the <hi>Loyre,</hi> for the benefits it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth by that river: on which the City of <hi>Orleans</hi> it ſelf is ſweetly ſeated. Of all places in <hi>England, Worceſterſhire,</hi> in mine opinion, cometh moſt nigh it; as well in reſpect of the Countrey, as the ſituation of the Town. For certainly that Countrey may be called the Epitome of <hi>England;</hi> as this of <hi>France.</hi> To the richeſt of the corn-fields of <hi>Orleanoys</hi> we may compare the Vale of <hi>Eveſham:</hi> neither will it yeeld for the choile and variety of fruits, the Vine only excepted. The hedges in that Countrey are prodigall and laviſh of thoſe

In a word, what a good writer hath ſaid of one, we may ſay of both; <hi>Coelum &amp; ſolum adeo propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium habent, ut ſalubritate &amp; ubertate vicinis non concedant.</hi> But the reſemblance betwixt the Towns, is more happy. Both ſeated on the ſecond river of note in their ſeveral Countreys; and which are not much unlike in their ſeveral courſes. <hi>Severne</hi> waſhing the wals of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and paſſing nigh unto <hi>Briſtol,</hi> ſeated on a little riveret and its homager, divideth the Antients <hi>Britains</hi> from the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The <hi>Loyre,</hi> gliding by the City of <hi>Tours,</hi> and paſſing nigh to <hi>Augeire,</hi> ſeated alſo up the land, on a little river, and one of its tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butories, ſeparateth the modern <hi>Bretagnes</hi> from the reſt of the <hi>French.

                     <p>The people of this town are not of the feweſt: no Town in <hi>France,</hi> the capacity of it conſidered, being more popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; for ſtanding in ſo delicate an air, and on ſo commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious a river, it inviteth the Gentry or Nobles of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey about it, to inhabit there: and they accept it. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their behaviour and humanity, certainly they much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the <hi>Pariſians.</hi> I was about to ſay all the <hi>French</hi> men; and indeed, I need not grudge them that Elogie which <hi>Caeſar</hi> giveth unto thoſe of <hi>Kent:</hi> and verifie, that they are <hi>omnium incolarum longe bumaniſſimi;</hi> my ſelf here obſerving more courtefie and affability in one day, then I could meet withall in <hi>Paris,</hi> during all my abode. The buildings of it are very ſuitable to themſelves, and the reſt of <hi>France;</hi> the ſtreets large and well kept: not yeelding the leaſt offence to the moſt curious noſethrill. Pariſh Churches it hath in it 26 of different and unequall being: as it uſeth to be in other places. Beſides theſe, it contains the Epiſcopal
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55011:91"/>
Church of St. <hi>Croix,</hi> and divers other houſes of religious perſons; amongſt which Sr. <hi>Jacques:</hi> of both which I ſhall ſpeak in their due order. Thus much for the reſemblance of the Towns: the difference betwixt them is this. That <hi>Orleans</hi> is the bigger, and <hi>Worceſter</hi> the richer; <hi>Orleans</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth much of the Nobles, and of ſojourners; <hi>Worceſter</hi> of Citizens only, and home dwellers. And for the manner of life in them; ſo it is, that <hi>Worceſter</hi> hath the handſomer women in it; <hi>Orleans</hi> the finer (and in mine opinion the lovelieſt of all <hi>France:) Worceſter</hi> thriveth much on Clothing; <hi>Orleans</hi> on their Vine-preſſes.</p>
                     <p>And queſtionleſs the Vine of <hi>Orleans</hi> is the greateſt riches not of the Town only, but of the Countrey alſo about it. For this cauſe <hi>Andre du Cheſne</hi> calleth it the prime cellar of <hi>Paris.

Such as it much griev'd me to mingle with water; they being ſo delicious to the palat, and the epicuriſm of the taſte. I have heard of a <hi>Dutch</hi> Gentleman, who being in <hi>Italy,</hi> was brought acquainted with a kinde of Wine, which they there call <hi>Lachrymae Christi.</hi> No ſooner had he taſted it, but he fell into a deep melancholy: and after ſome ſeven ſighs, beſides the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of two grones, he brake out into this pathetical ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: <hi>Dii boni, quare non Christus lachrymatus eſſet in noſtris regionibus!</hi> This <hi>Dutch</hi> man and I, were for a time of one minde: inſomuch that I could almoſt have picked a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with nature, for giving us none of this liquor in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> at laſt we grew friends again, when I had perceived how offenſive it was to the brain, (if not well qualified) for which cauſe it is ſaid, that King <hi>Lewis</hi> hath baniſhed it his Cellar: no doubt to the great grief of his drinking Courtiers, who may therefore ſay with <hi>Martiall,</hi>

This Town called <hi>Genabum</hi> by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> was reedified by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi> the Emperour, <hi>anno</hi> 276. and called by his name <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relianum;</hi> which it ſtill retaineth amongſt the <hi>Latines.</hi> It hath been famous heretofore for four Councels here cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated; and for being the ſiege royal of the Kings of <hi>Orleans,</hi> though as now I could not hear any thing of the ruines of the Palace. The fame of it at this time conſiſteth in the Univerſity, and its ſeat of juſtice: this Town being one of them which they call <hi>Seiges preſidiaux.</hi> Now theſe <hi>Seiges Preſidiaux,</hi> Seats or Courts of Juſtice were eſtabliſhed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Cities of the Realm, for the eaſe of the people; <hi>anno</hi> 1551, or thereabouts. In them all civil cauſes not excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding 250 livres in money, or 10 livres in rents; are heard and determined ſoveraignly and without appeal. If the ſum exceed thoſe proportions, the appeal holdeth good, and ſhall be examined in that Court of Parliament under whoſe juriſdiction they are. This Court here conſiſteth of a Bailly whoſe name is Mr. <hi>Digion,</hi> of 12 Counſellors, two Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants, one civil and the other criminal; and a publick no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. When Mr. <hi>Le Comte de</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who is Governor or Lieutenant Generall of the Province, cometh into their Court, he giveth precedency to the Bailly: in other places he receiveth it. This inſtitution of theſe Preſidentiall Courts, was at firſt a very profitable ordinance, and much eaſed the people: but now it is grown burthenſome: the reaſon is, that the offices are made ſalable, and purchaſed by them with a great deal of money, which afterwards they wreſt again out of the purſes of the peſants: the ſale of offices drawing neceſſarily after it, the ſale of juſtice; a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which is ſpread ſo far, that there is not the pooreſt under-officer in all the Realm, who may not ſafely ſay with the Captain in the 22. of the <hi>Acts</hi> and the 28. verſ. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, with a great ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney obtained I this freedome. Twenty years purchaſe is ſaid to be no extraordinary rate: and I have read, that only by the ſale of offices, one of the Kings had raiſed in 20 years 139 millions: which amounteth to the proportion of ſeven millions yearly, or thereabouts: of all waies to thrift and treaſure the moſt unkingly. In the year 1614 the King
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55011:92"/>
motioned the aboliſing of the ſales of this market, but it was upon a condition more prejudicial to the people then the miſchief: for he deſired in lieu of it, to have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter impoſition laid upon Salt and on the Aides: which thoſe who were Commiſſioners for the Commonalty would not admit of; becauſe then a common miſery had been bought out of the State to make their particular miſery the greater, and ſo the corruption remaineth unaltered.</p>
                     <p>This Town, as it is ſweetly ſeated in reſpect of the air: ſo is it finely convenienced with walks: of which the chief are that next unto <hi>Paris</hi> Gate, having the wall on one hand, and a rank of palm-trees on the other; the ſecond that near unto the Bridge, having the water pleaſingly running on both ſides: and a third, which is indeed the principal, on the eaſt ſide of the City. It is called the <hi>Palle Malle,</hi> from an exerciſe of that name, much uſed in this Kingdome: a very Gentleman-like ſport, not over violent; and ſuch as affordeth good opportunity of diſcourſe, as they walk from one mark to the other. Into this walk, which is of a wonderful length and beauty, you ſhall have a clear evening empty all the Town: the aged people borrowing legs to carry them; and the younger, armes to guide them. If any young Dame or Monſieur, walk thither ſingle, they will quickly finde ſome or other to link with them: though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſuch with whom they have no familiarity. Thus do they meaſure and re-meaſure the length of the <hi>Palle Malle,</hi> not minding the ſhutting in of the day, till darkneſs hath taken away the ſenſe of bluſhing. At all hours of the night, be it warm and dry, you ſhall be ſure to finde them there, thus coupled: and if at the years end, there be found more chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren then fathers in the Town; this walk and the night are ſuſpected ſhrewdly to be acceſſaries. A greater incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience in my opinion then an <hi>Engliſh</hi> kiſſe.</p>
                     <p>There is yet a fourth walk in this Town called <hi>L' Eſtapp,</hi> a walk principally frequented by Merchants: who here meet to conſerre of their occaſions. It lyeth before the houſe of Mr. <hi>Le Comte de St. Paul</hi> the Governour, and reacheth up to the Cloyſter of St. <hi>Croix:</hi> of the building of which Church, I could never yet hear or read of any thing, but that which
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55011:93"/>
is meerly fabulous, for the Citizens report, that long ſince, time out of minde, there appeared a viſion to an holy Monk, which lived thereabouts, and bad him dig deep in ſuch a place, where he ſhould finde a piece of the holy Croſſe, charging him to preſerve that bleſſed relique in great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and to cauſe a Church to be built in that place where it had been buried: upon this warning the Church was founded, but at whoſe charges they could not enform me: ſo that all which I could learn concerning the foundation of this Church, is that it was erected only by Superſtition and a lie. The Superſtition is apparent in their worſhipping of ſuch rotten ſticks, as they imagine to be remnants of the Croſſe; their calling of it holy, and dedicating of this Church unto it. Nay they have conſecrated unto it two holy daies, one in <hi>May,</hi> and the other in <hi>September:</hi> and are bound to ſalute it as often as they ſee it in the ſtreets or the high-waies, with theſe words, <hi>Ave ſalus totius ſaeculi arbor ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutifera.</hi> Horrible blaſphemy, and never heard but under Antichriſt! <hi>Cruces ſubeundas eſſe non adorandas,</hi> being the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Ancients. As for the miracle, I account it as others of the ſame ſtamp: equally falſe and ridiculous. This Church in the year 1562. was defaced and ruined by the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots,</hi> who had entred the Town under the conduct of the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> An action little ſavouring of humanity, and leſſe of Religion: the very Heathens themſelves ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver demoliſhing any of the Churches, of thoſe Towns which they had taken. But in this action, the <hi>Hugonots</hi> conſulted only with raſhneſſe, and a zealous fury, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no title ſo glorious as to be called the Scourge of Papiſts, and the overthrowers of Popiſh Churches.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55011:93"/>
his Son <hi>Lewis</hi> hath ſince continued: ſo that the quire is now quite finiſhed, and the workmen are in hand with the reſt. What ſhould move the <hi>Hugonots</hi> to this execution, I cannot ſay: unleſſe it were a hate which they bare unto the name; and perhaps that not unlikely. We read how the <hi>Romans</hi> having expelled their Kings, baniſhed alſo <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinus</hi> their Conſul: a man in whom they could finde no fault but this, that his ſurname was <hi>Tarquin; tantum ob nomen &amp; genus regium,</hi> ſaith <hi>Florus:</hi> afterwards, <hi>quam inviſum regis nomen,</hi> is very frequent in the ſtories of thoſe times. Amongſt thoſe which had been of the conſpiracy againſt <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar,</hi> there was one named <hi>Cinna,</hi> a name ſo odious amongſt the people, that meeting by chance with one of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>'s chief friends, and hearing that his name was <hi>Cinna,</hi> they preſently murthered him in the place, for which cauſe one <hi>Caſca,</hi> which was alſo the name of one of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, publiſhed a writing of his name and pedegree: ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein, that he neither was the traytor, nor any kin to him. The reaſon of his action <hi>Dion</hi> giveth us <gap reason="foreign">

And what troubles the <hi>French</hi> party here in <hi>England</hi> have raiſed, becauſe of that harmleſſe ceremony of the croſſe; <hi>Notius eſt quam ut ſtilo egeat,</hi> and therefore I omit it. This Church is the ſeat of a Biſhop, who acknowledgeth the Archbiſhop of <hi>Sens,</hi> for his Metropolitan. The preſent Biſhop is named <hi>Franciſcus d' Aubeſpine,</hi> ſaid to be a worthy Scholar, and a ſound Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lititian; though he were never graduated further then the arts. Of his revenue I could learn nothing, but of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge this: namely, that at the firſt entrance of every new Biſhop into this Church, he hath the liberty of ſetting free any of the priſoners of the Gaole: though their crime be never ſo mortall. For, the original of this indulgence: we are beholding to St. <hi>Aignan,</hi> once Biſhop here, and who defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the City againſt <hi>Auila</hi> the <hi>Harme.</hi> At his firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55011:94"/>
into the town, (ſaith the ſtory) after he was inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted Biſhop, he beſought <hi>Agrippinus</hi> the Governour, that for his ſake he would let looſe all his priſoners, <hi>ut omnes quos pro variis criminibus poenalis carcer detinebat incluſos, in ſui introi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus gratiam redderet abſolutos;</hi> when the Governour had heard his requeſt, he denied it: and preſently a ſtone falleth upon his head, no man knew from whence: wounded and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with this, the Governor granteth his deſire, recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her health: and ever ſince the cuſtome hath continued. For the truth of this ſtory, I intend to be no Champion: for I hold it ridiculous and ſavouring too much of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend: but this I am certain of, that every new Biſhop ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a very ſolemn and majeſtick entry into the City; and at his entry, releaſeth a priſoner.</p>
                     <p>Let us follow the Biſhop into his Church, and there we ſhall finde him entertained with an high Maſſe; the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies whereof are very pretty and abſurd. To go over them all, would require a volume, I will therefore mention thoſe only wherein they differ from other Maſſes: and they are two: the one fantaſtical, the other heatheniſh. For as ſoon as the prieſt at the altar hath read a certain leſſon, but what, his voice was not audible enough to tell me: out marcheth the Dean, or in his abſence, the ſenior Canon, out of the Church. Before him two or three torches, and a long croſſe ſilvered over, after him all thoſe of the Church, and laſtly the lay people, both men and women: ſo that there is none left to keep poſſeſſion, but the Prieſt and the Altar; and ſuch ſtrangers as come thither for curioſity, they go out at one door, and having firſt circuited the quire, and afterwards the body of the Church; they return to their places: and the Prieſt proceedeth. I have ſeen many a dumb ſhew in a play juſt like it. This only is the difference, that here we had no interpreter nor Chorus afforded us to ſhew us the myſterie of this ſilent geſticulation. The other addition which I obſerved here at the Maſſe (though I have ſince been told that it is ordinary at high Maſſes, in the Cathedral Churches) was the cenſing of the people: which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in this manner. Whileſt the Prieſt was buſie at the Altar, there entred into the quire at a ſide door, two boyes in
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55011:94"/>
their Surplices, bearing wax-tapers in their hands: and immediately after them the foreſaid fellow with the Croſſe, in the rere there came two of the Prieſts in their copes, and other ſtately veſtiments: between both a young lad with the incenſe-pot, made full of holes to let out the ſume; which he ſwingeth on all ſides of him, with a chain, to which it was faſtned: having thus marched through the Church and cenſed the people, he aſcendeth unto the Altar, and there cenſeth the croſſe, the relicks, the bread, the wine, the chalice, the images: and I know not what not. A cuſtome very much uſed amongſt the Heathen. <hi>Omnibus viris factae ſunt ſtatuſe &amp; ad eas thus &amp; cerei,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tully:</hi> and, <hi>Jane tibi primam thura merum<expan>

At what time it crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Churches of the Chriſtians, I cannot tell. Sure I am it was not uſed in the primitive times, nor in the third age after our Saviour: ſave only in their burials, <hi>Sciant Sabaei</hi> (ſaith <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who at that time lived) <hi>pluris &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riores merces ſuas, Chriſtianis ſepeliendis profligari, quam fumigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus. Arnobius</hi> alſo in the 7 book <hi>adverſus gentes,</hi> diſclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the uſe of it: and yet the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> in the 22. Seſſion, defineth it to be as boldly, <hi>ex Apoſtolica inſtitutione &amp; traditione,</hi> as if the Apoſtles themſelves had told them ſo. I know they had rather ſeem to derive it from the 30 chap. and 7. verſ. of <hi>Exodus:</hi> and ſo Biſhop <hi>Durand</hi> is of opinion in his <hi>Rationale divinorum:</hi> but this will not help them. <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> there is commanded only to burn incenſe on the Altar: and not to cenſe men and images, croſſes and relicks, &amp;c. as the Papiſts do. So that will they, nill they, they muſt be counted followers of the Heathen: though I envie them not the honour of being Jewes.</p>
                     <p>From the hiſtory and view of the Church, proceed we to that of the Town: where nothing occurreth more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable then the great ſiege laid before it by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> A ſiege of great importance to both parties. <hi>France</hi> having been totally won unto King <hi>Henry,</hi> if this Town had yeelded, and once ſo nigh it was to ſubmit it ſelf, that the people proffer'd to yeeld themſelves to <hi>Philip</hi> Duke

For her firſt ſervice ſhe taketh <hi>Jargeau,</hi> diſcomfiteth the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> which were within it, and maketh the Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> priſoner. Soon after followed the battail of <hi>Patay:</hi> in which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were driven out of the field, and the great <hi>Talbot</hi> taken. This done, ſhe accompanieth <hi>Charles</hi> the 7. whoſe Angel Guardian ſhe was, through all <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pague</hi> unto <hi>Rhemes:</hi> where ſhe ſaw him ſolemnly crowned: all the Towns of thoſe Countreys yeelding upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of her, and the Kings Army. Finally, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny acts performed above the nature of her ſexe, which I will not ſtand here to particulate, ſhe was taken priſoner at the ſiege of <hi>Campoigne:</hi> delivered over unto the Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> by him ſent unto <hi>Roven,</hi> and there burnt for a Witch on the 6. of <hi>July, anno</hi> 1431. There was alſo another crime objected againſt her, as namely that ſhe
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55011:95"/>
had abuſed the nature of her ſexe, marching up and down in the habit of a man, <hi>Et nihil muliebre praeter corpus gerens.</hi> Of all accuſations the moſt impotent, for in what other habit could ſhe dreſſe her ſelf, undertaking, the actions of a Generall? and beſides, to have worn her womans weeds in time of battail, had been to have betrayed her ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and to have made her ſelf the mark of every arrow. It was therefore requiſite that ſhe ſhould array her ſelf in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat harneſſe; and in that habit of complete armour, have thoſe of <hi>Orleans</hi> erected her Statua all in braſſe, upon the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of their bridge.</p>
                     <p>As for that other imputation of being a Witch, ſaving the credit of thoſe which condemn'd her, and theirs alſo who in their writings have ſo reported her: I dare be of the contrary opinion, for dividing her actions into two parts, thoſe which preceded her coming unto <hi>Orleans,</hi> and thoſe which followed it: I finde much in it of cunning, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what perhaps of valour: but nothing that is devilliſh. Her relieving of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and courage ſhewn at the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails of <hi>Patay</hi> and <hi>Gergeau,</hi> with her conducting of the King unto <hi>Rhemes:</hi> are not ſuch prodigies, that they need to be aſcribed unto witchcraft. She was not the firſt woman whom the world knew famed in armes, there being no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion almoſt of the earth, who have not had a Champion of this ſexe, to defend their Liberties: to omit the whole Nation of <hi>Amazons.</hi> To the Jewes in the time of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, the Lord raiſed up ſalvation by means of two women, <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Judith:</hi> and God is not the God of the <hi>Jewes</hi> only, but alſo of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> amongſt the <hi>Syrians Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobia</hi> Queen of <hi>Pabnira</hi> is very famous; the <hi>Romans</hi> whom ſhe often foyled, never mentioning her without honour. The like commendable teſtimony they give of <hi>Velleda,</hi> a Queen amongſt the <hi>Germans:</hi> a woman that much hindred their affairs in that Countrey. Thus had the <hi>Gothes</hi> their <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſunta:</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> their <hi>Semiramis,</hi> the <hi>Scythians</hi> their <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myris,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> their <hi>Fulvia:</hi> all brave Captains, and ſuch as poſterity hath admired without envie. To come home unto our ſelves, the writers of the <hi>Romans</hi> mention the revolt of <hi>Britain,</hi> and the ſlaughter of 70000 <hi>Raman</hi> Confederates
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55011:96"/>
under the conduct of <hi>Voaditia:</hi> and ſhe in the beginning of her incouragements to the action, telleth the people this, <hi>Solitum quidem Britannis foeminarum ductu bellare.</hi> Of all theſe heroical Ladies, I read no accuſation of witchcraft: inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive courage and a ſenſe of injury, being the armes they fought withall; neither can I ſee why the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed us in modeſty; or that we need envie unto the <hi>French</hi> this one female warriour, when it is a fortune which hath befaln moſt Nations. As for her atchievements, they are not ſo much beyond a common being: but that they may be imputed to natural means: for had ſhe been a Witch, it is likely ſhe would have prevented the diſgrace which her va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour ſuffered, in the ditches of <hi>Paris,</hi> though ſhe could not avoid thoſe of <hi>Compeigne,</hi> who took her priſoner: the Devill at ſuch an exigent only being accuſtomed to forſake thoſe which he hath entangled. So that ſhe enjoyed not ſuch a perpetuity of felicity, as to entitle her to the Devils aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſhe being ſometimes conqueror, ſometimes overthrown, and at laſt impriſoned. <hi>Communia fortunae ludibria,</hi> the ordinary ſports of fortune. Her actions before her march to <hi>Orleans,</hi> have ſomewhat in them of cunning, and perhaps of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, as the viſion which ſhe reported to have incited her to theſe attempts, her finding out of the King diſguiſed in the habit of a countrey man; and her appointing to her ſelf an old Sword hanging in St. <hi>Katharines</hi> Church in <hi>Tours.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> were at this time meerly creſt faln: not to be raiſed but by miracle. This therefore is invented, and ſo that which of all the reſt muſt prove her a ſorcereſſe, will only prove her an impoſtor. <hi>Gerrard, Seigneur du Hailan,</hi> one of the beſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>France,</hi> is of opinion that all that plot of her coming to the King, was contriv'd by three Lords of the Court; to hearten the people; as if God now miraculouſly intended the reſtauration of the Kingdome. Add to this, that ſhe never commanded in any battail, without the aſſiſtance of the beſt Captains of the <hi>French</hi> Nation: and amongſt whom was the Baſtard of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who is thought to have put this device into her head. The Lord of <hi>Bellay</hi> in his diſcourſe of <hi>arte militarie,</hi> proceedeth further, and maketh her a man: only thus habited, <hi>pour faire revenir le courage aux Francois:</hi> which,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55011:96"/>
had it been ſo, would have been diſcovered at the time of her burning. Others of the later <hi>French</hi> writers (for thoſe of the former age ſavour too much of the Legend) make her to be a luſty Laſſe of <hi>Lorrein,</hi> trained up by the Baſtard of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the Seigneur of <hi>Baudricourte;</hi> only for this ſervice. And that ſhe might carry with her the reputation of a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe, and an Ambaſſadreſſe from heaven; admit this, and fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well witchcraft. And for the ſentence of her condemnation, and the confirmation of it by the Divines and Univerſity of <hi>Paris;</hi> it is with me of no moment: being compoſed only to humour the Victor. If this could ſway me, I had more reaſon to incline to the other party; for when <hi>Charles</hi> had ſetled his eſtate, the ſame men, who had condemned her of ſorcery, abſolved her: and there was alſo added in defence of her innocency, a Decree from the Court of <hi>Rome. Joane</hi> then with me ſhall inherit the title of <hi>La pucille d' Orleans:</hi> with me ſhe ſhall be ranked amongſt the famous Captains of her times; and be placed in the ſame throne, equall with the valianteſt of all her ſexe, in time before her. Let thoſe whom partiality hath wreſted aſide from the path of truth, proclaim her for a ſorcereſſe, for my part I will not flatter my beſt fortunes of my Countrey to the prejudice of a truth: neither will I ever be enduced to think of this female warrier, otherwiſe then of a noble Captain.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>I Have now done with the Town and City of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and am come unto the Univerſity or Schools of Law which are in it; this being one of the firſt places in which the ſtudy of the Civill Lawes was revived in <hi>Europe.</hi> For immediately after the death of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> who out of no leſſe then 2000 volumes of law-writers had collected that bodie of the Imperiall Lawes, which we now call the <hi>Digeſts,</hi> or the <hi>Pandects:</hi> the ſtudy of them grew neglected in theſe Weſtern parts, nor did any for a long time profeſſe or read them; the reaſon was, becauſe <hi>Italy, France, Spain, England</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> having received new Lords over them; as the <hi>Franks, Lombards, Saxons, Saracens,</hi> and others were fain to ſubmit themſelves to their Laws. It happened afterwards that <hi>Lotharius Saxo</hi> the Emperour, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap>gan his reign, <hi>anno</hi> 1126. (being 560 years after the death of <hi>Juſtinian)</hi> having taken the City of <hi>Melphy</hi> in <hi>Naples,</hi> found there an old copy of the <hi>Pandects.</hi> This he gave to the <hi>Piſans</hi> his confederates, as a moſt reverend relick of Learning and Antiquity; whence it is called
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55011:98"/>
                        <hi>Littera Piſana.</hi> Moreover he founded the Univerſity of <hi>Bologne</hi> or <hi>Bononia,</hi> ordering the Civill Law to be profeſt there: one <hi>Wirner</hi> being the firſt Profeſſor; upon whoſe advice the ſaid Emperor ordained that <hi>Bononia</hi> ſhould be <hi>Legum &amp; juris Schola una &amp; ſola:</hi> and here was the firſt time and place of that ſtudy in the Weſtern Empire. But it was not the fate only of the Civill Laws, to be thus neglected. All other parts of learning, both Arts and languages, were in the ſame deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate eſtates; the Poets exclamation of <hi>O ſaeclum inſipiens &amp; infacetum,</hi> never being ſo applyable as in thoſe times. For it is with the knowledge of good letters, as it was with the effects of nature; they have times of groweth alike, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and of death. Like the ſea, it hath its ebbs as well as its flouds; and like the earth, it hath its Winter, wherein the ſeeds of it are deaded and bound up, as well as a Spring wherein it reflouriſheth. Thus the learning of the <hi>Greeks</hi> lay forgotten, and loſt in <hi>Europe</hi> for 700 years, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <hi>Emanuel Chryſolaras</hi> taught it at <hi>Venice,</hi> being driven out of his Countrey by the <hi>Turks.</hi> Thus the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> lay hidden in the moath of duſt and libraries, <hi>Et nominabatur potius quod legebatur,</hi> as <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> obſerveth in his notes upon St. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> untill the time of <hi>Alexander Aphrodiſeus.</hi> And thus alſo lay the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies of the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue obſcured, till that <hi>Eraſmus, More</hi> and <hi>Reuchlyn,</hi> in the ſeverall Kingdomes of <hi>Germany, England,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> endeavoured the reſtauration of it.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the Civill Law. After the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Univerſity of <hi>Bologne,</hi> it pleaſed <hi>Philip le bel</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> to found another here at <hi>Orleans,</hi> for the ſame purpoſe, <hi>anno</hi> 1312. which was the firſt School of that profeſſion on this ſide the mountains. This is evident by the Bull of <hi>Clement</hi> V. dated at <hi>Lyons</hi> in the year 1367. where he giveth it this title, <hi>Fructiferum univerſitatis Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianenſts intra caetera citramontana ſtudia, prius ſolennius, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quius, tam civilis, quam Canonicae facultatis ſtudium.</hi> At the firſt there were inſtituted eight Profeſſors, now they are reduced to four only; the reaſon of this decreaſe, being the increaſe of Univerſities. The place in which they read
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55011:98"/>
their Lectures, is called <hi>Les grand eſcoles,</hi> and part of the City, <hi>La Univerſite;</hi> neither of which attributes it can any way remit. <hi>Colledge</hi> they have none, either to lodge the ſtudents, or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Profeſſors, the former ſojourning in divers places of the Town, theſe laſt in their ſeverall houſes. As for their place of reading which they call <hi>Les grans eſcoles,</hi> it is only an old barn converted into a School, by the addition of five ranks of formes, and a pew in the middle, you never ſaw a thing ſo mock its own name: <hi>Lucus</hi> not being more properly called ſo <hi>a non lucendo,</hi> then this ruinous houſe is a great School, becauſe it is little. The preſent profeſſors are Mr. <hi>Furner,</hi> the <hi>Rector</hi> at my being there; Mr. <hi>Tuillerie,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Grand.</hi> The fourth of them named Mr. <hi>Augrand,</hi> was newly dead, and his place like a dead pay among Souldiers not ſupplyed; in which eſtate was the function of Mr. <hi>Brodee,</hi> whoſe office it was to read the Book of Inſtitutions, unto ſuch as come newly to the Town. They read each of them an hour, in their turns, every morning in the week, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Holydayes and Thurſdayes, their hearers taking their Lectures in their tables. Their principall office is that of the <hi>Rector,</hi> which every three months deſcends down unto the next, ſo that once in a year, every one of the profeſſors hath his turn of being <hi>Rector.</hi> The next in dignity unto him is the <hi>Chancellour,</hi> whoſe office is during life, and in whoſe name all degrees are given, and the Letters Authenticall, as they term them, granted. The preſent <hi>Chancellour</hi> is named Mr. <hi>Bouchier</hi> Dr. of Divinity and of both the Laws, and <hi>Prebend</hi> alſo of St. <hi>Croix;</hi> his place is in the gift of the Biſhop of <hi>Orleans;</hi> and ſo are the <hi>Chancellors</hi> places in all <hi>France</hi> at the beſtowing of the <hi>Dioceſan.</hi> Antiently it was thus alſo with us at <hi>Oxford;</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne</hi> nominating to us our <hi>Chancellors,</hi> till the year 1370. <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Remington</hi> being the firſt <hi>Chancellour</hi> elected by the Univerſity.</p>
                     <p>In the beſtowing of their degrees here, they are very libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and deny no man that is able to pay his fees. <hi>Legem ponere</hi> is with them more powerfull then <hi>legem dicere,</hi> and he that hath but his gold ready, ſhall have a ſooner diſpatch, then the beſt Scholar upon ticket.

and in this preſerve their Records and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, the keeping of the one, and ſummoning the other, being meerly in the hands of the <hi>Procurator.</hi> About the Table they have five chairs for the five principall Officers; thoſe of the Councell ſitting round the Chamber on ſtools; the armes of the Empire being placed directly over every of the ſeats. If it happen that any of them die there, they all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him to his grave, in a manner mixt ſo orderly of grief and ſtate, that you would think the obſequies of ſome great Potentate were ſolemnized. And to ſay truth of them, they are a hearty and a loving Nation, not to one another only, but to ſtrangers, and eſpecially to us of <hi>England.</hi> Only I would wiſh that in their ſpeech and complement, they would not uſe the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue, or elſe ſpeak it more congruouſly.

                           <hi>Orleans</hi> not an Univerſity till the coming of the Jeſuites. Their Colledge there by whom built. The Jeſuites no ſingers. Their laudable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act method of teaching. Their policies in it. Received not without great difficulty into <hi>Paris.</hi> Their houſes in that Univerſity.

Our returne to <hi>Paris.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe difference between an Univerſity and an Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demie ſtanding thus, Thoſe which lived in our Fathers dayes could hardly have called <hi>Orleans</hi> an Univerſity; a School of Law being the name moſt fit for it. At this time ſince the coming of the Jeſuites, that appellation may not misbecome it, they having brought with them thoſe parts of learning, which before were wanting in it: but this hath not been of any long ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, their Colledge being not yet fully finiſhed. By an inſcription over the gate, it ſeemeth to be the work of Mr. <hi>Gagliery,</hi> one of the Advocates in the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> a man of large practiſe, and by conſequence, of great poſſeſſions; and who having no childe but this Colledge, is ſaid to intend the faſtning of his eſtate upon it. In this houſe do thoſe of this order apply themſelves to the ſtudy of good Letters, in the purſuit whereof, as the reſt of this fracernity are, they are good proficients, and much exceed all other ſorts of Fryers, as having better teachers and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55011:101"/>
more leaſure to learn. That time which the other ſpent at high Maſſes, and at their Canonicall hours, theſe men beſtowed upon their books: they being exempted from theſe duties by their order. Upon this ground they trouble not their heads with the crotchets of Muſick, nor ſpend their moneths upon the chanting out of their ſervices. They have other matters to imploy their brains upon, ſuch as are the ruin of Kingdoms, and deſolation of Countries. It was the ſaying of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> being requeſted to play a leſſon on the Lute, <hi>That he could not fidle, but he could tell how to make a little Town a great City.</hi> The like we may ſay of the Jeſuites; They are no great ſingers, but are well skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in making little Cities great, and great ones little. And certain it is, that they are ſo far from any ability or deſire this way, that upon any of their ſolemn Feſtivals, when their Statutes require muſick, they are faine to hire the ſinging men of the next <hi>Cathedrall.</hi> As here upon the feaſt of their Patron St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> being the 21 of <hi>July,</hi> they were compelled to make uſe of the voyces of the Church of St. <hi>Croix.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this advantage of leaſure is added the exact method of their teaching, which is indeed ſo excellent, that the Proteſtants themſelves in ſome places ſend their ſons to their Schools; upon deſire to have them prove exquiſite in thoſe arts they teach. To them reſort the children of the rich as well as of the poor, and that in ſuch abundance, that whereſoever they ſettle, other houſes become in a manner deſolate, or frequented only by thoſe of the more heavie and phlegmatick conſtitutions. Into their Schooles when they have received them, they place them in that forum or Claſſis into w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they are beſt fitted to enter. Of theſe Claſſes, the loweſt is for Grammar: the ſecond for Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the making of Theames, as we call it: the third for Poetry: the fourth for Oratory: the fifth for Greek Grammar and compoſitions: the ſixt for the Poeſie and Rhetorick of that language: the ſeventh for Logick: and the eight and laſt for Philoſophy. In each of theſe Schooles there is a ſeverall Reader or Inſtitutor, who only mindeth that art, and the perfection of it, which for that year he
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55011:102"/>
teacheth. That year ended, he removeth both himſelf and Scholars with him, into the Claſſis or Schooles next beyond him, till he hath brought them through the whole ſtudies of humanity. In this laſt forme, which is that of Philoſophy, he continueth two years, which once expired, his Scholars are made perfect in the Univerſity of learning, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves manumitted from their labours, and permitted their private ſtudies. Nor do they only teach their Scholars an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſſe in thoſe ſeveral parts of Learning which they handle, but they alſo endevour to breed in them an obſtinacy of mind, and a ſturdy eagerneſſe of ſpirit to make them thereby hot proſecutors of their own opinions, and impatient of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary conſideration. This is it which maketh all thoſe of their education, to affect victory in all the controverſies of wit or knowledge, with ſuch a violence, that even in their very Grammaticall diſputations, you ſhall find little boyes maintaine arguments with ſuch a fierie impatience, that you would think it above the nature of their years. And all this they performe freely and for nothing; the poor Paiſants ſon being by them equally inſtructed, with that of the Nobleſt.</p>
                     <p>By this means they get unto their Society, great honour, and great ſtrength; honour in furniſhing their Schooles with ſo many perſons of excellent quality or Nobility, of whom afterwards they make their beſt advantages for their ſtrength alſo. As for thoſe of the poorer ſort, they have alſo their ends upon them; for by this free and liberall education of their children, the common people do infinitely affect them: beſides that, out of that ranke of their Scholars they aſſume ſuch into their fraternity, whom they finde to be of a rare wit and excellent ſpirit, or any other way fitted for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Thus do they make their own purpoſes out of all conditions, and refuſe no fiſh which either they can draw into their nets, or which will offer it ſelf unto them. <hi>Si locuples quis eſt, avariſunt, ſi pauper, ambitioſi, quos non oriens, non occidens ſatiaverit, ſoli omnium opes atque inopiam pari affectu concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcunt: Galgacus</hi> a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Captain, ſpake it of the Souldiers of the <hi>Romans</hi> Empire: we may as juſtly verifie it of theſe Souldiers of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, they being the men whom

neither the <hi>Weſt</hi> nor <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> can ſatisfie; and who with a like fervencie deſire the education of the needy and the wealthy. Moreover, by this method of teaching they do not only ſtrengthen themſelves in the affections of men a broad, but alſo fortifie themſelves within their own wals at home; for by this means, there is not one of their ſociety, who hath not only perfectly concocted in his head the whole <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

To conclude then and ſay no more of them, and their rare abilities (for <hi>virtus &amp; in hoſte probatur)</hi> it is thought by men of wiſdome and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the planting of a Colledge of Jeſuites in any place, is the onely ſure way to reeſtabliſh that Religion which they profeſſe, and in time to eate out the contrary.</p>
                     <p>This notwithſtanding, they were at the firſt inſtitution of them mightily oppoſed, and no where more violently then in the Univerſity of <hi>Paris.</hi> An Univerſity that ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth much upon its liberty and priviledges; to which this order was imagined to be an hindrance: it being lawfull for them to take any degree in their own houſes, without reference to any publick exerciſe or examination. In the year 1554. at what time they firſt began to ſet foot in <hi>France,</hi> the Colledge of the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> made a long decree againſt them, in the end whereof are theſe words, and they are worth the reading, <hi>Uidetur haec ſocietas in negotio fidei pericu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſa, pacis Eccleſiae perturbativa, monaſticae religionis everſiva &amp; magis ad deſtructionem, quam ad adificationem;</hi> a cenſure too full of vineger and bitterneſſe. Afterwards in the year 1564. they preferred a Petition to the Univerſity, that the Colledge which the Biſhop of <hi>Clermont</hi> had built for them, might be incorporated into the Univerſity, and enjoy the immunities of it. Upon the Univerſities deniall of their deſire, there aroſe a ſuit between them and the Univerſity in the high Court of Parliament; <hi>Peter Verſoris</hi> pleading for the Jeſuits, and <hi>Stephen Paſquier</hi> for the other party.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55011:103"/>
In the end they were admitted, though upon terms of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous ſtrictneſſe. <hi>Anno 1594. John Caſtell</hi> a novice of this order, having wounded King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. in the mouth, occaſioned the baniſhment of this Society out of all <hi>France,</hi> into which they were not again received till the year 1604. and then alſo upon limitations more ſtrict then ever. Into <hi>Paris</hi> they were not readmitted untill <hi>anno</hi> 1606. neither had the liberty of reading Lectures and inſtructing the youth confirmed unto them till <hi>anno</hi> 1611. which alſo was compaſſed not without great trouble and vexation.

                     <p>In this Univerſity they have at this inſtant three houſes, one of the Novices, a ſecond of Inſtitutors, which they call the Colledge; and a third of profeſſed Jeſuites, which they ſtyle their Monaſtery, or the profeſſed houſe of St. <hi>Lewis.</hi> In their houſe of Novices they train up all thoſe whom they have culled out of their Schooles to be of their order, and therein initiate them in the arts of Jeſuitiſm, and their myſteries of iniquity. They there teach them not Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall conſtructions or compoſition, but inſtruct them in the paths of virtue, courage and obedience, according to ſuch examples as their Authors afford them. This they ſay of themſelves and their friends for them. But he that made the funerall Oration for <hi>Henry</hi> IV. <hi>anno</hi> 1610. reporteth it otherwiſe, <hi>Latini ſermonis obtentu</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>impuriſſime Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licae juventutis mores ingenuos foedant. Bonarum litterarum praetextu, peſſimas edocent artes. Dum ingenia excolunt, animas perdunt,</hi> &amp;c. In their Colledge they have the ſame method of teaching which the others of their company uſe in <hi>Orleans.</hi> A Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge firſt given unto them by Mr. <hi>William Pratt</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Clermount,</hi> whoſe houſe it was; but much beautifyed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after his deceaſe. For with the mony which he gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by his will, which amounted (as it was thought) to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55011:103"/>
60000 crowns; they added to it the Court called <hi>De Langres,</hi> in St. <hi>James ſtreet, anno</hi> 1582. Their Monaſtery or houſe of profeſſion is that unto which they retire themſelves after they have diſcharged their duties in the Colledge, by reading and ſtudying publickly in their ſeverall Claſſes. When they are here, their ſtudies both for time and quality is <hi>ad placitum;</hi> though generally their only ſtudie in it is Policy, and the advantage of their cauſe. And indeed out of this <hi>Trojan</hi> horſe it is, that thoſe firebrands and incendiaries are let out to diſturb and ſet in combuſtion the affaires of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, out of this forge come all thoſe ſtratagems and tricks of <hi>Machiavillianiſm,</hi> which tend to the ruine of the Proteſtants, and the deſolation of their Countries. I ſpeak not this of their houſe of Profeſſion here in <hi>Paris,</hi> either only or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally; whereſoever they ſettle, they have a houſe of this nature, out of which they iſſue to overthrow the Goſpell. Being ſent once by their Superiors, a neceſſity is layed upon them of obedience, be the imployment never ſo dangerous. And certainly this Nation doth moſt ſtrictly obey the rules of their order, of any whatſoever, not excepting the <hi>Capou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins</hi> nor the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> This I am witneſſe to, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Divinity Lecture is to end at the tilling of a Bell; one of the Society in the Colledge of <hi>Clermont,</hi> reading about the fall of the Angels, ended his Lecture with theſe words, <hi>Denique in quibuſeunque;</hi> for then was the warning given, and he durſt not ſo far treſpaſſe upon his rule, as to ſpeak out his ſentence.</p>
                     <p>But it is not the fate of theſe Jeſuits to have great perſons only, and Univerſities only to oppoſe their fortunes: they have alſo the moſt accompliſht malice, that either the ſecular Prieſts or Fryers amongſt whom they live, can faſten upon them. Some envie them for the greatneſſe of their poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſome becauſe of the excellency of their learning; ſome hate them for their power, ſome for the ſhrewdneſſe of their brains; all together making good that ſaying of <hi>Patercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> that <hi>Semper eminentis fortune comes eſt invidia.</hi> True in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is, that the Jeſuits have in a manner deſerved all this clamor and ſtomach by their own inſolencies; for they have not only drawn into their own hands all the principall
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55011:104"/>
affairs of Court and ſtate; but upon occaſions caſt all the ſcorn and contempt they can, upon thoſe of the other Orders. The Janizaries of the <hi>Turke</hi> never more neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſpeak of the <hi>Aſapi,</hi> then thoſe doe of the reſt of the Clergy. A great crime in thoſe men, who deſire to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſuch excellent Maſters of their own affections. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the affection born to them abroad, greater then that at home; amongſt thoſe I mean of the oppoſite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; who being ſo often troubled and crumped by them, have little cauſe to afford them a liking, and much leſſe a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Upon this reaſon they were not ſent into <hi>England</hi> with the Queen, although at firſt they were deſtinate to that ſervice. It was well known how odious that name was amongſt us, and what little countenance the Court or Countrey would have afforded them. They therefore who had the Governance of that buſineſſe, ſent hither in their places the <hi>Oratorians,</hi> or the <hi>Fratres congregationis Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torii;</hi> a race of men never as yet offenſive to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> further then the generall defence of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> cauſe, and ſo leſſe ſubject to envie and exception. They were firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by <hi>Philip Nerius,</hi> not long after the Jeſuits, and advanced and dignified by <hi>Pope Sixtus</hi> V. principally to this end, that by their inceſſant Sermons to the people, of the lives of Saints, and other Eccleſiaſticall Antiquities, they might get a new reputation; and ſo divert a little the torrent of the peoples affections from the Jeſuites. <hi>Baronius,</hi> that great and excellent Hiſtorian, and <hi>Bozius</hi> that deadly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to the Soveraignity of Princes, were of the firſt foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Order.</p>
                     <p>I have now done with <hi>Orleans</hi> and the Jeſuits, and muſt prepare for my return to <hi>Paris.</hi> Which journey I begun the 23 of <hi>July,</hi> and ended the day following. We went back the ſame way that we came, though we were not ſo fortunate as to enjoy the ſame company we came in, for in ſtead of the good and acceptable ſociety of one of the <hi>French</hi> Nobles, ſome Gentlemen of <hi>Germany,</hi> and two Fryers of the Order of St. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> we had the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall vexation of four tradeſmen of <hi>Paris,</hi> two <hi>filles de joye,</hi> and an old woman; the Artizans ſo ſlovenly atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55011:104"/>
and greaſie in their apparell, that a moſt modeſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion could have conceived no better of them, then that they had been newly raked out of the ſcullery. One of them by an Inkehorne that hung at his girdle, would have made us believe that he had been a <hi>Notarie;</hi> but by the thread of his diſcourſe, we found out that he was a <hi>Sumner:</hi> ſo full of ribaldrie was it, and ſo rankly did it favour of the <hi>French</hi> bawdie-courts. The reſt of them talked according to their skill, concerning the price of commodities; and who was the moſt likely man of all the City, to be made one of the next years <hi>Eſchevins.</hi> Of the two wenches, one ſo extreamly impudent, that even any immodeſt ear would have abhorred her language, and of ſuch a ſhameleſſe deportment, that her very behaviour would have frighted luſt out of the moſt incontinent man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Since I firſt knew mankinde and the world, I never obſerved ſo much impudence in the generall, as I did then in her particular, and I hope ſhall never be ſo miſerable, as to ſuffer two dayes more the torment and hell of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. In a word, ſhe was a wench born to ſhame all the Fryers with whom ſhe had traficked, for ſhe would not be <hi>caſta,</hi> and could not be <hi>cauta,</hi> and ſo I leave her, a creature extreamly bold, becauſe extreamly faulty. And yet having no good property to redeem both theſe, and other unlovely qualities; but (as Sir <hi>Philip Sydney</hi> ſaid of the Strumpet <hi>Baccha</hi> in the <hi>Arcadia)</hi> a little coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit beauty diſgraced with wandring eyes, and unwayed ſpeeches. The other of the younger females (for as yet I am doubtfull whether I may call any of them women) was of the ſame profeſſion alſo, but not half ſo rampant as her companion.

as <hi>Auſonius</hi> giveth it one of the two wanton ſiſters. By her carriage a charitable ſtranger would have thought her honeſt; and to that favourable opinion had my ſelf been inclinable, if a <hi>French Monſieur</hi> had not given me her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter

at <hi>Orleans:</hi> beſides there was an odd twinkling of her eye, which ſpoyled the compoſedneſſe of her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; otherwiſe ſhe might have paſſed for currant. So that I may ſafely ſay of her, in reſpect of her fellow Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, what <hi>Tacitus</hi> doth of <hi>Pompey,</hi> in reference to <hi>Caeſar, viz. Secretior Pompeius, Caeſare non melior.</hi> They were both equally guilty of the ſin; though this laſt had the more cunning to diſſemble it, and avoid the infamie and cenſure due unto it. And ſo I come to the old woman, which was the laſt of our goodly companions. A woman ſo old, that I am not at this day fully reſolved whether ſhe were ever young or no. 'T was well I had read the Scriptures, otherwiſe I might have been very prone to have thought her one of the firſt pieces of the creation, and that by ſome miſchance or other, ſhe had eſcaped the flood; her face was for all the world like unto that of <hi>Sibylla Erythraea</hi> in an old print, or that of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> two harlots in the painted cloth; you could not at the leaſt but have imagined her one of the Relicks of the firſt age after the building of <hi>Babel;</hi> for her very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion was a confuſion more dreadfull then that of languages. As yet I am uncertain whether the Poem of our arch-poet <hi>Spencer,</hi> entituled, <hi>The Ruines of time,</hi> was not purpoſely intended on her; ſure I am it is very applyable in the title. But I might have ſaved all this labour: <hi>Ovid</hi> in his deſcription of <hi>Fames,</hi> hath moſt exactly given us her portraicture; and out of him, and the eight book of his <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> you may take this view of her.</p>

                        <hi>JUly</hi> the 27. having diſpatched that buſineſſe which brought us into <hi>France,</hi> and ſurveyed as much of the Countrey, as that opportunity would permit, we began our journey towards <hi>England</hi> in a Coach of <hi>Amiens.</hi>

Better accompaned we were then when we came from <hi>Orleans,</hi> for here we had Gentlemen of the choiceſt faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, very ingenious, and in my opinion of finer condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then any I had met withall in all my acquaintance with that Nation. We had no vexation with us in the ſhape of a <hi>French</hi> woman, which appeared unto me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what miraculous, to torment our ears with her diſcourſe, or puniſh our eyes with her complexion. Thus aſſociated we began to jog towards St. <hi>Loup,</hi> where that night we were to be lodged. The Countrey ſuch as already I have deſcribed it in the Iſle of <hi>France,</hi> ſave that beyond St. <hi>Denis</hi> it began to be ſomewhat more hilly. By the way I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved thoſe little croſſets erected in the memorie of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> as being vainly ſuppoſed to be his reſting places, when he ran from <hi>Mont-martre</hi> with his head in his hand, which the zealous madneſſe of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> had thrown down, and were now reedified by King <hi>Lewis.</hi> It could not but call to mind the hate of that Nation unto that harmeleſſe monument of Chriſts ſufferings, the Croſſe; which is grown it ſeemeth ſo exorbitant, that the Papiſts make uſe of it to diſcover an <hi>Hugonot.</hi> I remember as I paſſed by water from <hi>Amiens</hi> to <hi>Abbeville,</hi> we met in the boat with a levie of <hi>French</hi> Gentlewomen; to one of them, with that <hi>French</hi> as I had, I applyed my ſelf, and ſhe perceiving me to be <hi>Engliſh,</hi> queſtioned my Religion. I anſwered (as I ſafely might) that I was a <hi>Catholick:</hi> and ſhe for her better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction proffered me the little croſſe which was on the top of her beads to kiſſe, (and rather ſhould I deſire to kiſſe it then many of their lips) whereupon the reſt of the company gave of me this verdit, that I was <hi>Un urai Chriſtien, &amp; ne point un Hugonot.</hi> But to proceed in our journall. The ſame day we parted from <hi>Paris,</hi> we paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the Town of <hi>Luzarch,</hi> and came to that of St. <hi>Loup.</hi> The firſt famous only in its owner, which is the Count of <hi>Soiſſons.</hi> The ſecond in an Abbey there ſituate built in memory of St. <hi>Lupus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Trios</hi> in <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne.</hi> Theſe Townes paſſed, we were entred into <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardie.</hi>

The higher which is the leſſer, and more Northern part is bounded North and Weſt with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ocean; and on the Eaſt with <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artoys.</hi> The lower, which is the larger, the richer and the more Southern, hath on the Eaſt the little Country of <hi>Veromandys;</hi> on the Weſt <hi>Normandy;</hi> and on the South the Countrey of <hi>Champagne.</hi> In length it comprehendeth all the 51 degree of Latitude, and three parts of the 50; extending from <hi>Calice</hi> in the North, to <hi>Clermont</hi> in the South. In breadth it is of a great inequality. For the higher <hi>Picardie</hi> is like <hi>Linea</hi> amongſt the <hi>Logitians,</hi> which they deſine to be <hi>longitudo ſine latitudine,</hi> it being indeed nothing in a manner, but a meer border. The lower is of a larger breadth, and containeth in it the whole 24 degree of longitude, and a fourth part of the 23; ſo that by the proportion of degrees, this Province is 105 miles long, and 25 broad.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the name of <hi>Pieardie,</hi> it is a difficulty beyond my reading and my conjecture. All I can do is to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the leſſe probable opinions of other writers, and make my ſelf ſubject to that ſcoffe which <hi>Lactantius</hi> beſtoweth on <hi>Ariſtotle, Rectè hic ſuſtulit aliorum diſciplinas, ſed non recte fundavit ſuam.</hi> Some then derive it from <hi>Piquon,</hi> one forſooth of <hi>Alexander</hi> the greats Captains, whom they fain to have built <hi>Amiens</hi> and <hi>Piquigni;</hi> an abſurdity not to be honoured with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutation: ſome from the Town of <hi>Piquigni</hi> it ſelf, of which mind is <hi>Mercator;</hi> but that Town never was of ſuch note as to name a Province: others derive it from <hi>Picardus</hi> a fanaticall Heretick of theſe parts, about the year 1300 and after; but the appellation is far older then the man: others fetch it from the <hi>Picts</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi> whom they would have to flie hither after the diſcomfiture of their Empire and Nation by the <hi>Scots;</hi> a tranſmigration of which all Hiſtories are ſilent: this being the verdict of the beſt Antiquary ever was nurſed up in. <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Picti itaque funeſtiſſimo praelio debellati, aut penit us fuerunt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tincti, aut paulatim in Scotorum nomen &amp; nationem conceſſerint.</hi>

Laſtly, ſome others derive the name from <hi>Pique,</hi> which ſignifieth a Lance or a Pike, the inventors of which warlike weapon, the fathers of this device would fain make them. In like manner ſome of <hi>Germany</hi> have laboured to prove that the <hi>Saxons</hi> had that name given them from the ſhort ſwords which they uſed to wear, called in their language <hi>Scaxon;</hi> but neither truely. For my part I have conſulted <hi>Ptolemie</hi> for all the Nations; and the <hi>Itinerarium</hi> of <hi>Antonius</hi> for all the Towns in this tract, but can find none on which I may faſten any probable Etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie. All therefore that I can ſay, is, that which <hi>Robert</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Auranches</hi> in <hi>Normandy</hi> hath ſaid before me, and that only in the generall, <hi>Quos itaque aetas noſtra Picardos appellat verae Belgae dicendi ſunt: qui poſt modum in Picardorum nomen tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grarunt.</hi>

At this table judgeth alſo <hi>Le grand Maiſtre des eaues et forrests;</hi> we may call him the Juſtice in Eire of all his Majeſties Forreſts and waters. The actions here handled, are Thefts, and abuſes committed in the Kings Forreſts, Rivers, Parks, Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds, and the like. In the abſence of the <hi>grand Maiſtre,</hi> the power of ſentence reſteth in the <hi>Les grand Maiſtres Enqueſteurs, et generaux reformateurs,</hi> who have under their command no fewer then 300 ſubordinate officers.

With us in <hi>England</hi> the Marſhalſhip is more entire, as that which beſides its own ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, hath now incorporated into it ſelf moſt of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, antiently belonging to the Conſtables, which office ended in the death of <hi>Edward</hi> Lord Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the laſt hereditary and proprietary Conſtable of <hi>England.</hi> This office of Conſtable, to note unto you by the way ſo much, was firſt inſtituted by <hi>Lewis</hi> the groſſe, who began his reign, <hi>anno</hi> 1110. and conferred on Mr. <hi>Les Diguieres</hi> on the 24 of <hi>July,</hi> 1622. in the Cathedrall Church of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> where he firſt heard Maſſe, and where he was inſtalled Knight of both Orders.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55011:108"/>
hated by the Proteſtants as an Apoſtata, and ſuſpected by the Papiſts not to be entire.</p>
                     <p>To proceed, <hi>July</hi> the 28. we came unto <hi>Clermont,</hi> the firſt Town of any note that we met with in <hi>Picardie:</hi> a prety neat Town, and finely ſeated on the riſing of an hill. For the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it, it hath on the upper ſide of it, an indifferent large Caſtle, and ſuch which were the ſituation of it ſomewhat hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the ſtrength of Art, might be brought to do good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Towards the Town, it is of an eaſie acceſſe, to the fieldwards more difficult, as being built on the perpendicular fall of a rock. In the year 1615, it was made good by Mr. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancourt</hi> with a Regiment of eight Companies, who kept it in the name of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the reſt of that confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy; but it held not long, for at the Marſhall <hi>D' Ancres</hi> coming before it with his Army, and Artillery, it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently yeelded. This war, which was the ſecond civill war which had happened in the reign of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by the Princes, chiefly to thwart the deſignes of the Queen mother, and cruſh the powerfulneſſe of her grand fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, the Marſhall. The pretence (as in ſuch caſes it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is) was the good of the Common-wealth: the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, the croſſe marriages then conſummated by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall, between the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> for by thoſe marriages they ſeemed to fear the augmentation of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> greatneſſe; the alienation of the affections of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient allies; and by conſequence the ruine of the <hi>French</hi> Empire. But it was not the fate of <hi>D' Anire,</hi> as yet to perſh. Two years more of command and inſolencies, his deſtinies allow'd him, and then he tumbled. This opportunity of his death ending the third civill war, each of which his faulty greatneſſe had occaſioned.</p>
                     <p>What the ambition of his deſignes did tend to, I dare not abſolutely determine; though like enough it is, that they aimed further then at a private, or a perſonall potencie; for having under the favour and countenance of the Queen mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made himſelf maſter of the Kings ear, and of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell; he made a ſhift to get into his own hands an authority almoſt as unlimited, as that of the old <hi>Mayre</hi> of the Palace. For he had ſuppreſſed the liberty of the generall eſtates, and of the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55011:109"/>
ſoveraign Courts; removed all the officers and Counſellors of the laſt King; raviſhed one of the Preſidents of the great Chamber, by name Mr. <hi>le Jay,</hi> out of the Parliament into the priſon, and planted Garriſons of his own in moſt of the good Towns of <hi>Normandy,</hi> of which Province he was Governour. Add to this, that he had cauſed the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> being acknowledged the firſt Prince of the bloud, to be impriſoned in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> and had ſearched into the continuance of the lives of the King and his brother, by the help of Sorcery and Witchcraft. Beſides, he was ſuſpected to have had ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence with ſome forain Princes, ill willers to the State; and had diſgraced ſome and neglected others of the Kings old confederates. Certainly theſe actions ſeem to import ſome project beyond a private and obedient greatneſſe, though I can hardly believe that he durſt be ambitious of the Crown; for being a fellow of a low birth, his heart could not but be too narrow for ſuch an hope, and having no party amongſt the Nobility, and being leſſe gracious with the people, he was altogether deſtitute of means to compaſſe it. I therefore am of an opinion, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> gold had corrupted him to ſome project concerning the enlargement of that Empire, upon the <hi>French</hi> dominion; which the croſſe marriages, whereof he was the contriver, and which ſeemed ſo full of danger to all the beſt Patriots of <hi>France,</hi> may ſeem to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. And again, at that time when he had put the Realm into his third combuſtion, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had an Army on foot againſt the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and another in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of <hi>Cleve</hi> and <hi>Juliers;</hi> which had not the timely fall of this Monſter, and the peace enſuing prevented it, might both perhaps have met together in the midſt of <hi>France.</hi> But this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conjecturall.</p>

                           </gap>aul,</hi> where we were harboured: being from <hi>Clermont 6 French</hi> leagues; and from <hi>Paris</hi> 20. Our entertainment there ſuch as in other places: as ſluttiſh, as inconvenient. The next day being the 29, about ten of the clock, we had a ſight of the goodly City of <hi>Amiens.</hi> A City of ſome four <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles circuit within the wals, which is all the greatneſſe of it: for without the wals it hath houſes few or none. A City very capacious, and for that cauſe hath been many times honoured with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and trains of many great Princes: beſides that once it entertained almoſt an whole Army of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> For King <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11. having made an advantagious peace with our <hi>Edward</hi> 4. and perceiving how ungratefull it was amongſt the military men, he intended alſo to give them ſome manner of ſatisfaction: He ſent therefore unto them 300 carts loaden with the beſt Wines: and ſeeing how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable a preſent that had proved; he intended alſo to feaſt them in <hi>Amiens,</hi> within half a league of which their Camp was lodged. This entertainment laſted four daies,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55011:110"/>
each ſtreet having in it two long tables: and each table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing furniſhed with very plentiful proviſion. Neither were they denied entrance into any of the Taverns, and Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alling houſes, or therein ſtinted either in meats, or drinks; whatſoever was called for, being defrayed by King <hi>Lewis.</hi> An action wherein, if mine opinion might carry it, there was little of the politician. For there were permitted to enter into the Town ſo many at once of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, that had they been but ſo minded, they might eaſily have made themſelves Maſters both of the place, and of the Kings perſon. Nine thouſand are reckoned by <hi>Cumines</hi> to have been within it together, and moſt of them armed: ſo that they might very eaſily have ſurpriſed the Gates, and let in the reſt of the Army. Thoſe of the <hi>French</hi> Kings Counſell much feared it, and therefore enformed both Princes of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the one of his Town, the other of his Honour. But this jealouſie was but a <hi>French</hi> diſtruſt, and might well have been ſpared: the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being of that Generals minde, who ſcorned to ſteal a victory, and of that generous diſpoſition, that they would not betray their credits. <hi>Nunquam illis adei ulla opportuna viſa eſt victoriae occaſio, quam damno penſarent fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des:</hi> as the Hiſtorian of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> If this City then eſcaped a ſack or a ſurpriſal, it cannot be imputed to the wiſdome of the <hi>French,</hi> but to the modeſty and fair dealing of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But this was not the only ſoloeciſm in point of ſtate, committed by that great politick of his time, King <hi>Lewis:</hi> there never being man ſo famed for his brain, that more groſly over-reached himſelf, then that Prince, though perhaps more frequently.</p>
                     <p>The buildings of this Town are of diverſe materials, ſome built of ſtone, others of wood, and ſome again of both. The ſtreets very ſweet and clean, and the air not giving place to any for a lively pureneſs. Of their buildings the principal are their Churches, whereof there are twelve on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in number: Churches I mean parochial, and beſides thoſe belonging to Religious houſes. Next unto them the work of moſt eſpecial note, is a great and large Hoſpital; in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and the diſpoſing of the beds much like unto the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtel Dieu</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> but in number much inferiour; <hi>Et me
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55011:110"/>
tamen rapuerant,</hi> and yet the decency of them did much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light me. The ſweetneſſe and neatneſſe of the Town, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded partly as I ſaid from the air, and partly from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of the River of <hi>Some,</hi> on which it is ſeated. For the river running in one entire bank at the further end of the Town, is there divided into ſix channels, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at an equall diſtance run through the ſeveral parts of it. Thoſe channels thus divided, receive into them all the ordure and filth, with which the Town otherwiſe might be peſter'd: and affordeth the people a plentifull meaſure of water wherewith to purge the lanes, and bie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of it, as often as them liſteth. But this is not all the benefit of theſe Channels: they beſtow upon the City mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alſo of commodity, which is the infinite number of Griſt-mils, that are built upon them. At the other end of the Town the Channels are again united into one ſtream: both thoſe places, as well of the diviſion, as of the union of the Channels being exceeding well fortified with chains and piles, and alſo with bulwarks and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works.</p>
                     <p>Neither is the Town well fortified and ſtrengthned at thoſe paſſages only: the other parts of it having enough of ſtrength to inable them to a long reſiſtance. The ditch round about it, ſave where it meeteth with the Citadell, is exceeding deep, and ſteepie: the wals of a good height, broad, and compoſed of earth and ſtone equally: the one making up the outſide of them, and the other the inſide. The Gates are very large and ſtrong, as well in the finewie compoſition of themſelves, as in the addition of the Draw-bridge. Suburbs this City hath none, becauſe a Town of war: nor any liberal circuit of territory, becauſe a frontier. Yet the people are indifferently wealthy, and have amongſt them good trading; beſides the benefit of the Garriſon, and the Cathedral. The Garriſon conſiſteth of 250 men, (500 in all they ſhould be) who are continually in pay to guard the Citadel, their pay eight Sols daily. The Governor of them is the Duke of <hi>Chaune,</hi> who is alſo the Lieutenant or Deputy Governour of the whole Province under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable: their Captain Mr. <hi>Le Noyre,</hi> ſaid to be a man of good
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55011:111"/>
experience, and worthy his place. This Citadel was built by <hi>Henry</hi> 4. as ſoon as he had recovered the Town from the <hi>Spaniards, anno</hi> 1597. It is ſeated on the lower part of the City, though ſomewhat on the advantage of an hill, and ſeemeth in mine opinion, better ſituate to command the Town, then to defend it; or rather to recover the Town being taken, then to ſave it from taking. They who have ſeen it, and know the arts of fortification, report it to be impregnable.

                     <p>Nor am I able to contradict it. For beſides that it is a skill beyond my profeſſion, we were not permitted to come within it, or to take a ſurvey of it, but at a diſtance. As ſoon as we approached high unto it, one of the Garriſon proffes'd us the Musket: a ſufficient warning not to be too venturous. So that all which I could obſerve was this: that they had within themſelves good plenty of earth to make their Gabions, and repair their breaches. With the ſame jealouſie alſo, are the reſt of the Forts and Towns of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance guarded in this and other Countreys: no people that ever I heard being ſo open in ſhewing their places of ſtrength and ſafety unto ſtrangers, as the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> For a dozen of Ale a foreiner may pace over the curtain of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and meaſure every ſtone and bulwark of it.

                     <p>Beſides theſe ſouldiers which are continually in garriſon for the defence of the Citadell, there are alſo 300 which keep watch every night for the defence of the City.

The wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons which they uſe, are pikes only, and muskets: there being not one piece of Ordinance all about the Town, or on the wals of it.

                     <p>The Vidames then according to their firſt inſtitution were the ſubſtitutes of the greater Biſhops, in matter of ſecular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration: for which cauſe, though they have altered their tenure, they take all of them their denomination from the chieftown of ſome Biſhoprick.

I am not well able to judge, whether this Quire, or the Chappell of King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> be the more exquiſite piece of Architecture; though I am not ignorant that <hi>Leland</hi> calleth that of our King <hi>Miraculum orbis.</hi> I perſwade my ſelf, that a moſt diſcerning eye could find out but little difference between them, and that difference more ſubtile then ſound: for if ſuch perfection may receive the word of <hi>more,</hi> it might be ſaid, that there were more majeſty in this of <hi>Amiens,</hi> and more of lovelineſſe in that of <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> yet ſo that the ones majeſty did exceed in lovelineſſe, and the others lovelineſſe exceed in majeſty.

The front of <hi>Welles</hi> or <hi>Peterborough,</hi> which we ſo much fame in <hi>England,</hi> deſerve not to be named in the ſame myriad of years, with this of <hi>Amiens;</hi> for here have you almoſt all the ſacred ſtories engraven ſo lively, that you would no longer think the ſtory of <hi>Pygmalions</hi> image to be a fable; and indeed at the firſt ſight, you would confidently believe that the hiſtories there preſented were not carved, but acted. To ſay no more of it (for all my abilities will but diſgrace it in the deſcription) that of <hi>Zeuxis</hi> may moſt fitly he inſcribed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, <hi>Inviſurum facilius aliquem, quam imitaturum;</hi> ſo infinitely it is above the ambition of imitation.</p>

The outſide of the Church being admirable, you would have thought that art and treaſure had left nothing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to beſtow within it: yet herein would ſuch thoughts deceive you; for although the beauty of the <hi>Noſtre dames</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Roven</hi> lay moſt without, yet here it ſerveth but as a maske to hide and conceal thoſe moſt admirable graces which are within. As ſoon as entred you will ſuppoſe that the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of it are all of gold; ſuch a luſtre doth it caſt upon the eyes of all thoſe that look upon it. The glory of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, next unto the deſcription of it in the Scriptures, is beſt read in this Church, of which it ſeemeth to have been the pattern. <hi>Jupiters</hi> houſe in heaven deſcribed by the Poets, was never half ſo gorgeous as this on the earth; that therefore which <hi>Ovid</hi> Poetically ſpake concerning that imaginary Palace of the falſe God, we may poſitively verifie of this reall manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the true God.</p>

                     <p>To inſtance in particulars; the partition between the Quire and the body, is ſo overlaid with gold, that the acuteſt ſight could apprehend no other ſubſtance of it; and yet the art of the workman ſo fully expreſſed its power on it, that the coſt was much inferiour to the workmanſhip; ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly was it adorned with excellent Imagery, and what elſe the hand of man could faſhion into portraiture: on the top of it was the Statua of our Lady in the juſt height and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of a woman, all either of gold or gilded; her child in her armes, of the ſame making. She was there expreſſed as ſtanding in a round circle, unto every point of which ſhe darted out rayes and beams of gold; juſt as the Sun doth ſeem to do, when the Painter hath drawn him in his full luſtre. The glaſſe of the Church generally, and particularly that about the Quire, and the Virgins Chappell, is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt of life and beauty, of any that I ever yet ſet eye upon. As much as that of St. <hi>Denis</hi> exceedeth ours at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> ſo much doth this St. <hi>Denis.</hi> But the largeſt meaſure of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in it is that of the Pillars, which though full of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55011:114"/>
majeſty in their height and compaſſe, have yet an ornament added to them, more majeſticall then the majeſty, for upon each of them (there are four ranks of them in all) are faſtned four Tables, which take up their whole circle, every Table being in length two yards or thereabout. In every of theſe, are the pictures of ſundry men and women of the better qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſo exactly limmed, that neither a curious eye could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, nor a cunning hand diſcharge it better. Theſe Tables are the Monuments and Tombs of the Burgers of the City, or of the nobleſt of the Countrey nigh unto it; who in them have cauſed their pictures to be drawn with as great art and ſtate as coſt could procure them, and in a ſubſcription of golden letters, have eternized their names and that act to all ſucceeding poſterity. So that we may juſtly ſay of the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſneſſe of this Church, what the Hiſtorian doth of the Temple of <hi>Delphos, Multa igitur ibi, &amp; opulenta regum populorumque viſuntur munera; quaeque magnificentia ſui, reddentium vota gratam voluntatem manifeſtant.</hi> Neitheir have theſe Sepulchrall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments been of any great ſtanding; the antienteſt of them which I could obſerve having been erected ſince the year 1570. Add to theſe the curious works which the ingraver hath cut in the main wals, and then you perhaps will fall into the ſame extaſie that I did, and pick a quarell with nature and the heavens, that they had not made you all into an eye.</p>
                     <p>In this Church, as in others alſo of this party, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the high Altar in the middeſt of the Quire, there are divers others in the private Cloſſets, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate to the mumbling of their low Maſſes. Of theſe there are in number 24. all of them ſeated between the two outermoſt rankes of pillars and the wals; prety neat places, and it is pity they ſhould be abuſed to ſuch Idolatries. Of three of them I took eſpeciall notice, they being indeed the chiefeſt of the reſt, either for furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or uſe.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of them was that of the Virgin, which was divided from the reſt of the Church by a ſphere made of wood, which reached unto the tops of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.

On the outſide the Planets, Starres and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations were moſt artificially ſet down in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per orbes, with the times of abſolving their ſeverall courſes. On the inſide, thoſe ſpaces were filled up with a pack of Verſes in commendation of our Lady. The Altar there, was for matter and making, the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that ever I yet looked upon; that on the other ſide in the Quire, and over which is the image of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, being more deſpicable then were fit for the credite of a Village. Over this Altar was the Virgins Status, all gilt, and of a full and wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In this Maſſing Closet over the Altar there was hanged a tablet, which by the many lines and ſhadowes drawn in it, ſeemed to repreſent ſome piece of building. Moving my hand towards mine eye in the nature and kind of a Perſpective glaſſe, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it to be the repreſentation of that Church in which I ſtood to ſee it; and it was done with that cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that it would almoſt have perſwaded a man out of himſelf, and made him believe, that he had been in the Church yard. So perfectly did it ſhew the majeſty of the Front, the beauty of the Iles, the number of the Pillars, and the glory of the Quire. A kinde of work, in mine opinion of all others the moſt excellent, and ſuch as would infinitely delight an optick. Had not

ſuch pieces been vulgar to me, it had more affected me; but in the Gallery of Mr. <hi>Crane</hi> of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> once belonging to that humorous Phyſitian Mr. <hi>Butlar;</hi> and in that of Sir <hi>Noel Caron,</hi> late Leiger for the States, at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> I had ſeen divers of them, whereof ſome perfector.</p>
                     <p>The third of theſe Maſſing cloſets was that of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> not ſo gorgeous as the reſt unto the eyes of them that ſaw it, but more uſefull to the ſouls of thoſe, who had a minde to take the benefit of it. For therein hung an indulgence granted by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the fifteenth unto that Church; Dated the 27 of <hi>July, anno</hi> 1622. and of his Popedome the ſecond. The contents of it were an abſolute exemption from the paines and place of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to thoſe, who upon the Feaſt of <hi>Al-ſoules (Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum commemorationis defunctorum,</hi> the brief calleth it) and the <hi>Octaves</hi> of it; would come to pay their devotions and moneyes, in that Temple. Had the extent of it been generall, it would quickly have emptied the Popes Treaſury; and in time have put an end to Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. His Holineſſe therefore did wiſely reſtrain it in his Bull, to the natives of that Dioceſſe. The Author and firſt founder of this granting of Indulgences (if it be lawfull to note ſo much by the way) was Pope <hi>Urban</hi> the ſecond, who began his Popedome <hi>anno</hi> 1088. who conferred them upon all ſuch as would goe unto the warres for the recovering of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> next they began to be conferred on thoſe, who would ſide with the Pope, in his unlawfull warres againſt the Emperours. And faſtly, about the time of <hi>Clement</hi> the fifth (he began his reign <hi>anno</hi> 1306) they began to be merchantable; for to him that gainfull invention of the Church Treaſury, conſiſting of the merits of our Saviour and the Saints is imputed. But I return againe to the Church of <hi>Amiens.</hi>

                     <p>The next place of note that the water conveied us to, was the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Pont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>d' Arme:</hi> a place now ſcarce viſible in the ruines, and belonging to one Mr. <hi>Quercy.</hi> It took name, as they ſay, from a bridge here built for the tranſportation of an Army; but this I cannot juſtifie. Three leagues down the river is the Town of <hi>Abbeville;</hi> a Town conveniently ſeated on the <hi>Some,</hi> which runneth through it. It is of greater circuite within the wals, then the City of <hi>Amiens,</hi> and hath four Pariſh Churches more then it; but is not ſo beautifull, nor ſo populous. For the houſes here are of an older ſtampe, and there is within the Town no ſcarcity of waſt ground. I went round about the wals, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the thinneſs of the houſes, &amp; the largeneſs of the fields, which are of that capacity and extent, that for ought I could apprehend, the Town need never fear to be compelled by famine, if thoſe fields were husbanded to the beſt advantages. The wals are of earth within and ſtone without, of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall breadth, and in ſome places ruinous. A Caſtle it once had, of which there is now ſcarce any thing remaining. In ſtead of which, and in places more convenient, they built out
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:55011:118"/>
three Baſtions, very large and capacious; and ſuch well man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned need not yeeld upon a ſummons. There are alſo a couple of mounts raiſed nigh unto the wall, at that place where the Countrey is moſt plain, upon which good Ordinance would have good command; but at this time there were none upon it. Without the wals it is diverſly ſtrengthned, having in ſome places a deep ditch without water, in ſome a ſhallower ditch but well filled by the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the river, in others only a mooriſh and fennie levell, more dangerous to the enemie, and ſecure to the Town, then either of the reſt, and therefore never guarded by the Souldiers of the Garriſon. But the chief ſtrength of it, is five Companies of <hi>Swiſs,</hi> 100 in a company, proper tall fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in appearance, and ſuch as one would imagine fit for the ſervice. It was my chance to ſee them begin their watch; to which imployment they advanced with ſo good order, and ſuch a ſhew of ſtomach, as if they had not gone to guard a Town, but poſſeſſe one. Their watch was at <hi>Porte de Boyes,</hi> and <hi>Porte St. Valery;</hi> the firſt lying near un-<hi>Heſain</hi> a frontier Town of <hi>Artoys;</hi> the other five leagues on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Sea and Haven of St. <hi>Valery.</hi> From thoſe places moſt danger was feared, and therefore there kept moſt of their Souldiers, and all their Ordinance. Their Captain is named Mr. <hi>Aillè</hi> a <hi>Griſon</hi> by birth, and reported for a good Souldier. Beſides him they have no Military Commander; the Maior of the Town, contrary to the nature of Towns of war, being there in higheſt authority. A priviledge granted unto the Maiors hereof, not long ſince, as a reward due to one of their integrities, who underſtanding that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Town held intelligence with the <hi>Arch-duke;</hi> apprehended him and ſent him to the Court, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his puniſhment. This <hi>Abbeville</hi> (and ſo I leave it, and in it my bevie of <hi>French</hi> laſſes) is ſo called <hi>quaſi Abbatis Villa,</hi> as formerly belonging to the Abbot of it.</p>
                     <p>And yet before I leave this Town, I muſt needs take notice of an Adventure, which might have proved prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to me, if my good fortune had not overcome all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary accidents. My companions had no ſooner landed out of the boat which brought us from <hi>Amiens,</hi> but preſently
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55011:119"/>
they betook themſelves to the Poſt-houſe without the Town, that they might be ready for <hi>Bologne</hi> the next morning. But I who did not think that I was to make ſuch a gollopping journey thorow <hi>France,</hi> as the fooliſh traveller affirmed he had made thorow <hi>Venice,</hi> reſolved to ſatisfie my ſelf in all thoſe particulars which I found capable of note and obſervation. Which having done, and thinking I had ſtill day enough for my curioſities, I betook my ſelf to the <hi>Corps du guard,</hi> where being ſoon known to be a Gentleman of <hi>England,</hi> I eaſily obtained leave to walk round about the works of the Town, and to obſerve the ſituation, ſtrength, and defences of it. But ſo it hapned that before I came to the gate which led towards the Poſt-houſe, I found in newly locked up by the Captain of the watch ſon that night, and thought I might have found paſſage at the next gate, had I haſtned towards it; yet I was ſo taken up with the orderly march of the Guards, being all proper followes and well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that before I came to that gate, it was locked up alſo: which being the two only gates on that ſide of the River, deprived me of all ordinary meane to come that night to my Companions, who were reſolved to be on horſe back the next morning by the break of day. I had now liberty enough to traverſe and conſult the ſtreets, within which I ſeemed to be impriſoned, but could meet none that could informe me how to free my ſelf out of that reſtraint; at laſt I met with and old Burger of a comely preſence, who I thought promiſed better ſatisfaction then the reſt had given me; who being acquainted with my deſire of uniting my ſelf with my companions, and the difficulty which my curioſity had brought upon me, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected me to the houſe of the Provoſt, who, as he told me, had the keeping of a Water gate under one of the Arches of the wall by which the River paſſed thorow the Town, by which I might finde a way out of it, if I could wooe him to make uſe of his priviledge in that point, which he thought hard, if not impoſſible to be effected. Well, to the Provoſts houſe I went, whom I ſound at home, acquainted him that I came with Letters from
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55011:119"/>
the Court of <hi>England,</hi> that I was returning thither with my diſpatches, that my companions being leſſe curious then my ſelf, had preſently betook themſelves to their lodgings without the Town, that it would be a great reproach to me, if I ſhould not be in <hi>England</hi> as ſoon as they, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore humbly did beſeech him (in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

News being brought that the Water Bailiffe was coming forwards, he conducted me into a low Parlor very handſomely furniſhed, where I found a Banquet or Collation provided for me, conſiſting of cold bake-meats, choiſe Marmelets, and moſt excellent Wines, and (which I looked upon as the greater favour) his Wife and Daughters ready for my entertainment. We had ſcarce ended this refreſhment, when the Bailiff brought word that he had made a boat ready to carry me to the Water-gate; whereupon having had the honor to kiſſe the hands of the women, I made accompt to take my leave of the Provoſt alſo, who on the other ſide was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to accompany me to the water ſide, and not to leave me till he ſaw me paſſed thorow the gate (whether out of civility to me, or compliance with the truſt repoſed in him, I determine not) which was done accordingly; one of his ſervants waiting on me till he had brought me to the Inne where I was to lodge.</p>

Out of this gravity no perſwaſion could work them; the dull Jades being grown unſenſible of the ſpur, and to hearten them with wands would in ſhort time have diſforeſted the Country. Now was the Cart of <hi>Dieppe</hi> thought a ſpeedy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance; and thoſe that had the happineſſe of a Waggon were eſteemed too bleſſed, yea though it came with the hazard of the old woman and the wenches. If good nature, or a ſight of their journeyes end, did chance to put any of them into a pace like unto a gallop, we were ſure to have them tire in the middle way, and ſo the remainder of the Stage was to be meaſured by our own feet. Being weary of this trade, I made bold to diſmount the Poſtilion, and aſcended the trunk-horſe, where I ſat in ſuch a magnificent poſture, that the beſt Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier in <hi>Paris</hi> might envie my felicity. Behind me I had a good large Trunk and a Port mantle; before me a bundle of cloaks, a cloak-bag, and a parcell of boots; ſure I was if my ſtirrups could poiſe me equally on both ſides, that I could not likely fall backwards nor forwards.

                     <p>WE are now come to the County of <hi>Boulonnois,</hi> which though a part of <hi>Picardie,</hi> diſdaineth yet to be ſo accounted, but will be reckoned as a County of it ſelf. It comprehendeth in it the Town of <hi>Boulogne, Eſtaples,</hi> and <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Neither is it only a County of it ſelf, but it is in a manner alſo a free County, it being holden
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:55011:121"/>
immediately of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who is, no queſtion, a very gracious Landladie. For when King <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. after the deceaſe of <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> had taken in <hi>Boulogne, anno</hi> 1477. as new Lord of the Town (thus <hi>John de Serres</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it) he did homage without Sword or Spurs, bare-headed and on his knee, before the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> offering unto her Image an heart of maſſie gold, weighing 2000 crowns. He added alſo this, that he and his ſucceſſors Kings after him, ſhould hold the County of <hi>Boulogne</hi> of the ſaid Virgin, and do homage unto her image in the great Church of the higher Town dedicated to her name, paying at every change of a Vaſſall an heart of pure gold of the ſame weight. Since that time, the <hi>Boulonnois</hi> being the Tenants of our Lady, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed a perpetuall exemption from many of thoſe Tributes and Taxes, under which the reſt of <hi>France</hi> is miſerably afflicted. Amongſt others they have been alwayes freed from the Gabell of Salt; by reaſon whereof, and by the goodneſſe of their Paſtures, they have there the beſt butter in all the Kingdome. I ſaid partly by reaſon of their ſalt, becauſe having it at a low rate, they do liberally ſeaſon all their Butter with it; whereas they which buy their Salt at the Kings price, cannot afford it any of that deer commodity: upon this ground it is the cuſtome of theſe of <hi>Boulonnois</hi> to ſend unto their friends of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> a barrell of Butter ſeaſoned according to their faſhion; a preſent no leſſe ordinary and acceptable, then Turkies, Capons, and the like, are from our Countrey Gentlemen to thoſe of <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the Town of <hi>Boulogne,</hi> it is divided into two parts, <hi>La haute Ville,</hi> and <hi>La baſſe Ville,</hi> or the high Town, and the low Town, diſtant one from the other above an hundred paces, and upwards. The high Town is ſeated upon the top of an hill; the low Town upon the declivity of it, and towards the Haven. Or elſe we may divide it into other parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Town, and the City; the Town that towards the water, and the City that which lyeth above it. It was made a City in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> II. <hi>anno</hi> 1553. at which time the City of <hi>Terovenne</hi> was totally ruined by the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, and the Biſhops ſeat was removed hither; the Church
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55011:122"/>
of <hi>Noſtre Dame</hi> being made the Cathedrall. There came along hither, upon the remove of the Biſhop, 20 Canons, which number is here ſtill retained, their revenue being about 1000 Livres yearly. As for the preſent Biſhop, his name is <hi>Pierre d' Armè,</hi> his intrado 2000 Livres, his <hi>Metropolitan</hi> he of <hi>Rhemes.</hi> The Town, or as they call it, the low Town, is bigger then the City, and better built, the ſtreets larger, and the people richer, moſt of the Merchants living in it, becauſe it lyeth upon the Haven.</p>
                     <p>But that which made this low Town moſt pleaſing to me, was a ſolemn proceſſion that paſſed through the ſtreets of it, intending to pacifie Gods anger, and divert the plague, which at that time was in the City. In the firſt front there was carried the Croſſe, and after that the holy or ſanctified Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; next unto it followed all the Prieſts of the Town bare-headed, and in their Surplices, ſinging as they went the Services deſtinate to that occaſion. After them followed the men, and next to them the women of the Town, by two and two, it being ſo ordered by the <hi>Roman Rituall, U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> laici a clericis, foeminae a viris proſequantur ſe paratae.</hi> On the other ſide of the ſtreet went the Brethren <hi>De la Charitè,</hi> every one of them holding in his hand a little triangular Banner, or a Pennon; after them the boyes and wenches. In this method did they meaſure ſolemnly every lane and angle of the Town; the Prieſts ſinging, and ill the people anſwering them in the ſame note. At the Church they began it with prayers, and having viſited all the Town, they returned again thither to end it with the ſame devotion. An action very grave and ſolemn, and ſuch as I could well allow of, were it not only for one prayer which is alwayes ſaid at the time of this performance, and the addition of the Banners. The Prayer is this: <hi>Exaudi nos Deus ſalutaris noſter, &amp; intercedente beata &amp; glorioſa Viigine, &amp; beato Sebaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano Martyre tuo</hi> (this <hi>Sebastian</hi> is their <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> or tutelary Saint againſt the Sickneſſe) <hi>&amp; omnibus Sanctis; populum tuum ab iracundiae tuae terroribus libera, &amp; miſericordiae tuae fac largi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate ſecurum, Amen.</hi> This only excepted, there is nothing in all the liturgie of it, which can be offenſive to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, not idlely ſcrupulous.—Theſe Proceſſions
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:55011:122"/>
were firſt inſtituted by Pope <hi>Stephanus</hi> II. who began his Popedome <hi>anno</hi> 752. the intent of them, as <hi>Platina</hi> reporteth it, <hi>Ad placandam Dei iram.</hi> The firſt place that ever they went to in proceſſion, was the Church of our Lady in the Shambles; or <hi>Ad ſanctam Dei genitricem ad praeſepe,</hi> as the Hiſtoriian calleth them. As for the Letany, which is a principall part of it, it was firſt compiled by <hi>Mamercus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>Daulphine,</hi> in the time of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the firſt, which was 308 years before the time of <hi>Stephanus.</hi> The motive of it, was the often danger to which <hi>France</hi> was ſubject, by reaſon of the frequency of Earth-quakes. Since thoſe beginnings, which were fair and commendable, the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church hath added much to them of magnificence, and ſomewhat of impiety, and proſaneneſſe. As for the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren <hi>De la Charitè,</hi> I could not learn any thing of their originall, but much of their Office; for they are bound to viſit all ſuch as are infected with the Plague, to miniſter unto them all things neceſſary, and if they die, to ſhrowde them and carry them to their graves. Theſe duties they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme very willingly, as being poſſeſſed with this fancie, that they are priviledged from contagion, by virtue of their Order. And to ſay the truth, they are moſt of them old, and ſo leſſe ſubject to it; and indeed ſuch ſapleſſe, thin, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied fellowes, that one would think almoſt no diſeaſe could catch them. Yet hath their prerogative not always held to them; of 33 of them in <hi>Calice,</hi> three only ſurviving the diſeaſe, about four yeers ſince. But were the danger to which themſelves are liable, all the inconveniency of it, I ſhould not much diſallow it. There is a greater miſchief waiteth upon it, and that is, the infecting of others; they immediately after their return from the Peſt houſe, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves with any of their neighbours. A moſt ſpeedy means to ſpread the Peſtilence, where it is once begun; though neither they nor the people will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to it.</p>
                     <p>The City or the high Town, ſtandeth, as we have ſaid, on the top of the hill, environed with deep ditches, a ſtrong wall, and cloſed with a treble gate and two draw-bridges. A little ſmall Town it is, not much above a flights ſhot
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:55011:123"/>
thwart, where it is wideſt; and hath in it but one Church beſides that of <hi>Noſtre Dame,</hi> which is Cathedrall. The ſtreets not many, and thoſe narrow, unleſſe it be in the Market-place, where the <hi>Corpus du Guarde</hi> is kept. What the outworks are, or whether it have any or no, I cannot ſay. Even in this time of League and Peace, their jealouſie will not permit an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man to walke their wals, either within or without the Town. A Caſtle they ſaid that it hath; but ſuch a one as ſerveth more for a dwelling then a Fort. The Garriſon of this Town conſiſteth of five Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, 60 in a Company, which amount in all to 300: their Governour being Mr. <hi>D' Aumont,</hi> ſon to the Marſhall <hi>D' Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont;</hi> who ſo faithfully adhered to <hi>Henry</hi> IV. in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his troubles. The cauſe why this Town being ſo ſmall, is ſo ſtrongly Garriſoned; is the ſafe keeping of the Haven which is under it, and the command of the paſſage from the Haven up into the Countrey. The firſt of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices it can hardly performe, without much injury to the low Town, which ſtandeth between them: but for the ready diſcharge of the laſt, it is daintily ſeated, for though to ſpare the low Town, they ſhould permit an enemie to land; yet as ſoon as he is in his march up into the higher Countrey, their Ordinance will tear him into pieces.</p>
                     <p>But for the immediate ſecurity of the Haven, their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors did uſe to fortifie the old Tower, ſtanding on the top of the hill, called <hi>La tour d'ordre.</hi> It is ſaid to have been built by <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> at the time of his ſecond expedition into <hi>Britaine;</hi> this Haven being then named <hi>Portus Geſſoriacus.</hi> This Tower which we now ſee, ſeemeth to be but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of a greater work; and by the height and ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, one would gueſſe it to have been the <hi>Keepe</hi> or <hi>Watch-tower</hi> unto the reſt. It is built of rude and vulgar ſtone, but ſtrongly cemented together, the figure of it is ſix ſquare, every ſquare of it being nine paces in length. A compaſſe too little for a Fortreſſe, and therefore it is long ſince it was put to that uſe; it now ſerving only as a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke by day, and a <hi>Pharos</hi> by night; <hi>Ubi aecenſae noctu faces navigantium curſum dirigunt.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> man calleth it, <hi>The old
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:55011:123"/>
man of Boulogne,</hi> and not improperly, for it hath all the ſignes of age upon it. The Sea by undermining it, hath taken from it all the earth about two ſquares of the bottom of it; the ſtones begin to drop out from the top, and upon the leaſt riſing of the wind, you would think it were troubled with the Palſie. In a word, two hard Winters, ſeconded with a violent tempeſt, maketh it rubbiſh; what therefore is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of preſent ſtrength to the Haven in this ruine of a Tower, the wiſdome of this age hath made good in the Garriſon. And here me thinks I might juſtly accuſe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politick thrift of our former Kings of <hi>England</hi> in not laying out ſome money upon the ſtrength and ſafety of our Haven Towns: not one of them, <hi>Porteſm uth</hi> only excepted, being Garriſoned. True it is, that <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. did erect Block-houſes in many of them; but what bables they are, and how unable to reſiſt a Fleet royally appointed, is known to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one. I know, indeed, we were ſufficiently garriſoned by our Navy, could it either keep a watch on all particular places, or had it not ſometimes occaſion to be abſent I hope our Kings are not of <hi>Darius</hi> mind in the ſtory, <hi>Qui glorioſius ratus eſt hoſtem repellere quam non admittere;</hi> neither will I take upon me, to give counſell; only I could wiſh that we were not inferior to our neighbours, in the greatneſſe of our care; ſince we are equall to the beſt of them in the goodneſſe of our Countrey.</p>
                     <p>But though the old man was too old to performe this ſervice, or to contribute any thing toward the defence of the Town and Haven, yet I conceived my ſelf obliged to give him a viſite; partly out of the reverent eſteem which I had of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> but principally that I might from thence take a full view of my deareſt <hi>England,</hi> from which for want of winde and Company, I was then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained. With theſe deſires I made a boy of the Inne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, who told me that there was no way but by the Peſt-houſes from the Town to the Tower, and that if we were noted to walke that way, we ſhould both be preſently ſhut up as infected perſons, or committed to the cuſtody of the <hi>Brethren of Charity,</hi> the worſt condition
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55011:124"/>
of the two. But finding the impatiencie of my deſires not ſo eaſily ſatisfied, and the temptation of a <hi>Quart d' eſcue,</hi> not to be reſiſted; he told me that if I would venture to climb up the Rocks, as he and other boyes of the Town uſed to do ſometimes, he would undertake to bring me thither. This offer I readily accepted, and as ſoon as the tide was low enough for us, we began our walke upon the <hi>Beach</hi> till we came to the bottom of the Rocks where the old man dwelt, and preſently we began to mount, as if we meant to take the Fortreſſe by Scalado. I found the way more troubleſome and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous then I had conceived, and my ſelf before I came halfe way towards the top, which ſeemed ſtill to be farther of then it was at the firſt, ſo vexed and bruiſed, that I began to be amazed at my own fool-hardineſſe, and was many times in a minde to deſcend again; and queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe I had done accordingly, if a reſolution of not giving over any enterpriſe which I was engaged in, and a fear leaſt the boy would laugh at me when we came to the Town, had not puſhed me on. Having breathed our ſelves a while, we advanced again. The old <hi>cripple</hi> who is fabled to have ſtolen <hi>Pauls</hi> weather-cock, uſed not more pains and cunning in climbing to the top of that lofty ſteeple, then we in mounting to the top of theſe mighty Rocks; which when we had attained at laſt, me thought I was much of the ſame humor with old <hi>Tom</hi> of <hi>Odcombe</hi> on the top of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> of whom the Poet hath informed us:</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>That to the top at laſt being got,</l>
                        <l>With very much adoe god wot;</l>
                        <l>He eagerly deſired,</l>
                        <l>That mighty <hi>Jove</hi> would take the pains</l>
                        <l>To daſh out their unworthy brains,</l>
                        <l>Who offered to be tired.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>No ſooner had my eyes got above the height of the Cliffes, but the firſt ſight I met with was a row of Peſt-houſes
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55011:124"/>
not far diſtant, and ſome old women drying the inſected cloathes on a bank adjoyning; the ſight whereof had almoſt made me recoil backward with more haſt then ſpeed. But having overcome the danger of that apprehenſion, I firſt ſaluted the old man, taking full no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his great ſtature, old age, and many infirmities. That done, I turned my face toward <hi>England,</hi> which afforded me a moſt pleaſing object; the courſe thereof lying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my view at ſo great a length, that one might eaſily diſcerne from <hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle Eaſtward, to the Weſt of <hi>Suſſex:</hi> an object of ſo rich contentment and ſo full of raviſhing contemplations, that I was almoſt of his mind who ſaid <hi>Bonum eſt nobis eſſe hic;</hi> and certainly I had dwelt there longer, if the boy had not put me in mind that the flood was coming back amain (as indeed it was) and that if we made not ſpeed to recover the Town before it was got near the foot of the Rocks, we muſt of neceſſity be fain to abide there the greateſt part of the night till the ebb enſuing. On this advertiſement; there was no need to bid me haſten: but then a new humor ſeized upon me, when I beheld thoſe dreadfull precipices, which I was to deſcend, together with the infinite diſtance of the Beach from the top of the Rocks; the danger of being ſhut up by the ſea, if we made not haſt, and of tumbling into it if we did. But as curioſity had carryed me up, ſo neceſſity brought me down again, with greater ſafety, I confeſſe, then I had deſerved. This adventure being like ſome of thoſe actions of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, whereof <hi>Curtius</hi> telleth us that they were, <hi>magis ad temeritatis quam ad gloriae famam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Town of <hi>Boulogne,</hi> and the Countrey about it, was taken by <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. of <hi>England, anno</hi> 1545. himſelf being in perſon at the ſiege; a very coſtly and charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able victory. The whole liſt of his Forces did amount to 44000 Foot, and 3000 Horſe; Field pieces he drew after him above 100 beſides thoſe of ſmaller making: and for the conveyance of their Ordinance, Baggage and other proviſion, there were tranſported into the Continent,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55011:125"/>
above 25000 horſes. True it is, that his deſignes had a further aime, had not <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor, with whm he was to joyne, left the field and made peace without him. So that, judging only by the ſucceſſe of the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we cannot but ſay, that the winning of <hi>Boulon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois</hi> was a deer purchaſe. And indeed in this one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> in the Preface to his moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Hiſtory ſaith not amiſſe of him; namely, <hi>That in his vain and fruitleſſe expeditions abroad, he conſumed more treaſure, then all the reſt of our Victorious Kings before him did in their ſeverall Conqueſts.</hi> The other part of his cenſure concerning that Prince, I know not well what to think of, as meerly compoſed of gall and bitterneſſe. Onely I cannot but much marvell, that a man of his wiſdome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed from almoſt nothing by the daughter, could be ſo ſeverely invective againſt the Father; certainly a moſt charitable Judge cannot but condemne him of want of true affection and duty to his Queen: ſeeing that it is as his late Majeſty hath excellently noted in his <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>Preſently after this taking of <hi>Boulogne,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain endevoured their gaining of it, even during the life of the Conquerour; but he was ſtrong enough to keep his gettings. After his death, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being engaged in a war againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Ket</hi> having raiſed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in <hi>Norfolke,</hi> they began to hope a Conqueſt of it, and that more violently then ever. Upon news of their preparations, an Embaſſador was diſpatched to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, to deſire ſuccor of him, and to lay before him the infancy and ſeverall neceſſities of the young King, who was then about the age of ten years. This deſire when the Emperour had refuſed to hearken to, they beſought him, that he would at the leaſt be pleaſed to take into his hands and keeping, the Town
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55011:125"/>
of <hi>Boulogne;</hi> and that for no longer time, then untill King <hi>Edward</hi> could make an end of the troubles of his Subjects at home. An eaſie requeſt. Yet did he not only deny to ſatisfie the King in this, except he would reſtore the Catholick religion; but he alſo expreſly commanded that neither his men or munition, ſhould go to the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> An ingratitude, for which I cannot finde a fitting epithite; confidering what faſt friends the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had alwayes been to the united houſes of <hi>Burgundie</hi> and <hi>Auſtria;</hi> what moneys they have helped them with, and what ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Warres they have made for them, both in <hi>Belgium</hi> to maintain their Authority, and in <hi>France</hi> to augment their potencie.</p>
                     <p>From the marriage of <hi>Maximilian</hi> of the family of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> with the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the yeere 1478. unto the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, which fell in the yeere 1548. are juſt 70 yeeres. In which time only it is thought by men of knowledge and experience, that it coſt the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> at the leaſt ſix millions of pounds, in the meer quarrels and defence of the Princes of thoſe houſes. An expence, which might ſeem to have earned a greater requitall, then that now demanded. Upon this deniall of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull Emperour, a Treaty followed betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> The effect of it was, that <hi>Boulogne,</hi> and all the Countrey of it ſhould be reſtored to the <hi>French,</hi> they paying unto the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> at two dayes of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 800000 Crownes. Other Articles there were, but this the principall. And ſo the fortune of young <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> in his beginning, was like that of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> towards his end, <hi>Dum clementiam, quam praeſtiterat, expectat, inca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I am now at the point of leaving <hi>Boulogne,</hi> but muſt firſt reckon with mine Hoſt, to whom we were growne into arrears ſince our firſt coming thither. Our ſtock was grown ſo low, when we came from <hi>Paris,</hi> that had not a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman whom we met at <hi>Amiens</hi> disburſed
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55011:126"/>
for us, it would not have brought us to this Town, ſo that our Hoſt was fain to furniſh us with ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to make even with him. After which ſtaying there from Sunday noon to Wedneſday morning, and being then fain to make uſe of his credit alſo to provide of a Boat for <hi>England</hi> (which alone ſtood us in three pound) our engagements grew greater then he had any juſt reaſon to adventure on us. But being an ingenuous man, and ſeeing that we fared well, ſpent freely, and for the moſt part entertained him and his family at our table, he was the leſſe diffident of payment, as he told me after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Having ſtayed three dayes for Company, and none appearing, we were fain to hire a boat expreſſe for my companion and my ſelf to paſſe over in. In order whereunto, I told him of our preſent condition, aſſured him that we had friends in <hi>Dover</hi> who would ſupply us with all things neceſſary (as indeed we had) that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſummed up what we owed him, and what he had contracted for our paſſage over, he ſhould have a note under our hands for the payment of it, and that one of us ſhould remain priſoner in the Boat till the other raiſed money to redeem him. To which he anſwered, that we had carryed our ſelves like Gentlemen, which gave him no diſtruſt of a reall payment; that he would take if we pleaſed a Bill of our hands for the money to be paid in <hi>Dover;</hi> and deſired that we would give him leave to ſend over a ſervant in our Boat with a basket of poultery, who ſhould receive the money of us and give back our Bond. This being agreed upon, the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning we took boat for <hi>England,</hi> the Mariners knowing nothing elſe, but that the ſervant went over only to ſell his Poultery (that being an opportunity frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged by them unto thoſe of the Town) though we knew well enough he went on another errand; and as we could not but commend my Hoſt for his courteſie and his care taken of our credit, ſo we had reaſon to eſteem our ſelves in a kinde of cuſtody in that he would not let us ſtir without a Keeper. Nor did my Hoſt loſe any thing by his kindneſſe to us. For we not only paid him
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55011:126"/>
honeſtly all his full demands, but beſtowed a reward upon his ſervant and ſent a preſent of Gloves and Knives (commodities much prized in <hi>France)</hi> to his Wife and Daughters; that he might ſee we knew as well how to require as receive a curteſie.

For perſon he is of the middle ſtature, and rather well proportioned then large, his face knoweth little yet of a beard, but that which is black and ſwarty, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion alſo much of the ſame hew, carrying in it a certain boiſterouſneſſe, and that in a farther meaſure then what a gracefull majeſty can admit of, ſo that one can hardly ſay of him, without a ſpite of Courtſhip, which <hi>Paterculus</hi> did of <hi>Tiberius, Quod viſus praetulerit principem,</hi> that his countenance proclaimed him a King. But queſtionleſſe his greateſt defect is want of utterance, which is very unpleaſing, by reaſon of a deſperate and uncurable ſtammering; which defect is likely more and more to grow upon him. At this time he is aged 24 years and as much as ſince the 27 day of laſt <hi>September,</hi> which was his birth day; an age which he beareth not very plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fible; want of beard, and the ſwarthineſſe of his complexion, making him ſeem older. At the age of 11 years he was affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anced to the Lady <hi>Anna</hi> Infanta of <hi>Spain,</hi> by whom as yec he hath no children.

ſo much of her Kinſwoman, as to permit this ſon of hers to ſpend his time alſo amongſt his play-fellowes and the birds, that ſhe may the more ſecurely manage the State at her diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

the Goſpel; in particular we may make uſe of it in expreſſing the State of the Church and Religions of <hi>France:</hi> for certain it is, that here were divers pangs in the womb of the <hi>French</hi> Church before it was delivered. And firſt ſhe was delivered of <hi>Eſau,</hi> the <hi>Popiſh</hi> faith being firſt after the ſtrugling coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by authority; <hi>And he came out red all over like an hairy garment,</hi> ſaith the text, which very appoſitely expreſſeth the bloudy and rough condition of the <hi>French</hi> Papiſts at the birth of the Reformation, before experience and long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance had bred a liking between them. <hi>And after came his Brother out, which laid hold on Eſaus heel, and his name was called Jacob;</hi> wherein is deſcribed the quality of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant party, which though confirmed by publick Edict af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the other, yet hath it divers times endevoured, and will perhaps one day effect, the tripping up of the others heels. <hi>And Eſau</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes) was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob a plain man, dwelling in tents:</hi> in which words the compariſon is made exact. <hi>A cunning hunter,</hi> in the Scripture ſignifieth, <hi>a man of art and power mingled;</hi> as when <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>For the better government therefore of a charge ſo weighty, they have appointed him a Coadjutor to diſcharge that great function till he come to age to take orders. His name is <hi>Gifford</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> fugitive, ſaid to be a man worthy of a great fortune, and able to bear it. The revenues of this Archbiſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick are ſomewhat of the meaneſt, not amounting yearly to above 10000 Crowns, whereof Dr. <hi>Gifford</hi> receiveth only 2000, the remainder going to the <hi>Caidet</hi> of <hi>Lorreine.</hi> This trick the <hi>French</hi> learn of the Proteſtants in <hi>Germany,</hi> where the Princes after the Reformation began by <hi>Luther,</hi> took in the power and Lordſhips of the Biſhops, which together with their functions, they divided into two parts. The lands they beſtowed upon ſome of their younger ſons or kinſmen, with the title of <hi>Adminiſtrator;</hi> the office and pains of it they conferred with ſome annuall penſion, on one of their Chaplaines, whom they ſtyled the <hi>Superintendent</hi> of the Biſhoprick. This Archbiſhop together with the reſt of the Biſhops have under them their ſeverall Chancellours, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries, Archdeacons, and other officers attending in their Courts; in which their power is not ſo generall as with us in <hi>England.</hi> Matters of teſtament never trouble them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Court of Parliament; who alſo have wreſted to their own hands almoſt all the buſineſſe of importance; ſure I am, all the cauſes of profit originally belonging to the Church, the affairs meerly Epiſcopall and ſpirituall are left unto them, as granting Licence for Marriages, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing whoredome by way of penance and the like; to go beyond this were <hi>ultra crepidam,</hi> and they ſhould be ſure
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:55011:134"/>
to have a <hi>prohibition</hi> from the Parliaments. Of their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the chiefeſt of the Clergy / men is, the little or no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon the Pope, and the little profits they pay unto their King; of the Pope anon; to the King they pay only their Diſmes, or Tithes according to the old rate; a ſmall ſum if compared unto the payments of their neighbours; it being thought that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> receiveth yearly one half of the living of the Churches; but this I mean of their livings only, for otherwiſe they pay the uſuall gabels and cuſtomes, that are paid by the reſt of the Kings liege people. In the generall aſſembly of the three Eſtates the Clergy hath authority to elect a ſet number of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, to undertake for them and the Church; which Commiſſioners do make up the firſt of the three Eſtates, and do firſt exhibit their grievances and Petitions to the King. In a word, the <hi>French</hi> Church is the freeſt of any in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, that have not yet quitted their ſubjection to the Pope, as alwayes proteſting againſt the Inquiſitions, not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting themſelves to the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and paying very little to his Holineſſe, of the plentifull revenue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God and good men have bleſſed it.</p>
                     <p>The number of thoſe which the Church Land maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in <hi>France</hi> is <hi>tantum non</hi> infinite, therefore the Intrado and Revenue of it muſt needs be uncountable. There are numbred in it, as we ſaid before, 12 Archbiſhops, 104 Biſhopricks; to theſe add 540 Archpriories, 1450 Abbies, 12320 Priories, 567 Nunneries, 700 Convents of Fryers, 259 Commendames of the order of <hi>Malta,</hi> and 130000 Pariſh Prieſts. Yet this is not all, this reckoning was made in the year 1598. Since which time the Jeſuits have divers Colledges founded for them, and they are known to be none of the pooreſt. To maintain this large wilderneſſe of men, the Statiſtes of <hi>France,</hi> who have proportioned the Countrey; do allow unto the Clergy almoſt a fourth part of the whole. For ſuppoſing <hi>France</hi> to contain 200 milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Arpens (a meaſure ſomewhat bigger then our Acre) they have allotted to the Church for its temporall revenue, 47 of them. In particular of the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Abbots and Pariſh Prieſts, they of <hi>Aux, Alby, Cluniac</hi> and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:55011:135"/>
St. <hi>Eſtiennes</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> are ſaid to be the wealthyeſt; the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Aux</hi> in <hi>Gaſcoine</hi> is valued at 400000 Livres or 40000 <hi>l. Engliſh</hi> yearly. The Biſhop of <hi>Alby</hi> in <hi>Lanquedoc,</hi> is prized at 10000 Florens, which is a fourth part of it; a great part of this revenue riſing out of Saffron. The Abbot of <hi>Cluniac</hi> in the Dutchie of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> is ſaid to be worth 50000 Crowns yearly; the preſent Abbot being <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lorreine,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Rheimes,</hi> and Abbot of St. <hi>Dennis.</hi> The Pariſh Prieſt of St. <hi>Eſtiennes,</hi> is judged to receive yearly no ſewer then 8000 Crowns, a good Intrado. As for the vulgar Clergy they have little Tit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e and leſſe Glebe, moſt part of the revenue being appropriated unto <hi>Abbeys</hi> and other Religious houſes; the greateſt part of their means is the <hi>Baiſſe-maine,</hi> which is the Church-offerings of the people at Chriſtnings, Marriages, Burials, Dirges, Indulgences, and the like; which is thought to amount to almoſt as much as the temporall eſtate of the Church, an income able to maintain them in good abundance, were it not for the greatneſſe of their number; for reckoning that there are (as we have ſaid) in <hi>France</hi> 130000 Periſh Prieſts, and that there are only 27400 Pariſhes; it muſt of neceſſity be, that every Pariſhone with another muſt have more then four Prieſts; too many to be rich.</p>

In performing which buſineſſe, the principall thing of which he ſpake was to this purpoſe; That whereas his Majeſty was bound to give them fathers, he gave them children; that the name of Abbot ſignifieth a Father; and the function of a Biſhop is full of fatherly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: that <hi>France</hi> notwithſtanding was now filled with Biſhops and Abbots, which are yet in their Nurſes armes, or elſe under their Regents in Colledges; nay more, that the abuſe goeth before their being; Children being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly deſigned to Biſhopricks and Abba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He made alſo another complaint, that the Soveraign Courts by their decrees, had attempted upon the authority which was committed to the Clergy, even in that which meerly concerned Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline and government of the Church. To theſe complaints he gave them, indeed, a very gracious hearing, but it was no further then an hearing, being never followed by redreſſe. The Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment knew too well the ſtrength of their own authority, and the King was loath to take from himſelf thoſe excellent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of binding to himſelf his Nobility, by the ſpeedy preferring of their children; and ſo the clergie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> departed with a great deal of envy, and a little ſatisfaction.

Neither did the Kings of <hi>France</hi> forget to maintain their own authority. And therefore when as Pope <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> VIII. had in a peremptory Letter, written to <hi>Philip le Bell</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> ſtyled himſelf <hi>Dominus totius mundi tam in temporalibus quam in ſpiritualibus:</hi> the King returned him an anſwer with an Epithite ſutable to his arrogancy, <hi>Sciat maxima tua fatuitas nos in temporalibus alicui non ſubeſſe,</hi> &amp;c. The like anſwer, though in modeſter termes, was ſent to another of the Popes, by St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> a man of a moſt milde and ſweet diſpoſition, yet unwilling to forgoe his royalties.</p>
                     <p>His ſpirituall power is alwayes as little in ſubſtance, though more in ſhew; for whereas the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> hath been an eſpeciall authorizer of the Popes ſpirituall ſupremacy; the <hi>French</hi> Church would never receive it. By this means the Biſhops keep in their hands, their own full authority; whereof an obedience to the decrees of that Councell would deprive them. It was truely ſaid by St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> and they well knew it, <hi>Lib. 7. Epiſt. 70.

To look upon higher times, when the Councell of <hi>Conſtance</hi> had ſubmitted the authority of the Pope unto that of a Councell; <hi>John Gerſon, Theologus Pariſienſis magni nominis,</hi> as one calleth him, defended that decree: and intituleth them, <hi>

But the principall thing in which it behoveth them not to acknowledge his ſpirituall Supremacy, is the collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Benefices and Biſhopricks, and the Annats and firſt fruits thence ariſing. The firſt and greateſt contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie between the Pope and Princes of Chriſtendome, was about the beſtowing the livings of the Church, and giving the inveſture unto Biſhops; the Popes had long thirſted after that authority, as being a great means to advance their followers, and eſtabliſh their own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for which cauſe in divers petty Councels, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of any Eccleſiaſticall preferment of a Lay man was enacted to be <hi>Simony.</hi> But this did little edifie with ſuch patrons as had good livings.

The Popes having with much violence and oppoſition wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted into their hands, this priviledge of nominating Prieſts and inveſting Biſhops, they ſpared not to lay on what taxes they pleaſed; as on the Benefices, firſt fruits, penſions, ſubſidies, fifteenths, tenths; and on the Biſhopricks for palles, miters, croſiers, rings, and I know not what bables. By theſe means the Churches were ſo impoveriſhed, that upon complaint made to the Councell of <hi>Baſil,</hi> all theſe cheating tricks, theſe <hi>aucupia &amp; expilandi rationes,</hi> were aboliſhed. This decree was called <hi>Pragmatica functio,</hi> and was confirmed in <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Charles</hi> VII. <hi>anno</hi> 1438. An act of ſingular improvement to the Church and Kingdome of <hi>France;</hi> which yearly before, as the Court of Parliament manifeſted to <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. had drained the State of a million of Crowns; ſince which time the Kings of <hi>France</hi> have ſometimes omitted the rigor of this ſanction, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo exacted it, according as their affairs with the Pope ſtood; for which cauſe it was called <hi>Froenum pontificum.</hi> At laſt King <hi>Francis</hi> I. having conquered <hi>Millaine,</hi> fell into this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition with his Holineſſe; namely, that upon the falling of any Abbacy or Biſhoprick, the King ſhould have 6 months time allowed him to preſent a fit man unto him, whom the Pope ſhould legally inveſt. If the King neglected his time li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, the Pope might take the benefit of the relapſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute whom he pleaſed. So is it alſo with the inferior Benefices, between the Pope and the Patrons; inſomuch that any or every Lay-patron, and Biſhop together in <hi>England,</hi> hath for ought I ſee (at the leaſt in this particular) as great a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Supremacy, as the Pope in <hi>France.</hi>

                     <p>Nay to proceed further, and ſhew how meerly titular both his ſupremacies are, as well the ſpirituall as the temporall, you may plainly ſee in the caſe of the Jeſuites, which was thus: In the year 1609 the Jeſuites had obtained of King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. licence to read again in their Colledges of <hi>Paris;</hi> but when their Letters patents came to be verified in the Court of Parliament, the Rector and Univerſity oppoſed them, on the 17 of <hi>December,</hi> 1611. both parties came to have an hearing, and the Univerſity got the day, unleſſe the Jeſuites would ſubſcribe unto theſe four points. <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. That a Councell was above the Pope.</p>

                        <pb n="225" facs="tcp:55011:137"/>
2. That the Pope had no temporall power over Kings, and could not by Excommunication deprive them of their Realm and Eſtates.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That Clergy men having heard of any attempt or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt the King or his Realm, or any matter of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in confeſſion, he was bound to reveal it.</p>
                     <p>And 4. That Clergy men were ſubject to the ſecular Prince or politick Magiſtrate. It appeared by our former diſcourſe, what little or no power they had left the Pope over the Eſtates and preferments of the <hi>French.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By theſe Propoſitions (to which the Jeſuites in the end ſubſcribed, I know not with what mentall reſervation) it is more then evident, that they have left him no command neither over their conſciences, nor their perſons; ſo that all things conſidered, we may juſtly ſay of the Papall power in <hi>France,</hi> what the Papiſts ſaid falſly of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> namely that it is <hi>Nomen ſine rebus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In one thing only his authority here is intire, which is his immediate protection of all the orders of Fryers, and alſo a ſuperintendency or ſupreme eye over the Monks, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge very ſmall obedience, if any at all, to the <hi>French</hi> Biſhops: for though at the beginning every part and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Dioceſſe, was directly under the care and command of the Biſhop; yet it ſo happened that at the building of Monaſteries in the Weſtern Church, the Abbots being men of good parts and a ſincere life, grew much into the envie of their Dioceſan. For this cauſe, as alſo to be more at their own command, they made ſuit to the Pope that they might be free from that ſubjection, <hi>Utque in tutelam divi Petri admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terentur;</hi> a propoſition very plauſible to his Holineſſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, which by this means might the ſooner be raiſed to its height; and therefore without difficulty granted. This gap opened, firſt the ſeverall orders of Fryers; and after even the Deans and Chapters, purchaſed to themſelves the like exemptions. In this the Popes power was wonderfully ſtrengthned, as having ſuch able, and ſo main props to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his authority; it being a true Maxime in State, <hi>Quod qui privilegia obtinent; ad eadem conſervanda tenentur authoritatem concedentis tueri.</hi> This continued till the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi>

unqueſtioned. Where the Biſhops much complained of their want of authority, and imputed all the Schiſmes and Vices in the Church, unto this, that their hands were tyed; hereupon the Popes Legats thought it fit to reſtore their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, their Deans and Chapters.

                     <p>To proceed a little further in the Allegory, ſo it is that when <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw <hi>Eſau</hi> to have incurred his fathers and mothers anger, for his heatheniſh marriage, he ſet himſelf to bereave his elder brother of his bleſſing. Prayers, and the ſweet ſmell of his Veniſon, the ſweet ſmelling of his ſacrifices, obtained of his Lord and Father a bleſſing for him: for indeed the Lord hath given unto this his <hi>French Jacob,</hi> as it is in the text, <hi>the dew of heaven, and the fatneſſe of the earth, and plenty of corne and wine, Gen.</hi> 27. 28. It followeth in the 41. <hi>verſ.</hi> of the <hi>Chapter. And Eſau hated Jaeob, becauſe of the bleſſing wherewith his father had bleſſed him; and Eſau ſaid in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at band, then will I ſlay my brother Jacob.</hi> The event of which his bloudy reſolution was, that <hi>Jacob</hi> was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ain to relinquiſh all that he had, and flie unto his Uncle. This laſt part of the ſtory, expreſſeth very much of the preſent eſtate of the <hi>French</hi> Church. The Papiſts hated the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants to ſee them thrive and increaſe ſo much amongſt them. This hatred moved them to a war, by which they hoped to root them out altogether; and this war com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the Proteſtants to abandon their good Towns, their ſtrong holds, and all their poſſeſſions, and to flie to their friends whereſoever they could finde them. And indeed, the preſent eſtate of the Proteſtants is not much better then that of <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Meſopot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ia,</hi> nor much different. The bleſſing which they expect lyeth more in the ſeed then the harveſt. For their ſtrength it conſiſteth principally in their prayers to God: and ſecondly, in their obedience to their Kings. Within theſe two fortreſſes, if they can keep themſelves, they need fear none ill; becauſe they ſhall deſerve none. The only outward ſtrengths they have left them, are the two Towns of <hi>Montaban</hi> and <hi>Rochell,</hi> the one deemed invincible, the other threatned a ſpeedy deſtruction. The Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> (at my being there) lay round about it, and it was ſaid, that the Town was in very bad terms: all the neighbouring Towns, to whoſe oppoſition they much truſted, having yeelded at the firſt fight of the Canon. <hi>Rochell,</hi> it is thought, cannot be forced
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:55011:142"/>
by aſſault, nor compelled by a famine. Some Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants are glad of, and hope to ſee the <hi>French</hi> Church reſtored to its former powerfulneſſe, by the reſiſtance of that Town meerly. I rather think, that the perverſe and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born condition of it, will at laſt, drive the young King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fury, and incite him to revenge their contradiction, on their innocent friends, now diſarmed and diſabled. Then will they ſee at laſt the iſſue of their own peremptory reſolutions, and begin to believe, that the Heathen Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian was of the two the better Chriſtian, when he gave us this note, <hi>Non turpe eſt ab eo vinci, quem vincere eſſet nefas, neque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

In the opinion of this their potency, they call Aſſemblies, Parliaments as it were, when and as often as they pleaſed.

they notwithſtanding would not ſeparate themſelves, but ſtood ſtill upon terms of capitulation, and the juſtifiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their action again. Whereas it hapned, that the Lord of <hi>Privas,</hi> a Town full of thoſe of the Religion, dyed in the year 1620<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and left his daughter and heir in the bed and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Viſcount of <hi>Cheylane,</hi> a <hi>Catholick:</hi> this new Lord according to law and right, in his own Town changed the former Garriſon, putting his own ſervants and dependants in their places. Upon this the Proteſtants of the Town and Countrey round about it, draw themſelves in troops, ſurpriſe many of the Towns about it, and at laſt compelled the young Gentleman to flie from his inheritance; an action, which jumping even with the time of the Aſſembly at <hi>Rochell,</hi> made the King more doubtfull of their ſincerity. I could add to theſe divers others of their undutifull practiſes, being the effects of too much felicitie, and of a fortune which they could not govern.

                     <p>Theſe their inſolencies and unruly acts of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, made the King and his Counſell ſuſpect, that their deſignes tended further then Religion, and that their purpoſe might be to make themſelves a free State, after the example of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and the Low-countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The late power which they had taken of calling their own Synods and Convocations, was a ſtrong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of their purpoſe; ſo alſo was the intelligence which they held with thoſe of their own faith. At the Synod of <hi>Gappe,</hi> called by the permiſſion of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, on the firſt of <hi>October, anno</hi> 1603. they not only gave audience to Ambaſſadours, and received Letters from forain Princes; but alſo importuned his Majeſty to have a generall liberty of going into any other Countries, and aſſiſting at their Councels: a matter of eſpeciall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance: and therefore the King upon a foreſight of the dangers, wiſely prohibited them to goe to any
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:55011:144"/>
Aſſemblies without a particular Licence, upon pain to be declared Traytors. Since that time growing into greater ſtrength, whenſoever they had occaſion of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with King <hi>Lewis,</hi> they would never treat with him, but by their Ambaſſadours, and upon eſpeciall Articles.</p>
                     <p>An ambition above the quality of thoſe that profeſſe themſelves Subjects, and the only way, as <hi>Du Seirres</hi> noteth, <hi>To make an Eſtate in the State.</hi> But the anſwers made unto the King by thoſe of <hi>Clerac</hi> and <hi>Montauban,</hi> are pregnant proofs of their intent and meaning in this kinde; the firſt being ſummoned by the King and his Army the 21 of <hi>July, Anno</hi> 1621. returned thus, <hi>That the King ſhould ſuffer them to enjoy their Lilerties, and leave their Fortifications as they were, for the ſafety of their lives, and ſo they would declare themſelves to be his Subjects.</hi> They of <hi>Montauban,</hi> made a fuller expreſſion of the generall deſign and diſobedience, which was, <hi>That they were reſolved to live and die in the union of the Churches,</hi> had they ſaid <hi>for the ſervice of the King,</hi> it had been ſpoken bravely, but now rebelliouſly.</p>
                     <p>This Union and Confederacy of theirs, King <hi>Lewis</hi> uſed to call <hi>the Common-wealth of Rochell;</hi> for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of which, he alwayes proteſted, that he had only taken armes, and if we compare circumſtances, we ſhall finde it to be no other.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond of <hi>Aprill,</hi> before he had as yet advanced into the field, he publiſhed a Declaration in favour of all thoſe of the Religion, which would contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within duty and obedience. And whereas ſome of <hi>Tours,</hi> at the beginning of the wars, had tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly moleſted the Proteſtants, at the buriall of one of their dead; five of them, by the Kings commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were openly executed.

After, when this rabble had burne down their Temple at <hi>Charenton,</hi> the Court of Parliament on the day following ordained, that it ſhould be built up again in a more beautifull manner, and that at the Kings charge. Add to this, that ſince the ending of the wars, and the reduction of almoſt all their Towns, we have not ſeen the leaſt alteration of Religion.

                     <p>All things thus conſidered in their true being, I connot ſee for what cauſe our late Soveraign ſhould ſuffer ſo much cenſure as he then did, for not giving them aſſiſtance. I cannot but ſay, that my ſelf have too often condemned his remiſſeneſſe in that cauſe, which upon better conſideration I cannot tell how he ſhould have dealt in. Had he been a medler in it further then he was, he had not ſo much preſerved Religion, as ſupported Rebellion; beſides the conſequence of the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He had Subjects of his own more then enough, which were ſubject to diſcontent, and prone to an apoſtaſie from their alleagiance. To have aſſiſted the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient <hi>French</hi> under the colour of the liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, had been only to have taught that King a way into <hi>England</hi> upon the ſame pretence; and to have trod the path of his own hazard. He had not long before denied ſuccour to his own children, when he might have given them on a better ground, and for a fairer purpoſe; and could not now in honour countenance the like action in another. For that other, deniall of his helping hand, I much doubt how far poſterity will acquit him, though certainly he was a good Prince, and had been an happy inſtrument of the peace of Chriſtendome, had not the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:55011:145"/>
latter part of his reign hapned in a time ſo full of troubles. So that betwixt the quietneſſe of his nature, and the turbulency of his latter dayes, he ſell into that miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exigent mentioned in the Hiſtorian, <hi>Miſerrimum eſt eum alicui, aut natura ſua excedenda eſt, aut minuenda dignitas.</hi> Add to this, that the <hi>French</hi> had been firſt abandoned at home by their own friends, of ſeven Generals which they had appointed for the ſeven circles into which they divided all <hi>France;</hi> four of them never giving them incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The three which accepted of thoſe unordinate Governments, were the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> his brother M. <hi>Soubiſe,</hi> and the Marqueſſe of <hi>Lafforce;</hi> the four others being the Duke of <hi>Tremoville,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Chastillon,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Leſdiſguier,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bovillon,</hi> who ſhould have commanded in chief. So that the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay that he was firſt wanting for them, but they to themſelves.</p>
                     <p>If we demand what ſhould move the <hi>French</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants to this Rebellious contradiction of his Majeſties commandements. We muſt anſwer, that it was too much happineſſe: <hi>Gauſa hujus belli eadem quae omnium, nimia foelicitas,</hi> as <hi>Florus</hi> of the Civill wars between <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey.</hi> Before the year 1620 when they fell firſt into the Kings disfavour, they were poſſeſſed of almoſt 100 good Towns, well fortified for their ſafety; beſides beautifull houſes and ample poſſeſſions in the Villages, they ſlept every man under his own Vine and his own Fig-tree; neither fearing, nor needing to fear the leaſt diſturbance: with thoſe of the Catholick party, they were grown ſo intimate and entire, by reaſon of their inter-marriages, that a very few years would have them incorporated, if not into one faith, yet into one family. For their better ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in matters of Juſtice, it pleaſed King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, to erect a Chamber in the Court of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paris,</hi> purpoſely for them. It conſiſteth of one Preſident and 16 Counſellours; their office to take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all the Cauſes and Suits of them of the reformed Religion, as well within the juriſdiction of the Parliament
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:55011:146"/>
of <hi>Paris,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> till there ſhould be a Chamber erected in either of them. There were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alſo two Chambers in the Parliaments of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> and <hi>Grenoble,</hi> and one at the <hi>Chaſtres</hi> for the Parliament of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loza.</hi> Theſe Chambers were called <hi>Les Chambre de l' Edict,</hi> becauſe they were eſtabliſhed by eſpeciall Edict, at the Towns of <hi>Nantes</hi> in <hi>Britain, Aprill</hi> the 8. <hi>anno</hi> 1598. In a word, they lived ſo ſecure and happy, that one would have thought their felicities had been immortall.

And yet they are not brought ſo low, but that they may live happily, if they can be content to live obediently; that which is taken from them, being matter of ſtrength only, and not priviledge.</p>
                     <p>Let us now look upon them in their Churches, which we ſhall finde as empty of magnificence as ceremony. To talke amongſt them of Common-prayers, were to fright them with the ſecond coming of the Maſſe; and to mention Prayers at the buriall of the dead, were to perſwade them of a Purgatory. Painted glaſſe in a Church window, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for the flag and enſigne of Antichriſt: and for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, no queſtion but they are deemed to be the Devils bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipes. Shew them a Surplice, and they cry out, a rag of the Whore of <hi>Babylon;</hi> yet a ſheet on a woman, when ſhe is in child-bed, is a greater abomination then the other. A ſtrange people, that could never think the Maſſe-book ſufficiently reformed, till they had taken away Prayers; nor that their Churches could ever be handſome, untill they were ragged. This fooliſh oppoſition of their firſt Reformers, hath drawn the Proteſtants of theſe parts into a world of diſlike and envie, and been no ſmall diſadvantage to the fide. Whereas the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though it diſſent as much from the Papiſts in point of Doctrine, is yet not uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably thought on by the Modern Catholicks, by reaſon it retained ſuch an excellency of Diſcipline.

An allowance, which with ſome little help, might have been raiſed higher, from the practice of our Church, to ſome points of our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and it is very worthy of our obſervation, that which the Marqueſſe of <hi>Rhoſny</hi> ſpake of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> when he came as extraordinary Ambaſſadour from King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. to welcome King <hi>James</hi> into <hi>England.</hi> For upon the view of our ſolemn Service and ceremonies, he openly ſaid unto his followers, <hi>That if the reformed Churches in France, had kept the ſame orders amongſt them which we have, he was aſſured that there would have been many thouſands more of Protestants there, then now are.</hi> But the Marqueſſe of <hi>Rhoſny</hi> was not the laſt that ſaid ſo, I have heard divers <hi>French</hi> Papiſts, who were at the Queens coming over, and ventured ſo far upon an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, as to be preſent at our Church ſolemn Services, extoll them and us for their ſakes, even almoſt unto hyperboles.

                     <p>As are their Churches, ſuch is their Diſcipline, naked of all Antiquity, and almoſt as modern as the men which imbrace it.

When any buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which concerneth the good of the Congregation is befallen, they muſt be called to councell, and you ſhall finde them there as ſoon as ever they can put off their Aprons; having blurted out there a little Claſſicall non-ſenſe, and paſſed their conſents rather by nodding of their heads, then any other ſenſible articulation, they haſten to their ſhops, as <hi>Quinctius</hi> the Dictator in <hi>Florus</hi> did to his plough, <hi>Vt ad opus relictum feſtinaſſe videatur.</hi> Such a plat-form, though it be, that needeth no further confutation then to know it, yet had it been tolerable if the contrivers of it had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured to impoſe it on all the Reformation.

                     <p>As for their Miniſtery, it is indeed very learned in their ſtudies, and exceeding painfull in their calling. By the firſt they confute the ignorance of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy; by the ſecond their lazineſſe. And queſtionleſſe it behoveth them ſo to be, for living in a Countrey full of oppoſition, they are enforced to a neceſſity of book-learning, to maintain the cauſe, and being continually as it were beſet with ſpies, they do the oftner frequent the Pulpits, to hold up their. credits. The maintenance which is allotted to them, ſcarce amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to a competency, though by that name they pleaſe to call it. With receiving of tithes they never meddle, and therefore in their Schiſmaticall tracts of Divinity, they do hardly allow of the paying of them. Some of them hold that they were <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> and abrogated with the Law. Others think them to be meerly <hi>jure humano,</hi> and yet that they may lawfully be accepted, where they are tendred. It is well known yet that there are ſome amongſt them, which will commend grapes, though they cannot reach them. This competence may come unto 40 or 50 <hi>l.</hi> yearly, or a little more. <hi>Beza</hi> that great and famous

                     <p>As for the Tithes, they belong to the ſeverall Pariſh Prieſts in whoſe Precincts they are due; and they, I'le warrant you, according to the little learning which they have, will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them to be <hi>jure divino.</hi> The Sermons of the <hi>French</hi> are very plain and home-ſpun, little in them of the Fathers, and leſſe of humane learning; it being concluded in the Synod of <hi>Gappe,</hi> that only the Scriptures ſhould be uſed in their Pulpits. They conſiſt much of Exhortation and Uſe, and of nothing in a manner which concerneth knowledge; a ready way to raiſe up and edifie the Will and Affections, but withal to ſtarve the underſtanding.

                     <p>HAving thus ſpoken of the Churches; I muſt now treat a little of the Common-wealth. Religion is as the ſoul of a State, Policy as the body; we can hardly diſcourſe of the one, without a relation to the other; if we do, we commit a wilfull murder, in thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying a republick. The Common-wealth without the Church, is but a carkaſſe, a thing inanimate. The Church without the Common-wealth is as it were <hi>anima ſeparata,</hi>

There is beſides the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral reſpect of each to other, a more particular band betwixt them here in <hi>France,</hi> which is a likeneſſe and reſemblance. In the Church of <hi>France</hi> we have found an head and a body; this body again divided into two parts, the Catholick and the Proteſtant: the head is in his own opinion, and the minds of many others, of a power unlimited; yet the Catholick party hath ſtrongly curbed it. And of the two parts of the body, we ſee the Papiſts flouriſhing and in triumph, whileſt that of the Proteſtant is in miſery and affliction. Thus is it alſo in the body Politick. The King in his own conceit boundleſſe and omnipotent, is yet affronted by his Nobles; which Nobles enjoy all the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of riches and happineſſe; the poor Paiſants in the mean time living in drudgery and bondage.</p>
                     <p>For the government of the King is meerly, indeed, regal, or to give it the true name <hi>deſpoticall;</hi> though the Countrey be his wife, and all the people are his children, yet doth he neither govern as an husband or a father; he accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of them all as of his ſervants, and therefore comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them as a Maſter. In his Edicts which he over frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſendeth about, he never mentioneth the good will of his Subjects, nor the approbation of his Councell, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth all of them in this forme, <hi>Car tell eſt nostre plaiſir, Sic volo ſic jubeo.</hi> A forme of government very prone to degenerate into a tyranny, if the Princes had not oftentimes ſtrength and will to make reſiſtance. But this is not the vice of the entire and Soveraign Monarchy alone; which the Greek call <gap reason="foreign">

They therefore which have written of Republicks do moſt applaud and commend the mixt manner of rule, which is equally compounded of the Kingdome and the <hi>Politeia;</hi> becauſe in theſe the Kings have all the power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to their title, without prejudice to the populacie. In theſe there is referred to the King, abſolute Majeſty; to the Nobles, convenient authority; to the People, an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted liberty: all in a juſt and equall proportion.

The late Wars which he managed againſt the Proteſtants coſt him deer, he being fain to bind unto him moſt of his Princes by money and penſions. As the expenſes of the King are brought unto this Court to be examined, ſo are alſo the Gifts and Penſions by him granted to be ratified. The ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulary power given unto this Chamber, is to cut off all thoſe of the Kings grants which have no good ground and foundation; the officers being ſolemnly (at the leaſt formally) ſworn, not to ſuffer any thing to paſſe them, to the detriment of the Kingdome, whatſoever Letters of command thay have to the contrary.

From the King deſcend we to the Subjects, <hi>ab equis (quod aiunt) ad aſinos,</hi> and the phraſe is not much improper; the <hi>French</hi> commonalty being called <hi>the Kings aſſes.</hi> Theſe are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three ranks or Claſſes, the Clergy, the Nobles, the Paiſants; out of which certain delegates or Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, choſen upon occaſion, and ſent to the King, did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently concur to the making of the Supreme Court for Juſtice in <hi>France.</hi> It was called the Aſſembly of the three Eſtates, or the <hi>Conventus ordinum;</hi> and was juſt like the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament of <hi>England.</hi> But theſe meetings are now forgotten, or out of uſe; neither, indeed, as this time goeth, can they any way advantage the State; for whereas there are three principall, if not ſole cauſes of theſe conventions, which are, the deſpoſing of the Regency during the nonage or ſickneſſe of a King; the granting Aides and Subſidies; and the redreſſing of Grievances: there is now another courſe taken in them. The Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> which ſpeaketh, as it is prompted by power and greatneſſe, appointeth the Regent; the Kings themſelves with their officers determine of the Taxes; and as concerning their Grievances, the Kings care is open to private Petitions.</p>
                     <p>Thus is that little of a Common-wealth which went to the making up of this Monarchie, eſcheated, or rather devoured by the King, that name alone containing in it both Clergy, Princes and People.

And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this is the iſſue of it, the former liveth the life of a ſlave to maintain his Lord in pride and lazineſſe; the Lord liveth the life of a King to oppreſſe his Tenant by fines and exactions.

In that Chapter, his project is, to have a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency ſo far between Subjects under the King or people of the ſame City, that neither the one might be over rich, nor the other too miſerably poor. They, ſaith he, which are too happy, ſtrong, or rich, or greatly favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the like, can not nor will not obey, with which evill they are infected from their infancy. The other through want of theſe things are too abjectly minded and baſe; ſo that the one cannot but command, nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but ſerve. And this he calleth <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, a City inhabited onely by Slaves and Tyrants. That queſtionleſſe is the moſt perfect and compleat forme of Government, <hi>Ubi veneratur protentem humilis, non timet; antecedit, non contemnit humiliorem potens,</hi> as <hi>Velleius.</hi> But this is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſſe of which <hi>France</hi> is not capable; their Lords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kings, and their Commons Villains.</p>
                     <p>And not to ſay leſſe of them then indeed they are, the Princes of this Countrey, are but little inferiour in matter of Royalty, to any King abroad; and by conſequence little reſpective, in matter of obedience, to their own King at home. Upon the leaſt diſcontent, they withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Court, or put themſelves into armes; and of all other comforts are ever ſure of this, that they ſhall never want partizans. Neither do they uſe to ſtand off from him fearfully, and at diſtance, but juſtifie their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt by publick Declaration, and think the King much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to them, if upon fair terms and an honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement, they will pleaſe to put themſelves again into his obedience. <hi>Henry</hi> IV. was a Prince of as undaunted and uncontroulable a ſpirit, as ever any of his predeceſſors, and one that loved to be obeyed; yet was he alſo very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baffled by theſe Roytelets, and at the laſt dyed in an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front.

A ſtomach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reſolution, and misbecoming a Subject; yet in this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition he perſiſted, his humor of diſobedience out-living the King whom he had thus affronted. But theſe tricks are ordinary here, otherwiſe a man might have conſtrued this action, by the term of Rebellion. The chief means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by theſe Princes become ſo head ſtrong, are an immunity given them by their Kings, and a liberty which they have taken to themſelves. By their Kings they have been abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely exempted from all Tributes, Tolles, Taxes, Cuſtomes, Impoſitions and Subſidies. By them alſo they have been eſtated in whole entire Provinces, with a power of <hi>haute and main Juſtice</hi> (as the Lawyers term it) paſſed over to them; the Kings having ſcarce an homage or acknowledgment of them. To this they have added much for their ſtrength and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by the inſconcing and fortifying of their houſes, which both often moveth, and afterwards inableth them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn his Majeſty. An example we have of this in the Caſtle of <hi>Rochfort</hi> belonging to the Duke of <hi>Tremoville,</hi> which in the long Civill wars endured a ſiege of 5000 ſhot, and yet was not taken. A very impolitick courſe (in my conceit) of the <hi>French,</hi> to beſtow honours and immunities upon thoſe, <hi>Qui</hi> (as the Hiſtorian noteth) <hi>ea ſuo arbitrio aut repoſituri, aut retenturi videantur; quique modum habent in ſua voluntate.</hi> For upon a knowledge of this ſtrength in themſelves, the Princes have been always prone to Civill wars, as having ſufficient means for ſafety and reſiſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On this ground alſo they ſlight the Kings authority, and diſobey his Juſtice. In ſo much that the greater ſort of Nobles in this Kingdome, can ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome be arraigned or executed in perſon; and therefore the Lawes condemn them in their images, and hang them in their pictures. A pretty device to mock Juſtice. If by chance, or ſome handſome ſleight, any of them are apprehended, they are put under a ſure guard, and not done to death without great fear of tumult and unquietneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it <hi>unus &amp; alter,</hi> only ſome two or three, that
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:55011:152"/>
thus ſtand upon their diſtance with the King, but even all the Nobility of the Realm, a rout ſo diſordered, unconfined, and numberleſſe, that even <hi>Fabius</hi> himſelf would be out of breath in making the reckoning. I ſpeak not here of thoſe that are ſtyled <hi>La Nobleſſe,</hi> but of <hi>Titulados,</hi> men only of titular Nobility, of the degree of Baron and above. Of theſe there is in this Countrey a number almoſt innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. <hi>Quot Coelum Stellas;</hi> take quantity for quantity, and I dare be of the opinion, that heaven hath not more Stars, then <hi>France</hi> Nobles. You ſhall meet with them ſo thick in the Kings Court eſpecially, that you would think it almoſt impoſſible the Countrey ſhould bear any other fruit. This, I think, I may ſafely affirme, and without Hyperbole, that they have there as many Princes, as we in <hi>England</hi> have Dukes; as many Dukes, as we Earls; as many Earls, as we Barons; and as many Barons as we have Knights; a jolly company, and ſuch as know their own ſtrength too. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore but much marvell, that theſe Kings ſhould be ſo prodigall in conferring honours; conſidering this, that every Noble man he createth, is ſo great a weakning to his power.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, I cannot but as much wonder at ſome of our Nation, who have murmured againſt our late Soveraign, and accuſed him of an unpardonable unthriftineſs, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing the dignities of his Realm, with ſo full and liberall a hand. Certainly, could there any danger have ariſen by it unto the State, I could have been as impatient of it as another. But with us, titles and ennoblings in this kind, are only either the Kings favour, or the parties merit, and maketh whomſoever he be that receiveth them, rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced then powerfull. <hi>Raro eorum honoribus invidetur, quorum vis non timetur,</hi> was a good Aphoriſme in the dayes of <hi>Paterculus;</hi> and may for ought I know be as good ſtill. Why ſhould I envie any man that honour, which taketh not from my ſafety; or repine at my Soveraign for raiſing any of his Servants into an higher degree of eminency, when that favour cannot make them exorbitant? Beſides it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the improvement of the Exchequer, at the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Subſidies, and the glory of the Kingdome, when the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:55011:152"/>
Prince is not attended by men meerly of the vulgar. Add to this, the few Noble men of any title w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he found at his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py coming in amongſt us, and the additions of power which his comming brought unto us; and we ſhall finde it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable, that he ſhould enlarge our Nobility, with our Empire: neither yet have we, indeed, a number to be talked of, comparing us with our neighbour Nations. We may ſee all of the three firſt ranks in the books of <hi>Milles, Brooke,</hi> and <hi>Vincent;</hi> and we are promiſed alſo a Catalogue of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſucceſſions of all our Barons. Then we ſhould ſee that as yet we have not ſurfeited. Were this care taken by the Heralde in <hi>France,</hi> perhaps the Nobility there would not ſeem ſo numberleſſe; ſure I am not ſo confuſed.

                     <p>The Nobles being ſo populous, it cannot be but the <hi>Nobleſſe,</hi> as they call them; that is, the Gentry, muſt needs be thick ſet and only not innumerable. Of theſe Nobles there are ſome which hold their eſtates immediately of the Crown, and they have the like immunities with the Princes. Some hold their Feifes (or <hi>feuda)</hi> of ſome other of the Lords, and he hath only <hi>Baſſe Juſtice</hi> permitted to him, as to mulct and amerce his Tenants, to impriſon them, or give them any other correction under death. All of them have power to raiſe and inhance up their Rents, to Tax his Subjects on occaſion, and to prohibit them ſuch pleaſures, as they think fit to be reſerved for themſelves. By <hi>Brettaul</hi> in <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy,</hi> I ſaw a poſt faſtned in the ground, like a race poſt with us, and therein an inſcription; I preſently made to it, as hoping to have heard of ſome memorable battell there foughten; but when I came at it, I found it to be nothing
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:55011:153"/>
but a Declaration of the Prince of <hi>Condes</hi> pleaſure, that no man ſhould hunt in thoſe quarters; afterwards I obſerved them to be very frequent. But not to wander through all particulars, I will in ſome few of them only give inſtance of their power here. The firſt is <hi>Proict de bailli age,</hi> power to keep Aſſize, or to have under him a <hi>Bailli,</hi> and a Superiour ſeat of Juſtice, for the deciſion of ſuch cauſes as fall under the compaſſe of ordinary juriſdiction. In this Court there is notice taken of Treaſons, Robberies, Murders, Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Pardons, Faires, Markets, and other matters of priviledge. Next they have a Court of ordinary juriſdiction, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Judge whom they call <hi>Le guarde de Juſtice,</hi> for the deciſion of ſmaller buſineſſe, as Debts, Treſpaſſes, breach of the Kings peace, and the like In this the purſe is only emptied, the other extendeth to the taking of life alſo; for which cauſe every one which hath <hi>Haute Juſtice</hi> annexed to his Feiſe, hath alſo his peculiar Gibbet; nay which is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully methodicall, by the criticiſme of the Gibbet, you may judge at the quality of him that owneth it. For the Gibbet of one of the Nobles hath but two pillars, that of the Chaſtellan three, the Barons four, the Earls ſix, the Dukes eight; and yet this difference is rather preciſe then generall. The laſt of their <hi>jura regalia,</hi> which I will here ſpeak of, is the command they have upon their people, to follow them unto the wars; a command not ſo advantagious to the Lord, as dangerous, to the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Thus live the <hi>French</hi> Princes, thus the Nobles. Thoſe ſheep which God, and the Lawes hath brought under them, they do not ſheer but fleece; and which is worſe then this, having themſelves taken away the Wooll, they give up the naked carkaſſe to the King. <hi>Tondi oves meas volo, non deglubi,</hi> was accounted one of the golden ſayings of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> but it is not currant here in <hi>France.</hi> Here the Lords and the King, though otherwiſe at oddes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, will be ſure to agree in this, the undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and oppreſſing of the poor Paiſant; <hi>Ephraim</hi> againſt <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but both againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> ſaith the Scripture.</p>

The reaſon why they thus deſire the poverty of the Commons, is, as they pretend, the ſafety of the State, and their owne particulars. Were the people once warmed with the feeling of eaſe and their own riches, they would preſently be hearkning after the warres; and if no imployment were proffered abroad, they would make ſome at home.

As for the women, they know in what degree nature hath created them, and therefore dare not be ſo fine as their Husbands; ſome of them never had above one pair of ſtockins in all their lives, which they wear every day, for indeed they are very durable. The goodneſſe of their faces tell us, that they have no need of a band, therefore they uſe none. And as concerning Petticoats, ſo it is, that all of them have ſuch a garment, but moſt of them ſo ſhort, that you would imagine them to be cut off at the placket.

But of all miſeries, this me thinketh is the greateſt, that ſowing ſo many acres of excellent wheat in an year, and gathering in ſuch a plentifull Vintage as they do, they ſhould not yet be ſo fortunate, as to eat white bread, or drink wine; for ſuch infinite rents do they pay to their Lords, and ſuch innumerable taxes to the King, that the profits ariſing out of thoſe commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, are only ſufficient to pay their duties, and keep them from the extremities of cold and famine. The bread then which they eat, is of the courſeſt flowre, and ſo black, that it cannot admit the name of brown. And as for their drink, they have recourſe to the next Fountain.

In this, queſtionleſſe, they are intirely miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, in that they are ſenſible of the wretchedneſſe of their preſent fortunes, and dare not labour nor expect an alteration. If induſtry and a ſparing hand hath raiſed any of this afflicted people ſo high, that he is but 40 <hi>s</hi> or 5 <hi>l.</hi> richer then his neighbour, his Lord immediately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunceth his Rents, and enformeth the Kings task-maſters of his riches, by which means he is within two or three years brought again to equall poverty with the reſt. A ſtrange courſe, and much different from that of <hi>England,</hi> where the Gentry take a delight in having their Tenants thrive under them, and hold it no crime in any that hold of them to be wealthy. On the other ſide, thoſe of <hi>France</hi> can abide no body to gain or grow rich upon their farmes; and therefore thus upon occaſions rack their poor Tenants. In which they are like the Tyrant <hi>Procruſtes,</hi> who laying hands upon all he met, caſt them upon his bed; if they were ſhorter then it, he racked their joynts till he had made them even to it, if they were longer, he cut as much of their bodies from them, as did hang over; ſo keeping all that fell into his power in an equality.

Like to Coppice woods, in which if you let them grow too thick in the ſtadles, they run to buſhes or bryers, and have little clean under-wood. Neither is this in <hi>France</hi> only, but in <hi>Italy</hi> alſo, and ſome other parts abroad; in ſo much, that they are enforced to imploy mercenary Souldiers for their battalions of foot: whereby it cometh to paſſe, that in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries they have much people, and few men. On this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. one of the wiſeſt of our Princes took a courſe ſo cunning and wholeſome, for the increaſe of the military power of his Realm; that though it be much leſſe in territory, yet it ſhould have infinitely more Souldiers of its native forces, then its neighbour Nations. For in the fourth year of his Reign, there paſſed an Act of Parliament pretenſively againſt the depopulation of Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, and decay of tillage, but purpoſedly to inable his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for the wars.

Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently the Kings of <hi>France</hi> had rich and plentifull demeans, ſuch as was ſufficient to maintain their greatneſſe and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, without being burdenſome unto the Countrey. Pride in matters of ſumptuouſneſſe, and the tedious Civill wars, which have laſted in this Countrey, almoſt ever ſince the death of <hi>Henry</hi> II. have been the occaſion that moſt of the Crown lands have been ſold and morgaged; in ſo much that the people are now become the <hi>Demaine,</hi> and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject only is the Revenue of the Crown. By the ſweat of their browes is the Court ſed, and the Souldier paid; and by their labours are the Princes maintained in idleneſſe. What impoſitions ſoever it pleaſeth the King to put upon them, it is almoſt a point of treaſon not only to deny, but to queſtion. <hi>Apud illos vere regnatur, nefaſque quantum regi liceat, dubitare;</hi> as one of them. The Kings hand lyeth hard upon them, and hath almoſt thruſt them into an <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, the poor Paiſant being conſtrained to make up dayly his full tale of bricks, and yet have no ſtraw allowed them. Upon a ſight of the miſeries and poverties of this people, Sir <hi>John Forteſcue,</hi> Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> in his book in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>De Laudibus legum Angliae,</hi> concludeth them to be unfit men for Jurors or Judges, ſhould the cuſtome of the Countrey admit of ſuch tryals. For having proved there unto the Prince, (he was ſon to <hi>Henry</hi> VI.) that the manner of tryall according to the Common Law, by 12 Jurates, was more commendable then the practiſe of the Civill or

Emperiall Lawes, by the depoſition only of two witneſſes, or the forced confeſſion of the perſons, arrained, the Prince ſeemed to marvell, <hi>Cur ed lex Angliae quae tam fiugi &amp; optabilis eſt, non ſit toti mundo communis.</hi> To this he maketh anſwer, by ſhewing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then he ſheweth how in other places all things are contrary, the Husbandman an abſolute begger, eaſie to be bribed by reaſon of his poverty; the Gentlemen living far aſunder, and ſo taking no notice of the fact; the Paiſant alſo neither fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring infamie, nor the loſſe of goods, if he be found faulty, becauſe he hath them not. In the end he concludeth thus, <hi>Ne mireris igitur princeps, ſi lex per quam in Anglia veritas inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur, alias non pervagetur nationes, ipſae namque ut Anglia neque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt facere ſufficientes conſimileſque Juratas.</hi> The laſt part of the latine, ſavoureth ſomewhat of the Lawyer, the word <hi>Juratas</hi> being put there to ſignifie a <hi>Jury.</hi>

                     <p>To go over all thoſe impoſitions, which this miſerable people are afflicted withal, were almoſt as wretched as the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them; I wiil therefore ſpeak only of the principall. And here I meet in the firſt place, with the Gabell or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition on Salt. This <hi>Gabelle de ſel,</hi> this Impoſt on Salt was firſt begun by <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Long,</hi> who took for it a double (which is half a Sol) upon the pound. After whom <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Valoys, anno</hi> 1328. doubled that. <hi>Charles</hi> the VII. raiſed it unto three doubles; and <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI. unto ſix. Since that time it hath been altered from ſo much upon the pound to a certain rate on the Mine, which containeth ſome 30 buſhels <hi>Engliſh;</hi> the rates riſing and falling at the Kings pleaſure. This one commodity were very advantagious to the Exchequer, were it all in the Kings hands; but at this time a great part of it is morgaged. It is thought to be worth unto the King three millions of Crowns yearly; that only of <hi>Paris</hi> and the Provoſts ſeven Daughters, being farmed at 1700000 Crowns the year. The late Kings ſince <hi>anno</hi> 15<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:55011:157"/>
let it out others; in ſo much that about <hi>anno</hi> 1599. the King loſt above 800000 Crowns yearly: and no longer agone then <hi>anno</hi> 1621. the King taking up 600000 pounds, of the Provoſt of Merchands and the Eſchevines, gave unto them a rent charge of 40000 <hi>l.</hi> yearly, to be iſſuing out of his Cuſtomes of Salt, till their money were repaid them. This Gabell is, indeed, a Monopoly, and that one of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſteſt and unreaſonableſt in the World. For no man in the Kingdom (thoſe Countries hereafter mentioned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) can eat any Salt, but he muſt buy of the King and at his price, which is moſt unconſcionable; that being ſold at <hi>Paris</hi> and elſewhere for five Livres, which in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted places is ſold for one. Therefore that the Kings profits might not be diminiſhed, there is diligent watch and ward, that no forain Salt be brought into the Land, upon pain of forfeiture and impriſoment. A ſearch which is made ſo ſtrictly, that we had much ado at <hi>Dieppe</hi> to be pardoned the ſearching of our trunks and port-mantles, and that not, but upon ſolemn proteſtation, that we had none of that commodity. This Salt is of a brown colour, being only ſuch as we in <hi>England</hi> call Bay ſalt; and impoſed on the Subjects by the Kings Officers with great rigour, for though they have ſome of their laſt proviſion in the houſe, or perchance would be content (through poverty) to eat meat without it, yet will theſe cruell villaines enforce them to take ſuch a quantity of them; or howſoever they will have of them ſo much money.</p>
                     <p>But this Tyranny is not generall, the <hi>Normans</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cards</hi> enduring moſt of it, and the other Paiſant the reſt. Much like unto which was the Licence which the Popes and Biſhops of old granted in matter of keeping Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines. For when ſuch as had the charge of gathering the Popes Rents happened upon a Prieſt which had no Concubine, and for that cauſe made deniall of the Tributes; the Collectours would return them this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that notwithſtanding this, they ſhould pay the money, becauſe they might have the keeping of a wench if they would.</p>

This Gabell, as it ſitteth hard on ſome, ſo are there ſome alſo which are never troubled with it. Of this ſort are the Princes in the generall releaſed, and many of the Nobleſs in particular; in ſo much that it was proved unto King <hi>Lewis, anno</hi> 1614. that for every Gentleman which took of his Majeſties Salt, there were 2000 of the Commons.

Beſides, here are yet divers of the Ducall family living in that Countrey, who would much trouble the peace of the Kingdome, ſhould the people be oppreſſed with this bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and they take the protection of them. <hi>Poictou</hi> and <hi>Quercu</hi> have compounded for it with the former Kings, and pay a certain rent yearly, which is called the <hi>Equivalent.

And as for the <hi>Gaſcoynes,</hi> the King dareth not impoſe it upon them for fear of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They are a ſtuborne and churliſh people, very impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of a rigorous yoak, and ſuch which inherit a full meaſure of the <hi>Biſcanes</hi> liberty and ſpirits, from whom they are deſcended. <hi>Le droict de fouage,</hi> the priviledge of levying a certain piece of money upon every chimney in an houſe that ſmoketh, was in times not long ſince one of the <hi>jura regalia</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> Lords, and the people paid it without grumbling; yet when <hi>Edward</hi> the black Prince returned from his unhappy journey into <hi>Spain,</hi> for the paying of his Souldiers to whom he was indebted, laid this <hi>Fouage</hi> upon this people, being then <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they all preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted to the <hi>French,</hi> and brought great prejudice to our affairs in thoſe quarters.</p>
                     <p>Next to the Gabell of Salt, we may place the Taille or Taillon, which are much of a nature with the Subſidies
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:55011:158"/>
in <hi>England,</hi> as being levied both on Goods and Lands. In this again they differ, the Subſidies of <hi>England</hi> being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the people, and the ſum of it certain; but this of <hi>France</hi> being at the pleaſure of the King, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he ſhall pleaſe to impoſe them. Antiently the Tailles were only levyed by way of extraordinary Subſidie, and that but upon four occaſions, which were, the Knighting of the King Son, the marriage of his Daughters, a Voyage of the Kings beyond ſea, and his Ranſome in caſe he were taken Priſoner; <hi>Les Tailles ne ſont point devis de voir or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaire</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ragneau) ains ant eſte accordeès durant la neceſſite des affaires ſeulement.</hi> Afterwards they were continually levyed in times of war; and at length <hi>Chales</hi> the VII. made them ordinary. Were it extended equally on all, it would amount to a very fair Revenue. For ſuppoſing this, that the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> containeth 200 millions of Acres (as it doth) and that from every acre there were raiſed to the King two Sols yearly, which is little in reſpect of what the Taxes impoſe upon them: That income alone, beſides that which is levyed on Goods perſonall, would amount to two millions of pounds in a year. But this payment alſo lyeth on the Paiſant; the greater Towns, the officers of the Kings houſe, the Officers of War, the Preſident, Counſellors and Officers of the Courts of Parliament, the Nobility, the Clergy, and the Scholars of the Univerſity being freed from it.</p>
                     <p>That which they call the Taillon, was intended for the eaſe of the Countrey, though now it prove one of the greateſt burdens unto it. In former times the Kings Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers lay all upon the charge of the Villages, the poor people being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If they were not well pleaſed with their entertainment, they uſed commonly to beat their Hoſt, abuſe his family, and rob him of that ſmall proviſion, which he had laid up for his children; and all this <hi>Cum privilegio.</hi> Thus did they move from one Village to another, and at the laſt again returned to them from whence they came; <hi>Ita ut non ſit ibi villula una expers cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitatis

For ſuch is the lamentable fate of this Countrey, that their kindneſſes are made duty; and thoſe moneys which they once grant out of love, are always after exacted of them, and payed out of neceſſity. The <hi>Bedroll</hi> of all theſe impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and Taxes, is called the <hi>Pancarte,</hi> becauſe it was han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a frame, like as the Officers fees are in our Dioceſan Courts; the word <hi>Pan</hi> ſignifying a frame or a pane of Wainſcot.

This hapned in the year 1383. and was for five years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continued, which time being expired, and other Cities warned by that example, the Impoſition was eſtabliſhed, and the priviledges reſtored. For the better regulating of the Profits ariſing from theſe Impoſts, the <hi>French</hi> King erected a Court called, <hi>Le Cour des Aides;</hi> it conſiſted at the firſt of the Generals of the Aides, and of any four of the Lords of the Councell, whom they would call to their aſſiſtance. Afterwards <hi>Charles</hi> the V. <hi>anno</hi> 1380 or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts ſetled it in <hi>Paris,</hi> and cauſed it to be numbred as one of the Soveraign Courts. <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI. diſſolved it, and committed the managing of his Aids to his houſhold ſervants, as loath to have any publick officers take notice how he fleeced his people. <hi>Anno</hi> 1464. it was reſtored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And finally, <hi>Henry</hi> II. <hi>anno</hi> 1551. added to it a ſecond Chamber compoſed of two Preſidents and eight Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; one of which Preſidents, named Mr. <hi>Chevalier,</hi> is ſaid to be the beſt monied man of all <hi>France.</hi> There are alſo others of theſe Courts in the Countrey, as one at <hi>Roven,</hi> one at <hi>Montferrant</hi> in <hi>Avergne,</hi> one at <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> and another at <hi>Montpelier,</hi> eſtabliſhed by <hi>Charles</hi> VII. <hi>anno</hi> 1437<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

When then the King levyeth his Taxes, he ſendeth his Letters Patents to the principall Officers of every Generalty, whom they call <hi>Les Genereaux des Aides,</hi> and they diſpatch their Warrant to the <hi>Eſleus</hi> or Commiſſioners. Theſe taxing every one of the Pariſhes and Villages within their ſeverall diviſions at a certain rate, ſend their receivers to collect it, who give account for it to their Comptrollers. By them it aſcendeth to the <hi>Eſleus,</hi> from him to the Receiver generall of that Generalty, next to the Comptroller, then to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, afterwards to the <hi>Generall des Aides;</hi> and ſo

By all theſe hands it is at laſt conveyed into the Kings purſe; in which ſeverall paſſages, <hi>Neceſſe eſt ut aliquid haereat,</hi> it cannot be but that it muſt have many a ſhrewd ſnatch. In ſo much that I was told by a Gentleman of good credence in <hi>France,</hi> that there could not be gathered by the ſeverall exactions above ſpecified, and other deviſes of prowling, which I have omitted, leſſe then 85 millions a year, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the King receiveth 15 only. A report not altogether to be ſlighted, conſidering the Preſident of the Court of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptes made it evident to the Aſſembly at <hi>Bloys,</hi> in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. that by the time that every one of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers had his ſhare of it, there came not to the Kings Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers one <hi>teſton</hi> (which is 1 <hi>s.</hi> 2 <hi>d.)</hi> of a Crown; ſo that by reckoning 5 <hi>teſtons</hi> to a Crown or <hi>Eſcu</hi> (as it is but 2 <hi>d.</hi> over) theſe Officers muſt collect five times the money which they pay the King, which amounteth to 75 millions, and is not much ſhort of that proportion which before I ſpake of. The Kings Revenues then, notwithſtanding this infinite oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his people, amounteth to 15 millions (ſome would have it 18.) which is a good improvement in reſpect of what they were in times aſore. <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI. as good a husband of his Crown, as ever any was in <hi>France,</hi> gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but one and a half only. But as you reckon the flood, ſo alſo if you may reckon the ebb ofhis Treaſures, you will finde much wanting of a full ſea in his Coffers; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

generally known, that the fees of officers, penſions, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, and the men of armes, draw from him yearly no fewer then 6 of his 15 millions.</p>
                     <p>True it is, that his Treaſure hath many good helps by way of Eſcheat, and that moſt frequently, when he cometh to take an accompt of his Treaſurers and other Officers.

He is juſt of the nature of the Horſe-leech, when he hath once gotten hold of you, he will never let you go till he be filled. And which is moſt ſtrange, he thinks it a greater clemency that he hath leſt the poor man ſome of his money, then the injury was in wreſting from him the reſt. Nay they will brag of it, when they have taken but five of the eight Sols, that they have given him three, and expect thanks for it.

But he is not like to carry it to his grave, the King having ſeized upon a good part of it, and himſelf being condemned to the gallowes by the grand <hi>Chambre</hi> of Parliament, though as yet he cannot be apprehended and advanced to the Ladder. And this hath been the end of many of them, ſince the reign of this preſent King, whom (it may be) for this cauſe, they call <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>juſt.</hi> This faſhion of affixing Epithites to the names of their Kings was in great uſe heretofore with this Nation. <hi>Carolus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Pepin,</hi> was by them ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Le Magne: Lewis</hi> his ſon <hi>Debonaire,</hi> and ſo of the reſt.

For my ſelf, in bettering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="280" facs="tcp:55011:165"/>
what I could my underſtanding, if peradventure the perſons or the place might add unto me the knowledge of any one thing, to which I was a ſtranger. At the leaſt I was in hope to ſatisfy my curioſity, as being not a little emulous of this kind of living, <hi>Multorum mores hominum qui vidit &amp; urbes;</hi> which had ſeen ſo much of men and of their manners. It was alſo not the laſt part of mine intention, to do ſomething in the honour of the Iſland, by committing to memory their Antiquities, by reporting to poſterity their Arts of Government, by repreſenting, as in a Tablet, the choyceſt of their beauties; and in a word, by reducing theſe and the Achievements of the people, as far as the light of Authors could direct me, into the body of an Hiſtory. But when I had a little made my ſelf acquainted with the place and people, I found nothing in them which might put me to that trouble. The Churches naked of all Monuments, and not ſo much as the blazon of an Armes permitted in a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, for fear, as I conjecture, of Idolatry. No actions of importance to be heard of in their Legends, in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancers; whereby to ennoble them in time to come, unleſſe perhaps ſome ſlight allarmes from <hi>France,</hi> may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſpeech of them in our common Chronicles. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, indeed, exceeding pleaſant and delightſome, but yet ſo ſmall in the extent and circuit, that to ſpeak much of them, wereto put the ſhooe of <hi>Hercules</hi> upon the foot of an Infant. For being in themſelves, an abridgement only of the greater works of nature, how could the character and deſcription of them be improved into a Volume? Having thus failed in the moſt of my deſignes, I applyed my ſelf to make enquirie after their form of Government, in which, I muſt needs confeſſe, I met with much which did exceedingly affect me. Their Lawes, little beholding in the compoſition of them, to <hi>Juſtinian;</hi> and of no great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity with the laws of <hi>England,</hi> which we call Municipall or common. The grand Cuſtomarie of <hi>Normandy,</hi> is of moſt credit with them; and that indeed the only rule by which they are directed, ſave that in ſome few paſſages it hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by our Prince, for the conveniency of this people.</p>

                        <hi>Sed quid hoc ad Iphycli boves?</hi> But what had I, a Prieſt of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to do with the Laws and Cuſtomes of the <hi>Normans?</hi> Had I gone forward in my purpoſe, I deny not, but I had mingled that knowledge which I have gotten of their Laws, amongſt other my Collections; but failing in the main of my intent, I muſt only make ſuch uſe of them, as ſhall be neceſſary for this preſent argument. An Argument not ſo much as in my thoughts, when firſt I reſolved upon the Journey; as little dreaming that any alterations had lately hapned in the Churches of thoſe Iſlands, or that thoſe alterations could afford one ſuch varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. An Argument more ſutable to my profeſſion, as having had the honour to be reputed with the Clergy; and ſuch as in it ſelf may juſtly be intituled to your Lordſhips patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage.

An advancement which doth call upon you for the eſtabliſhment and ſupportation of the meaneſt Oratory dependant on the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> your moſt indulgent, and in you moſt happy mother. No marvail therefore, if thoſe little Chappels, even thoſe two Tribes and a half, which are on the other ſide of the flood, moſt humbly caſt themſelves at your Lordſhips feet, and by me lay open their eſtate unto you.</p>
                     <p>Which that I may the better do, in diſcharge of the truſt repoſed in me, and for your Lordſhips, more ample ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I ſhall proceed in this order following.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I ſhall lay before your Lordſhip, the full ſucceſſe and courſe of our Navigation, till we were ſetled in thoſe Iſlands; that ſo the reſt of this diſcourſe being more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall, may receive no interruption in the proceſſe of it.</p>
                     <p>Next, I ſhall briefly, as in a map, preſent your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the ſituation, quality and ſtory of the Iſlands; with ſomewhat alſo of their Cuſtomes, of their Government; but this (as the great Cardinall acknowledgeth the Popes power in temporall affaires) <hi>in ordine tantum ad ſpiritualia:</hi> the better to acquaint you with the occurrents of their Churches.</p>

That done, I ſhall draw down the ſucceſſe of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs from the beginning of the Reformation in matters of Religion, to the accompliſhment of that innovation which they had made in point of diſcipline; and therein, the full platforme or diſcipline it ſelf, according as by <hi>Snape</hi> and <hi>Cartwright</hi> it was eſtabliſhed in their Synods.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, I ſhall ſhew your Lordſhip, by what degrees and means the Miniſters and Church of <hi>Jerſey,</hi> were perſwaded to conforme unto the diſcipline of <hi>England;</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a copy of thoſe Canons and conſtitutions Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall, whereby the Church and Miniſtery of that Iſland is now governed.</p>
                     <p>Laſt of all, I ſhall commence a ſuit unto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the name of thoſe of <hi>Guernzey</hi> for their <hi>little ſiſter which hath no breaſts;</hi> that by your Lordſhips place and power the one Iſland may conforme unto the other, and both to <hi>England.</hi> In which I ſhall exhibit unto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip a juſt ſurvey of ſuch motives, which may have moſt ſway with you in the furthering of a work ſo commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and ſhall adventure alſo upon ſuch particulars, as may conduce to the advancing of the buſineſſe. Not that therein I ſhall preſume poſitively to adviſe your Lordſhip, or to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you in the readieſt way for the accompliſhment of this deſigne; but that by this propounding of mine own conceits, I may excite your Lordſhip to have recourſe unto the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent treaſures of your own mind, and thence to faſhion ſuch particulars for this purpoſe, as may be moſt agreeable to your Lordſhips wiſdome.</p>
                     <p>In order whereunto your Lordſhip may be pleaſed to call to mind that on provocation given unto the <hi>French</hi> at the Iſle of <hi>Rhe,</hi> the King received advertiſement of ſome reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall affront intended by the <hi>French</hi> on the Iſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

againſt all invaſions. This order ſignified to his Lordſhip about the beginning of <hi>December, anno</hi> 1628. he chearfully embraced the ſervice, and prepared accordingly. But being deſerted by his own Chaplaines in regard of the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſeaſon, and the viſible danger of the enterpriſe, he propoſed the buſineſſe of that attendance unto me (not otherwiſe relating to him then as to an honourable friend) in whom he found as great a readineſſe and reſolution, as he found coldneſſe in the other. According to his Lordſhips ſummons, I attended him in his Majeſties houſe of St. <hi>James,</hi> a little before the Feaſt of <hi>Chriſtmas;</hi> but neither the Ships, money, nor other neceſſaries being at that time brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, I was diſmiſſed again at the end of the Holydayes, untill a further intimation of his Lordſhips pleaſure. Toward the latter end of <hi>February</hi> I received a poſitive command to attend his Lordſhip on Friday the 20 of that month, at the houſe of Mr. <hi>Arthur Brumfeild,</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Tichfeild</hi> near the Sea, ſituate between <hi>Portſmouth</hi> and <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

It was a full week after that, before we heard of his Lordſhips coming, and yet his Lordſhip was fain to tarry two or three dayes before he had any advertiſement that his Ships, Men and Ammunition (which he thought to have found there in readineſſe) were Anchored in the road of <hi>Portſmouth.</hi> News whereof being brought unto us on the Monday morning, we ſpent the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of that day in preparations for our Journey, and taking leave of thoſe good friends by whom we were ſo kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained and welcomed.</p>
                     <p>On Tueſday <hi>March</hi> the 3. about ten in the morning, we went aboard his Majeſties Ship called the <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> being a Ship of 800 tun, furniſhed with 42 pieces of Ordinance, and very well manned with valiant and expert Sailors; welcomed aboard (after the faſhion of the Sea) with all the thunder and lightning which the whole Navy could afford from their ſeverall Ships. Our whole Navy conſiſted of five Veſſels, that is to ſay, the <hi>Aſſurance</hi> ſpoken of before, two of his Majeſties <hi>Pinnaces</hi> called the <hi>Whelps,</hi> a <hi>Catch</hi> of his Majeſties called the <hi>Minikin,</hi> and a Merchants ſhip called

the <hi>Charles,</hi> which carryed the Armes and Ammunition for the uſe of the Iſlands. Aboard the Ships were ſtowed about 400 foot with their ſeverall Officers, two Companies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of under the command of Collonell <hi>Pipernell</hi> (if I remember his name aright) and Lieutenant Collonell <hi>Francis Connisby</hi> were intended for the Iſle of <hi>Guernzey;</hi> the other two under the command of Lieutenant Collonell <hi>Francis Rainford,</hi> and Captain <hi>William Killegre</hi> for the Iſle of <hi>Jarſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All of them men of note in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall wayes, and moſt of them of as much gallantry and ingenuity, as either their own birth or education in the Schoole of war could inveſt them with. The Sea was very calme and quiet, and the little breath of winde we had, made us move ſo ſlowly, that the afternoon was almoſt ſpent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had paſſed through the Needles, a dangerous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage at all times, except to ſuch only who being well skilled in theſe ſharpe points, and thoſe dreadfull fragments of the Rocks, which ſo intituled them, could ſtear a ſteady courſe between them: <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis</hi> in old times, nothing more terrible to the unskilled Mariners of thoſe dayes, then thoſe Rocks to ours. Being got beyond them at the laſt, though we had got more Sea roome, we had little more winde, which made us move as ſlowly as before we did, ſo that we ſpent the greateſt part of the night with no ſwifter motion, then what was given us by the tide. About 3 of the clock in the morning we had winde enough, but we had it directly in our teeth, which would have quickly brought us to the place we had parted from, if a great Miſte ariſing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Sun, had not induced our Mariners to keep themſelves aloofe in the open Sea for fear of falling on thoſe Rocks wherewith the Southſide of the <hi>Wight</hi> is made unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſable. About 2 of the clock in the afternoon, the winds turning ſomewhat Eaſtward, we made on again, but with ſo little ſpeed, and to ſo little purpoſe, that all that night we were fain to lie at <hi>Hull</hi> (as the Mariners phraſe it) without any ſenſible moving either backward or forward, but ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſily withall, that it muſt be a very great tempeſt indeed,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:55011:167"/>
which gives a paſſenger a more ſickly and unpleaſing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For my part I had found my ſelf good Sea-proof in my Voyage to <hi>France,</hi> and was not much troubled with thoſe diſturbances to which the greateſt part of our Land-men were ſo ſenſibly ſubject. On Thurſday morning about day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break being within ſight of <hi>Portland,</hi> and the winde ſerving very fitly, we made again for the Iſlands. At 11 of the clock we diſcovered the main Land of <hi>Normandy,</hi> called by the Mariners <hi>Le Haggs.</hi> About 2 in the afternoon, we fell even with <hi>Aldernie</hi> or <hi>Aurnie;</hi> and about 3 diſcerned the Iſle of <hi>Jarzey</hi> to which we were bound, at which we aimed, and to which we might have come much ſooner then we did had we not found a ſpeciall entertainment by the way to retard our haſte. For we were hardly got within ſight of <hi>Jarſey</hi> but we deſcried a ſail of <hi>French</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ten barks laden with very good <hi>Gaſcoy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Theſe being looked on as good prize, our two <hi>Whelpes</hi> and the <hi>Catch</hi> gave chace unto them, a great ſhot being firſt made from our Admirals Ship to call them in. The ſecond ſhot brought in the <hi>Holland man of war,</hi> who very ſordidly and baſely betrayed his charge before he came within reach of danger; the reſt for the greateſt part of the afternoon, ſpun before the winde, ſometimes ſo neer to their purſuers, that we thought them ours, but preſently tacking about, when our <hi>Whelpes</hi> were ready to ſeaze on them, and the <hi>Catch</hi> to lay faſt hold upon them, they gained more way then our light Veſſels could reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in a long time after. Never did Duck by frequent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo eſcape the Spaniell, or Hare by often turning ſo avoid the Hounds, as theſe poor Barks did quit themſelves by their dexterity in ſailing from the preſent danger. For my part I may juſtly ſay that I never ſpent an afternoon with greater pleaſure, the greater in regard that I knew his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips reſolution to deal favourably with thoſe poor men if they chanced to fall into his power.

Reſolved upon the laſt courſe and favoured with a ſtrong leading gale, they paſſed by us with ſuch ſpeed and ſo good ſucceſſe, (the duskineſſe of the evening contributing not a little to a fair eſcape) that though we gave them 30 ſhot, yet we were not able to affirme that they received any hurt or dammage by that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter; with as much joy unto my ſelf (I dare boldly ſay) as to any of thoſe poor men who were ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed

in it. This Chaſe being over, and our whole Fleet come together, we Anchored that night in the Port of St. <hi>Oen,</hi> one of the principall Ports of that Iſland; the Inhabitants whereof (but thoſe eſpecially which dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the inland parts) ſtanding all night upon their guard, conceiving by the thunder of ſo many great ſhot, that the whole powers of <hi>France</hi> and the Devill to boot were now falling upon them; not fully ſatisfied in their fears, till by the next riſing of the Sun they deſcried our colours.</p>
                     <p>On Friday <hi>March</hi> the 6. about nine in the morning (having firſt landed our foot in the long boats) we went aboard his Majeſties <hi>Catch</hi> called the <hi>Minikin,</hi> and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the points of <hi>Le Corbiere</hi> and of <hi>Normoint,</hi> we went on ſhoar in the Bay of St. <hi>Heliers,</hi> neer unto <hi>Mount St. Albin</hi> in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> The greateſt part of which day we ſpent in accommodations and refreſhments, and receiving the viſits of the Gentry which came in very frequently to attend his Lordſhip.

And finally, adviſing the common Souldiers to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſuch ſobriety and moderation towards the natives of the Countrey, (for as for their valour towards the enemies he would make no queſtion) as to give no offence or ſcandall by their converſation. This ſaid, the Aſſembly was diſſolved, to the great ſatisfaction of all parties preſent; the night enſuing and the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being ſpent for the moſt part in the entertainments of reſt and pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>The only buſineſſe of that day was the diſpoſing of the three Barks which we took in our Journey, the goods whereof having before been inventoried and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by ſome Commiſſioners of the Town, and now expoſed to open ſale, were for the moſt part, bought together with the Barks themſelves by that very <hi>Holland man of warre,</hi> whom they had hired to be their Convoy: Which gave me ſuch a Character of the mercenary and ſordid nature of that people, that of all men living, I ſhould never deſire to have any thing to do with them, unleſſe they might be made uſe of (as the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> were) in <hi>hewing wood, and drawing water for the uſe of the Tabernacle;</hi> I mean in doing ſervile offices to ſome mightier State which would be ſure to keep them under.</p>

                     <p>TO begin then with the places themſelves, the Scene and Stage of our diſcourſe, they are the only remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of our rights in <hi>Normandy;</hi> unto which Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome they did once belong. <hi>Anno</hi> 1108. at ſuch time as <hi>Henry</hi> I. of <hi>England</hi> had taken priſoner his Brother <hi>Robert,</hi> theſe Iſlands as a part of <hi>Normandy,</hi> were annext unto the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:55011:171"/>
                        <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, and have ever ſince with great teſtimony of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aith and loyalty, continued in that ſubjection. The ſentence or arreſt of confiſcation given by the Parliament of <hi>France</hi> againſt King <hi>John,</hi> nor the ſurpriſall of <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> by the <hi>French</hi> forces, could be no perſwaſion unto them to change their Maſters. Nay when the <hi>French</hi> had twice ſeized on them, during the Reign of that unhappy Prince, and the ſtate of <hi>England</hi> was embroyled at home, the people valiantly made good their own, and faithfully returned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their firſt obedience. In aftertimes as any war grew hot between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> theſe Iſlands were principally aimed at by the enemy, and ſometimes alſo were attempted by them, but with ill ſucceſſe. And certainly, it could not be but an eye ſore to the <hi>French,</hi> to have theſe <hi>Iſles</hi> within their ſight, and not within their power; to ſee them at the leaſt in poſſeſſion of their ancient enemy the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> a Nation ſtrong in ſhipping, and likely by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of theſe places to annoy their trade. For if we look upon them in their ſituation, we ſhall find them ſeated purpoſely for the command and Empire of the Ocean. The Iſlands lying in the chief trade of all ſhipping from the Eaſtern parts unto the Weſt, and in the middle way between St. <hi>Malos</hi> and the river <hi>Seine,</hi> the only trafick of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Pariſians.</hi> At this St. <hi>Malos,</hi> as at a common <hi>Empory</hi> do the Merchants of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> barter their Commodities; the <hi>Pariſians</hi> making both their paſſage and return by theſe Iſles; which if wel aided by a ſmal power from the Kings Navy, would quickly bring that entercourſe to nothing. An opportunity neglected by our former Kings in their attempts upon that Nation, at not being then ſo powerfull on the Seas as now they are, but likely for the future to be husbanded to the beſt advantage, if the <hi>French</hi> hereafter ſtir againſt us. Sure I am, that my Lord of <hi>Danby</hi> conceived this courſe of all others to be the fitteſt, for the impoveriſhing if not undoing of the <hi>French;</hi> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made propoſition by his Letters to the Councell, that a ſquadron of eight Ships <hi>(viz</hi> five of the <hi>Whelpes,</hi> the <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> the <hi>Adventure</hi> and the <hi>Catch)</hi> might be employed about theſe Iſlands for that purpoſe. An advice which had this Summer
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:55011:172"/>
took effect, had not the Peace between both Realms, been ſo ſuddenly concluded.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe, four only are inhabited, and thoſe reduced only unto two Governments; <hi>Jarſey</hi> an entire Province as it were within it ſelf; but that of <hi>Gueruzey</hi> having the other two of <hi>Alderney</hi> and <hi>Serke</hi> dependant on it. Hence it is, that in our Hiſtories, and in our Acts of Parliament, we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only of <hi>Jarſey</hi> and of <hi>Guernzey,</hi> this laſt comprehending under it the two other. The people of them all live as it were in <hi>libera custodia,</hi> in a kind of free ſubjection; not any way acquainted with Taxes, or with any levies either of men or money. In ſo much, that when the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> contribute towards the occaſion of their Princes, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a proviſo in the Act, <q>That this grant of Subſidies or any thing therein contained, extend not to charge the inhabitants of <hi>Guernzey</hi> and <hi>Jarſey,</hi> or any of them, of, for or concerning any Mannors, Lands, and Tenements, or other poſſeſſions, Goods, Chattels, or other moveable ſubſtance, which they the ſaid Inhabitants, or any other to their uſes, have within <hi>Jarſey</hi> and <hi>Guernzey,</hi> or in any of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> Theſe priviledges and immunities (together with divers others) ſeconded of late dayes with the more powerfull band of Religion, have been a principall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that conſtancy, wherewith they have perſiſted faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in their allegiance, and diſclaimed even the very name and thought of <hi>France.</hi> For howſoever the language which they ſpeak is <hi>French,</hi> and that in their originall, they either were of <hi>Normandy</hi> or <hi>Britagne;</hi> yet can they with no patience endure to be accounted <hi>French,</hi> but call themſelves by the names of <hi>Engliſh-Normans.</hi> So much doth liberty, or at the worſt a gentle yoak, prevail upon the mind and fancy of the people.</p>
                     <p>To proceed unto particulars, we will take them as they lie in order, beginning firſt with that of <hi>Alderney,</hi> an Iſland called by <hi>Antonine, Arica,</hi> but by the <hi>French</hi> and in our old Records known by the name of <hi>Aurigny</hi> and <hi>Aurney.</hi> It is ſituate in the 49 degree between 48 &amp; 52 minutes of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, juſt over againſt the Cape or promontory of the <hi>Lexobii,</hi> called at this time by the Mariners the <hi>Hague.</hi> Diſtant from
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:55011:172"/>

A Town it hath of well-near an hundred fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and not far off, an haven made in the manner of a ſemicircle, which they call <hi>Crabbie.</hi> The principall ſtrength of it, are the high rocks, with which it is on every ſide envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned, but eſpecially upon the South; and on the Eaſt ſide an old Block houſe, which time hath made almoſt unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable. The chief houſe herein belongeth unto the <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlains,</hi> as alſo the dominion or Fee-farme of all the Iſland, it being granted by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> unto <hi>George</hi> the ſon of Sir <hi>Leonard Chamberlain,</hi> then Governour of <hi>Guernzey,</hi> by whoſe valour it was recovered from the <hi>French,</hi> who in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes had ſeized upon it. Neer unto the Fort or Block-houſe afore mentioned, a great quantity of this little Iſland is overlaid with ſand, driven thither by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Four leagues from hence, and to the Southweſt and by weſt, lyeth another of the ſmaller Iſlands, called <hi>Serke;</hi> ſix miles in circuit at the leaſt, which yet is two miles leſſer in the whole compaſſe then that of <hi>Alderney.</hi> An Iſle not known at all by any name amongſt the Antients, and no marvail, for till the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

But then, it pleaſed her Majeſty to grant it for ever in Fee farme to <hi>Helier de Carteret,</hi> vulgarly called <hi>Seigneur de St. Oen,</hi> a principall Gentleman of the Iſle of <hi>Jarſey,</hi> and Grandfather to Sir <hi>Philip de Carteret</hi> now living. By him it was divided into ſeverall eſtates, and leaſed out unto divers Tenants, collected from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Iſlands, ſo that at this day it may contain ſome forty houſholds; whereas before it contained only a poor her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage, together with a little Chappell appertaining to it; the reſt of the ground ſerving as a Common unto thoſe
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:55011:173"/>
of <hi>Guernzey</hi> for the breeding of their Cattell. For ſtrength it is beholding moſt to nature, who hath walled it in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner round with mighty rocks, there being but one way or aſcent unto it, and that with ſmall forces eaſie to be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt the ſtrongeſt power in Chriſtendome. A paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage lately fortified by the Farmers here, with a new plat-forme on the top of it, and thereupon ſome four pieces of Ordinance continually mounted. In this Iſland, as alſo in the other, there is a Bailiff and a Miniſter, but both of them ſubordinate in matter of appeal unto the Courts and <hi>Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies</hi> of <hi>Guernzey.</hi>

                     <p>During the reign of the late Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who for her husband <hi>Philips</hi> ſake, had engaged her ſelf in a war againſt the <hi>French;</hi> this Iſland then not peopled, was ſuddenly ſurprized by thoſe of that Nation, but by a Gentleman of the Netherlands, a ſubject of King <hi>Philips</hi> thus regained, as the ſtory much to this purpoſe is related by Sir <hi>Wal. Raleigh.</hi> The <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Gentleman with a ſmall Bark came to Anchor in the road, and pretending the death of his Merchant, beſought the <hi>French</hi> that they might bury him in the Chappell of that Iſland, offering a preſent to them of ſuch commodity as they had aboard. To this requeſt the <hi>French</hi> were eaſily entreated, but yet upon condition that they ſhould not come on ſhoar with any weapon, no not ſo much as with a knife. This leave obtained, the <hi>Fleming</hi> rowed unto the ſhoar with a Coffin in their Skiffe for that uſe purpoſely provided, and manned with Swords and Arcubuiſhes. Upon their landing, and a ſearch ſo ſtrict and narrow, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to hide a pen-knife; they were permitted to draw their Coffin up the Rocks, ſome of the <hi>French</hi> rowing back unto the Ship to fetch the preſent, where they were ſoon made faſt enough and laid in hold. The <hi>Flemings</hi> in the mean time which were on land, had carryed their Coffin into the Chappell, and having taken thence their weapons, gave an alarme upon the <hi>French,</hi> who taken thus upon the ſuddain, and ſeeing no hopes of ſuccour from their fellowes, yeelded themſelves, and abandoned the poſſeſſion of that place. A ſtratagem to be compared, if not preferred, unto any of the Ancients; did not that fatall folly reprehended once by

In this circuit are comprehended ten Pariſhes, whereof the principall is that of St. <hi>Peters</hi> on the Sea, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a fair and ſafe peer adjoyning to it for the benefit of their Merchants, and being honoured alſo with a Market, and the <hi>Plaidery</hi> or Court of Juſtice. The number of the Inhabitants is reckoned neer about twenty thouſand, out of which there may be raiſed ſome two thouſand able men; although their trained Band conſiſts only of twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and thoſe, God knows, but poorly weaponed. The aire hereof is very healthfull, as may be well ſeen in the long lives both of men and women; and the earth ſaid to be of the ſame nature with <hi>Crete</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> not apt to foſter any venemous creature in it. Out of which generall affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we may do well to except <hi>Witches,</hi> of whom the people here have ſtrange reports, and if an Ox or Horſe perhaps miſcarry, they preſently impute it to <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> and the next old woman ſhall ſtraight be hal'd to Priſon. The ground it ſelf, in the opinion of the Natives, more rich and battle then that of <hi>Jarſey;</hi> yet not ſo fruitfull in the harveſt, becauſe the people addict themſelves to merchandiſe eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, leaving the care of husbandry unto their hindes. Yet Bread they have ſufficient for their uſe; enough of Cattell both for themſelves and for their ſhips; plenty of Fiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually brought in from the neighbour ſeas, and a Lake on the Northweſt part of it, neer unto the ſea, of about a mile or more in compaſſe, exceeding well ſtored with Carpes, the beſt that ever mortall eye beheld, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Some other Iſles yet there be pertaining unto this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Guernzey,</hi> but not many nor much famous. Two of them lie along betwixt it and <hi>Serke, viz.

                     <p>But indeed, the principall honour and glory of this Iſland, I mean of <hi>Guernzey,</hi> is the large capaciouſneſſe of the harbour, and the flouriſhing beauty of the Caſtle; I ſay the Caſtle, as it may ſo be called by way of eminency, that in the vale, and thoſe poorer trifles all along the Coaſts, not any way deſerving to be ſpoken of. Situate it is upon a little Iſlet juſt oppoſite unto <hi>Pierport</hi> or the Town of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> on the Sea; to which, and to the peere there it is a good aſſurance, and takes up the whole circuit of that Iſlet whereupon it ſtandeth. At the firſt it was built upon the higher part of the ground only, broad at the one end, and at the other, and bending in the faſhion of an horne, whence it had the name of <hi>Cornet.</hi> By Sir <hi>Leonard Chamberlane</hi>
                        <pb n="299" facs="tcp:55011:174"/>
Governour here in the time of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and by Sir <hi>Thomas Leighton</hi> his ſucceſſour in the reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it was improved to that majeſty and beauty that now, it hath, excellently fortified according to the moderne art of war, and furniſhed with almoſt an hundred piece of Ordinance, whereof about ſixty are of Braſſe. Add to this, that it is continually environed with the Sea, unleſſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at a dead-low water, whereby there is ſo little poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of making any approaches neer unto it, that one might juſtly think him mad, that would attempt it. And certainly it is more then neceſſary that this place ſhould be thus fortified, if not for the ſafety of the Iſland, yet at the leaſt for the aſſurance of the Harbour. An harbour able to contain the greateſt Navy that ever failed upon the Ocean; fenced from the fury of the winds by the Iſles of <hi>Guernzey, Jet-how, Serke</hi> and <hi>Arvie,</hi> by which it is almoſt encompaſſed; and of ſo ſure an anchorage, that though our Ships lay there in the bluſtering end of <hi>March,</hi> yet it was noted that never any of them ſlipped an anchour. Other Havens they have about the Iſland, <hi>viz. Bazon, L' Aucreſſe, Fermines</hi> and <hi>others;</hi> but theſe rather landing places to let in the Enemy, then any way advantageous to the trade and riches of the people. A place not to be neglected in the defence of it; and full of danger to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> State and Trafick, were it in the hands of any enemy.</p>
                     <p>Upon the notable advantage of this harbour, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of the Peer ſo neer unto it, which is alſo warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſix peece of good Canon from the Town; it is no marvell if the people betake themſelves ſo much unto the trade of Merchandiſe. Nor do they trafick only in ſmall boats between St <hi>Malos</hi> and the Iſlands, as thoſe of <hi>Jarſey;</hi> but are Maſters of good ſtout Barks, and venture unto all theſe neerer Ports of Chriſtendom. The principall commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity which they uſe to ſend abroad, are the works and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the poorer ſort, as Waſt-cotes, Stockins, and other manufactures made of wool, wherein they are exceeding cunning; of which wooll to be tranſported to their Iſland in a certain proportion, they lately have obtained a licence of our Princes. But there accreweth a further benefit unto
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:55011:175"/>
this people, from their harbour then their own trafick, which is the continuall concourſe and reſort of Merchants thither, eſpecially upon the noiſe or being of a War. For by an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient priviledge of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> there is with them in a manner a continuall truce; and lawfull it is both for <hi>French</hi> men and for others, how hot ſoever the war be followed in other parts, to repair hither without danger, and here to trade in all ſecurity. A priviledge founded upon a Bull of Pope <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> IV. the 10 year, as I remember, of his Popedom; <hi>Edward</hi> IV. then reigning in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. over the <hi>French:</hi> by virtue of which Bull, all thoſe ſtand <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, which any way moleſt the Inhabitants of this Iſle of <hi>Guerazey,</hi> or any which reſort unto their Iſland, either by Piracy or any other violence whatſoever.

The copy of this Bull my ſelf have ſeen, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what alſo in the practiſe of it on record; by which it doth appear, that a man of war of <hi>France</hi> having taken an <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhip, and therein ſome paſſengers and goods of <hi>Guern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zey;</hi> made prize and priſoners of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored theſe of <hi>Guernzey</hi> to their liberty and to their own.</p>
                     <p>And now at laſt after a long paſſage, and through many difficulties, we are Anchored in the Iſle of <hi>Jarſey;</hi> known in the former ages, and to <hi>Antonine</hi> the Emperor, by the name of <hi>Ceſarea.</hi> An Iſland ſituate in the 49 degree of Latitude, between the 18 and 24 minutes of that degree; diſtant 5 leagues only from the Coaſt of <hi>Normandy,</hi> 40 or thereabouts from the neereſt parts of <hi>England,</hi> and 6 or 7 to the South eaſt from that of <hi>Guernzey.</hi> The figure of it will hold proportion with that long kind of ſquare, which the <hi>Geometricians</hi> call <hi>Oblongum;</hi> the length of it from Weſt to Eaſt 11 miles, the breadth 6 and upwards, the whole circuit about 33.

                     <p>Both Iſlands conſiſt very much of ſmall Incloſure, every man in each of them, having ſomewhat to live on of his own. Only the difference is, that here the mounds are made with ditches &amp; banks of earth caſt up, well fenced and planted with ſeveral ſorts of apples, out of which they make a pleaſing kinde of Sider, which is their ordinary drink; whereas in <hi>Guernzey</hi> they are for the moſt part made of ſtones, about the height and faſhion of a <hi>Parapet.</hi> A matter of no ſmall advantage in both places againſt the fury of an enemy, who in his marches cannot but be much annoyed with theſe incombrances, and ſhall be forced to pay deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for every foot of ground which there he purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>
                     <p>For other ſtrengths this Iſland is in part beholding unto Nature, and ſomewhat alſo unto Art.

There is, indeed, one of them, and that the principall, ſufficiently aſſured; on the one ſide by a little <hi>Blockhouſe,</hi> which they call <hi>Mount St. Aubin;</hi> and on the other by a fair Caſtle, called the Fort <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth.</hi> The Harbour it ſelf is of a good capacity, in figure like a ſemicircle or a creſcent, and by reaſon of the Town adjoyning, known by the name of the Haven of St. <hi>Hilaries.</hi> On that ſide o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is for the moſt part the inhabitatiou of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, who is Captain of it; ſtored with about ſome forty pieces of Ordinance, and guarded by ſome five and twenty wardours.

Add to this, that the people here are more poor, and therefore more deſtitute of humanity; the children here continually craving almes of every ſtranger; whereas in all <hi>Guernzey</hi> I did not ſee one begger.</p>
                     <p>A principall reaſon of which poverty, I ſuppoſe to be their exceeding populouſneſſe, there being reckoned in ſo ſmall a quantity of ground, neer upon thirty thouſand li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſouls. A matter which gave us no ſmall cauſe of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and when my Lord of <hi>Danby</hi> ſeemed to wonder, how ſuch a ſpan of earth could contain ſuch multitudes of people, I remember that Sir <hi>John Payton</hi> the Lieutenant Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, made him this anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> That the people mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried within themſelves like Conies in a burrow; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that for more then thirty years they never had been moleſted either with Sword, Peſtilence, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond reaſon of their poverty (add alſo of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers) may be the little liking they have to Trafick; whereby as they might have advantage to improve themſelves, and employ their poor; ſo alſo might that ſervice caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diminiſh their huge multitudes, by the loſſe of ſome men, and diverting others from the thought of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
                     <p>But the main cauſe, as I conceive it, is the tenure of their Lands, which are equally to be divided amongſt all the Sons of every Father, and thoſe parcels alſo to be ſubdivided even <hi>ad infinitnm.</hi> Hence is it, that in all the Countries you ſhall hardly finde a field of Corne of larger compaſſe then an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Garden; every one now having a little to himſelf, and that little made leſſe to his poſterity. This Tenure our Lawyers call by the name of <hi>Gavel-kinde;</hi> that is, as ſome of them expound it, <hi>Give all-kinne,</hi> becauſe it is amongſt them all to be divided.

the one ſide hath many priviledges, and on the other ſide as many inconveniences.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, they which hold in this Tenure, are free from all cuſtomary ſervices, exempt from wardſhip, at full age when they come to 15 years, and if they pleaſe, they may alienate their eſtates either by gift or ſale, without the aſſent or knowledge of the Lord. But which is moſt of all, in caſe the Father be attaint of Felony or Murder, there is no <hi>Eſcheat</hi> of it to the Lord; the whole Eſtate, after the King hath had <hi>Diem annum &amp; vaſtum,</hi> deſcending on the Heires. <hi>Et post annum &amp; diem terrae &amp; tenementa reddentur, &amp; revertentur porximo haeredi cui debuerant deſcendiſſe, ſi felonia facta non fuiſſet;</hi> ſo the Lawyers.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, by this means their eſtates are infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtracted, their houſes impoveriſhed, the Kings profits in his Subſidies diminiſhed, and no little diſadvantage to the publick ſervice, in the finding of Armours for the Wars. Whereupon, as many Gentlemen of <hi>Kent</hi> have altered by eſpeciall Acts of Parliament, the antient Tenure of their Lands, and reduced it unto <hi>Knights-ſervice;</hi> ſo is it wiſhed by the better ſort of this people, and intended by ſome of them, that their Tenure may be alſo altered and brought into the ſame condition.

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:55011:185"/>
not as particularly appertaining to thoſe Pariſhes againſt which they are diſpoſed.</p>
                     <p>For the better underſtanding of this <hi>Diagram,</hi> there are <note place="margin">(10) What is meant by Deſerts,</note> three words which need a commentary, as being meerly Aliens to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue, and hardly <hi>Denizens</hi> in <hi>French.</hi> Of theſe, that in the <hi>Diagrams</hi> called the <hi>Deſerts,</hi> is the firſt. A word which properly ſignifieth a Wilderneſſe, or any waſt ground from which ariſeth little profit. As it is taken at this preſent and on this occaſion, it ſignifieth a field which formerly was laid to waſte, and is now made arable. The caſe this: At the ſuppreſſion of the <hi>Priors Aliens</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition made betwixt the Curates and the Governours, there was in either Iſland much ground of ſmall advantage to the Church or to the owner, which they called <hi>Les De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts.</hi> But the Countreys after growing populous, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mouths requiring much proviſion, theſe Deſerts were broke up and turned into tillage. Hereupon the Curates made challenge to the tithes, as not at all either intended or contained in the former compoſition. The Governours on the other ſide alleadging cuſtome, that thoſe grounds had never paid the Tithe, and therefore ſhould not. Nor could the <hi>Clergy</hi> there obtain their rights untill the happy entrance of King <hi>James</hi> upon theſe Kingdoms. A Prince of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a moſt indulgent father to the Church. By him and by a letter Decretory from the Counſell, it was adjudged in favour of the Miniſtery; the Letter bearing date at <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich June</hi> the laſt, <hi>anno</hi> 1608. ſubſcribed <hi>T. Elleſmere Canc. R. Salisbury, H. Northampton, E. Worceſter, T. Suffolke, Exeter Zeuch, Wotton, Ceſar, Herbert.</hi> A matter certainly of much importance in the conſequence, as making known unto your Lordſhip how eaſie a thing it is in the authority royall to free the Church from that tyranny of <hi>cuſtome</hi> and <hi>preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> under which it groneth.</p>
                     <p>The next of theſe three words to be explained, is in the <note place="margin">French Quer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rui,</note> note <hi>French Querrui,</hi> which in the note is told us to be the 8 and 9 ſheaf; by which account or way of tithing, the Miniſter in 50 ſheafs receiveth 6, which is one ſheaf more then the ordinary tithe. The word corrupted, as I <note place="margin">and by</note>
                        <pb n="322" facs="tcp:55011:186"/>
conceive, from the <hi>French</hi> word <hi>Charrue,</hi> which ſignifieth a Plough, and then <hi>French querrui</hi> is as much as Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, alluding to the cuſtome of ſome Lords in <hi>France,</hi> who uſed to give their husbandmen or villains, as a guerdon for their toyle, the 8 and 9 of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
                     <p>As for the laſt, that, <hi>viz.</hi> which the <hi>Diagram</hi> calleth <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,</hi> it intimates in the origination of the word, a part or <note place="margin">Champart.</note> portion of the field, that which the Lord in chief reſerved unto himſelf.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Guernzey</hi> it is conſtantly the 12 ſheaf of the whole crop, the Farmer in the counting of his ſheafes caſting aſide the 10 for the King, and the 12 which is the Champart, for the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Now here in <hi>Guernzey</hi> (for thoſe of the other Iſle have no ſuch cuſtome) there is a double <hi>Champart,</hi> that namely <hi>Du Roy,</hi> belonging to the King, whereof the Clergy have the tithe, and that of St. <hi>Michael en leval,</hi> not titheable. The reaſon is, becauſe at the ſuppreſſion of the Priorie of St. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi> which was the only <hi>Religious houſe</hi> in theſe Iſlands, which ſubſiſted of it ſelf; the Tenants made no tendry of this <hi>Champart,</hi> and ſo it lay amongſt <hi>concealments.</hi> At the laſt, Sir <hi>Thomas Leighton</hi> the Governour here recovered it unto the Crown by courſe of Law, and at his own charges; whereupon the Queen licenced him to make ſale of it, to his beſt advantage, which accordingly he did.</p>
                     <p>For the Religion in theſe Iſlands, it hath been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuch as that profeſſed with us in <hi>England,</hi> and as <note place="margin">(11) The alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in theſe Iſlands.</note> much varied. When the <hi>Priors Aliens</hi> were baniſhed <hi>England</hi> by King <hi>Henry</hi> V. they alſo were exiled from hence. Upon the demolition of our Abbeys; the Priory of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> and that little Oratory of our <hi>Lady of Lehu,</hi> became a ruine. The <hi>Maſſe</hi> was here alſo trodden down whileſt King <hi>Edward</hi> ſtood, and raiſed again at the exaltation of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> Nay even that fiery tryall, which ſo many of Gods ſervants under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went in the ſhort Reign of that miſguided Lady, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:55011:186"/>
even unto theſe poor Iſlanders; and that, as I conceive, in a more fearfull tragedy, then any, all that time preſented on the Stage of <hi>England.</hi> The ſtory in the brief is this;</p>

                        <hi>Guernzey,</hi> was noted to be much abſent from the Church, and her two daughters guilty of the ſame neglect. Upon this they were preſented before <hi>Jaques Amy</hi> then Dean of the Iſland, who finding in them, that they held opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions contrary unto thoſe then allowed, about the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Altar, pronounced them <hi>Hereticks</hi> and condemned them to the fire. The poor women on the other ſide pleaded for themſelves, that that Doctrine had been taught them in the time of King <hi>Edward;</hi> but if the Queen was otherwiſe diſpoſed, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be of her Religion. This was fair, but this would not ſerve; for by the Dean they were delivered unto <hi>Elier Goſſelin</hi> the then Bailiffe, and by him unto the fire, <hi>July 18. Anno Dom.</hi> 1556. One of theſe daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Perotine Maſſey</hi> ſhe was called, was at that time great with childe; her husband, which was a Miniſter, being, in thoſe dangerous times, fled the Iſland; in the middle of the flames and anguiſh of her torments, her belly brake in ſunder, and her child, a goodly boy, fell down into the fire, but was preſently ſnatched up by one <hi>W. Houſe</hi> one of the by-ſtanders. Upon the noiſe of this ſtrange accident, the cruell Bailiffe retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned command, that the poor Infant muſt be caſt again into the flames; which was accordingly performed; and ſo that pretty babe was borne a Martyr, and added to the number of the <hi>Holy Innocents.</hi> A cruelty not paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leld in any ſtory, not heard of amongſt the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But ſuch was the pleaſure of the Magiſtate, as one in the Maſſacre of the younger <hi>Maximinus,</hi> viz. <hi>Canis peſſimi ne catulum eſſe relinquendum;</hi> that not any iſſue ſhould be left alive of an Heretick Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>

                     <p>This fit of indignation being thus paſſed over, I can proceed with greater patience to the reſt of the ſtory of this Iſland, which in brief is this:</p>
                     <p>That after the death of Queen <hi>Many,</hi> Religion was <note place="margin">(3) The Iſlands an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto the Dioceſe of <hi>Wint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                              </gap>,</hi> and for what Reaſons.</note> again reſtored in the reformation of it to theſe Iſlands. In which ſtate it hath ever ſince continued in the main and ſubſtance of it; but not without ſome alteration in the circumſtance and forme of Government. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as notwithſtanding the alteration of Religion in theſe Iſlands they ſtill continued under the Dioceſe of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> during the whole Empire of King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. and <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. yet it ſeemed good to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> upon ſome reaſons of State, to annex them unto that of <hi>Winton.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt motive of it was, becauſe that Biſhop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to abjure the pretended power which the Pope chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth in Kingdomes, as other of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelates did; but this diſpleaſure held not long. For preſently upon a conſideration of much ſervice and intelligence which might reaſonably be expected from that Prelate, as having ſuch a neceſſary dependence on this Crown, they were again per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>At the laſt, and if I well remember, about the 12 year of that excellent Ladies Reign, at the perſwaſion of Sir <hi>Amias Paulet,</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho. Leighton</hi> then Governours, they were for ever united unto <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> The pretences that
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:55011:188"/>
ſo there might a fairer way be opened to the <hi>reformation</hi> of Religion; to which that Biſhop was an enemy, and that the ſecrets of the State might not be carryed over into <hi>France,</hi> by reaſon of that entercourſe which needs muſt be between a Biſhop and his Miniſters. The truth is, they were both reſolved to ſettle the <hi>Geneva</hi> diſcipline in every Pariſh in each Iſland; for which cauſe they had ſent for <hi>Snape</hi> and <hi>Cartwright,</hi> thoſe great incendiaries of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church to lay the ground-work of that building. Add to this that there was ſome glimmering alſo of a Confiſcation in the ruine of the Deanries; with the ſpoyles whereof they held it fit to enrich their Governments. Matters not poſſible to be effected, had he of <hi>Conſtance</hi> continued in his place and power. But of this more in the next Chapter.</p>

                     <p>THus having ſhewed unto your Lordſhip the affairs <note place="margin">(1) The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> under their Biſhop.</note> and condition of theſe Churches till the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Religion; I come next in the courſe of my deſigne, unto that Innovation made amongſt them in the point of Diſcipline. For the more happy diſpatch of which buſineſſe, I muſt crave leave to aſcend a little higher into the ſtory of change, then the introduction of it into thoſe little Iſlands. So doing, I ſhall give your Lordſhip better ſatisfaction, then if I ſhould immediately deſcend upon that Argument; the rather becauſe I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver nothing in this diſcourſe not warranted to be by the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:55011:189"/>
chief contrivers of the Diſcipline. To begin then with the firſt originall and commencement of it; ſo it is that it took the firſt beginning at a City of the <hi>Allobroges</hi> or <hi>Savoyards,</hi> called <hi>Geneva,</hi> and by that name mentioned in the firſt of <hi>Ceſars</hi> Commentaries. A Town ſituate at the end of <hi>Lacus Lemannus,</hi> and divided by <hi>Rhodanus</hi> or <hi>Rhoſne</hi> into two parts. Belonging formerly in the Soveraignty of it to the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> but in the profits and poſſeſſion to their Biſhop and homager of that Dukedome. To this Biſhop then there appertained not only an Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, as Governour of the Church under the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Vienna,</hi> in <hi>Daulphinoys</hi> his Metropolitane; but a juriſdiction alſo temporall, as Lord and Maſter of the Town under the protection of the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> This granted by the teſtimony of <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Epiſtle unto Cardinall <hi>Sadolet,</hi> dated the laſt of <hi>Auguſt 1539. Habebat ſane</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>jus gladii, &amp; alias civilis juriſdictionis partes;</hi> but as he conceived, I know not on what grounds, <hi>Magiſtratui ereptas,</hi> fraudulently taken from the Civill Magiſtrate.</p>
                     <p>In this condition it continued till the year 1528. when <note place="margin">(2) The altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there both in Religion,</note> thoſe of <hi>Berne,</hi> after a publick diſputation held, had made an alteration in Religion. At that time <hi>Viret</hi> and <hi>Farel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> men ſtudious of the Reformation had gotten footing in <hi>Geneva,</hi> and diligently there ſollicited the cauſe and entertainment of it. But this propoſall not plauſibly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the Biſhop, they dealt with thoſe of the lower rank, amongſt whom they had gotten moſt credit, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king opportunity by the actions and example of thoſe of <hi>Berne,</hi> they compelled the Biſhop and his Clergy to abandon the Town, and after proceeded to the reforming of his <note place="margin">and</note> Church. This alſo avowed by <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Epiſtle to the ſaid Cardinall, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Church had been reformed and ſetled before his coming into thoſe quarters by <hi>Viret</hi> and <hi>Farellus,</hi> and that he only had approved of their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, <hi>Sed quia quae a</hi> Vireto <hi>&amp;</hi> Farello <hi>facta eſſent, ſuffragio meo comprobavi,</hi> &amp;c. as he there hath it.</p>
                     <p>Nor did they only in that tumult alter the Doctrine and <note place="margin">(<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The power and dominion of that City thus put into the <note place="margin">(4) The eſtate of that Church before the coming of <hi>Calvin</hi> thither.</note> hands of the common people, and all things left at liberty and randome, it could not be expected that there ſhould any diſcipline [be] obſerved, or good order in the Church. The Common-councell of the Town diſpoſed of it as they pleaſed; and if any crime which antiently belonged to Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, did h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>p to be committed, it was puniſhed by order from that Councell. No cenſures Eccleſiaſticall, no ſentence of Excommunication thought on at that time, either here at <hi>Geneva,</hi> or in any other of the popular Churches. <hi>Si quidem excommunicationi in aliis Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiis nullus locus,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> hath it in the life of <hi>Calvin.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Miniſters of <hi>Zurich</hi> affirmes no leſſe in theſe words, <hi>viz. Nec me latet pies &amp; doctos eſſe homines, quibus ſub principibus Chriſtianis non videtur eſſe neceſſaria Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatio;</hi> ſo he.</p>
                     <p>Thus was it with the Church and City of <hi>Geneva</hi> at the <note place="margin">(5) The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</note> firſt coming of <hi>Calvin</hi> to them; a man of excellent abilities, and one that had attained a good repute in many places of the <hi>French</hi> dominions.

For thus himſelf in his Epiſtle above mentioned unto <hi>Sadolet, Diſciplinam qualem vetus habuit Eccleſia apud nos non eſſe [dicis]; ne<expan>

                     <p>The Diſcipline hitherto was only in conception, before it came unto maturity, and ready for the birth, the people weary of this new yoak began to murmur, and he reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent not to vary from his firſt purpoſe, was in that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment baniſhed the Town, together with <hi>Farellus</hi> and <hi>Coraldus</hi> his colleagues, <hi>anno</hi> 1538.

A deſire to which by no means he would hearken, unleſſe both they and all their Miniſters would take a ſolemn oath to admit a compleat forme of diſcipline, not arbitrary, not changeable; but to remain in force for ever after. Upon aſſurance of their conformity herein, he returns unto them <note place="margin">and</note> like an other <hi>Tully</hi> unto <hi>Rome;</hi> and certainly we may ſay of him as the Hiſtorian of the other, <hi>Nec quiſquam aut expulſus eſt invid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

and <hi>Abſolution</hi> did properly belong to them. Upon this he is again reſolved to quit the Town; but at laſt the Controverſie is by joynt conſent referred unto the judgement of four Cities of the <hi>Switzers.</hi> Then did he labour in particular to conſider of it, not as a matter of ordinary conſequence, but (as in his ſaid Epiſtle to thoſe in <hi>Zurich) De toto Eccleſiae hujus ſtatu,</hi> &amp;c. ſuch as on which the whole being of that Church depended. In the end he ſo contrived it, that the anſwer was returned to <hi>Geneva, Nil contra tentandum;</hi> that they ſhould not ſeek to alter what was ſo well eſtabliſhed; and hereupon they were all conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to obey.

For ſo the cunning Architect had contrived it, that for every pillar of the Church, there ſhould be alſo two Pillaſters, or rather underproppers of the people. <hi>Non ſolos verbi Miniſtros ſedere judices in conſiſtorio; ſed numerum duplo majorem, partim ex mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nori ſenatu, partim ex majori delige;</hi> ſo he in his Remonſtrance unto them of <hi>Zurich,</hi> affixed to his Epiſtle.

In this he doth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently expreſſe his deſire to have his project entertained; in that which followeth he doth ſignifie his joy that the world had made it welcome. An epiſtle written to a certain <hi>Quidam</hi> of <hi>Polonia,</hi> dated the year 1561. Wherein he doth congratulate the admiſſion of the Goſpell (as he cals it) in that Kingdom.

On the other ſide, they take unto themſelves, the deſignation of all thoſe, which bear publick office in the Church: Chap. 3 7. The appointing and proclaiming all publick faſts: Chap. 11. 1. The preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in their Aſſemblies: Chap. 16. 1. The calling of their Councels: Chap. 19. 20. Matters in which conſiſts the life of Soveraignty.

years old, he ever diſliked their opinions: and as the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world</hi> had ſaid, <hi>though he lived among them, he was not of them.</hi> In this conference alſo, that ſo memorized <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pophthegm</hi> of his Majeſty: <hi>No Biſhop,</hi> no King: and anon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, My Lords the Biſhops (faith he) <hi>I may thank ye, that theſe men</hi> (the <hi>Puritans) plead thus for my Supremacy.</hi> Add to this, that his Majeſty had alwaies foſtred in himſelf a pious purpoſe, not only of reducing all his Realms and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into one uniform order and courſe of diſcipline; which thing himſelf avoweth, in his Letters Patents unto thoſe of <hi>Jarzey:</hi> but alſo to eſtabliſh in all the reformed Churches, if poſſibly it might be done; together with unity of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and uniformity of devotion. For which cauſe he had commanded the <hi>Engliſh Liturgie</hi> to be tranſlated into the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> and alſo into moſt of the national Languages round about us: by that and other more private means, to bring them into a love and good opinion of our Government: which he oftentimes acknowledged to <hi>have been approved by manifold bleſſings from God himſelf.</hi> A heroick purpoſe, and worthy of the Prince from whom it came.</p>
                     <p>This notwithſtanding, that he was enclined the other way; yet upon ſuit made by thoſe of theſe Iſlands, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed unto them their preſent orders, by a Letter under his private Seal, dated the 8. of <hi>August</hi> in the firſt year of his reign in <hi>England;</hi> which Letters were communicated in the Synod at St. <hi>Hilaries</hi> the 18. of <hi>September,</hi> 1605. the Letter written in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue; but the tenor of them was as followeth:</p>

                     <p>The reaſons which moved this Prince to aſſent unto a form of Government, which he liked not; was partly an ancient rule and precept of his own, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Princes at their firſt entrance to a Grown ought not to innovate the government preſently eſtabliſhed.</hi> But the principal cauſe indeed, was deſire not to diſcourage the <hi>Scots</hi> in their beginnings: or to lay open too much of his intents at once unto them. For ſince the year 1595. his Majeſty wearied with the confuſions of the <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> in that Church eſtabliſhed; had much buſied himſelf in reſtoring their antient place and power unto the Biſhops. He had already brought that work ſo forwards, that the <hi>Scottiſh Miniſters</hi> had admitted of 13 Commiſſioners (which was the antient number of the Biſhops) to have ſuffrage in the <hi>Parliament;</hi> and to repreſent in that Aſſembly the body of the Clergy: and that their place ſhould be perpetual. Thus far with ſome trouble, but much art, he had prevailed on that unquiet and unruly company: and therefore had he denied the Iſlanders an allowance of their <hi>Diſcipline;</hi> he had only taught the <hi>Scottiſh Miniſtery</hi> what to truſt to. An al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance whereof he after made eſpecial uſe in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings with that people. For thus his Majeſty in a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration concerning ſuch of the <hi>Scottiſh Miniſters,</hi> as lay at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted of High Treaſon, <hi>Anno 1606. viz.</hi>

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:55011:215"/>
and how dangerous alterations are without good advice and mature deliberation; and that even in matters of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Church, in ſome ſmall Iſland under our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, we have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>On theſe reaſons, or on ſome other not within the power of my conjecture; this Diſcipline was permitted in theſe Iſlands: though long it did not continue with them. For preſently upon his Majeſties comming to the Crown, Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> then Governor of <hi>Jarzey</hi> was attaint of Treaſon: on which attaindure this with others of his places, fell actually into the Kings diſpoſing: upon this variancy, it pleaſed his Majeſty to depute the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Sir <hi>John Peiton,</hi> to that office: A Gentleman not over forward in himſelf, to purſue the projects of the <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets</hi> his predeceſſors, (for Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> had but a little while poſſeſſed the place) and it may well be furniſhed alſo with ſome ſecret inſtructions from the King, not to be too indulgent to that party. Whether that ſo it was or not, I cannot ſay: Sure I am that he omitted no opportunity of abating in the <hi>Conſiſtorians</hi> the pride and ſtomach of their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction. But long it was not before he found a fit occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to place his battery againſt thoſe works; which in the Iſland there they thought impregnable. For as in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proverb, <hi>Facile eſt invenire baculum ut caedas canem:</hi> it is an eaſie thing to quarrell one, whom before hand we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to baffle. The occaſion this. The Curate of S. <hi>Johns</hi> being lately dead, it pleaſed the <hi>Colloquie</hi> of that Iſland, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their former method; to appoint one <hi>Brevin</hi> to ſucceed him: againſt which courſe, the Governor, the Kings Attorney and other the officers of the Crown pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted; as prejudicial to the rights and profits of the King. Howbeit, the caſe was over-ruled; and the <hi>Colloquie</hi> for that time carried it: hereupon a bill of Articles was exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited unto the Councel againſt the Miniſters, by <hi>Peiton</hi> the Governor, <hi>Marret</hi> the Attorney, <hi>now one</hi> of the Jurates, and the reſt: as <hi>viz.</hi> that they had uſurped the <hi>Patronage</hi> of all benefices in the Iſland; that thereby they admitted men to
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:55011:216"/>
livings without any form of pretentation; that thereby they deprived his Majeſty of Vacancies and firſt-fruits; that by connivence (to ſay no worſe of it) of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Governors, they exerciſed a kinde of arbitrary juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, making and diſannulling lawes at their own uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain liberty; whereupon they moſt humbly beſought his Majeſty to grant them ſuch a diſcipline, as might be fitteſt to the nature of the place, and leſſe derogatory to the Royal <hi>Prerogative.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Bill exhibited unto the Councell, found there ſuch approbation, that preſently Sir <hi>Robert Gardiner,</hi> once chief Juſtice, (as I take it) in the <hi>Realm of Ireland;</hi> and <hi>James Huſſey</hi> Doctor of the Lawes; though not without ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer buſineſſe; were ſent into the Iſlands. Againſt their coming into <hi>Jarzey,</hi> the Miniſters of that Iſland had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Anſwer; which in the general may be reduced to theſe two heads; <hi>viz.</hi> That their appointment of men into the Miniſtery, and the exerciſe of Juriſdiction being prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal parts of the Church Diſcipline; had been confirmed unto them by his Majeſty. And for the matter of Firſt-fruits, it was a payment which had never been exacted from them; ſince their diſcharge from him at <hi>Conſtance;</hi> unto whom in former times they had been due. Upon this anſwer the buſineſſe was again remitted unto the King, and to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell; by them to be determined upon the comming of their Deputies: the Committees not having (as they ſaid) a power to determine it; but only to inſtruct themſelves in the whole cauſe, and accordingly to make report. Other matters within the compaſſe of their Commiſſion, and about which they were ſaid principally to be ſent over, were then concluded: all which hapned in the year 1608. Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the departure of theſe Commiſſioners; and long before their Deputies had any faculty to repair unto the Court: a foul deformity of confuſion and diſtraction had overgrown the Church and <hi>Diſcipline.</hi> In former times all ſuch as took upon them any publick charge either in Church or Common-wealth, had bound themſelves by oath to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and maintain the <hi>Diſcipline:</hi> that oath is now diſclaimed as dangerous and unwarrantable. Before it was their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:55011:216"/>
to exact <hi>ſubſcription</hi> to their platform, of all ſuch as purpoſed to receive the <hi>Sacrament:</hi> but now the Kings <hi>Attorney,</hi> and others of that party, choſe rather to abſtain from the Communion; nay even the very <hi>Elders</hi> ſilly ſouls, that thought themſelves as <hi>Sacroſancti</hi> as a <hi>Roman Tribune:</hi> were drown with proces into the civil courts; and there reputed with the vulgar. Nor was the caſe much better with the <hi>Conſiſtory:</hi> the <hi>Jurates</hi> in their <hi>Cohu</hi> or Town-hall, relieving ſuch by their authority, whom that <hi>Tribunal</hi> had condemned or cenſured. <hi>A pravis ad praecipitia.</hi> Such is the inhumanity of the world, that when once a man is caſt upon his knees, every one-lends a hand to lay him proſtrate. No ſooner had thoſe of the lower rank, obſerved the Miniſters to ſtagger in their chairs; but they inſtantly begin to wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle for the Tithes: and if the Curate will exact his due; the Law is open, let them try the Title. Their Benefices, where before accounted as excempt and priviledged, are brought to reckon for <hi>firſt-fruits</hi> and <hi>tenths:</hi> and thoſe not rated by the book of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> but by the will and pleaſure of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. Adde unto this, that one of the <hi>Conſtables</hi> preferred a Bill againſt them in the <hi>Cohu:</hi> wherein the Miniſters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were <hi>indicted</hi> of <hi>hypocriſie;</hi> and their government of <hi>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</hi> And which of all the reſt was the greateſt of their miſeries; it was objected that they held ſecret meetings and private practiſes againſt the Governor: yea ſuch as reflected alſo on the King.</p>
                     <p>In thi confuſion and diſtreſſe they were almoſt uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of counſel. They applyed themſelves in the next <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquie</hi> unto the Governor, that he would pleaſe to intercede for them to his Majeſty: but him they had ſo far exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their clamours, that he utterly refuſed to meddle for them. Nor did the Miniſters, as I conjecture, propound it farther to him, then by way of due reſpect: as little hoping that he ſhould bend himſelf for their relief; whom they ſo often had accuſed to be the cauſe of all this trouble. At laſt they are reſolved to caſt themſelves upon the grace and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the King; and for that cauſe addreſſed themſelves and their deſires unto the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> a man, at that time of ſpecial credit with the King, being alſo <hi>Lord High
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:55011:217"/>
Treaſurer,</hi> and chief Secretary. This their addreſſe as he took in ſpecial good regard; ſo did he alſo ſeem to adviſe them for the beſt: his counſel, that they ſhould joyn unto them thoſe of <hi>Guernzey,</hi> in the peruſing of their <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and the correcting of ſuch things moſt ſtomacked by the Civil Magiſtrates: and after, both together to refer themſelves unto his Majeſty. A counſel not to be deſpiſed in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance: but yet (as certainly he was of a fine and ſubtil wit) of exceeding cunning. For by this means the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe not yet ripe, and the King ſcarce maſter of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes in <hi>Scotland;</hi> he gains time farther to conſider of the main: and by ingaging thoſe of <hi>Guernzey</hi> in the cauſe, they alſo had been ſubject to the ſame concluſion: But ſubtil as he was, he found no art to protract the fatal and inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blow of death; for whileſt his Clients buſily purſued this project, in reviewing of their platform, he yeelded up himſelf unto the grave, <hi>March 24. anno</hi> 1612. upon report whereof, they layed by the proſecution of that buſineſſe; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of it to the mercy of ſome better times.</p>
                     <p>This comfort yet they found in their addreſſe unto the Court, that things at home were carried on in a more fair and quiet courſe: but long they would not ſuffer themſelves to enjoy that happineſſe. The Pariſh of S. <hi>Peters</hi> being void, <hi>Meſſerny</hi> was preſented to it by the Governour: one that had ſpent his time in <hi>Oxenford,</hi> and had received the Orders of the Prieſthood from the Right Reverend Doctor <hi>Bridges,</hi> then Biſhop of that Dioceſſe. A matter ſo infinitely ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macked by the <hi>Colloquie,</hi> that they would by no means yeeld to his admiſſion: not ſo much becauſe of his preſentation from the Governor, as of his ordination from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. For now they thought <hi>Annibalem ad portas,</hi> that Popery began again to creep upon them: and therefore they reſolved to fight it out, <hi>tanquam de ſumma rerum,</hi> as if the whole cauſe of Religion were in danger. <hi>Meſſerny</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever enjoyed the profits of the living; and a new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was made againſt them to the Councel: In which complaint, there alſo was intelligence given unto their Lordſhips, that the inhabitants generally of the Iſle, were diſcontented with the <hi>Diſcipline<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="385" facs="tcp:55011:217"/>
Church: and that the moſt of them would eaſily admit the form of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government; that ſome of them did deſire it. The matter thus grown ready for an iſſue, and his Majeſty deſirous to bring all things to the moſt peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and quiet end; both parties were commanded to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at Court: the Governor and ſecular ſtates, to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their ſuit, and make good their intelligence; the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to anſwer the complaints, and tender their propoſals. Hereupon the Governor and thoſe of the laity delegated to the Court, <hi>Marret</hi> the <hi>Attorney,</hi> and <hi>Meſſervy</hi> the new Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of St. <hi>Peters:</hi> by whom the people ſent a formal Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Majeſty, ſigned by many of their hands; and to this purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that he would be pleaſed to eſtabliſh in their Iſland, the book of Common-prayers; and to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle there among them ſome Eccleſiaſtical Officer, with <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi> juriſdiction. On the other ſide, there were deputed, for the Miniſters, Mr. <hi>Bandinell,</hi> the now Dean; <hi>Oliveis,</hi> the now Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Immediately upon their appearance at the Court, both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by his Majeſty were referred to the Councel: and by them again to my Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Lord <hi>Zouche,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Herbert,</hi> then principal Secretary. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them the cauſe was privately argued by the Deputies of both parties: and the deſires of the Governor and of the people, conſtantly impugned by the Miniſters. But as it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies hapneth that there is no confederacy ſo well joyned, but one member of it may be ſevered from the reſt; and thereby the whole practiſe overthrown: ſo was it alſo in this buſineſſe. For thoſe which there ſollicited ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate buſineſſe of the Governors, had finely wrought upon the weakneſſe or ambition of <hi>De la place;</hi> bearing him in hand, that if the Government of the Church were altered, and the office of the Dean reſtored; he was for certain
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:55011:218"/>
reſolved upon to be the man. Being faſhioned into this hope, he ſpeedily betrayed the counſels of his fellowes; and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their opponents at all their enterviews, with ſuch intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence as might make moſt for their advantage. At laſt the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters not well agreeing in their own demands, and having little to ſay in the defence of their proper cauſe, whereto their anſwers were not provided beforehand; my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> at the Councel-table thus declared unto them the pleaſure of the King and Councell: <hi>viz.</hi> that for the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy redreſſe of their diſorders, it was reputed moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to eſtabliſh among them, the authority and office of the Dean; that the book of Common-prayer being again printed in the <hi>French</hi> ſhould be received into their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; but the Miniſters not tyed to the ſtrict obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of it in all particulars: that <hi>Meſſerny</hi> ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his benefice; and that ſo they might return unto their charges.</p>
                     <p>This ſaid, they were commanded to depart, and to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to thoſe from whom the came, they full ſcope of his Majeſties reſolution; and ſo they did. But being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what backward in obeying this decree, the Councel inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to them by Sir <hi>Phil. de Carteret</hi> their Agent for the Eſtates of the Iſland; that the Miniſters from among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſhould make choice of three learned and grave per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe names they ſhould return unto the board: out of which his Majeſty would reſolve on one to be their Dean. A propoſition which found among them little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. Not ſo much out of diſlike unto the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for they were moſt of them well contented with the change: but becauſe every one of them conceived hopeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of himſelf to be the man, and all of them could not be elected; they were not willing to prejudice their own hopes, by the naming of another.

as a perſon anſwerable to the Governors commendations; he was eſtabliſhed in that office by Letters Patents from his Majeſty, dated the 8. of <hi>March, anno</hi> 1619. and was inveſted with all ſuch rights as formerly had been inherent in that dignity: and that both in point of profit; and alſo in point of juriſdiction. For whereas formerly the Dean was ſetled in the beſt benefice in the Iſland, that <hi>viz.</hi> of St <hi>Martins;</hi> and had divers portions of tithes out of every of the Pariſhes: the ſaid St. <hi>Martins</hi> was allotted to him, upon the next avoidance; and the whole tithes of St. <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> allowed him, in conſideration of his ſeveral parcels.

                     </argument>
                     <p>I Now am come unto the fourth and laſt part of this diſcourſe, intended once to have been framed by way of ſuit unto your Lordſhip, in the behalf of the other Iſland not yet weaned from the breaſts of their late mother of <hi>Geneva.</hi> But finding that courſe not capable of thoſe particulars which are to follow; I choſe rather to purſue that purpoſe by way of declaration. My ſcope and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to lay before your Lordſhip ſuch reaſons which may encite you to make uſe of that favour which moſt worthily you have attained to with his Majeſty, in the reduction of this Iſle of <hi>Guernzey</hi> to that antient order by which it formerly was guided, and wherein it held moſt conformity with the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Before I enter on with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, I ſhall remove a doubt which might be raiſed about
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:55011:231"/>
this buſineſſe; as <hi>viz.</hi> For what cauſe his late moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Majeſty proceeded to this alteration in one Iſland, not in both; and being reſolved to try his forces on the one only; why he ſhould rather ſort out <hi>Jarſey.</hi> A doubt without great difficulty to be cleared. For had his Majeſty attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted both at once, the Miniſters of both Iſlands had then communicated counſels, banded themſelves in a league, and by a mutuall encouragement continued more peremptory to their old <hi>Mumpſimus.</hi> It is an antient principle in the arts of Empire, <hi>Divide &amp; impera;</hi> and well noted by the <hi>State-hiſtorian,</hi> that nothing more advantaged the affaires of <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Britaine,</hi> then that the natives never met together to reaſon of the common danger. <hi>Ita dum ſinguli pugnabant, univerſi vincebantur.</hi> And on the other ſide his Majeſty ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw for certain, that if one Iſland once were taken off, the other might with greater eaſe be perſwaded to conforme. Being reſolved then to attempt them ſingle, there was good reaſon why he ſhould begin with <hi>Jarſey</hi> firſt, as unto which he was to ſend a new Governour, not yet ingaged unto a party, and pliable to his inſtructions. Whereas Sir <hi>Tho. Leighton</hi> ſtill continued in his charge at <hi>Guernzey,</hi> who having had ſo main a hand in the introduction of the Plat-forme, could not be brought with any ſtomach to intend an alteration of his own counſels.</p>
                     <p>But not to loſe my ſelf in the ſearch of Princes coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, which commonly are too far removed from vulgar eyes, let us content our ſelves with knowing the event; which was, that by his means the Iſle of <hi>Jarſey</hi> was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto a Diſcipline conformable to that of <hi>England,</hi> and thereby an eaſie way for the reforming alſo that in <hi>Guern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zey.</hi> For the accompliſhment of which deſigne, may it pleaſe your Lordſhip to take notice of theſe reaſons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, by which it is within my hopes, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip poſſibly may be perſwaded to deal in it. <hi>A Jove princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And here (as in a Chriſtian duty I am bound) I propoſe unto your Lordſhip in the firſt place, the honour which will redound unto the Lord in this particular, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of a <hi>Diſcipline</hi> unto the ſmalleſt <hi>Oratory</hi> of his Church,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:55011:232"/>
which you aſſure your ſelf to be moſt anſwerable to his holy word, and to the practice of thoſe bleſſed ſpirits the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> For why may not I ſay unto your Lordſhip, as <hi>Mardochaus</hi> once to <hi>Heſter,</hi> though the caſe be ſomewhat different, <hi>Who knoweth whether you be come unto theſe dignities, for ſuch a time as this?</hi> And why may it not be ſaid of you even in the application unto this particular deſignment, <hi>That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom ſo much is given, of him alſo ſhall much be required?</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate exployts and undertakings are expected even from private perſons. But God hath raiſed up you to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick honours, and therefore looks that you ſhould ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him in the advancement and undertaking of ſuch counſels as may concern his Church in publick. And certainly, if (as I verily perſwade my ſelf) your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels tend unto the peace and glory of the Chureh; the Church, I mean, whereof you are ſo principall a member: You ſhall not eaſily encounter with an object, whereon your counſels may be better buſied. So ſtrangely do theſe men diſgrace your bleſſed Mother, <hi>and lay her glory in the duſt.</hi> Two inſtances hereof I ſhall preſent unto your Lordſhip to ſet the better edge on your proceedings, though otherwiſe I had forborne to meddle with particulars. It pleaſed his Majeſty for the aſſurance of theſe Iſlands, to ſend into each of them two Companies of Souldiers, which were equally diſtributed. But ſuch was the peeviſh obſtinacy of one of the Miniſters of this <hi>Guernzey,</hi> that he would not allow their Miniſter to read prayers unto them in his Church, at ſuch times when himſelf and people did not uſe it. At laſt on much entreaty he was contented to permit it, but with expreſſe condition, that he ſhould not either read the <hi>Litany,</hi> or adminiſter the <hi>Communion.</hi> Since when, as often as they purpoſe to receive the Sacrament, they have been compelled to ferry over to the Caſtle, and in the great hall there celebrate the holy <hi>Supper.</hi> As little is our Church beholding to them in her <hi>Feſtivals,</hi> as in her <hi>Liturgie.</hi> For whereas, at the Town of St. <hi>Peters</hi> on the Sea, they have a Lecture every Thurſday, upon which day the Feaſt of Chriſts Nativity was ſolemnized with us in <hi>England, anno</hi> 1623. the ſame party choſe rather to put off the Sermon
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:55011:232"/>
for that time, then that any the ſmal leſt honour might reflect upon the day. <hi>O curvae in terris animae, &amp; coeleſtium inanes.</hi> An oppoſition far more ſuperſtitious then any ceremony, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a day, though meerly <hi>Jewiſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Next to the honour due to God and to his Church, is that which all of us are obliged to tender to our Princes, as being Gods by office, and <hi>nurſing fathers</hi> of that Church whereof they are. Therefore I repreſent in the next rank unto your Lordſhip a conſideration of the honour which you ſhall here in do unto your Kings. To the one, your late Maſter of happy memory, who gave you firſt his hand to guide you unto greatneſſe, in the purſuit of his intendments. So glorious were the purpoſes of that Heroick Prince, for the ſecure and flouriſhing tranquillity of Gods holy Church, that certainly it were impiety if any of them be permitted to miſcarry. To the other our now gratious Soveraign, who hath doubled the promotions conferred upon you by his father; in being an author to him of thoſe thoughts which may ſo much redound unto his glory; the rather, becauſe, in caſe his Majeſty ſhould find a time convenient to go forward in his Fathers project, of reducing all the Churches <hi>Proteſtant</hi> unto one <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Liturgie;</hi> there might not an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thwart him, drawn from home.

                     <p>Beſides the honour due to God, the Church, and to the King, there is an honour next in order to the calling of the Prieſt. A calling, as much ſtomached in generall by all that party, ſo moſt eſpecially reviled by thoſe amongſt our ſelves for <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> tyrannous, a diveliſh ordinance a baſtardly
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:55011:233"/>
government, and the like. Nor do I think that thoſe of <hi>Guernzey</hi> are better affected to it, though more moderate in profeſſing their diſlike: for did they but approve the hierarchy of Biſhops, they would not then proceed ſo unwarrantably as now they do, in the ordination of their Miniſters. I cal it unwarrantable proceeding, becauſe the lawful and ordinary door of entrance unto the Miniſtery, was never ſhut unto this people; and therefore their prepoſterous entry upon this ſacred calling, either by the <hi>back-door</hi> or by the <hi>window,</hi> the more unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Whereas it may be pleaded in the behalf of thoſe in ſome parts beyond the ſeas, that they could not meet with any Biſhops which would give them <hi>ordination,</hi> unleſſe they would abjure the Goſpell as they then profeſt it, and therefore that neceſſity compelled them to the private way of <hi>impoſing hands</hi> on one another. In which particular, the caſe of ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, may not unfitly be reſembled unto that of <hi>Scipio,</hi> as it is related to us in the third book of <hi>Valerius Max. cap.</hi> 7. upon ſome want of money for the furtherance of the neceſſary affaires of ſtate, he demanded a ſupply from the common treaſury. But when the <hi>Queſtor</hi> pretending that it was againſt the Lawes, refuſed to open it, himſelf a private perſon, ſeiſed the Keyes, <hi>Patefacto aerario legem utilitati cedere coegit;</hi> and over-ruled the Law by the advancement of the Weal publick. In like manner (which is I think the moſt and beſt that can be ſaid in this behalf) to promote the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Religion, many good men made ſuit to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed out of the common treaſury, to be admitted to the preaching of the word according to the ordinary courſe of <hi>ordination;</hi> which when it was denied them by the <hi>Queſtors</hi> or <hi>Prelates</hi> of thoſe dayes; they choſe rather to receive it at the hands of private and inferior Prieſts, then that the Church ſhould be unfurniſhed. This may be ſaid for them, which in excuſe of thoſe of <hi>Guernzey</hi> can never be alleadged; whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall recourſe unto theſe <hi>private keyes</hi> is done upon no other reaſon then a diſlike of that high calling to which your Lordſhip is advanced; which therefore you are bound, if not to puniſh in them, yet to rectifie.</p>
                     <p>Two other reaſons yet there are which may invite your Lordſhip to this undertaking, though not ſo weighty or of
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:55011:233"/>
that importance as the former. The one, that the remainders of that party here at home, may not be hardned in their obſtinacy; the other, that thoſe of <hi>Jarſey,</hi> be not diſcouraged in their ſubmiſſion and conformity. I have already ſhewn unto your Lordſhip, that the brethren here in <hi>England,</hi> never made head againſt the Church, till the permiſſion of plat-forme in theſe Iſlands. After which, with what violence they did aſſaile the hierarchy, what clamorus they continually raiſed againſt the Prelates, what ſuperſtitions and impieties they imputed to our <hi>Liturgy; notius eſt quam ut ſtylo egeat,</hi> is too wel known to be related. If ſo, then queſtionleſs it cannot but confirme them in their new devices, to ſee them ſtill permitted to this Iſle. Nor can they think themſelves but wronged, that ſtill they are contrould and cenſured for the maintenance of that diſcipline, which is by Soveraign authority allowed and licenſed; though in other places, yet in the ſame dominions. And on the other ſide, your Lordſhip may conceive how juſt a cauſe of diſcontent and of repining it may be to thoſe of <hi>Jarſey;</hi> when they ſhall dayly hear it thundred from the Coaſts of <hi>France,</hi> that faintly they have ſold themſelves to bondage; whereas the faithfull zelots in the Iſle of <hi>Guernzey,</hi> doe ſtill preſerve themſelves in liberty. <hi>Vel ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>From my firſt rank of motives here preſented to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which I may moſt properly call <hi>motives neceſſary,</hi> and in reſpect unto the cauſe; I come next to thoſe of an other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which I call <hi>motives</hi> of <hi>conveniency,</hi> and in relation to the time. For queſtionleſſe the time is at this preſent more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the accompliſhment of this work, then ever we may hope to ſee hereafter; whether we conſider it in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto our Kingdome, or to the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> it ſelf, or to the Governour, or to the people of both ſorts, the Clergy and the Magiſtrates.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, there is at this inſtant, an eſtabliſhed peace between it and <hi>France,</hi> concluded on while we were in theſe Iſlands, and publiſhed immediately on our coming home; which Realm only carryeth a covetous and watchfull eye upon thoſe Iſlands. Were it between us, as it lately was, nothing but wars and depredations; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he alteration then perhaps might
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:55011:234"/>
be unſafe, it being alwayes dangerous to diſcontent or charge that Nation, upon whoſe loyalty we muſt rely. Nor can I tell unto what deſperate and undutifull practiſes, the furious heat of ſome few Preachers may poſſibly excite a multitude; when come the worſt that can, there is an enemy at hand that will ſubſcribe to any articles. But now tis peace, and how long peace will hold, is not eaſie to determine, depending as it doth, upon the will and pleaſure of another.</p>
                     <p>If, in the ſecond place, we look upon the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> it ſelf, we ſhall find it well prepared, and ready for a change. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is ordered in their <hi>Canons</hi> (if I ſo may call them) that the errours of the <hi>Conſiſtory</hi> ſhall be corrected by the <hi>Colloquie</hi> thoſe of the <hi>Colloquie,</hi> by the <hi>Synod;</hi> by the departure of <hi>Jarſey</hi> from them, they have no way of further <hi>Synods,</hi> and therefore no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe of grivances. So then either the ſentence of the <hi>Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie</hi> muſt be unalterable, which is expreſly contrary to the platforme; or elſe there muſt be granted ſome other <hi>juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to have power above them, whereby their cenſures may be moderated. The firſt of theſe would eſtate their <hi>Colloquies</hi> in a tyranny more prevalent and binding, then the chair of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo much complained of. The other openeth a way for the entrance of <hi>Epiſcopall</hi> authority, for the admiſſion of <hi>Appeals,</hi> for the directions of their proceedings. Add hereunto, that at this time they have a noble Governour, no friend I am aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to any of that party; and ſuch a one which gladly would reſign thoſe rights of old belonging to the <hi>Deanry,</hi> when ever it ſhall pleaſe his Majeſty to reſtore that dignity unto the Iſland. A Peer ſo perfectly known unto your Lordſhip and to all the Kingdom, that I need not ſay more of him, then that which once <hi>Velleius</hi> did of <hi>Junius Blaeſus, Vir neſcias an utilior Caſtris, vel melior toga.</hi> It were a matter of no ordinary ſtudy to determine, whether he be more able in the <hi>Campe</hi> or <hi>Senate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in alterations, ſuch as theſe, the fancy and affection of the people is principally to be attended, as thoſe whom ſuch <hi>mutations</hi> moſt properly concern; wherein I find all things made ready to your Lordſhips hand, if you vouchſafe to ſet it forwards. The Magiſtrates and more underſtanding people of the Iſle, offended with the ſevere and unſociable carriage of

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had enough to keep themſelves from cenſure, and their houſes from the diligence of <hi>Conſiſtoriall</hi> ſpies; when yet there was an higher Court wherein there was ſome hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. But there being none to appeal from in the <hi>Conſiſtory,</hi> but thoſe which wil condemn them in the <hi>Colloquie,</hi> they undergo the yoak with much clamour, but with more ſtomach. A ſtomach which eſtſoones they ſpare not to diſgorge upon them, as often, <hi>viz.</hi> as they come within the compaſſe of their Courts, either in way of puniſhment or cenſure. On the other ſide the Miniſters exclaime againſt the Magiſtrates, as preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming too far above their latchet; pretending that by them their <hi>Diſcipline</hi> hath been infringed, their priviledges violated, and their Miniſtery interrupted. Matters that have not been repined at only in a corner, but publickly preſented as on the Theater, and complained of to their Governours. For at my Lord of <hi>Danbies</hi> being there, they articled againſt the Magiſtrates for invading the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction;</hi> as <hi>viz.</hi> that they take upon them to diſſolve <hi>contracts</hi> made in the preſence of the Miniſter, and with an invocation of the name of God, which in judgment of the <hi>Diſcipline (Chap.</hi> 12. 1.) are <hi>undiſſoluble.</hi> That they had intermedled with the adminiſtration of holy <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> a duty meerly ſpirituall. That they had ſeiſed upon the treaſures of the Church in ſome places, and diſpoſed of them at their pleaſure. That they had cauſed the Miniſters to be impriſoned, and there detained them for a long time, to their great diſcomfort, and the hazard of their <hi>flooks.</hi> And laſtly that they had deprived them of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Natives in denying them their ſuffrages for the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Curates.</hi> Other grievances there were, but theſe the principall. True it is, that upon due examination of particulars, it did appear that the Magiſtrates had more reaſon in their actions, then the Miniſters in their complaints. But not having been accuſtomed to the like uſage, they do eſteem it a thraldome ſo incompetent and unſupportable, that I perſwade my ſelf they ſooner would reſolve to yeeld to any courſe, then have their doings croft by that <hi>tribunall.</hi> Sure I am, when they found ſo ſmall redreſſe for theſe (as they
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:55011:235"/>
conceived) great oppreſſions, they made petition to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to bethink himſelf on ſome other way for their relief, and laboured to procure me to be their Mediator to his Lordſhip in it.</p>
                     <p>Theſe circumſtances alſo happily concurring, portend, in my opinion, as great an alteration in this ſtate <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> as the conjunction of ſome powerfull Planets doth ſometimes upon the temporall. And if your Lordſhip ſhould be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting now unto preſent opportunity, it may be ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of preparatives and helps may hardly be met withall hereafter. Preſuming therefore, that your Lordſhip will not neglect the advantage offered, I ſhould next proceed unto thoſe means which might beſt be uſed in the effecting of this work; but what were this but to read a lecture of the wars to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> to play a part on the Stage in the ſight of <hi>Roſcius?</hi> For whether your Lordſhip ſhall think moſt fit to treat firſt of it with my Lord the Governour, that he may make plain the way before you, and facilitate the buſineſſe; or whether it may be thought moſt proper, that ſome negotiate with the people and the <hi>Jurates,</hi> to commence a ſuit in this behalf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Councell; or whether that the Miniſters themſelves, in this conjuncture of time, oppreſſed, as they conceive it, by the Civill Magiſtrates encroaching on them, may not with great facility be perſwaded to ſollicite for a change; who can ſo well determine as your Lordſhip, whom long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and naturall abilities have made perfect in theſe arts? Only let me beſeech your Lordſhips leave to enjoy mine own folly, and for a while to act my part, to read my lecture, though <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Roſcius</hi> be in preſence.</p>
                     <p>At ſuch time as by the Miniſters his Lordſhip was petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to reſolve upon ſome courſe for their relief; they made requeſt to me to ſollicite for them their deſires, to be a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer for them to his Lordſhip. To which I anſwered, that I could direct them in a way which ſhould for ever free them from that yoak which ſo much they feared, and if they would vouchſafe to ſee my Chamber, I would there impart it. A motion not made unto the wals, or loſt in the propoſall; for down unto my Lodging they deſcended, and there we joyned our ſelves in Councell. The Petitioners were five in number,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:55011:235"/>
                        <hi>viz. De la March, Millet, Perchard, Picote,</hi> and <hi>De la Place;</hi> my ſelf alone, and not provided (ſave in Wine and Sider) for their entertainment. But as <hi>Lactantius</hi> in an equall caſe, <hi>Neceſſe eſt, ut me cauſae bonitas fac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>at eloquentem;</hi> preſuming on the goodneſſe of my cauſe, but more upon their ignorance, I was reſolved to bid them battail. Immediately upon the opening of the Counſell, I was importuned my opinion; whereto I freely made them anſwer, the only courſe whereby they might ſubſiſt entire and free from bondage, was to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs themſelves to his Majeſty for the reſtitution of the <hi>Dean.</hi> But this ſay they is Phyſick worſe then the diſeaſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the battails began to joyn with greater violence; with violence it was, and therefore (as we are inſtructed in <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy)</hi> of no long continuance; for preſently upon the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter their ranks were broken, and their forces diſunited. <hi>Picote</hi> for his part proteſted, that he had alwayes been an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to <hi>Lay Elders,</hi> and that he could not ſee by what authority of Scripture they were permitted in the Churches. <hi>Perchard</hi> was well enough content, that the diſpenſing of the poor mans box might be committed unto others, and that the <hi>Deacons</hi> as being a degree or ſtep unto the Miniſtery, might be employed about the treaſures of ſalvation. <hi>Millet</hi> ſtood ſilent all the while, and as I think reſerved himſelf to try the fortune of another day. <hi>De la March</hi> and <hi>De la Place</hi> (this <hi>De la Place</hi> is he who aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned <hi>Jarſey</hi> upon his failing of the <hi>Deanſhip)</hi> what they could not make good by reaſon, ſupplied by obſtinacy. In my life I never knew men more willing to betray a cauſe, or leſſe able to maintain it. My inference hereupon is this, that if his Majeſty ſhould ſignifie unto them, that it is his royall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to admit a <hi>Dean</hi> among them, or elſe repair unto the Court to give a reaſon of their refuſall; they ſooner would forſake and quit their cauſe, then either be reſolved to agree about it, or venture to defend it. If I were ſure to make no uſe of <hi>Logick,</hi> till theſe men ſhal run the hazard of a <hi>diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> I would preſently go and burn my <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To draw unto an end, for I have been too tedious to your Lordſhip. Before I pluck off my diſguiſe and leave the ſtage whereon I act, I could me thinks add ſomewhat here about the choicing of a man moſt fit for this authority. In which
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:55011:236"/>
particular, as I ſtand well affected to <hi>Perchard,</hi> for a moderate and quiet man, ſo hath he alſo a good repute in all the Iſland, both for his vein of Preaching, his liberall hoſpitality, and plauſible demeanor. Or if your Lordſhip think a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainer more fit, there being now the Pariſh of St. <hi>Saviours</hi> void, and ſo full room for that <hi>induction,</hi> I durſt propoſe to you <hi>Olivier</hi> of <hi>Jarſey;</hi> a man which I perſwade my ſelf, I may ſay ſafely, not inferiour unto any of both Iſlands in point of Scholarſhip, and well affected to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Add to this that already he is acquainted with the nature of the place, as having executed the office of the <hi>Commiſſary</hi> or <hi>Subdean,</hi> ever ſince the introduction of the charge, and therefore not to ſeek in the managing and cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his juriſdiction. But good God! what follies do we dayly run into, when we conceive our ſelves to be diſguiſed, and that our actions are not noted? It is therefore high time for me to unmaske my ſelf, and humbly crave your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips pardon, that under any habit I ſhould take upon me to adviſe. A further <hi>plaudite</hi> then this I do not ſeek for, then that you will vouchſafe to excuſe my boldneſſe, though not allow it: the rather becauſe a zeal unto the beauteous uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the Church did prompt me to it. But this, and this diſcourſe, ſuch as it is, I conſecrate unto your Lordſhip; for whoſe honour, next under Gods, I have principally pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued this argument. For my ſelf, it will be unto me ſufficient glory, that I had any, though the leaſt, hand in ſuch a pious work; and ſhall be happy, if in this, or in any other your Lordſhips counſels for the Churches peace, I may be worthy of imployment. Nor need your Lordſhip fear, that in the proſecution of this project, you may be charged with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation. To purſue this purpoſe is not to introduce a <hi>novelty</hi> but to reſtore a <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> to revive the perfect ſervice of God, which ſo long hath been, to ſay the beſt of it, in a <hi>Lethargy,</hi> and to make the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh Empire,</hi> like a <hi>City which is at unity within it ſelf.</hi>
