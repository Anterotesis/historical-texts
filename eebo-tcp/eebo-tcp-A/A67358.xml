            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE have recieved a Letter from Lt. Col. <hi>Puckle</hi> Governor of <hi>Ross,</hi> and in it one from you to him, dated at <hi>Duncannon;</hi> wherein you require him to preserve <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>
Garrison for the Parliament: He had done that before he had any Orders from you to do it. We wish you had rather sent Orders of that nature to your Sub<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>tute
Col. <hi>Jones,</hi> when he so long and so openly acted against the Parliaments Authority; than to Lt. Col. <hi>Puckle,</hi> who, you could not but know, had <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>gether with us declared for it. When you were in this Bay, you recieved an Assurance under all our hands, That we had declared (as in duty bound) for <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
Parliament, whose commands both concerning you and our selves, we would cheerfully and punctually obey; But you write to Lt. Col. <hi>Puckle,</hi> That we had set up for o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>selves; We will not say, that you have set up for your self, though your staying, if not acting, amongst those who had set up for themselves at <hi>London;</hi> your never declaring <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
the Parliament, when most of the Army here had declared against them; your poasting from the Parliament, when you your self write they were to fit within a day or two; a<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
your now casting your self into that onely place, in this Nation, which hath not, together with us, declared for the Parliament: might, we say, give us a juster rise to belie<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
you had set up for your self, than our Actings or Letters have given you cause so untruly to report of us. If you have assumed that belief concerning us, because of our not a<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>mitting you here, we hope whatever you your self are pleased to believe, all unbyassed persons will, with us, judg, it was not consistent with our duty to admit to the command
of the Parliaments Army here, (till their pleasure was signified) a person that had ever since their interruption resided among, and (we more than doubt) acted with their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
that would not stay two or three days for their sitting, to bring their commands with him; and who stands now accused before them with several Articles of Hig<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
Treason.</p>
            <p>Truly Sir, your Actings have made our suspicions but too strong. You went declaredly from hence with an Address from this Army to the Parliament; and to settle accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their commands, the Forces in this Nation: But though you met at <hi>Conway</hi> the news of their being by force kept from sitting, whereby the end you proposed by yo<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
journey, was cut off even in the beginning of it; yet you went on to those who had offered that sinfull violence. 'Tis true you say, That by a Letter you recieved from th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
factious Party, which had been guilty thereof, they intimated unto you, that a stop for the present was onely put upon their sitting, and consequently, a dore of hope was opene<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to you to bring them to their duty: but let all rational men judg, Whether it had not been a much more probable way conducing to that end, for you to have return'd to th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Army, and accompanied your persuasions with a Declaration, That if those were not listned unto, the Forces of this Nation should be imployed by you to bring them to th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
obedience, which fair means could not effect. We doubt you had too good an opinion of such men, or of the force of your own reasons, to believe that those who would n<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">

listen to the Authority and Commands of a Parliament, would be brought to their duties by the prevalencie of your particular arguings or desires. Had worthy General <hi>M<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">

we had recieved our Laws from <hi>Wallingford</hi>-house, and not from the Parliament, who onely can make and repeal them. But allow you could be so much mistaken in them a<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
That the Council of Officers at <hi>Wallingford</hi>-house, were so far from restoring the Parliament, that they voted the calling a New one, with a Senate, and one and twenty Co<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
and of a fresher date, <hi>viz.</hi> the 17. of <hi>December</hi> last, wherein you use these very words: <hi>We seem to be necessitated to look towards the Long Parliament; 'tis to be fear'd they will <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
very high, in case they should be brought in without Conditions.</hi> Let all that hear this, judg how fit that person is to command an Army of the Parliaments, that includes himse<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
amongst those who not out of willingness, but necessity, seem to be looking towards the restauration of the Parliament; and who expresses a fear they would be very high, <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
not bound up by Conditions before their admittance. Your duty had been the contrary to what your fears are; and we would gladly know, who you judged fit to put Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
upon the Parliament. But since you fear the Actings of the Parliament, unless brought in by Conditions; you teach us thereby to keep you from the Head of one of th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Parliaments Armies, least you should make use of their Forces, to secure you, and those like minded with you, from your fears: For our parts, we desired no earthly thing mor<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
than their restauration, and bless God, both our duties and innocencie makes us not fear, but desire they should fit as a Parliament, that is, without any previous Conditions pu<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
upon them. You that could fear the Parliament would be very high, in case they should be admitted without Conditions, and have associated your self of late with those, th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
moderatest of which were guilty of that Apprehension, may be suspected to have been pleased with, if not consenting to the Interruption of that Authority, whose high acting<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
are confessedly feared by you.</p>
            <p>We shall not much dwell upon the Title that you give Col. <hi>Jones,</hi> of <hi>Dear Friend,</hi> in the said Letter; though in it we cannot but observe, That 'tis not probable you would call
him by that name, if you thought he had falsified the trust you had reposed in him; and yet that he has publickly acted against the Authority of Parliament, and their Laws
could not be unknown unto you, were it onely in reference to that particular Subscription promoted, of owning the Lord <hi>Fleetwood</hi> Commander in chief of the Armies of this
Commonwealth, contrary to an express Act in that behalf, whereby from your Substitute, he became my Lord <hi>Fleetwoods;</hi> and you from Lieutenant General under the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to become Lt. General under their Enemies. If you approv'd of this Action, why should we recieve you? if you disapprov'd it, why do you give the chief promoter
of it the Title of your <hi>Dear Friend?</hi> In the same Letter also you have these words, <hi>viz. I hope ere this the Commissions for the setting of Civil justice on the wheels in Ireland, i<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
come unto your hands;</hi> which Commissions being sent by the power of those who had violated the Parliaments Authority, we might expect would rather have had your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance,
than your hope that they would come safely unto his hands. And though we love to have the wheels of Civil Justice moving: yet we as much desire to have
those wheels recieve their motion from that Authority onely which legally can give it to them: and we heartily wish you had the like Principle.</p>
            <p>That you could have come from <hi>London</hi> hither, when your mention'd hopes fail'd you, and when your Substitute Col. <hi>Iones</hi> had so egregiously acted against the Parliament
and with their Enemies, is evident, by your being now able to come into <hi>Ireland;</hi> and therefore your declining thereof so long, proves the fault lay more in your want of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
than in your want of Power; and if you had appeared active at <hi>London</hi> for the restauration of the Parliament, or earnest against those here which had neglected their
duty therein: it is not over probable you would have been permitted to have come for <hi>Ireland,</hi> which (as your own Letter imports) was well known at <hi>London</hi> before your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
thence, to have declared for the Parliament; unless those that permitted you to come for this Countrey, had believ'd your actings here (if reciev'd) would prove more
advantageous to them than to the Parliaments service. You went to <hi>London</hi> to represent things to the Parliament, and slayd there all the while that by force they were kept
from sitting; and as soon as ever (through Providence) they were restor'd to sit, you hasten away hither, without any application to them. This being the matter of Fact, we
leave it to all sober men to make the inference; We cannot indeed but admire, that having assur'd you under all our hands, whatever the Parliaments commands were concerning
you, when your case was heard by them, they should be cheerfully and readily obey'd; That you would rather elect to put things into extreams, as much as in you lay, than
