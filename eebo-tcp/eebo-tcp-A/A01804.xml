            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

A branch or limme of this miracle I haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vpon mee to describe, euen soe far forth as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth this our <hi>Britaine,</hi> and haue presumed to offer the same vnto your Majestie; as an argument, if it were well handled, not vnworthy your conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For whereas this worke consisteth of two parts, being both narrations, one reporting the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of our conuersion from <hi>Paganisme</hi> vnto <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> religion; the other containing a memoriall of the liues and actions of such as from time to time haue been the principall instruments of the propagation and continuance of that first plantation: It will lay open two poynts ministring matter of greate and most just glorie, both vnto your selfe and the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ouer which God of his goodnesse hath placed you: the first, shewing, that heere the miracle afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said

had his first operation; as the second, that heere likewise it hath found the most effectuall operation.</p>
            <p>For first, it will appeare (that which <hi>Sabellicus</hi> hath well noted) how that <hi>Omnium Prouinciarum pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, Britannia, publicitùs Christi nomen recepit</hi>;<note place="margin">Ennead: 7 lib: 5.</note> In which respect it is worthylie called <hi>Primogenita ecclesiae,</hi> the first begoten daughter of the church of God: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the godly care and judicious choyce of your Majesty, hath afforded vnto our Church such Pastors both for pietie and learning, as neither can any age past in our country, nor any other country in the world at this present, be compared justly with vs, for abundance of Preachers of Gods truth, men indued with excellent learning, and moreouer by Godlinesse of life and good example confirminge what they teach; howsoeuer by the slaunderous mouthes as well of Puritanes as Papists, imputations are dayly cast vpon vs importing the contrary. In the former of these I haue the more willingly taken paynes, by inlarging that which heeretofore I haue written to that purpose somewhat more breefly th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nowe although the consequence being so weake, the argument of it selfe falleth to the ground; yet, in as much as, going about to make good the antecedent (which is notoriously false) these men they cast a myst before our eyes in deprauing and falsifying the history of our Church: I haue thought good to indeuour, that the very truth in that behalfe may appeare, as by testimonies worthy credit and without exceptions I trust it shall.

Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by reason of a mischance in our coppy, and my absence, the Printer hath not been able to doe his duty so well, as that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges are not mistaken; I must earnestly intreate the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to take notice of the corrections; the want whereof may greatly wrong both me and himselfe. That done, I trust these my labours shall find the like acceptance as my former did; the which I must commend vnto the mercie and goodnes of our gracious God, whose name be blessed and praised now and for euermore.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:5993:17"/>
which <hi>Baronius</hi> also deliuereth) how that the messengers sent vnto <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> were named <hi>Eluanus</hi> and <hi>Meduinus:</hi> and that <hi>propter eloquentia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; scientiam in sacris Scripturis, in regard of their eloquence and knowledge in the Scriptures, Eluanus</hi> was by the said <hi>Eleutherius</hi> consecrated a Bishop, and <hi>Meduinus</hi> appointed a Doctor or teacher.</p>
               <p>The Author of the booke called <hi>Antiquitates Britannicae,</hi> out of <hi>Capgraue,</hi> and <hi>Bale</hi> out of Leland; report, how that <hi>Medwin</hi> was by birth a Dutchman, but as for <hi>Eluan,</hi> he was a Brittane brought vp in the Colledge or Monastery of <hi>Auallon</hi> amongest the Disciples and successors of <hi>Ioseph of Arimathaea</hi>; and had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed through the wilde fields of Brittane those first seedes of the Gospell sowed by the said <hi>Ioseph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether <hi>Lucius</hi> were baptized by these men, or some other sent by <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> it is not easily to be discerned. The history of <hi>Landaff</hi> aforesaid with diuers other deliuer, that it was done by <hi>Eluan</hi> and <hi>Medwyn:</hi> But by most it is affirmed, how that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutherius</hi> sent with these two before named, two other, to order the state of the Church, who had the honour of performing that office.</p>
               <p>The one of them is called by some <hi>Damianus,</hi> by other <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanus,</hi> and by other againe <hi>Deruianus, Derunianus, Dimianus, Diuianus,</hi> and <hi>Donatianus.</hi> Neither is the agreement much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about the name of the other; who is sometimes termed <hi>Faga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Fugatius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the time also of this conuersion, there is much difference amongst writers: The history of <hi>Landaff</hi> saith it was <hi>anno</hi> 156. (in which yeare <hi>Galfr. Monumeth</hi>: saies, the saide King died.) <hi>Nauclerus</hi> also setteth downe the same time, and so doth a Manuscript containing a story in Latine (but without the Authors name) now remaining in my custody. <hi>Nennius</hi> reporteth the messengers aforesaid were sent to Rome the yeare 163. mary not to <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> but to <hi>Euaristus.</hi> Another anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Chronicle of mine written in English (a large history but namelesse also,<note place="margin">

and <hi>Deruuianus</hi> arriued héere, there passed 103. yeares, by which reckoning it must fall out, they came the yeere 165. <hi>Henricus de Erfordia</hi> sayes it was the yeare 169. <hi>Marianus Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> 177. <hi>Bale</hi> 179. <hi>Polydore Virgill,</hi> 182. <hi>Baronius</hi> 183.

               <p>Whensoeuer it was that this good Prince receiued the faith of Christ; so it fell out (our histories say) that not onely his wife and family accompanied him in that happy course, but Nobles also and commons, Priests and people, high and low, euen all the people of this land which we now call England: And that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally all their Idoles where then defaced; the temples of them conuerted into Churches for the seruice of God; the liuings of their idolatrous Priests appointed for the maintainance of the Priests of the Gospell, and that in stead of the 25. Flamines, or high Priests of their Idoles, there were ordained 25. Bishops; as also for 3. Archflamines 3. Archbishops, whereof one was seated at London, another at Yorke, and a third at Carlion in Monmonthshire.</p>
               <p>Now whereas many of these points are (and not without good cause) called into question; it shall not be amisse, to spend some time in debating &amp; discussing of the same.

Super omnes autem Britannos dextralis partis Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannia, beatum Dubritium, summum doctorema Rege &amp; ab omni paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia electum Archiepiscopum, consecrauerunt.

After the saide elders had rooted out the Pelagian heresie, they consecrased Bishops in many places of Brittane. Ouer all the Brittanes dwelling on the right side of Brittaine, they consecrated for Archbishops <hi>S. Dubritius,</hi> who was chosen for the supreame Doctor, by the King and all the Diocesse. This dignity beeing bestowed vpon him by <hi>Germanus</hi> and <hi>Lupus,</hi> they, with the consent of <hi>Mouric</hi> the King, the Nobility, Clergy and people, appointed his see to be at the manner of <hi>Lantaui,</hi> and founded the same there, to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:5993:21"/>
honour of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> bounding the territories thereof in this wise. &amp;c. This was about the yeare of Christ 430. about which time also (or somewhat later) <hi>Palladius</hi> (who is falsly said to haue béen the first Preacher vnto the Scottish nation) did first appoint Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and ordaine Bishopricks in Scotland,<note place="margin">

               <p>Upon these testimonies, I reason thus; If before these times we had so many Bishops, Bishoprickes, and Archbishoprickes, how commeth it to passe, that in no monument whatsoeuer, we finde any name or mention of any Bishop of this land, sauing some few that (as we say) had their sée at London? and if so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sees had been furnished before, what occasion had <hi>Germanus</hi> and <hi>Lupus</hi> to consecrate so many Bishops as in the report of the history of Landaff before mentioned is related.</p>

               <p>Yea it séemeth also (to note by the way) that another Temple was then likewise built vnto all the Empresses consecrated after their death.

               <p>It is time for me now to say somewhat of a certaine Epistle written (as we finde deliuered) by <hi>Eleutherius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> vnto King <hi>Lucius.</hi> The copy of which Epistle was first found (for ought I can discerne) in an old Chronicle entituled <hi>Brut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Now therefore to procéed, you shall vnderstand that amongest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers terrible persecutions wherewith our Churches heere in Brittane were shaken at sundry times vnder <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and other tyrants; the most gréeuous of all others was that of the Saxons, who being Pagans and worshippers of Idoles, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, not onely Christian religion, but the followers also of the same into a corner of this Island, to wit, Wales &amp; Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, whereby it came to passe, that all the rest of our England was quite ouerwhelmed with the waues of Paganisme and Idolatry. True it is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many of the Brittanes remained here after the conquest of the Saxons: <hi>William of Malmsbury</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth the same:<note place="margin">

publicke manner. Yet priuately no doubt, many of them, they not onely in secret serued God, and kept a good conscience, but vsed their talent in seeking to draw some of the Saxons vnto the faith of Christ. This partly appeareth in <hi>Offa</hi> that (as <hi>Munster</hi> reporteth) being an English-man and of the bloud royall (it seemeth hee was sonne vnto <hi>Athelfride</hi> King of the Bernicians) was a very good Christian,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>It is manifest also by the letters of <hi>S.

They, being now well onward on their way, enquired of the State of the Country, and manner of the people vnto whom they went; and vnderstood so much of their barbarous and fierce rudenesse, as they in a manner, all vtterly renounced procéeding any further in the voyage, and as it were compelled <hi>Augustine</hi> to poste backe to <hi>Rome,</hi> there to craue licence of returne.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> much grieued with this message, writ his letters vnto them, vsing many reasons to perswade them, in any wise to goe forward; whereunto at last they yéelded.

               <p>
                  <hi>Augustine</hi> notwithstanding not discouraged with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse, procured yet another meeting, to which many more of the Brittaines repayred then vnto the first: For it was saide there were there 7.

               <p>Some time before this assembly, certaine of the Brittanes thought good to aske counsell of a certaine Anchorite whom they estéemed greatly of for his holinesse, and to know of him whether hee thought it best for them to yéeld vnto the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Augustine</hi> or no. He aduised them, if hee were a man of God, to take the course hee shewed, and to follow the same. And when they asked how they should discerne whether hée were such a one or no; hee pronounced this saying of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, <hi>Take my yoke vpon you, and learne of mee; for I am meeke and humble of heart:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  </gap> it is a great presumption that he beareth the yoke of Christ and offreth the same vnto you: But if he be stout and proud, he is not of God you may be bold.

               <p>
                  <hi>Augustine</hi> therefore first entred the place, with his banner and his crosse, with singing, procession, and great pompe; and when the Brittane Bishops came in, neuer mooued to rise or saluted them at all. This they taking very ill, gainsaid him in euery thing, exhorting one another not to yeeld a iote vnto him by any means.<note place="margin">

               <p>How well he seconded these words by déedes, let it appeare by the words of <hi>Thomas Gray</hi> that writ a Chronicle in french now well néere 300. yeares since. <hi>Aust<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>PLegmund</hi> the most excellent learned man of his time was borne in the kingdome of Mercia. In his youth hée first dedicated himselfe vnto a solitarie life and liued an Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite in the Island of Chester, which of him (as it should seeme) was woont to be called Plegmundsham. Hee was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thence to teach <hi>Alfred</hi> that was afterward king of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Being chosen Archbishop, he trauelled to Rome in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and was there consecrate. Soone after his returne (to requite belike the curtesie hee had found there) hee tooke great paines in collecting the almes of al men well disposed through the land, which the king sent together with much treasure of his owne vnto the Pope by <hi>Athelmus</hi> Bishop of Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, appointing a certaine portion of the same to bee conuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto Ierusalem. <hi>Marianus</hi> then Pope, a little before had gratified the King diuers waies: He had granted immunity of tribute vnto the Saxons schoole at Rome, and sent sundry pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents vnto him; namely (amongst other things) a péece of wood that was (as hee would make the King beléeue) part of the crosse vpon which our Sauiour suffered death. By this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution his kindnesse was sufficiently requited. The most memorable action of this Archbishop is, that the yéere 905. he consecrated seuen Bishops in one day. By reason of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all wars, all the prouince of the West Saxons had béene with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Bishop seuen yeares: Which <hi>Formosus</hi> the Pope im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting vnto the negligence of the King, sent out an excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication against him.

                  <note place="margin">1020</note> was the sonne of an Earle called <hi>Agelmare,</hi> and is said to haue béene Deane of Christchurch in Canterbury, which at that time was repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed for the most part with canons wearing the habite &amp; gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of monkes, but in profession and manner of life diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring much from them. Therefore when as in that same terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tithing of the Danes mentioned in the life of <hi>Elphege</hi> al the monkes were slaine except onely foure; the canons that were now the greater number, gaue vnto their gouernour the name of Deane. From this place <hi>Agelnoth</hi> was taken to be Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop. <hi>Malmsbury</hi> saith he was sometimes a monke of Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonbury, and therfore procured from king <hi>Knute</hi> a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the olde priuiledges of that Abbey, the charter whereof he exemplifieth <hi>De reg.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 11. Going to Rome to fetch his pal, he bought (as one reporteth) an arme of that blessed Father S. <hi>Augustine</hi> Bishop of Hippo for an hundred talents of siluer &amp; a talent of gold, and bestowed it vpon the Church of Couen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. He sustained great paines and cost in repairing his church and monastery destroyed and burnt by the Danes, and by his good aduise directed king <hi>Knute</hi> (that fauoured him exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) vnto many honourable enterprises. Hee died at last hauing sate Archbishop 17. yéeres and vpward, October 29. <hi>an.</hi> 1038.</p>

Hée was a man stout and wise e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but very vnlearned (as in a manner all the Bishops were of those times) and vnreasonable couetous. Perceiuing the King highly displeased with <hi>Robert</hi> the Archbishop, hée thrust himselfe into his roome (not expecting either his death, depriuation or other auoydence) without any performance of vsuall ceremonies. And whether it were that hee mistrusted his title to Canterbury, or inexcusable couetousnesse I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell; certaine it is, that he kept Winchester also together with Canterbury, euen vntill a little before his death hee was forced to forgoe them both.

hauing slaine king <hi>Harold</hi> in the field, all England yéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded presently vnto his obedience, except onely Kentishmen, who following the counsell of <hi>Stigand</hi> and <hi>Egelsin</hi> the Abbot of S. <hi>Augustines,</hi> gathered al their forces together at Swans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe néere Grauesend, and there attended the comming of the King (who doubted of no such matter) euery man holding a gréene bough in his hand; whereby it came to passe that hee was in the middest of them before he dreamed of any such bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse toward. Hee was greatly amazed at the first, till hée was giuen to vnderstand by <hi>Stigand,</hi> there was no hurt meant vnto him, so that hee would graunt vnto that country their ancient liberties, and suffer them to bee gouerned by their former customes and lawes, called then and till this day Gauelkind. These things hee easily yéelded vnto, vpon this armed intercession, and afterward very honourably perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: But hée conceiued so profound a displeasure against <hi>Stigand</hi> for it as he neuer ceased till hee had reuenged it with the others destruction. A while he gaue him very good counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, calling him Father, meeting him vpon the way when hee vnderstood of his repaire toward him, and affoording him all kind of gracious and fauourable vsage both in wordes and behauiour: but it lasted not long. The first signe of his hidden rancour and hatred toward him was, that hée would not suffer himselfe to bee crowned by him, but made choice of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> Archbishop of Yorke: for which hee alleadged other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as that hee had not yet receiued his pall, &amp;c. But the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was, hee was loth in that action to acknowledge him for Archbishop. Soone after his coronation, hée departed into Normandy carrying with him <hi>Stigand</hi> and many English nobles, vnder pretence to doe them honour: But in truth hee stoode in doubt least in his absence they should practise some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what against him: And namely <hi>Stigand</hi> he knew to bee a man of a haughty spirite, subtle, rich, gracious and of great power in his Country. Presently vpon his returne, certaine Cardinalls arriued in England, sent from the Pope as Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates to redresse (as they saide) certaine enormities and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the English Clergy. <hi>Stigand</hi> by and by perceiuing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to bee the marke that was specially shot at, hid himselfe a while in Scotland with <hi>Alexander</hi> Bishop of Lincolne, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:5993:47"/>
after in the Isle of Ely. At last perceiuing a conuocation to be called at Winchester, he came thither and besought the King in regard of his owne honour, and the promise made vnto him at Swanscombe (which was, not to bee offended with him or any other for their attempt at that time) to saue him from the calamity hee saw growing toward him, which hee could not impute vnto any thing so probably, as his vndeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued displeasure. The king answered him with very gentle words, that hee was so farre from endeuouring to take any reuenge of that or any other matter, as hée loued him, and wished hee knew how to protect him from the daunger immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: But that which was to bee done at that time, must bée done by the Popes authority, which hee might not counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. So do what he could, hee was depriued of his liuings by these legates. The causes alleaged against him were these; First, that he had held Canterbury and Winchester both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (which was no very strange thing; for Saint <hi>Oswald</hi> had long before held Worcester with Yorke, and S. <hi>Dunstan</hi> Worcester with London.) Secondly, that hee had inuaded the Sée of Canterbury, <hi>Robert</hi> the Archbishop beeing yet aliue vndepriued; And lastly that he presumed to vse the pall of his predecessor <hi>Robert</hi> left at Canterbury, and had neuer recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any pall but of Pope <hi>Benedict,</hi> at what time hee stood ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate for simony and other like crimes. In the same conuocation many other Prelates were depriued of their promotions as <hi>Agelmare</hi> Bishop of Helmham brother vnto <hi>Stigand,</hi> diuers Abbots and men of meaner places. All which was done by the procurement of the King, that was desirous to place his countrymen in the roomes of the depriued for the establishment of his new-gotten kingdome. Poore <hi>Stigand</hi> being thus depriued, as though he had not yet harme enough, was also clapt vp presently in prison within the Castell of Winchester, and very hardly vsed there, beeing scarcely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed meate inough to hold life and soule together. That was thought to bee done to force him to confesse where his treasure lay, whereof being demaunded, hee protested with great oathes he had no mony at all; hoping belike so to procure his liberty the rather, and then to make himselfe merry with that he had laid vp against such a déere yéere. Hée died soone

after of sorrow and griefe of minde, or (as some report) of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary famine, 17. yéeres after he first obtained the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke. After his death, a little key was found about his necke; the locke whereof being carefully sought out, shewed a nete or direction of infinite treasures hid vnder ground in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places. All that the King pursed in his owne coffers.

It is said, at his first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Pope rose vp vnto him and mette him, telling him he yeelded him that honour, not of duety, but in regard of his excellent learning, wherof he had heard great fame. <hi>Thomas</hi> Archbishop of Yorke was present the same time, together with <hi>Remigius</hi> Bishoppe of Dorchester. This <hi>Thomas</hi> had béene lately consecrated vnto Yorke by <hi>Lanfranke,</hi> and for a certaine time refused to make profession of obedience vnto the Sée of Canterbury, euen vntill by the commandement of the King he was enforced thereunto. Now whether it were discontentment and perswasion of a wrong, or else enuy at <hi>Lanfrankes</hi> eyther vertue or good fortune that moued him, hée presently beganne to make complaint vnto the Pope of a great iniury offered vnto his Sée, in the demaund of his profession. <hi>Lanfranke</hi> pleaded prescription for his right, and offered to make proofe of the same.

In that place he continued 15. yéers, &amp; then was earnestly requested by <hi>Hugh</hi> Earle of Chester lying bery sicke, to come into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land vnto him to conferre with him, and to order certaine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of his.

                  </gap>ther he came and had much honour done him euery where of all sorts of people. The King himselfe amongst the rest, beside many verball fauours, made offer vnto him of the Archbishopricke of Canterbury; verily hoping belike that a man giuen to Monasticall contemplation, &amp; not estéeming worldly pompe, would vndoubtedly haue refused the same: For it is certaine, that after <hi>Anselm</hi> had accepted the offer, pittying belike the spoil and desolation of the Church for want of a pastor; the King would faine haue retracted his gift, and perswaded him with many reasons to leaue it; shewing him how the burthen and trouble of the place was greater than hée should bée able to endure, a man that had spent his time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the wals of a Monastery, and not experienced in managing of great affaires. But he lost his labour: <hi>Anselm</hi> kept fast his hold, and was soone after consecrated by <hi>Walkelin</hi> Bishop of Winchester, or (as I finde also recorded) by <hi>Thomas</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Yorke, Decemb. 4. 1093. all the Bishops of the land that could possibly come, being present at that solemnity. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after his consecration, the king and he fell out. Not long
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:5993:49"/>
before, the king had throwne downe thirty churches to make his new forrest néere Winchester. This <hi>Anselm</hi> reprehended him sharpely for, and besought him to amend that and other faults; as namely his simony, his extortion, his cruelty, &amp;c. wherein hée dayly offended God grieuously, and greatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonoured himself. This admonition of his displeased the king very much; but his quarrell in shew was none other then this, that asking leaue to goe to Rome to fetch his pall, he had named <hi>Vrban</hi> Pope, whom the king as yet had not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for Pope; and for so doing, accused him of no lesse than high treason. After great stirre and much adoe between them about this matter, it was determined that all the abbots and Bishops of England should be called together to iudge of this controuersie. They met at Rochingham Castle; and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being proposed by the king, for feare or flattery they all assented vnto him, and forsooke their Archbishop, except one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Gundulphus</hi> Bishop of Rochester. A while hee endured to liue in continuall feare and disgrace, euen vntill hee was commanded out of the Realme by the king. Being at Douer ready to take ship, all his carriages were searcht, his goodes there and elsewhere soeuer taken from him and folde to the kings vse, his temporalties seased, and himselfe set a land in France in a manner naked. He trauelled presently to Lyons, and was sent for thence by the Pope. At his first comming to Rome, hée had all manner of fauour: But by that time the king with golden eloquence had informed him of the cause, his entertainement began to war colder. He determined ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to haue returned to Lyons, but was stayed by the Pope; whose pleasure while hée was content to awaite a while lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the Pope dyed. Soone after him, the King died also; being chanceably slaine by the glance of an arrow as hee was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in that forrest, for the making whereof, <hi>Anselm</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded him. This king was a very vicious prince, conetous in getting, &amp; prodigal in spending, the most sacrilegious symo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist that euer raigned in England. Reioycing in the gaine he made that way, he would ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> say, <hi>Panis Christi panis pinguis.</hi> His death as som report was miraculously signified vnto <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selme</hi> in France. A paper was put into the hands of one of his Chaplaines no man knew how, in which was found written,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:5993:50"/>
                  <hi>Galielmus Rufus occisus est.</hi> Within a few dayes after, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine word was brought of the tyrants death, and this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken as sent from heauen. <hi>Henry</hi> the first succeeded <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Rufus</hi> in the kingdom, who presently called home <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selme,</hi> and restored him to his former place. The first thing he did at his returne, he called a conuocation at London, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he depriued many Prelates of great place for their seuerall offences, <hi>Guy</hi> Abbot of <hi>VVindham</hi> &amp; <hi>Eldwyn</hi> of Ramsey for symony; <hi>Geffry</hi> of Peterburgh, <hi>Haymo</hi> of Cherwell, and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelrie</hi> of <hi>Middleton</hi> for not being in orders; <hi>Richard</hi> of Ely, &amp; <hi>Robert</hi> of S. Edmunds, all Abbots, for other enormities. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers canons were agréed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the same conuocation too long to rehearse: Some of them tended to the restraining of Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy men from marriage, which notwithstanding many marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dayly, and many that came for orders refused vtterly to make profession of chastity, as wée may see reported by <hi>Girard</hi> Archbishop of Yorke in an Epistle written by him vnto <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selm</hi> in the end of S. <hi>Anselmes</hi> Epistles. The falling out also of <hi>Anselme</hi> with the King (which happened presently after) was a great weakening vnto these Canons. All the time that the Archbishop was absent (which was thrée yéeres) the King had disposed of all Bishoprickes that fell, at his pleasure, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing inuestiture &amp; possession of them, by deliuery of the staffe &amp; the ring. And indéed the Princes in a manner of all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, had taken this kinde of authority vnto themselues eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where about this time. Bishops thus appointed, demanded consecration of <hi>Anselm,</hi> which he vtterly denied vnto them, prosessing withall, that hee would neuer receiue, or repute them for Bishops that were already consecrated by other vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such election; alleadging how it was lately forbidden in a Councell held by Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> the second, that any Clerke should take inuestiture of any spiritual preferment at the hand of any King, Prince or other lay man. The king vpon <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selms</hi> refusall, required <hi>Gerard</hi> Archbishoppe of Yorke, to giue these Bishoppes consecration; whereunto hee readily assented. But <hi>VVilliam Gifford</hi> nominated to Winchester stoode so in awe of <hi>Anselm,</hi> as that he durst not accept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration at <hi>Gerards</hi> hands. This incensed the King won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully; so as presently hée commanded <hi>Giffards</hi> goods to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:5993:50"/>
bée confiscate, and himselfe banished the Realme. Great adoo now there was about this matter throughout the realm; some defending the Kings right, others taking part with the Archbishop. In the end, the King doubting what might come of it, and being loath to giue occasion of tumult, considering that himselfe was a stranger borne, and that his father by force and much bloudshed, had not many yéeres since obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the rule of this land: he determined to send an Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to the Pope, together with the Archbishop, so to grow to some reasonable conclusion. The Pope (<hi>Paschalis</hi> 2.) would not yéelde one iot vnto the King: insomuch as, when the kings Ambassador <hi>William Warelwast</hi> (after Bishop of Exce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter) saide hee knew the King would rather loose his crowne then this priuiledge; he answered, yea, let him loose his head also if hee will, while I liue he shall neuer appoint Bishop but I wil resist him what I may. So without doing any good, home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they came. But the king vnderstanding before hand how the world went, sent a messenger to forbid <hi>Anselm</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Realme, and presently seised all his goodes mooneable and vnmooueable into his hands. Three yéeres more hée spent in exile, all which time hée liued with <hi>Hugh</hi> Archbishoppe of Lyons. At last it pleased God to open this passage of his reconciliation to the King. <hi>Adela</hi> Countesse of Bloys, the Kings sister, fell dangerously sicke in those parts, where it chanced the Archbishop to abide. Hée went to visite her, and yéelded so great comfort vnto her in that time of her distresse, as recouering afterward, she neuer reased importuning her brother, vntill shee had wrought an agreement betweene them, the conditions whereof were these; First, that <hi>Anselme</hi> should be content to consecrate the Bishops already nominated by the king: And then that the king should renounce all right to such nomination or inuesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the time to come. These conditions were allowed by the Pope, and the Archbishop restored not onely to his place, but to all his goodes and fruites gathered in the time of his absence. Two yeeres hee liued after this his last returne: in which time he persecuted married Priests very extreamly. <hi>Dunstan, Oswald, Ethelwald,</hi> and other enemies to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:5993:51"/>
of Clergy men, had onely expelled them out of Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries that had wiues: But <hi>Anselme</hi> vtterly forbidding them marriage, depriued them of their promotions that were married, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iscated their goods vnto the Bishop of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, adiudged them and their wiues adulterers, and forced all that entred into orders to vow chastity. Halfe the Clergy of England at this time were either married men, or the sonnes of married Priests. The king therefore pittying the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this calamity, sought to protect them a while from <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmes</hi> seuerity in this point: But he (I meane <hi>Anselm</hi>) was a little too resolute in all his determinations; in so much as hee might neuer bée perswaded to yéelde one iot in any thing he once intended. So, notwithstanding the Kings inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to succour so many distressed poore families, the Canons of the Conuocation before mentioned were generally put in execution throughout England. About this time it hapned <hi>Gerard</hi> Archbishop of Yorke to decease, and a second <hi>Thomas</hi> to be elected for his successor. What adoo there was betweene him and <hi>Anselme</hi> about profession of obedience, and how it was ended, see in the history of the said <hi>Thomas.</hi> To make an end at last with this Archbishop, the yeere 1109. hee fell ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely sicke at Saint Edmundsbury, and thence got him to Canterbury, where hee lay languishing a long time, and at last departed this life, Aprill 21. in the 16. yéere of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and of his age 76. He was first buried at the heade of his predecessor <hi>Lanfranke,</hi> but remoued after to the east end of his Church of Canterbury (vpon the building and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying whereof, he had bestowed very much money.) And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most 400. yeeres after by the procurement of <hi>Iohn Moorton</hi> one of his successors was canonized a Saint. A man of great learning as his works yet extant testifie, whereof one entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Cur Deus homo,</hi> he writ in the Abbey of Telesin in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, while there hee waited the Popes leysure; An other, <hi>De processione Spiritûs Sancti,</hi> containeth principally the effect of a Sermon preached at the Councell of Barum, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of certaine Grecian Prelates, whose Church hath long dissented from vs in opinion concerning that matter.

He receiued his Pall at Rome of <hi>Innocentius</hi> the second who also indued him and his successors for euer with the title of <hi>Legatus natus.</hi> This <hi>Theobald</hi> was first a Benedictine monks, and then (til he was chosen Archbishop) Abbot of Becco. A man of no great learning but of so gentle &amp; swéet behauiour (being very wise withall) as he was greatly estéemed of high and low, kings, nobles and commons. With the Pope he had often much ado. One <hi>Syluester</hi> a man infamous for many notorious offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, was presented vnto the Abbotship of Saint Augustines in Canterbury, whom in respect of his knowne vnworthines the Archbishop refused to admit. But the Popes letters came so thicke and thréefolde in fauour of him, that after many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, excuses and allegations against him, at last hee was faine to receiue him. There was at the same time one <hi>Ieremy</hi> Prior of that Abbey, an olde acquaintance and friend of the Archbishops, whom notwithstanding (vpon some great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion it is like) the Archbishop depriued and remoued from his place. In the behalfe of this man also, the Pope (who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was wont to faile where hée might be well paide for his paines) began to stickle and to enterpose his authority, resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Ieremy</hi> to his place againe, till the cause might bée heard and determined before him. Whereat <hi>Theobald,</hi> though a milde man of nature, being excéedingly moued, in a great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vowed hée would neuer exercise any Ecclesiasticall iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction so long as <hi>Ieremy</hi> helde that roome. He therefore sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Archbishop so resolute against him, and fearing some great inconuenience, would fal vpon the monastery by means of this businesse, and to procure him the hatred of his owne company, vpon payment of 100. marks, was content to giue ouer his said preferment, &amp; liued a priuate Monke in the same house euer after.

Now in the third yéere of his consecration, it happened a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was summoned at Rhemes, whereunto hee was called. <hi>Henry</hi> therefore Bishoppe of Winchester King <hi>Stephens</hi> brother (that by vertue of his power <hi>Legantyne</hi> had often contended with him, and euer opposed himselfe against him in the Popes behalfe) circumuented this good plaine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning man in this sort. He dealt first with the Pope in no wise to dispense with his absence; and then with his brother the King to forbid his passage, and perforce to stay him at home. But such were those times, as it was safer then to offend the King then the Pope; and therefore hee resolued to go, and in no wise to giue the Pope such an aduantage, against whome hée had now twice opposed himselfe already dangerously. Go therefore he would, but all the difficulty was in getting pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage. All the ports of England were laide for him; yet so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly he handled the matter, that ouer the seas hee got, and was at the Councell in good time. The King then following the aduice of his brother the Bishop of Winchester, seased vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his goods and temporalities, and banished him the Realm. Hée like a tall fellow interdicted the king and the whole Realme, and taking aduantage of the time which was very troublesome, (notwithstanding the Kings commandement) came home, and liued in Norfolke, till by the intercession of certaine Bishops he was restored. Afterward he grew into great fauour with the King; and was the chiefe meanes of concluding that finall peace at Wallingforde betweene him and <hi>Maud</hi> the <hi>Empresse.</hi> In the yéere 1152. hée summoned a conuocation at London, where the King would haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained the Clergy to make <hi>Eustace</hi> his sonne King, to the disheriting and great iniury of Duke <hi>Henry</hi> the Empresses sonne. The intent was spied before, and letters procured from the Pope to forbid the Clergy to meddle in any such busines. This notwithstanding, the matter was earnestly followed in behalfe of the young Prince <hi>Eustace,</hi> insomuch as, when they perceiued it was not effected according to their desire, they shut the doores vpon the Clergy in the place where they were gathered together, and thought by force and threatening to

The greater number seemed to yeelde; when <hi>Theobald</hi> stealing secretly out of the place, tooke his barge, and rowing downe the Thames, gotte him beyond sea, and so by his absence the Synode was dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

The Archbishop then séeing himselfe sick &amp; weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which made him altogether vnable to looke throughly into the drifts and deuises of Courtiers (that in all ages séeke to prey vpon the Church, and euer néede some watchfull eye to ouerlooke their practises) commended <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> vnto the King so effectually, as hée was content first to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him into the number of his Chaplaines, then made him Chancellour of England, and loaded him with all kind of spirituall preferment. For <hi>Theobald</hi> being a wise man, well perceiued <hi>Becket</hi> to bée first so subtle and discréete, so painefull and industrious, as the King being yet young, he would surely possesse him altogether, and bee able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand any endeuours that might bee preiudiciall vnto the Church; And againe, hee could not doubt either of his faithfulnesse to him, or his stoutnesse in so good a cause, of which both hee had had long experience. In regard hereof, hée imployed all his endeauour, to plant a perfect liking of <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> in the mind of the King; wherein he prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red so well, as in a short time no man was so farre in the Kings bookes as he, nay no man could doe any thing in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with the King but he. For the maintaining of this his credite (saith one) he thought it good to relinquish and forsake by little and little all Priestly eyther behauiour or attire, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the pompe and brauery of the Court, to liue as other Courtiers, to fare daintily, to lie long in bed, to hawke, to hunt, to haue many followers, &amp;c. in so much as some sticked not to say, the Chancellor had forgotten he was an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon also, and blamed him for not liuing like a Clergy man. But by this meanes (saith hée) <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> was euer at the kings elbow, was partaker of all his counsels, &amp; either by notice giuen to the Archbishop, or some deuise of his owne otherwise, could and did stop any courses that might bée preiudiciall to the Church. Hauing continued thus in the office of Chancellor foure or fiue yeeres with the great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and liking of the King, it hapned <hi>Theobald</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishoppe to die.

in his bosome, determined by him to doo his vtmost endeuour for the aduancement of him <hi>(Thomas Becket)</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Archbishoppricke. Being therefore at that time in Normandy, he sent <hi>Richard Lucy</hi> a counsellor of speciall trust into England with charge to effect these two things; first to procure all the Nobles, and best of the Comminalty to sweare fealty vnto young Prince <hi>Henry</hi> his sonne, and then to cause the Monkes of Canterbury to elect <hi>Thomas</hi> his Chancellour Archbishoppe. The first he quickly brought to passe (the rather by the helpe of the Chancellour that was ioyned in Commission with him.) And in the second also hée bestirred himselfe so well, as he caused the whole Conuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Clergy (a most authenticall kinde of election) to choose <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> for their Archbishoppe, no one man gainesaying it, except <hi>Gilbert Foliot</hi> Bishoppe of London. Hée was consecrate Archbishop vpon Whitsonday (béeing made Priest but iust the day before) by the Bishop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester, <hi>anno</hi> 1162. béeing not yet full forty foure yéers of age. Presently after his consecration, hee altered all the whole course of his life, became so grave, so austere, and so deuout in all outward shew, as hée séemed quite another man. Also hee resigned his Chancellorship, certifying the king by letters, (who was then in Normandy) he could not serue the Church and the Court both at once. The King that euer hitherto thought to vse <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> as a Schoolemaster to instruct and inure his sonne in matters of state aud policy: was now very sorry that he had made him Archbishopp, séeing he threw off all care of temporall gouernment; and considering the hawtinesse of his spirits, sore doubted wherunto this strange dealing would grow at the last. Another thing the king greatly disliked in him was this; that being yet scarsely warme in his seate, he beganne to looke so narrowly into the state of the land belonging to his Sée, and to challenge with such extremity what soeuer might séem to pertaine vnto him, as he prouoked many of all sorts of people against him, who euery where exclaimed with open mouth, and made their complaints thicke and thréefold vnto the king, saying, that hauing some authority and more knowledge in the law; vnder colour of defendiug the rights of his Church she tooke

But the maine quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell betwixt the king and him was this: The Cleargy of those times bare themselues so bold vpon the priuiledges of the Church (whereby, in crimes neuer so hainous they clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be exempted from the iudgement of temporall Courts) as, daily infinite outrages were committed by Cleargy men, murthers, robberies, rapes, &amp;c. which temporall Iudges might not meddle withall; and in the spirituall Courts they were either not punished, or for the most part very lightly. For the amendment and preuention of this inconuenience in time to come, the king intended to publish a certaine declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the customes of England set downe long since by king <hi>Henry</hi> the first his gandfather, wherein this intollerable and licentious liberty of the Cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the Archbishop hauing some inkling of the kings intent before hand, had so dealt with the Pope, as it was no sooner séene but it was straight reiected.

Yet so the matter was handled not long after, as first diuers other Bishops were content to yéelde vnto the king in this demaund, and at last euen the Archbishop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with all his followers. So at a time appointed they met

at Clarindon, and there sware vnto the obseruation of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles comprised in that declaration. This notwithstanding, soone after againe they disliking that they had done, got the Pope to assoile them of this oath. The Archbishop then, the chiefe procurer of this absolution, well assuring himselfe hée had so offended the king, as there was no abiding for him here, tooke shippe at Rumney, intending to auoid the realme, but missed of his purpose<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Presently vpon this arriuall hee was apprehended and carried prisoner to Northampton (where the King then held a Councel) and was there accused of extortion, periury, treason, forgery, and many other crimes. His owne suffragan Bishops, though hee had appealed vnto the Pope, gaue sentence against him, and warranted the king they would make proofe of these accusations vnto the Pope. The next night after his condemnation, hee scaped away and once more hasted vnto the sea, committed himselfe very despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately vnto a little bad rotten fisher boat, and, accompanied on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with thrée seruitors, crossed the sea, and got into the low Countries, and thence posted to the Pope at Senon, who pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him in the monastery of Pontiniar. While he there rested himselfe, he thundred out excommunications apace against all such as did obserue the articles contained in the declaration set foorth at Clarindon, whereunto himselfe had once sworn. The King as fast be stird himselfe in seasing all the goods and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralties of the Archbishop into his hand. He sent also ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors vnto the Earle of Flanders, the French King and the Pope, praying them in no wise to foster or suffer him in their dominions; requesting moreouer of the Pope, that hee would confirme and allow of the declaration published at Clarindon. The Pope made an answere (though friuolous) saying his would consider of the matter. But the French K. (with whom the King of England had amity and a league of friendship at that time) hée thinking that this disagréement betwéene him and the Archbishop would bréed some stir in England, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fell to inuading the King of Englands dominions and tooke by assault certaine holds of his in Normandy. The Archbishop also about the same time sent out particular excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against all the suffragan Bishops of his Prouince. The
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:5993:56"/>
King mightily offended with this excéeding boldnesse of the Archbishop, whereunto he well knew hee was hartned and animated by the Pope and the French King: be thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe how by all meanes possible hée might vexe and gréeue him; First, because he knew he delighted much in the mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of Pontiniac (which was an Abbey of Cistercian monkes) he signified to all the monkes of that order in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, that he would banish them euery one, if they would not procure the Archbishop to be thrust out of that monastery; which for feare of so great calamity to so many men was effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Then he also droue out of the realme, all his kinsfolks, friends and professed welwillers of whom he suspected him to be any way aided or comforted. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Pope, <hi>Thomas Beckets</hi> surest card, was ferited in much like sort the same time by <hi>Friderike Barbarossa</hi> the Emperor. The King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the counsell of <hi>Gilbert</hi> Bishop of London determined to fayne in league with the Emperor, (if possibly hee might) that was a professed enemie both to the French King and the Pope.

The Pope hauing notice of this practise, began presently to quaile, sent the King word he would order all things betwéene the Archbishop and him, to his owne liking, &amp; that out of hand. Now it had happened a little before, that the Pope had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the Archbishop a very large licence of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting whom he list in England; the King, the Quéene, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few other excepted. This authority he abused very intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately at that time when these matters were thus in ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering betwéene the Pope and the King; insomuch as he had marred all if the Pope had not spéedily yéelded a reason thereof to the King. By this time the French king (the Popes onely Protector against the Emperour) began to spy that hee was much more cold in the defence of the Archbishop th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

betwéene them, and thou to make the French King a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor for the Archbishop. This he effected, and brought the two kings together at Paris. Thither also came <hi>Thomas Becket</hi>: And sute beeing made vnto the king in his behalfe, that hée might returne, bee restored to his goods and reuenues arising in the time of his absence, &amp; lastly (vpon his humble submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to the kings fauour; The king answered, that for the rest he was contented; but (saith he) the profits of his Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke since his banishment I cannot allow him, for that I haue already giuen them to others: Mary recompence I will make him for them to the liking either of the French king, or the Senate of Paris, or else of the students of the Uniuersity. Presently the Archbishop was called for, who falling downe vpon his knées, vsed these words, My Lord and Soueraign, I do hée<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The king much offended with that last exception <hi>(Saluo honore Dei)</hi> turned him about vnto the French king, and telling him how much hee had done for the Archbishop, and how he had vsed him, I am (quoth be at last) so well acquainted with the tricks of this fellow, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hope for any good dealing at his hands. Sée you not how he goeth about to delude me with this clause (sauing the honor of God?)

Héereunto the Archbishop answered cunningly and stoutly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that the times were altered, his predecessors which could not bring all things to passe at the first dash, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to beare with many things, and that as men they fell and omitted their duety oftentimes; that which the Church had gotten, was by the constancy of good Prelates, whose example he would follow thus farre foorth, as, though he could not aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:5993:57"/>
the priuiledges of the Church in his time, yet he would neuer consent they should be diminished. This answere being heard, all men cried shame vpon him, and generally imputed the fault of these stirs vnto him. But this was the issue for that time, that they parted without reconciliation. The king doubting what might come of these broiles, caused his sonne <hi>Henry</hi> (that died soone after) to be crowned King in his owne lifetime, so to assure him of the succession. Afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into France againe, they were vpon the point of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, when the casting out of some such worde or another as before, marred all. At length the King and he were made friends; but his full restitution referred till hee had behaued himselfe quietly a while at Canterbury, which hée promised to do. But hee, was so farre from perfourming that promise, as hee sent into England before him diuers excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Pope had granted out long before, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his discretion. Amongst other, the Archbishop of Yorke, the Bishop of London and Salisbury were named in them, together with so many as had béene doers in the coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the yoong king, which the Archbishop saide might not bee performed of any but by his appointment. The men thus strucken with this holy fire, hasted them ouer into Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy to make their complaint vnto the King; who infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely gréeued at this kinde of dealing, cursed the time that euer hee made him Archbishop, or restored him to his place againe, adding, it was his chance euer to doe for vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, otherwise some or other would longere this haue made this proud Priest an example to all such troublesome perturbers of his realme and state. It happened amongest other, fower knights to be present at this spéech of the Kings; who gathered thereby, they should doe a déed very acceptable vnto him if they killed the Archbishop. Their names were <hi>Reynald Fitz-Vrse, Hugh de Mortuill, William de Tracy,</hi> and <hi>Richard Briton.</hi> In this meane time the Archbishop was come to Canterbury, and was receiued there with great ioy. Thence he went to London, and so to Woodstocke, where the yoong King then lay. But before hée could get to the Kings presence, word was brought him, the kings pleasure was hée should first go to Canterbury, and reuoke those excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:5993:58"/>
before hee the king would talke with him. So hée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned againe to Canterbury without séeing the King at all. Soone after his returne thither, the fowre Knights before mentioned arriued at Canterbury, to wit, vpon Innocents day. They comming vnto the Archbishop, told him the kings pleasure was, he should goe to his sonne and reuerently make offer of doing homage and fealty vnto him, for the Barony of his Archbishopricke; secondly, that hee should cause all the strangers he brought into the realme with him to be sworn to his obedience; and thirdly, that he should retreat those excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications which he had caused to be denounced against such as were the instruments of the yoong kings coronation. To those demands hee a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>swered, that neither the King nor any other mortall man should extort from him, or any of his by his consent, any vniust or vnreasonable oath. And as for the Bishops and other excommunicate concerning the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was indéede (quoth he) a thing done in my behalfe and for an iniury offered to my Church: But it was the act of the Pope. If therefore they will sweare they shall bee ready to make mee amends at the Popes discretion, I will absolue them; otherwise not. And whatsoeuer you say, it was the kings pleasure, I should take my best course for the redresse of this abuse by ecclesiasticall authority. Many other wordes passed betwéene them the same time, they breathing out terrible threats, and hee continuing still the same man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out yéelding one iote. At last the knights departed, giuing the monkes charge in the kings name, to sée the Archbishop foorth comming, and not to suffer him to escape away. At euening praier time the same day, they came suddenly into the Church, with their swords drawne, crying, Wheres the Traytor, Wheres the Traytor? The Archbishop who was then going vp the stepps toward the quire, hearing the noyse, turned backe vnto them, and euery one of the fower striking mainely at him, vpon the third or fourth greice of those steps was slaine. His body these knights had determined to haue cast into the sea, or else to haue hewen into a thousand pieces: but the Prior and the monkes doubting some such thing, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it immediately in the vndercraft, whence shortly it was taken vp and laid in a most sumptuous shrine in the East end

of the Church. The Pope hearing of this massacre, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated immediatly all that were either authors or consenters to the same. The king was faine to purge himselfe by oath, and yet could not be absolued before hee had done certaine strange penance; as first, that he should pray deuoutly at the tombe of this new Martyr; that he should be whipt in the chapter house, receiuing of euery monke one lash; that hee should maintaine 200. souldiers for the space of one yéere of Ierusalem; and lastly, reuoke the declaration published at Clarindon, that originally gaue the occasion of this murther.

After this in came <hi>Roger</hi> Archbishop of Yorke and would néedes haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed Canterbury to fit aboue him: that, when the other would not suffer, he sate downe in his lap. The other Bishops present amazed at this strange behauiour of the Archbishop of Yorke, cried out all vpon him, the Archbishop of Canterburies men by violence drew the other out of his ill chosen place, threw him down, tare his robes almost from his backe, trode vpon him, beat him, and vsed him so despitefully, as the Legat, whether for shame or for doubt what might happen to himself in such a tumult, got him out and went his way. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Yorke all ragged as he was, bloudy and dusty went to the King; who first was exceeding angry, but when he heard the truth, laughed merrily at it and said hee was well enough serued.

The end of this man is thus reported, how that beeing a sléepe at his mannor of Wrotham, there séemed to come vnto him a certaine terrible personage demanding of him who he was? whereunto when for feare the Archbishop answered nothing, Thou art he (quoth the other) that hast destroyed the goods of the Church, and I will destroy thée from off the earth: This hauing said, hee vanished away.

The Monkes (though mooued thereto) would in no wise ioyne with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, but perceiuing the Bishops began indéede to set foot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the matter, appealed to Rome. Much adoo there was there about it the space of nine moneths. At last the Bishops got a mandate wherein the Monkes and they were commaunded to ioyne together. The day of election was appointed; but the Monkes for curst heart would not come vnto it. So the Bishops procéeded, and make choice of <hi>Baldwin</hi> Bishop of Worcester. This election the monkes laboured mightily to disanul; professing, that they liked the man elect very well, but they must not indure such a president. The king therefore (who fauoured <hi>Baldwin</hi> excéedingly) wrought so with the one party and the other, as the Monkes were content to elect him, vpon condition he would renounce all benefit of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer election, and the Bishops themselues would confesse the same to be void and of no effect.

For his maners, hee was modest and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, of such abstinence, as same durst neuer stamp any sinister report vpon him, of few words, flow to anger, and very stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious from his very childhood. The onely fault he findeth with him is, that he was too remisse and gentle in his gouernment, saying that he was <hi>Monachus melior quam Abbas, Episcopus &amp; Archiepiscopus:</hi> for which cause the Pope in a certain letter grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him thus: <hi>Vrbanus seruus seruorum Dei, Monacho seruentis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simo, Abbati calido, Episcopo repido, Archiepiscopo remisso, salutem, &amp;c.</hi> It is a wonder that a man of this temper and disposition should be so much troubled as hee was: With the King hée al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies agréed very well: But betwéene the Monkes of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury and him there was much and continuall debate.

The matter was now veri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That notwithstanding, on went the worke: The Church part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly built was solemnly consecrate, and diuers secular Priests (such Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> himselfe was) instituted and installed into their prebends; when the monks that neuer linne laying on load by requests, gifts &amp; al manner of importunate sute to disturbe this platforme, procured the Pope to set downe an order, that this corporation should be dissolued, the buildings thereof rased and made euen to the ground. Such were the times, the Popes pleasure was an ineuitable necessity; it must be, and was performed.

He was then in the North country, about some businesse of the kings: Being sent for in all haste, at his first comming to Canterbury, he was solemnely elected, and his election pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in the Church before the King and an infinite number of people. These two elections being presented vnto the Pope he determined to make vse of the monks debate, and discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging each side (for the greater part of the Monks were then at Rome, some of them auouching their olde election for good, others importunately suing to haue the later confirmed) hée practised secretly with either of them, to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to choose yet a third man that he would nominate vnto them, &amp; that was one <hi>Stephen Langton</hi> a Cardinall of Rome a man in regard of many excellent gifts both of mind and body, very fit for the place, and no way to be misliked, if hee had orderly obtayned the same. By birth hee was an Englishman, brought vp in the Uniuersity of Paris, greatly estéemed by the king and all the nobility of France for his singular and rare learning, made Chauncellor of Paris, and lastly, called thence by the Pope to bée a Cardinall of Rome. Now when by fair means he could not preuail with them (for they feared the kings dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, whom they knew to be a hote and violent Prince) he began to terrifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with threatning, &amp; what by one means or other, made them content at last to choose him, which done, the Pope with his own hands gaue him consecration at <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbium</hi> Iune 17. Then well knowing how hainously the king would take this matter, he writ letters vnto him swéet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with many gentle entreaties, large prayses of the new Archbishop, and seasoned now and then with some touches of doubtfull threatning if he should oppose himselfe against that was then done. This notwithstanding, the king in great indignation, banished all the Monks of Canterbury, seased vpon their goods and lands, and forbad <hi>Stephen Langton</hi> entrance into the realme. The Pope hearing of this, sent his mandate vnto thrée Bishops, <hi>William</hi> of London, <hi>Eustach</hi> of Ely, and <hi>Mauger</hi> of Worcesters; wherin hee willed them first
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:5993:65"/>
to admonish and perswade the King to restore the Monkes to their goods and places, and to giue the Archbishop possession of his temporalities by a day; then if he refused so to do, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict the whole realme. They durst not but obey, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the king resolute in his determination, at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, they published the Popes interdiction; and as well foreseeing the great trouble to come, as the present danger, got them out of the land, together with <hi>Ioceline</hi> Bishoppe of Bathe, and <hi>Gyles</hi> of Hereford. The king immediately seased all their goods and temporalties into his hands, and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer banished all the friends and kinsfolke of these Bishops, that were likely to yeeld them any comfort or reliefe. During the time of this interdict, all seruice ceased throughout the Realme, except onely Baptisme of children, auricular confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and the administration of the Sacrament vnto such as lay vpon the point of death. The Pope seeing this course pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed not, procéeded to a particular excommunication of the king, and not long after, depriued him by sentence of all regal authority; a thing till that time in no age euer heard of. All this while the King estéemed the Popes sword blunt and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to wound him, till at last he perceiued the French King ready to take aduantage of this sentence, and prouiding bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily to inuade his dominions.

Séeing therfore no other remedy, he was faine to yéeld; receiued the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, restored the other Bishops, the Monks and all the rest banished, vnto their goods and reuenues; and moreouer was content to resigne his crowne into the Popes hands, &amp; vpon restitution, to assure him by his letters pattents a yéerly pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a thousand marks. This done, he thought all troubles at an end, when the worst of all was yet behinde: For he bare himselfe so bolde vpon the Popes fauour (which he had bought déerely) as he doubted not to oppresse diuers of his nobility, with many and continuall wrongs reuoking al for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer grants of priuiledges at his pleasure, vpon this point that he had receiued his kingdome from the Pope absolutely, frée from all entanglement of any priuiledges deriued from

the same. Hereupon the Barons rebelled, the Archb. taking their part, and when they doubted least they should not make their party good against the King, the Pope stucke so close vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; they procured <hi>Lewis</hi> the French kings eldest sonne to inuade the realme. Him together with the Archbishop and all the Barons, the Pope excommunicated. This great hurly burly was appeased sodainely by the kings death, who died some say, of care and sorrow, some of surfet; and some say, hee was poysoned by a Monke. His sonne <hi>Henry</hi> a Prince of ten years old was receiued to the kingdom, <hi>Lewis</hi> forsaken, &amp; the Barons vpon promise of obedience vnto their king, absolued by the Popes Legate. Clergy men were debarred a while from their absolution that they might compound for the same, which they were glad to doe.

The Archbishop first complained of the wrong vnto the king, &amp; finding no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy at his hands, excommunicated all the authors of this iniury (the king onely excepted) and got him to Rome. The king vnderstanding thereof, dispatched messengers thither also to hinder his procéedings there what might bee. The Pope notwithstanding delighted much with the eloquence, grauity, and excellent behauiour of the Archbishop, granted presently all his demands. Little ioy had he of this victory: Being thrée dayes iourney in his way homewards, hee fell sicke at the towne of Saint Gemma, and there died in the Friery, where also he was buried. It is reported that soone after his buriall, certaine théeues brake open his toombe, and thought to haue robbed him of his mysterrings, &amp;c. wherein (according to the manner of those times) he was buried; but that they claue so fast vnto him, as by no deuice they coulde take them from him.

Him also this Archbishop offended; and that so grieuously, by reprehending his monstrous coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, his bribery and extortion, as euer after he sought to worke him all the mischiefe hée might.

The Pope seemed willing to redresse these things; and namely concerning that matter, set downe this order, that if any Cathedrall Church continued voide aboue sixe monethes, it should be lawfull for the Archbishop to conferre it where he list, as well as any smaller Benefice. The procuring of this order cost him a great summe of mony: Yet no sooner was his backe turned, but the Pope at the Kings request reuoked the same. Béeing thus continually vexed; thwarted and disgraced, he departed into voluntary exile; and there bewayling the misery of his country, spoiled and wasted by the tyranny of the Pope, spent the rest of his life in continuall teares. Through extreame griefe and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or (as some thinke) too much fasting, he fell first into a consumption, and after into a strange kinde of ague.

If they could haue met with him, they had

surely hewen all to péeces. Hee was no sooner come home, but he thundered out his excommunications against not onely the whole Couent of Saint Bartholomew, but the Bishop of London also, as a fauourer of theirs. They all agreeing together, determined to send the Deane of <hi>Paules</hi> a graue and wise man to Rome, and by the letters of certaine Bishops (they knew the Pope would credite) to aduertise him of this strange disorder. The Archbishop vnderstanding hereof, followed thither apace, and entred Rome with great pompe; nothing doubting, but the King and Quéens letters which he had brought, his nobility and great lineage, or if all failed, his purse should beare him out in this matter well inough. But vnderstanding how odiously it was taken by all that heard it, and how hardly the Pope was informed against him; hee fell to entreaty of his aduersaries, the Deane of <hi>Paules</hi> and the rest, whom partly by faire promises, and partly by threates, at last he subdued and made them content to stay their complaint. That matter being so ended, he dealt earnestly with the Pope to ratifie the dooings of his Uisita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Bishops of his prouince vnderstanding thereof, &amp; knowing how great an inconuenience it would bee to them, and all their Clergy, they made a collection of two pence in the marke out of all spirituall promotions in the Prouince to be expended in sute of Law against the Archbishop. In the meane time the King had written his letters earnestly to the Pope in the Archbishops behalfe, which so inchanted him with partiality, as the Bishop of London vtterly despairing of any iustice, gaue ouer the matter in the plaine field: Onely thus much was obtained, that he, the Chapter of <hi>Paules,</hi> and the Couent of Saint Bartholomewes should be absolued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their excommunication. Soone after this it hapned that the Archbishop, (the olde malice still boyling in his breast) taking a small aduantage, excommunicated againe the Deane and Chapter of <hi>Paules</hi>; the indignity whereof so moued all the Cleargy, as they tooke order to meete at Dunstable, and there laying their purses together, gathered the sum of foure thousand Marks, which they determined to bribe the Pope withall so he would deliuer them from the misery of this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable kinde of Uisitation.

At Lincolne hee fell out with the Chapter there (the Sée then being voide) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the gift of prebends and benefices which he challenged, &amp; had euer heretofore in the vaca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy belonged vnto them. One <hi>William Lupus</hi> Archdeacon of Lincolne especially resisted him in this matter, and appealed vnto the Pope. This poore man he so vexed and hurried with his excommunications, and all manner of molestation hee could deuise, as at last he enforced him to hide himselfe, and to steale secretly to Rome; where he was so pittied, as the Pope was entreated not only to absolue him, but to protect him from the violence of <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> &amp; at last to iudge the controuersie of his side.

Then (to make short) hee declareth how his predecessour at his departure carried away all the moouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble goods belonging to the Sée, that <hi>Boniface</hi> had left all his houses very ruinous, that the King had taken vp before hand, one yéeres profite of his lands, that in the meane space hée was faine himselfe to liue vpon credit; and that to borrow to serue his necessary vses (the realme being so exhaust with continuall payments) it was excéeding hard. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard héereof, hée besought him (whom onely in trueth the matter concerned, though merchants of Luca bore the name of this debt) to order the matter so, as he might bée allowed a yéeres day of paiment, which at last with much adoo was granted him by the sute of <hi>Robert Kilwardby</hi> his predecessor, who died (as before is rehearsed) soone after. The new Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop then became a suter vnto the Pope, that hee would cause to be restored vnto his Church fiue thousand markes; the value whereof, the said <hi>Robert</hi> had carried away with him of the goods belonging to his Sée. This he was so farre from obtaining, as by and by the Pope began to call vpon him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine very hastily for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ower thousand marks aboue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and so made him glad to holde his peace for that time, and yet to pay the money at his day. In the first yéere of his
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:5993:73"/>
consecratlon he sommoned a Conuocation at Lambhith, at what time the Archbishop of Yorke comming to London, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his crosse to bee borne before him within the Prouince of Canterbury, which the Archbishop of Canterbury tooke to bée a great wrong vnto him &amp; his Sée. It had béene often in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion héeretofore whether it might be done or no, and much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doo there had bin about it: therfore to redresse this abuse quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; good cheape, our Frier deuised this course to be taken. Hée caused proclamations to be made in all places where he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the other Archbishop meant to passe, in w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he commanded all men vnder paine of excommunication to afford no manner of intertainement, no not so much as bread, or drinke, vnto him or any of his company, so long as hee bare vp his crosse in that manner. So except he and his traine should starue, down must the Crosse there was no remedy. The Conuocation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he began a generall visitation of his whole prouince; and being destrous to know the state of euery Dioces, went him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in person to most of them, vsing great lenity and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes euery where. For he was a man though very stately both in his gesture, gate, words, and all outward shew; yet of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding méeke, facile and liberall mind: He took great paines in labouring a peace betwéene <hi>Edward</hi> the first, and <hi>Leolin</hi> prince of Wales; vnto whom hee went in person, and trauailed long with him, but altogether in vaine. Hee bare a very hard hand vpon the Iews, whose Sinagogues he commanded to be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led downe to the ground throughout his Prouince. But the King was a meanes to stay the execution of that commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so far foorth, as he would haue one Church allowed vnto them, in the city in w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with certain restraints they should pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise their ceremonies. Unto double beneficed men &amp; non resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents he was very hard. Diuers elected vnto Bishopricks hée reiected, hauing no other exception against them. Many hée compelled to reforme themselues according to the Canons in that behalfe; and some that refused to be conformable, he finally depriued. Adultery he was woont to punish very seuerely. Hée persecuted a Bishop terribly (his name is not deliuered) for keeping a Concubine. One <hi>Roger Ham</hi> a Priest, hée enioyned to three yéeres penance for fornication, requiring him to spend all that time in fasting, prayer, and pilgrimages to Rome,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:5993:73"/>
Compostella, and Colon, and moreouer sequestred the fruits of his benefice during those thrée yéeres, appointing them to be giuen vnto the poore. Neither dealt hee thus with men of his owne coat onely. There was a certaine knight of Wiltshire called Sir <hi>Osborne Gifford</hi>; He had stollen two Nuns out of the Nunry of Wilton: which comming to the Archbishops eares, hee first excommunicated him, and after absolued vpon these conditions; first that hee should neuer after come within any Nunry, or in the company of a Nunne; then, that 3. Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies together hee should be whipped in the parish Church of Wilton, so likewise in the market and Church of Shaftsbury thrée other daies; that he should fast a certaine number of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, that he should not weare an shirt in thrée years; &amp; lastly, that he should not any more take vpon him the habite or title of a knight, but weare apparell of a russet colour, vntill hee had spent thrée yeares in the holy land. All this hee sware should be performed before he might haue absolution. If some of our Gentlemen were now and then thus serued, they would not be so wanton as they are. Thirtéene yéeres and almost a halfe this man continued Archbishop, holding all this while his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend he had first at Lyons, which when diuers begged of him, he would answere, that hee might not in any wise spare it; for he looked euery day when being drouen out of England by the King (against whom indéed he often very boldly opposed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe) hee should haue no other home to take to. For the same cause belike, it was annexed vnto the Sée of Canterbury. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny succéeding Archbishops enioyed the same a long time after.

Being ripe for the Uniuersity, he was sent first to <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge in Oxford, then to Paris. There hee proceeded Master of art, and before his departure thence was chosen Rector of that Uniuersity. Hauing passed through that office (which séemeth to bee annuall) with great commendation of integrity and wisdome, hee returned into England; and comming to Oxford, gaue such proofe there of his extellent knowledge in all good learning by preaching, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, &amp;c. as they thought good to honour him with the degrée of a Doctor, and shortly after made him Chancellor of their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersity. His gouernment there was such, as all men easily discerned him fit for a much higher place. Hee made many good and profitable statutes, and tooke away diuers fond and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious customes; to the great honor of the Uniuersity, and no lesse aduancement of good learning. His first spirituall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion was a Prebend in Pauls Church and the Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conry of Essex. His Archdeaconry he visited himselfe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son duely euery yéere, and did reside vpon his Prebend, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in that Cathedrall Church or some other place almost e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day. By reason héereof and his manifold good parts, hée grew so famous, as <hi>Peckham</hi> being dead, hee was straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way pointed out by the expectation of all men vnto the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishopricke. The monks therefore those him with the Kings very good liking and great applause of all men. It was his chance to come to Rome while <hi>Coelestinus</hi> was Pope, a good and vertuous man; but so simple, as <hi>Boniface</hi> that succéeded him could perswade him by counterfeiting the voice of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell through a trunke in the night, to resigne his Papacy and become an Heremit again, as before his election he had béene. Not onely this simple Heremite, but euen all the prelates
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:5993:74"/>
and Cardinals there, were amazed at his wonderfull rare learning, the like whereof (especially to bée ioyned with such discretion and wisedome) they well assured themselues was no where to be found. They were desirous therefore to haue made him a Cardinall, so to haue retained him amongest them: But he yéelding many reasons why hée might not bée spared at home, obtained at last consecration and hasted him vnto his charge. Upon the day of his inthronization, it is saide hée consecrated Bishop of Landaffe one <hi>Iohn Mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> Doctor of Diuinity, and bestowed twenty benefices, ten of very good value vpon ten Doctors, and ten lesse vpon tenne Bachelers of Diuinity. The See being yet voide the king had caused a Conuocation to be summoned, in which hee required the one halfe of all Ecclesiasticall reuenues for one yéere toward the charge of his wars. This intollerable exaction the Cleargy not intending to yéeld vnto, sent the Deane of Paules <hi>William de Monfort</hi> with diuers other prelates vnto the King to craue pardon, and to shew how hard it were for them to yéeld to this demand. Being admitted vnto his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, the Deane began his spéech, and after a few wordes fell downe suddenly starke dead. Herewith the king nothing moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, sent a knight the next day vnto the Conuocation to know whether any of them durst withstand the King in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: if there bee any such (quoth hee) let him come foorth, that I may take order with him as a disturber of the Kings peace. So no man daring to gainesay it, the graunt passed for good. The Archbishop now comming home soone after, called another Synode, wherein his Cleargy complained much of the last exaction. The Archbishop told them it was more then they could iustifie that they had done, for that in the late Councell of Lyons it was decréede, no Cleargy man should pay any thing to any temporall magistrate without the Popes license: that therefore they now set downe for a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non to be kept héereafter inuiolably. At that time the King that had had so liberall allowance very lately, demaunded nothing. But within a yéere or two after hauing spent an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite deale of money in the conquest of Scotland, he summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Parliament at Berwicke; wherein when the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty contributed liberally toward the charge of that warre,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:5993:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Cleargy alleaging the aforesaid Canon, would grant no thing. The king would not take this for payment: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore presently hee tooke order, that all barnes of Cleargy men should bee locked vp: hée also made proclamation that from that time forward, all Cleargy men were excluded for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his protection, so that héereafter it should be lawful for any man to sue them, but they might not commence sute against any other. This constrained them to yéeld, and all submitted themselues to allowance of such a proportion as the King li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked (it was a fist part of their reuenewes) except onely the Archbishop who would make no other answere vnto the king but this: Under God our vniuersall Lord, saith hee, wée haue two other Lords, a spirituall Lord the Pope, and a temporall Lord the king; and though we bee to obey both, yet rather the spirituall Lorde then the temporall. When therefore hee saw all the rest inclined to yéelde, vsing no other words then this, <hi>Saluet vnusquisque animam suam,</hi> hee rose vp and suddenly departed. For this contumacy the king caused all his goods to be seased into his hands, and made shew of greater displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Shortly after, notwithstanding beeing to make warre in France, before his departure he thought good to receiue the Archbishop to fauour againe; but this his grace indured for a very little while. Presently vpon his returne, hée laide diuers treasons to his charge, as that he had dehorted his subiects in his absence from payment of their subsidies, that hee had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired with diuers of his nobility to depriue him of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to crowne his sonne <hi>Edward, &amp;c.</hi> Whether the Archbishop were guilty of all the crimes obiected against him or no, I cannot tell. But certaine it is, that as guilty, he submitted himselfe to the kings mercy, and besought him for the same in most humble manner, or rather indéede deiected himselfe more basely, and lamented his case more passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately then became a man that were guiltlesse; much lesse a prelate that would be estéemed, graue, learned or wise. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this his submission, the King commenced a complaint against him at Rome, banished him the Realme, and seased vpon all his goods, mooueable and vnmooueable, forbidding all his subiects vpon great paine to foster him or yeeld him any manner of intertainement. Hee was in that case
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:5993:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hee must haue starued for want of sustenance, had not the monkes of Canterbury secretly taken him in and aduentured to yeeld him things necessary, till they found meanes to shift him beyond sea; which the King afterwards vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, seased vpon all their goods and lands, turned them all euen fowre score monkes a begging, forbad all men to harbour them, and kept them in that miserable state, till after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine space hee was content to restore them againe. These were the violent courses were taken by Princes in those daies: how happy are we that in all peace, liberty and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance quietly enioy our owne, without great desert to the contrary? Two yéeres the Archbishop contin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Héereby it came to passe that he was the richest Archbishop of many that were, either before or after him; so that his trouble turned him to great good. In regard whereof, he was wont to say <hi>(Nihil nocebit aduersitas vbi nulla iniquitas dominatur)</hi> so often as he talked of his trouble and banishment. Hee was no sooner come home but a new danger encountred him, occasioned by his owne wonted boldnesse. The yong King by the counsell of <hi>Piers Gaueston</hi> (a wanton and vicious man, banished into Ireland by king <hi>Edward</hi> the first for corrupting his sonne) had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Bishop of Couentry to ward at Yorke: A conuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation beeing gathered, the Archbishop would not suffer any matter to bee debated in the house till the Bishop were set at liberty. This the king was content to beare withall at that time: &amp; afterward he so behaued himselfe, as there neuer grew any dislike betwéene them.

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:5993:76"/>
He enforced <hi>Iohn Warren</hi> Earle of Surrey to forsweare the company of a certaine beautifull harlot, with the loue of whom hee was greatly bewitched. And afterwards when notwithstanding his oath he returned to her company againe and got children vpon her, he accused him to the Conuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of adultery and periury both, and at last made him to leaue her. Such preferments as fell to his disposition, he euer bestowed vpon men of excellent learning; despising letters and requests of noble men, which he estéemed not a rush. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poore schollars hee maintained at the Universities with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall exhibition, and vnto all kinde of poore people was excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding bountiful, insomuch as therein I thinke he excelled al the Archbishops that euer were, either before him or after him. Beside the daily fragments of his house, he gaue euery Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and Sunday vnto euery begger that came to his doore a loafe of breade of a farthing price (which no doubt was bigger then our penny loafe now.) And there were vsually euery such almes day in time of dearth to the number of 5000. but in a plentifull 4000. and seldome or neuer vnder, which <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus annis</hi> amounted vnto 500. pound a yéere. Ouer and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue this he vsed to giue euery great festiuall day 150. pence to so many poore people, to send daily meate, drinke and bread vnto such as by reason of age or sicknes were not able to fetch almes at his gate, and to send money, meate, apparell &amp;c. to such as he thought wanted the same, and were ashamed to beg. But of all other, hee was wont to take greatest compassion vpon those that by any misfortune were decaied and had fallen from wealth to poore estate. For these and other vertues, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people would néedes estéeme him a Saint, and frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed much the place of his burial: Therefore his tombe (which was situate beside the altar of S. <hi>Gregory</hi> néere the south wal) was afterwards pulled downe.

That warre beeing ended, and execution done vpon diuers of the nobles that had rebelled: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Tarlton</hi> Bishop of Hereford was apprehended &amp; brought to the barre to be arraigned for the like fault. All the Bishops of England almost were then at London. The Archbishops of Canterbury, Yorke, and Dublin hearing of it, in great hast hied them thither, and hauing their crosses borne before them, entred the court, by violence tooke the prisoner from the barre; and carried him away with them. Much adoo there was about this matter a good while: and the stirre was not quite ended when the Queene rising against her husband, and setting vp her sonne to challenge the kingdome, at last procured him to be deposed. This our Archbishop then shewed himselfe a very weake man: He was content a while outwardly to stand with the King (as beside the common duty of a subiect, he was bound to doe by benefits receiued infinite) but first vnderhand hee ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Quéene with great summes of money; and at last vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forsooke him, his lawfull prince, his master, his patrone that had aduanced him by so many degrées vnto an estate so honorable.

This <hi>Iohn Straford</hi> hauing long and to good purpose stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died the Canon and ciuill Law, was called to the Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conry of Lincolne. Being famous for his learning and good gouernment of that iurisdiction, <hi>Walter</hi> the Archbishoppe made him his principall Official and Deane of the Arches, and king <hi>Edward</hi> the second shortly after that, appointed him Secretary, and so one of his priuy counsell.

Moreouer, hée caused him to bee summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a certaine strange kinde of writs to appeare I know not where; and when for feare hee was faine to hide himselfe, proclamation was made that no man should dare to harbour him, or giue him any kind of entertainement by meate, lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

or otherwise. Hauing endured these miseries the space of a yéere, he intreated the Archbishop to bee an intercessour vnto the King for him; who relating vnto him how dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a thing it was for him to persecute a true subiect so terribly, both for an other mans fault, and an other mans pleasure too; hée was soone wonne to receiue the poore Bishop to his grace, and laid all the blame of that iniury vpon <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Baldock.</hi> Being thus restored, he grew dayly more and more into the kings fauour, whom he serued both diligently and faithfully to the last hower. When all other forsooke him, euen <hi>Walter</hi> the Archbishop of whom hée had deserued so notably; this good Bishop would neuer bee allured vnto the contrary part by any meanes; in so much as, the Quéene and <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> began to deuise how they might make him away.

He was not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in this coniecture: For no sooner was the King ouer the seas, but infinit sums of mony were collected with the

very good liking of all people. This mony (which men thought would haue maintained the charge of that war 2. or 3. yeares) the king being yoong and so easie to be either mistaken or decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, was spent in lesse then one yéere. The Archbishop mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling thereat, aduised the king by letters, to remooue from him such as had had the disposing of his treasure; for that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out imbesilling and falsehood, it was impossible so much money should be so soone consumed. The king on the other side, he put the Archbishop in minde of his promise, &amp; called vpon him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually for more money. Hee well knowing how hard it would bée to collect any reasonable summe so soone after so liberall contribution as had béene lately yéelded; fell to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading the king to accept reasonable conditions, which hée heard the French King had offered him, and to come home. The king either was or seemed to be exceeding angry with this motion: yet knowing there was no remedy but hee must get him home, his mony being now spent, and his credit amongest the vsurers stretched to the highest pin; he told his souldiers on the one side that the Archb. had betraied him vnto the French king, who no doubt had hired him to detaine their pay in his hands; &amp; on the other side made his creditors beléeue that the Archb. had taken vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him the discharge of al his debt, as hauing now gathered money sufficient for that purpose. So the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment of these people being either allaied, or cast vpon the Archbishop; it was deuised, that for the further countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this plot, the king should step ouer into England sodainely, and cast into prison the Archbishop, together with the Bishop of Chichester the Chancelor, and the Bishop of Litchfield the Treasurer.

This Citation they fixed vpon the high crosse at Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury with many ceremonies. Now the Archbishop perceiuing what a terrible tempest was growing toward him (for he was charged not only with the debt of many thousand pounds more then ouer he should be able to make, but with horrible treason, that might not onely take away his life, but make him odious in his life time, and infamous for euer with all posterity)<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding then that the king had written diuers discourses against him vnto the Bishop of London, the couent of Canterbury and others, to the intent they might be publike; for defence of his credit, hee thought it requisite to make his Apology in the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, which he did, taking this for his text, <hi>Non pertimuit Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipem, &amp; potentia nemo vicit illum, &amp;c.

He was not suffered to come into the parliament house before hee had answered to certaine crimes obiected against him in the court of the Exchequer.

But saith he (taking his crosse into his owne hand) I will not hence till I either bee suffered to come in or heare some cause alleaged why I should not.

The copy of this letter is to bée séene in <hi>Thomas Walsingham</hi> and other.

But so, betwéene the King and the Pope, elections were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together deluded, and made frustrate.

Now the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>Iohn Vfford</hi> being sodainely taken away, as before is declared, the Couent of Canterbury once more chose him the said <hi>Bradwardin,</hi> the King very willingly allowed of their choice; and the Pope hauing not yet heard of this their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond election, of his own accord before any request made cast vpon him this dignity. Hardly shall you finde any Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe in any age to haue attained his place in better sort. He was consecrate at Auinion by one <hi>Bertrand</hi> a Cardinall in the Church of the Frier minors there. That Ceremony once performed, he hasted him home into England; where first do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his duety to the King, hee receiued of him immediately his temporalties with all fauour. From the Court he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Lambhith to rest himselfe after his long iourney. Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there a while with the Bishoppe of Rochester, he fell sick and within fiue wéekes and fower dayes after his consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on died, so that he was neuer inthronized at all. He was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the Chappel of Saint <hi>Anselme</hi> toward the south wall. This man was borne at Hatfield in Sussex, and brought vp in the Uniuersity of Oxford, where hauing trauelled a long time in the study of good learning, he became one of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, the yeare 1325. and afterward procéeded Doctor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity. He was a good Mathematitian, a great Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and so excellent a Diuine, as he is commonly enstyled <hi>Doctor prosundus</hi>; which title that hee well inough deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, diuers works of his not yet perished doe testifie. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all he is especially to be commended for his sincerity of life and conuersation. <hi>Iohn Stratford</hi> the Archbishoppe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of these vertues commended him vnto that noble prince K. <hi>Edward</hi> the third, for his Confessor. In that office he beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued himself so, as he deserueth eternall memory for the same. He was wont to reprehend the King with great boldnes for such things as he saw amisse in him. In that long and paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full warre which the king had in France, he neuer would bee from him, but admonished him often secretly, and all his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in learned and most eloquent sermons publikely, to take

It is certaine also that hee was elected vnto the Archbishopricke without his owne séeking, &amp; might easily haue made the king for him, if he had endeauoured it.

The Pope then with the Kinges good liking, remooued to Canterbury <hi>Simon Langham</hi> Bishop of Ely and Treasurer of England. He was first a Monke of Westm. then Prior, and lastly Abbot there. Thence he was elected Bishop of London; but before he was consecrate thereunto, obtained Ely, where he continued fiue yéeres. He receiued his pall by the handes of the Bishop of Bathe, in Saint Nicholas Chappell at Westminster, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uemb. 4. 1366. and was enthronized the Lady day following. He was Archbishop but a little while, viz. two yéeres or little more, and therefore did not many things very memorable. There was a great strife betwéene the Londoners and their Clergy about tything, which he thus composed; he tooke or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they should pay, their offrings, personall tithes, and then also for the rest a farthing of euery 10. s. rent.

eight yéeres, and died Iuly 22. 1376. of the same disease his predecessor had done, viz. a palsie, wherewith hee was sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly taken as he sate at dinner. He was buried first in the Church of the Carthusians (whose house he had founded) at Auinion: but after thrée yeares, his bones (by his owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment while he liued) were taken vp, &amp; buried a second time at Westminster, in a goodly toombe of alabaster. It is scarce credible that is reported of his wonderfull bounty and liberality to that Monastery, I meane Westminster. When he was first made Abbot, hee bestowed all that he had gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together being Monke and Prior, in paying the debt of the house, which was to the value of two thousand and two hundred marks: he discharged it euery whit, and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther summes of money also, that particular Monks did owe: whom he tendred and cherished as his owne children, neuer taking any thing from them, but rather augmenting their portions out of that which was due to himselfe. Beeing Chancellour and Treasurer, he purchased diuers good peeces of land and gaue it vnto them. When hee went out of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, he left them books to the value of 830. pound, and copes, vestments, &amp;c. estéemed worth 437. pound. At his death hée bequeathed vnto them all his plate, prised at 2700. pound, &amp; all his debts any where due; they amounted vnto 3954. l. thritéen shillinge and foure pence.

Hereby it came to passe that the Bishoppe and his Archdeacons were suspended from their iurisdiction longer, (as it séemed vnto them) then they ought, and not disposed to awaite the Archbishops pleasure any longer, rushed into their iurisdictions againe, his visitation nothing néere finished, commanding all men vpon paine of excommunication, to repaire vnto their wonted ordinaries for proofe of Wils, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations, institutions, or any other such like occasions. This commandement published in many places of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oces, the Archbishop pronounced to be void; and required all men in these and the like cases to repaire vnto him, and none other. Herupon the Bishop appealed to Rome, and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop cited diuers of the Bishoppes officers to appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. His Apparitor (named <hi>Peter Hill</hi>) had also in his bosome a citation for the Bishop himselfe.

him to eate the citation, wax, paper and all. This fact was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preiudiciall to the Bishop of Exceters cause: For it incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the king against him; insomuch as though a while hée did prosecute his appeale at Rome diligently, hee saw himselfe so ouerborne by the king, hee was like to doe no good at all, and therefore resolued to make his peace with the Archbishop vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reasonable conditions which he easily obtained. But they that had abused his Apparator, were put to terrible pennance in diuers parts of the realme, and were faine to perform the same. One <hi>William Byd</hi> a Doctor of the Arches had giuen counsell vnto the Bishop in this cause: for so doing hée was displaced, and vpon that occasion an oathe was ordained of this Archbishop, that euery Aduocate of that Court shoulde take at his admission.

Scarce was he warme in his seate, when by the kings displeasure he was dispossessed of the same. In the second yéere of his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation a Parliament was held at London.

If happened in the meane time that the king (<hi>Richard</hi> the second) was deposed; or at least inforced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe his crowne vnto <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of Lancaster, that after possessed the same by the name of king <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> the Pope vnderstanding then of the fal of king <hi>Richard</hi> pronounced the said <hi>Roger</hi> to be an intruder and vsurper of the Archbishopricke, and by his omnipotent buls restored <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Arundell</hi> vnto the same againe. As for <hi>Roger Walden</hi> that was now a Bishop without a Bishopricke (for <hi>Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> is <hi>ordo,</hi> and so <hi>Character indelebilis</hi>) he liued in that state a while, till at last by the kind endeuour of the Archb. his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable aduersary, hee was promoted vnto the Bishopricke of London, which he enioyed but a short time, being taken away by death within one yéere after.

with a bare tenth, the next conuocation after, he was very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry that a more liberal allowance was not made vnto him; and began to hearken vnto the sacrilegious motions of certain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious politicians, that intending to cast the burthen of all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidies and other kind of tributes vpon the Cleargy, letted not to say openly in the parliament house, how the laity was not able to yeeld any thing to the Kings coffers, for that the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy had all the wealth of the land in their hands: And therefore the king must either take from them their temporalties, or else lay all the burthen vpon them that onely were able to beate it. The Archbishop (that was vndoubtedly a woorthy prelate, wise and very stout) rose vp and prooued by manifest argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that the contributions of the Cleargy were after the proportion of their ability, much more liberall then the subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies or other paiments of the temporalty in many respects. For (saith he) we pay the tenth of our liuings oftner then they pay fiftéenths, and though we serue not in the wars our selues, our seruants and tenants do; neither are we altogether idle, in as much as we pray daily for the king and the realme, as well in time of peace as warre. The prolocutor of the lower house of parliament at that time was a knight called Sir <hi>Iohn Clyen,</hi> that hauing béene a Cleargy man sometimes, without any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation forsooke the calling and became a soldier.

I sée now (quoth the Archbishop) whither the fortune of this Realme tendeth, the prayers of the Church beeing despised, which should appease the wrath of God iustly kindled against vs by the daily monstrous iniquities of our age. Perceiuing then that the King (who at his first comming to the crowne had made many open and publike protestations of his loue to the Church, and his intent to defend and protect the same to the vtmost) that he I say began to hearken somewhat too patiently to these wicked motions; he turned him toward him, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king low ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and dishonour of breaking the same; and lastly, that hee should feare to offend him by whom Kings raigne, and before whose tribunall all princes and monarchs neuer so great must one day come to be iudged. The King séemed to be somewhat mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with these wordes, and desiring the Archbishop to take his place againe, well (quoth he) howsoeuer I doe otherwise I will leaue the Church in as good estate as I found it. The Archbishop then turning him about vnto the Proloquutor and certaine other knights of the lower house that accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him: You it was (saith he) and such as you are that perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the last king to take into his hande all such Celles in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land as appertained vnto any religious houses of France or Normandy, assuring him it would so stuffe his coffers, as hée could not want in many yéeres after, and there is no question, but the land belonging to such celles was woorth an infinite summe of mony: Howbeit it is certaine and well inough knowne, that within one yéere after he had taken that course, he was not the value of halfe a marke the richer; and how he thriued afterward otherwise, I néede not tell you. After that time there were no other attempts against the Church in his daies. But the clergy were so terrified with that wauering doubtfulnesse of the king, as they durst not but graunt him a tenth euery yéere after; and though there were no other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the Archbishop was faine to call a conuocation euen for that purpose.

First, by the kings meanes hee got from him the Chauncellorship of England: Then being Cardinal, and the Popes Legate <hi>a latere</hi> by speciall commission, hee set vp a new court called <hi>Curia legatina</hi>; vnder colour whereof, he drew all manner of iurisdiction throughout England into his owne hands, and appointed Officials Registers, &amp;c. in euery Dioces, who tooke vp all causes, and suffered other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers (to whom the iurisdiction of right appertained) to sitte still without either regard or profit. This deiection of the Archbishop wherein men estéemed him for the time very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, fel out to his great good; the others immoderate great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, was the cause of his destruction.

But the Cardinal y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was ioined with Cardinal <hi>Campeius</hi> in commission, wherin they were autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rised by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope to examine the circumstances of that cause, he I say being more slack in his proceedings, then the K. expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted he should, so incensed him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> said K. against him, as shortly

after he was content, first to take the aduantage of a Premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire against him, and then to cause him to bée arrested of high treason; whereof see more in Yorke. Soon after the Cardinals death, there was a Conuocation held, wherein the Cleargie was aduertised that they all had fallen into a premunire by yéelding vnto the Cardinals power legantiue, neuer allowed by the King: which allegations though diuers of them knew to be false inough, yet durst they not doe otherwise then to redéeme the penalty they were said to haue incurred with the payment of 118. thousand pounds, whereof the Prouince of Yorke should pay eighteene thousand, and Canterbury the rest, which was 100000. pounds. When this gift was to haue beene presented, they were certified that the king would not accept of the same, except they declared in a Canon that he was supreame head of the Church. Long this matter was hammering. But at last they agréede to giue vnto him this new title, and inserted the same into the instrument of their gift. In that Conuocation many Canons were made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Lutherans, and many motions for renouncing the Popes authority; wherein the greatest part being fearefull of resoluing either way, the Conuocation was often proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued. After many adiournements it was once more put ouer from April till October 5. In which meane space the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop died at Saint Stephens neere Canterbury, in the house of <hi>William Warham</hi> his kinsman, Archdeacon of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury. That house at that time belonged vnto the Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conry, but (by what sacrilegious meanes I know not) was long since nipped away from the same; so that the Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, except he be otherwise prouided for then by his Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaconry, is now houselesse. But to returne vnto our Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, he was buried without any great funerall pompe, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing mourning clothes onely to the poore, and laide in a little Chappell built by himselfe for the place of his buriall vpon the North side of the Martyrdome, and hath there a reasonable faire toomb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And surely, if he regarded the worthines of the man, in respect of his manifold rare and excellent parts he could not lightly preferre any man lesse obnoxious to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. For he was not onely very learned (which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowne then that it néedeth many words) but also of such modesty in outward behauiour, and integrity of life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, as he was of all men both loued and reuerenced. I know well that <hi>Pasquill</hi> played his parts with him, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered a brat or two vpon him, but without any probability at all. He was made Cardinal, May 22. 1536. The Pope employed him the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in diuers Ambassages vnto the Emperour and the French King, wherein he did his best endeauour to ioyne them against his owne Soueraigne the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and not content therewith, hée dealt so busily with his letters amongst his friends in England, wherein hee dehor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them from the kings obedience, and all conformity vnto reformation, as it turned many of them to great trouble, &amp; amongst the rest cost his mother the Countesse of Salisbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and his eldest brother the Uicount <hi>Mountacute</hi> their heads. It pleased not God that any of his platformes should take successe: And therefore partly malecontent, and partely also weary of the paines and continuall daunger

these ambassages forced him vnto, hee procured the Pope to make him Legate of of Uiterbio, where he determined to leade the rest of his life quietly; but hee was disappointed of his purpose. The Pope (<hi>Paul</hi> the third) summoned a Councell at Trent. Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> and one or two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ioyned with him, must needs be his Uicegerents there. He for his part was nothing so resolute in matters of religion as men expected he would. In the question of iustification he professed to be on our side, and perswaded one <hi>Morell</hi> to be of his opinion, a learned Spaniard that lay in the same house he did, &amp; that was sent out of Spain of purpose to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Popes quarrel in disputation, wherein he was estée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med excellent. Soone after his returne from the Councell, it hapned the Pope to die. A great faction there was at that time in the Colledge of Cardinals, some taking part with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and some with the French king: Cardinal <hi>Poole</hi> was altogether Imperiall. All that side and diuers that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different gaue him their voices for the Papacy; whereunto whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had elected him orderly he forsooth found fault with them for their rashnes, and perswaded them to take further deliberation in so great and weighty a matter. Heere of the French party taking aduantage, began to cry out, it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son regard should be had of many French Cardinals and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that were absent, and could not possibly repaire vnto the election so soone; put them in minde also how the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had lately sacked Rome as it were in iest, &amp; that it was much to bee feared if they elected any man that were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther addicted vnto him it would bee a cause of great st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

One of their company then rising vp, began to take particular exceptions against Cardinall <hi>Poole,</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him with suspition of incontinency (whereof he allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged some reasons, though peraduenture friuolous) as also with her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But he was vtterly deceiued in his expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> cléered himselfe of all those suspicions ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, so that the next day (or rather I should say the night after the next day) the company were more resolute for him then they had béene before, and once more elected him Pope. Cardinall <hi>Farnesius</hi> the last Popes nephew was the mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of that canuasse. For so euer all Popes lightly take order, that some Cardinall of their kin shall strike a great stroke in the election of their successor, that hee may bee a meanes to shield the rest of his friends from that hard measure which successors are wont to meat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hée procured himselfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be appointed the Popes Legate, and to be dispatched into England with all spéed. The Emperour by this time had determined to endeauour a match betwéene his sonne <hi>Philip</hi> and Quéene <hi>Mary.</hi> Doubting therefore lest the presence of the Cardinall should disturbe his platforme, hee vsed many deuises to stop and hinder his passage, till such time as the marriage was indéede concluded. At last (but a day after the faire) ouer came this iolly Legate, reconciled the Realme of England to the Pope, caused the Archbishop of Canterbury to be depriued &amp; degraded, seating himselfe in his Sée, which things and many more are discoursed of him at large by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Foxe,</hi> and therfore I passe them ouer. He was consecrate March 22. 1555. in the gray Friers church at Gréenewich.

Being preferred himselfe, he was still moued with compassion toward his equals; but spared not his betters. Hee became first a Prior; taking part then with Priors, he would complaine of Abbots. Afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made an Abbot, fauouring his fellow-Abbots, hee ceased not to reprehend Bishops. And lastly when he was a Bishop himselfe, he began to sée how much more easie a thing it is to find faults, than to mend them. I thinke not (saith hee) that this Bishop was to be estéemed enuious, but beeing a wise man, hee expressed pretily an affection, as it were naturally engraffed in euery man; and was the more willing to take that kinde of fault vpon himselfe, that he might be the better heard of others. <hi>Ioan.

This Church (as the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor sayth) was hallowed and dedicated vnto the honour of our Sauiour, October 29. 189. by <hi>Faganus,</hi> and <hi>Damianus</hi> Bishops. About the space of 100. yéers, the Church of Christ had then peace in this land, viz. vntill the raigne of <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,</hi> who endeauouring to roote out Christian Religion, not onely killed the professors of the same, but also pulled down all Churches and Temples, any where consecrate vnto the exercise thereof. Amongest the rest, this of Winchester at that time went to wracke, the buildings thereof being rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:5993:117"/>
and made euen with the ground, and the Monks and all the officers belonging vnto it, eyther slaine, or enforced to flye for the present time, and yet afterward to deny Christ. This happened <hi>Anno</hi> 289. Not long after the death of this cruell tyrant, to wit, the yéere, 309. the Church aforesaide was againe réedefled, and that with such wonderful forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and zeale, as within one yéere and thirty dayes, both it and all the edifices belonging vnto it (as Chambers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther buildings, for the Monkes and officers) were quite fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished in very séemely and conuenient manner. The 15. day of March following, it was againe hallowed and dedicated vnto the honor and memory of <hi>Amphibalus</hi> (that had suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red death for Christ in the late persecution) by <hi>Constans</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop (as my Author saith) of Winchester, at the request of <hi>Deodatus</hi> Abbot of this new erected Monastery, 200. yéers and vpwards; it then continued in the same state, to witte, vntill the yéere, 519. at which time, <hi>Cerdicke</hi> the first King of the West Saxons, being a Pagan, conuerted the church into the Temple of <hi>Dagon</hi> (sayth the Manuscript aforesaid,) and eyther flow or chased away all the Monks and Ministers of the same.

Wherby ghessing his end not to bee far off, he determined to make vnto himselfe friends of the vnrighteous Mammon, bestowing well his goodes while he liued. And first he was purposed to haue built a monastery vntill that consecring with <hi>Hugh Oldham</hi> Bishop of Exeter a very wise man: Hee was aduised by him rather to bestow his money vpon the foundation of some Colledge in one of the Uniuersities, which should bee more profitable vnto the common wealth, and more auaileable to the preseruation of his memory. As for Monasteries (quoth he) they haue more already, then they are like long to kéepe. So by the counsel of this wise Prelate (whose purse also was a great helpe to the finishing thereof) the colledge of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> in Oxford was built, <hi>anno</hi> 1516, and endued by the said founder with possessions, to the yéerely value of 401. l. 8. s 11. d. Afterward in the yéere 1522. he bestowed the cost of building a faire frée schoole by the castle in Taunton (where the B. of Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster hath a goodly Lordship) and conuenient housing néere it for the Schoolemaster to dwell in: the like he performed at Grantham also, in which place it is probable hee might bée borne: lastly, it is to be remembred, that he couered the quier of Winchester, the Presbytery and Isles adioyning with a goodly vault, and new glased all the windowes of that part of the Church. It is said also that he built the partition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the presbytery and the said Isle, causing the bones of such Princes and Prelates as had bane buried here and there dispersed about the church, to be remoued and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in seemely monuments vpon the toppe of that new par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition. Many other notable things no doubt he did which haue not come vnto my knowledge. He was brought vp in Pembrooke hall in Cambridge (vnto which house hee gaue certaine hangings) and died a very olde man, <hi>anno</hi> 1528. when he had worthily gouerned the church of Winchester the space of 27. yéeres.

These reasons amplified with golden Rhetoricke, so perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the king, as he not only consented himselfe that this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery should be conuerted into a Cathedrall Church, and the Abbot made a Bishop; but also procured the Pope to confirme and allow of the same.

The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe of Lincolne was commanded to denounce this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication (which he did vnto his great trouble) and also, that if any of the excommunicate were dead, he should cause them to be digged out of their graues, and forbid them buriall in holy earth. This peremptory dealing of the Pope mooued the king vnto great choller: for diuers of those that were excommunicate, were persons of no small account; som of them of his Priuy Councell. Proclamation therfore was made throughout the Realme, that vpon paine of death, no man should hereafter be so hardy as to bring into the realme any kind of writing from the Popes Court. Some notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing contrary to this prohibition, deliuered letters to the Bishoppe of Rochester (then Treasurer of England) from the Pope concerning this matter, and fearing the worst had armed themselues. This done, they shrunke away and sled, but were soon after apprehended, and diuersly punished, some dismembred, other faire and well hanged. The Pope hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this, was so incensed, that hee wrote a very sharpe

Unto this man <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour (for diuers good seruices done vnto him) had promised long before, a Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke in England, if it should please God to send him victory. He was as good as his word, and the yeere 1070. preferred him to Dorchester, voide by the death of the former Bishop. The consideration of this gift comming to the Popes eare, he would néeds adiudge it symony, and as a Symonist actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally depriued him of his Bishopricke: But at the request of <hi>Lanfranke</hi> the Archbishop of Canterbury, he restored him to his ring and crosyer againe. Soone after his preferment, hée began to build at Dorchester, and intended great matters there. But order being taken in a Conuocation at London by the kings procurement, that Episcopall Sées euery where should be remoued from obscure townes to greater cities, he diuerted the course of his liberality from Dorchester to Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne. Lincolne at that time (saith <hi>William Malmsbury</hi>) was one of the most populous cities of England, of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort and traffique both by sea and land. <hi>Remigius</hi> therefore thinking it a fit place for a Cathedrall Church, bought cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ground vpon the top of the hill néere the castle then late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly built by <hi>William</hi> the conquerour, and began the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a goodly Church. The Archqishop of Yorke <hi>Thomas</hi> hearing of this designement, forbid him to proceede in that course, alleadging that Lincoln, Stow and Newarke were not onely of his Prouince and Dioces, but of the possessions of his Archbishopricke. This allegation, though friuolous, was an occasion of great charge vnto the Bishop, who was faine to worke the king to be a meanes of cleering that title, for which he gaue him (as saith <hi>Huntingdon</hi>) no lesse then 5000 pound. The fabrike of the Church beeing now fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and 21. prebends founded in the same, all which hee furnished with Incumbents very wel esteemed of both for lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:5993:159"/>
of England by the kings authority to be summoned therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. The rest came at the time appointed, which was May. 9. 1092. Onely <hi>Robert</hi> Bishop of Hereford absented himselfe, foreséeing by his skill in Astrology, that <hi>Remigius</hi> could not liue vnto the day prefixed, which also he foretold long before. It fell out (according vnto his prediction) that <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>igius</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two daies before the time appointed for this great solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Hee was buried in that his owne new built Church. This <hi>Remigius</hi> was a man, though of so high and noble a mind, yet so vnreasonable low of stature, as hardly he might attaine vnto the pitch and reputation of a dwarfe: So, as it seemed, nature had framed him in that sort; to shew how pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible it was that an excellent minde might dwell in a defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and miserable body. Besides this worthy foundation at Lincoln, he réedified the Church and Abbey at Stowe, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Abbey of Bardney. By his perswasion king <hi>William</hi> the conquerour erected the Abbeyes of Cane in Normandy, and Battell in Sussex vpon the very place where hee had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne king <hi>Harold</hi> in battel, and so made a passage vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the conquest of the whole land. <hi>Huntindon</hi> reporteth that he had béene accused of treason, but purged himselfe thereof by one of his men by walking vpon red-hote yron, and so was not onely acquitted, but restored to the kings fauour againe. The superstitious and credulous posterity ascribe diuers mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles vnto the holinesse of this Bishop, wrought (not in his life time<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And me thinks it were hard but he should know the truth, being a man that liued in those daies. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I hold it not fit to conceale, what I find in <hi>Matth. Paris</hi> touching the same matter. Where (saith he) before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest the Episcopall sée that is now at Lincolne being then at Dorchester; according vnto the demerits of the Bishop then gouerning, not onely he was depriued by the Pope, but the place it selfe also accursed; of so memorable an accident: after many yéeres there remained no memoriall, and so the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try continued long without either Bishop or Bishopricke. At last it came to passe that <hi>Wil. Rufus</hi> hauing throwen downe many Churches in the new Forrest, &amp; becomming penitent,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:5993:160"/>
for the same he determined in recompence thereof not onely to restore that noble Bishopricke to his former state, but to increase the same, and to remooue it to a more conuenient place. Wherefore hauing gotten, either by purchase or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, certaine land, from a noble man, one <hi>M. Gaunt,</hi> that came into England with his Father the Conqueror, and had the same bestowed vpon him for his seruice; Hee the saide <hi>William</hi> the second founded the Cathedral Church, which is now at Lincoln. Which being finished, he sent for two Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls, who brought with them all ample authority from the Pope, for the ordering of that Church and Bishopricke; and calling together eight Archbishops beside 16. other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, he caused the saide Church to be hallowed with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great solemnity, secular Canons to be placed in the same and their rents and seuerall portions to be distinguished and set out, that vnder their Bishop and Deane they might liue in good sort, &amp;c.

                  <hi>ROger</hi> that famous Bishop of Salisbury,<note place="margin">1123. <hi>Hen.</hi> 1.25.</note> was now so great a man with the K. (<hi>Henry</hi> the first) as being able to do with him what he list, he easily intreated him to bestow the Bishopricke of Lincolne vpon one <hi>Alexander</hi> his owne brothers sonne, a Normane borne, whome not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had made Archdeacon of Salisbury, and chiefe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of England. Hee was consecrate at Canterbury Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie 22. 1123. The next yeere after, his Cathedrall Church so lately built, and yet scarcely finished, was burnt and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly desaced by casuall fire. He repayred it againe, and added vnto it a speciall ornament, a goodly vault of stone, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:5993:161"/>
it had not, and therefore was the more subiect vnto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>re. He also increased the number of his Prebends, and purchased vnto his church certaine mannors and other lands. But his chiefe delight was in building of castles, wherein he imitated his vncle the Bishop of Salisbury. This humor was the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing of them both. To leaue the other vnto his owne place, <hi>Alexander</hi> built a stately castle at Banbury, another at Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke, and a third at Sleford. <hi>Newbrigensis</hi> reporteth that he also founded two monasteries, whereof one was Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerholm for white Canons and Nunnes, valued at the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression in 88. pound fiue shillings fiue pence, the other was S. Maries in Tame for white monks, valued at 256. pound, 13 shillings senen pence halfe penny, yéerely reuenue. His Castles were such eye-sores vnto king <hi>Stephen,</hi> as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked him to picke a quarrell otherwise vnto the Bishops, to clappe them vp in prison (where the other died) and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue them at once of these munitions and all their treasure, whereof they had hoorded vp great store. They that kept the castle of Newark refused to deliuer it at the kings summons, till such time as the Bishop intreated them to yéeld, signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (and it was true indéede) that the king had sworne hée should neither eate nor drinke before hee had possession of the castle. Hereupon they set open the gates vnto the king, and then with much adoo hauing lyen by it certaine months, hee was at last released of his imprisonment. After that, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the vanity of his former course, hee gaue himselfe wholly to building and aduancing the state of his Church, performed that which before I haue expressed, and so made it simply the most beautiful Church of England at that time. Hee was twice at Rome, to witte, the yéeres 1142. and 1144. where he behaued himselfe so, as hee pleased both the king and the Pope very well. The first time hee was there, the Pope gaue him authority to call a conuocation as his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and especially commended vnto him the redresse of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine enormities; for the effecting whereof he caused diuers canons to be made thought very necessary for those times. A 3. iourney he made vnto the Pope, lying then in France, in the moneth of August 11.17. where, through immoderate
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:5993:161"/>
heat of the weather during the time of his trauel he fell sicke, and with much adoo getting home, not long after his returne died, hauing sate Bishop about the space of 24. yeares.

In his time, the tyranny of the Pope was now growne to the full height and ripenes. What for appeales vnto Rome &amp; bribes at Rome, no iurisdiction here could punish any fault neuer so hainous. No benefice or other preferment was likely to fal, but the Popes reseruation would take it vp before hand, and bestow it at last vpon some stranger (happily a childe) that would neuer come néere it all his life long. The yéere 1252. notice being taken of this matter, the spirituall promotions of strangers within this Realme were found to amount vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the summe of 70000. marks by the yéer, wheras the kings yeerely reuenues at that time came not to the third part of that summe.

My aduice therefore is, that wée bée content to winke at this matter, and euen let him alone. Some say his counsell was followed, and the matter passed ouer in silence. Howbeit it is also reported (and both may be true) that afterwards (vpon some new quarrell peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) he was suspended at Rome, excommunicate, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly persecuted. Nay <hi>Bale</hi> affirmeth, that he was depriued by the said Pope, and another appointed to his Bishopricke to wit, one <hi>Albertus</hi> sometimes Archbishop of Prussia, that had been driuen out of Liuonia by the people of the country.

King <hi>Richard</hi> the first, being taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner by the Archduke of Austrich; he ioyned with <hi>Iohn</hi> Earl of Mortayne the Kings brother that sought to dispossesse his said brother of the kingdome, for which afterward himselfe, and his friends, indured much trouble, the history whereof is related by <hi>R. Houeden,</hi> who saith he was fain to redéem the Kings fauour with the payment of 5000. markes. Of the King, before that time (as it séemes) hee bought the mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of Couentry for 300. markes, intending to place secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Priests in the same. Thither hee came with a power of armed men the yeare 1190. and when the monkes would not giue place, inuading them with fine force, chased away some, beat and lamed other, spoyled their house, burnt their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and euidences, &amp;c. and then put in secular priests in their roomes. <hi>Bale</hi> reporteth that he could not cary this matter so cléere as that it cost him not some stripes: In the conflict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe was wounded, and that in the Church iust before the high altar. It séemeth he was a man learned, stout, and wise enough, but not so straight and carefull a censurer of his own manners and conuersation as hee should bee. No doubt our monkes (that were the onely writers of those times) speake no better of him then he deserues: yet for his religious and penitent end hee made they commende him much. Trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling toward Rome, in his own country of Normandy he fell sicke, and perceiuing his end to approach, sent for diuers reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious persons, vnto whom he acknowledged the loosenesse of his life, and with continuall teares greatly lamented the same, heartily requested them to pray for him, gaue al his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney &amp; goods vnto the poore, and lastly put on a monks cowle, thereby thinking to make the monkes amends for all the trouble and vexation he had wrought them. Hee died at Bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumerhill, or (as <hi>Roger Houeden</hi> reporteth) at Betherleuin March 27 1199. and was buried at Cane in the 14. yéere of his troublesome gouernment.

He writ diuers workes wel estéemed of in times past. In them hee maketh report of certaine visions and strange apparitions he had seene scarce credible. He was consecrate at Rome vpon Easter day 1224. In his time a great contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:5993:176"/>
was raised betwéene the Monkes of Couentry, &amp; the Cannons of Lichfield, about the election of their Bishoppe, which euer since the remoouing of the Sée from Chester, had belonged vnto the Monkes. After the spending of much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney vpon this suit in the Court of Rome, the matter was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered there by definitiue sentence in this sort. It was agréed that they should chuse <hi>alternis vicibus,</hi> the monkes one time, and the Canons of Lichfield the next: But in all elections as well at Lichfield, as at Couentry, the Prior of Couentry was allowed to giue a voice, and it must be the first voice. Of this Bishop, the king (<hi>Henry</hi> the 3.) stood in great iealousie, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the great familiarity that was betwéene him and the Earle Marshall that gallant rebell. Wherefore on a time, the King charged him as a party in the Earls conspiracy, which tended (as hee sayd) to the deposing and displacing of him from the Kingdome. To cleare himselfe from so hainous an imputation, he tooke no other course but this; hee put on immediately his Episcopall roabes, and solemnly accused all those that had but any thought of so wicked a practise. It was well accepted by the King, and gaue satisfaction. Concerning this man, it is also to bee remembred that hee was founder of a house for the Gray Friers, in the South west part of Lichfield, died at Andeuer, December 26, 1238. and was buried at Lichfield.</p>

               <p>Upon what occasion I know not, had spoiled the Church of all ornaments, chased away the Canons, and inuading al the possessions of the same, had conuerted them to his owne vse; so that the Canons remaining, which fled not for feare of this tyrant (they were onely fiue) they (I say) were faine to begge their bread. The Bishop complaining vnto the King of this outragious hauocke, found cold comfort at his hands: For, whether it were for fear of <hi>Haralds</hi> power or his wiues displeasure, he caused no restitution at all to be made. Onely the Queene was content to giue of her owne, Marke and Modesty vnto the Church. After the death of King <hi>Edward,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:5993:197"/>
Giso</hi> was faine to flye the land, till such time as <hi>Harold</hi> the sacrilegious vsurper being vanquished and slaine, <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror was a meane to restore, not onely him to his place and country, but his Church also to all that the other had violently taken from it, except some small parcels that, (I know not by what meanes) had beene conueighed vnto the Monastery of Glocester. Yet in stead of them also, hee was pleased to bestow vpon the Church, the mannor of Yat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, with the Patronage of the benefice there; and moreouer caused one <hi>Ealsi</hi> to restore vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same the mannor of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham, which long since had been alienated from it, by some si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister practise as it should seeme. <hi>Giso</hi> being thus setled, took great paines, in recouering such other things as had bin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besilled from his Church, in procuring such things as seemed to be wanting, and charters of confirmation for the better as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of what already they had: Namely, of one <hi>Arser</hi> a Courtier he found means to obtaine the mannors of Coomb-Nicolas, Woormister and Lytton. Then seeing the state of his Church so wel amended, he thought good to augment the number of his Canons, and for their better intertainement built them a cloyster, a hall, and a dorter or place for their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. Lastly hee appointed one <hi>Isaac</hi> by the name of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uost to be their gouernour. Hauing béene Bishop the space of 28. yéeres he departed this life, and was buried vppon the Northside of that place where the high altar then stood.

The continuer of <hi>Florent. Wig.</hi> setteth downe the history thereof at large. After his deliuerance, he tooke great paines in labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring an agreement betweene the Churches of Wels &amp; Bathe who had now many yeeres contended which of them should bee honoured with the Episcopall Sée. At last with the good liking of both parties, he set downe this order, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops heereafter should be called, Bishops of Bath &amp; Wels; that each of them should by commission appoint electors (the See being void) by whose voyces the Bishop should bée cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen; and that he should be installed in both of these churches. Then, whereas a kinsman of <hi>Iohn de Villula</hi> being appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him Prouost, by vertue of that office had withdrawn and conuerted vnto his owne vse, in a manner all the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of old, belonging to the canons, with great labour &amp; cost at last he procured, all that had appertained vnto them to bée restored againe. And to take away all occasion of the like v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation, he thought good to diuide the lands of the Church into two parts, whereof the one he assigned vnto the chapter in common; out of the rest he allotted to euery cannon a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the name of a Prebend.

The Subchauntership, together with the Prouostship an. 1547. were taken away and suppressed by act of Parliament, to patch vp a Deanry, the lands and reuenewes of the Deamy being deuoured by sacrilegious cormorants. Moreouer, and beyond all this, whereas our Church of Welles at this time was excéeding ruinous, and likely euery day to fall to the ground, he pulled downe a great part of it, and repaired it.

            <p>About the yeare 1040. (or soone after) Saint <hi>Peters</hi> church in Exceter was appointed the Sée for both Deuonshire, and Cornwall. And hath euer since that time so continued.</p>
            <p>NOw to come vnto the particular history of this Church you shall vnderstand, that amongst many religious houses erected heretofore in and about the City of Exceter, thrée there haue béene sometimes within the scite and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuite of that place, which now is called the close of S. <hi>Peters,</hi> The first of these was a house of Nunnes where the Deanes house and the Calender Hay or Uicars close doe now stand: The second was a Monastery for Monkes supposed to bée built by King <hi>Ethelred,</hi> the third sonne of King <hi>Ethelwolph,</hi> about the yeare 868. And the third was also for Monkes, to witte, of the Order of S. <hi>Benet,</hi> founded by King <hi>Athelstan,</hi> the yéere 932. therabout where the East parts of the church now called the Lady Chappell, standeth. Of this foundation thus one writeth.</p>

But after the time of K. <hi>Athelstane,</hi> the Danes with great hostility and cruelty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ouerrun this land, this City and Church was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested and troubled: for with no lesse cruelty did the Danes pursue the Englishmen and Saxons, then did the Saxons before pursue the Britaines. And then the Monkes not able to endure the same, sted and forsooke their house, seeking pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of refuge and better fafety And so was this Monastery left destitute, &amp; forsaken for sundry yeeres, vntill the time of King <hi>Edgar.</hi> He making a progresse into these West partes to visite <hi>Ordogarus</hi> Earle of Deuon. (whose daughter hee had married) came to this City, <hi>ann.</hi> 686. and pittying their distressed state, restored them their house &amp; liuelihoods: And appointed <hi>Sydemanus</hi> (who afterwards was Bishop) To bée their Abbot.

He first began to enlarge and encrease his Church from the Channcell downewards, and layed the foundation thereof.

Upon his toombe is written, <hi>Petra tegit Petrum, nihil of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiat sibi terrum.</hi> The Franciscanes or Gray Friers of this City, imputed his death to his hard dealing with them. For whereas hee had promised the King to prouide a conuenient place for them to build their house in, and had willed their warden, named <hi>Deodatus</hi> to séeke out and make inquiry for the same; yet notwithstanding when he had so done, because the same was within his Fée, swaruing from his said promise hee vtterly denied to performe the same, beeing disswaded by <hi>Peter Kenefield,</hi> a Dominicane or a blacke Frier, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor vnto him the said Bishop: For he enuying the good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of the Franciscanes, aduised the Bishop, in no wise to permit them to enioy the place which they had gotten. For (saith hee) as vnder colour of simplicity, they créepe into the harts of the people, and hinder vs poore Preachers from our gaines and liuings; so bee ye sure that if they put foote within your Liberties, they will in time find meanes to be exempted from out of your Liberty and iurisdiction. The Bishop being soone disswaded, vtterly forbiddeth them to build, or to do any thing within his Fée or liberty. About two yéeres after, the Bishop kept a great feast vpon the Sunday next before S. <hi>Francis</hi> day; And among others, <hi>Walter Winborne,</hi> one of the Kings chiefe Iustices of the bench, was inuited, who had béene present when the Bishop at the request of the King made promise to further and helpe the Franciscanes.

It fortuned that the same weeke, and vpon Saint <hi>Francis</hi> eue, the Bishop tooke a certaine Sirope to drinke, &amp; in too hasty swallowing thereof, his breath was stopped, and hee forthwith died.

A Iury being empannelled hereupon, found them guilty, and the officers tooke order for the apprehending of the murtherers if they might bee met withall. The Monkes greatly offended herewith, first ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated the Citizens, then shutting the gates, not onely prepared themselues to defence, but also beganne to offend the other, shooting at the passengers first, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward issuing out of their gates, killing diuers persons, and spoyling many houses. The Citizens greatly incensed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, fired the gates, entred the Monastery, and after a long conflict, a great number being slaine on both sides, preuailed, risled the Priory, and set fire on the same in diuers places at

The monkes for their part appealed to Rome, and so handled the matter, that they not onely escaped punishment, but also forced the Citizens to pay them 3000 markes, after 500. markes a yéer toward the reparation of their Church, and to present them with a Paxe of gold of seuen pound waight.

He was by &amp; by much admired for the straight life heled; and for the opinion men had of his holinesse so estéemed, as no preferme might fall whereof he was capable, but immediately it was cast vpon him. He was first made Master of the children, then Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Treasurer of the Church, after Prior there, then Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of Glocester, and lastly Bishop of that Dioces. It is said, he refused obstinately to yeeld consent vnto his election a long time, protesting he had rather lay his head vpon a blocke to be chopt off, then to take so great a charge vpon him. No man

               </hi> an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorite reprehended him sharply for his backwardnes; assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him, he offended God much in the same. His excuse was, want of learning: And certaine it is, that his defect that way, was so notable, as in the time of <hi>Wil.</hi> Conquerour (when all English Prelates were sifted to the branne) hée was called in question for insufficiency, and had beene depriued (as it is thought, at least wise) if hée had not beene found somewhat more sufficient then was expected. Hee was consecrate Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 8. 1062. by <hi>Aldred</hi> Archbishop of Yorke, <hi>Stigand</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then suspended. But that he might acquite himselfe from vsurpation of any right belonging to Canterbury, he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required him to make his oath of profession vnto Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, but also renounced all right of pretended iurisdiction vnto the Dioces of Worceter, acknowledging the same to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to Yorke (as some of his predecessors had affirmed) but to Canterbury, as to the Metropolitane of the same. Now to come vnto his gouernment, we are to remember especially two things memorable of him. One, the building of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall Church, which he raised from the foundation. At what time it was come vnto such perfection, as that the monkes forsaking their olde habitation, betooke themselues vnto this new built; the other Fabrike whereof <hi>Oswald</hi> was Author, (as in Yorke you may read more at large) was pulled down.

Earle of Mount-gomery, <hi>Barnard Newmarket, Roger Lacy, Ralfe Mortimer</hi> and other, attempted to take the City of Worceter. This Bishop, not onely resisted them, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall exhortations in preaching and otherwise contained them in very dutifull obedience, but also arming such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people as the citty could affoord, caused them to sally out and set vpon the enemy, whom they discomfited, killing and taking a number of them prisoners.

After that, when the king was content to winke at the mariage of many Priests in the realme (vnto whome (I meane married Priests) the Archbishop was a grieuous and heauy aduersary) and receiued of them yearely a great summe of money for defending them against the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity of the other, (to wit <hi>Anselme</hi>) this Bishop resisted the collection of that mony in his Dioces, calling it the tribute of fornication; and when (notwithstanding his resistance) it was paied, hee interdicted his owne Dioces, commaunding the Church-doores euery where to bee stopped vp with thornes. The king (a wise and gentle Prince, <hi>Henry</hi> the first) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not vouchsafing to contend with him, or taking his well meaning in good part, was not onely content to pardon this disobedience, but also bestowed the money so gathered in his Dioces vpon him, saying it was a poore Bishopricke and née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded such helpes.

            <head>THE BISHOPPES OF OXFORD.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout the yeare of our Lord 730. there liued a Duke of Oxford, (our histories term him so) called <hi>Didan</hi> or <hi>Didacus.</hi> He had a daugther of excellent beauty named <hi>Frideswyde,</hi> who though shée had many importunate suters, men of great wealth and nobility, yet desiring to serue God in such sort as she thought might bee most acceptable vnto him, would néeds dedicate her selfe vnto a sole and monasticall life. Amongest the rest of her wooers, there was one, a young Gentlemen of great power (some say hee was king of Leicester) whose name was <hi>Algarus.</hi> Hee not preuailing by intreaty, thought to vse force, and vpon a time, getting company about him, had almost seased vpon his desired pray: which he had so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly be set, as she had no way to escape his his hands, but by flying into a wood. Thither also he followed her, and that so neere, an leauing it, shee had much adoo to recouer Oxford. Perceiuing then that neither she was able to flye any further for wearinesse, nor yet to withstand him there, shée called vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for assistance against this importunate louer, who
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:5993:265"/>
thereupon (as the story saith) was miraculously stricken blind; And he continued in that case, till by her prayers he recouered his sight againe. Upon this occasion (saith <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Malmsbury</hi> and the rest of our Histories) the Kings of England tooke a conceit, that it was not safe for any Prince to enter Oxford, in so much, as euery one, being loath to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the triall of it in himselfe, it was euer auoided by them, till the time that King <hi>Henry</hi> the third prooued it altogether vaine by his owne experience. Howbeit it appeareth their report in that behalf to be vntrue, for that both before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest and after many kings repayred thether, as <hi>Burchardus, Almedus, Canutus, Harold, K. Stephen, Henry</hi> 1. and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond with some other. In this place, <hi>Didan,</hi> by the intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his daughter, built a Monastery for Nunnes, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed her the Abbesse. It happened then about the yeare of grace 847. in the time of King <hi>Egelred,</hi> that certaine Danes flying into this Monastery to saue their liues from the blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy cruelty of the English pursuing them; when otherwise they could not be gotten out, the Monastery was fired, and they all burnt in the same; But it was réedified shortly after by the same kng, and further enriched with diuers possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This notwithstanding, soone after it fell into wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full great decay, so as no body caring to inhabite the same, it was giuen by <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror vnto the Abbey of Abingdon for a Cell or remoouing house. They not greatly esteeming it, were content that <hi>Roger</hi> Bishop of Salisbury their Ordinary, should confirme it unto one <hi>Guimundus,</hi> Chaplaine vnto King <hi>Henry</hi> the first, a man wise, learned, and religious, that tooke vpon him to place Regular Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons in the same. Hee did so the yeare 1110. became Prior of this new (or rather renewed) Monastery himselfe, took other vnto him, repaired in very good sort the ruinous buildings, and by the fauour of King <hi>Henry</hi> the first recouered vnto it what lands soeuer had beene giuen héeretofore vnto the Nunnes. In this state then it continued, vntill that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Woolsey</hi> get licence for conuert it into a Colledge 1524. calling it by the name of the Cardinals Colledge. He leauing it vnperfect, King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight gaue it a foundation, the stile whereof hee first appointed to be <hi>Collegium Regis Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rici

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Brittish histories doe all report that in this Island at the first planting of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion heere, there were establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed 28. Episcopall Sées (as in S. <hi>Aug.</hi> of Canterbury I haue before declared.) Of these 28.3. were Archbishopricks, London Yorke &amp; Carlegion or <hi>Carleon</hi> vpon Uske in Monmouthshire. At Carleon (which was then a great and populous City) in the time of K. <hi>Arthur,</hi> sate <hi>Dubritius</hi> the sonne of <hi>Eurdila</hi> a gentlewoman of great birth, but who was his Father it was neuer knowen. He was a man of excellent learning and singular integrity, in regard whereof, when first he had taken great paines many yeares, as well in teaching and reading vnto his schollers (whereof hee had a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) as in preaching vnto the people; he was made Archbishop of all Wales, by <hi>Germanus</hi> &amp; <hi>Lupus</hi> two Bishops of France, that were intreated by <hi>Aurelius Ambrosius</hi> the king or ruler of Britaine, to come ouer and yéeld their best holpe for extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing the <hi>Pelagian</hi> heresie, that had then taken great roote in this Country. And they appointed his Sée to bee at Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daff, which soone after was remoued to Caerlegion vpon Usk in Monmouthshire. <hi>Aurelius Ambrosius</hi> beeing dead, hee crowned. <hi>Vther Pendragon,</hi> and afterward that great <hi>Arthur</hi>

king of this Island, and waxing olde, resigned his Bishoprick vnto <hi>Dauid</hi> a disciple of his. Hee died and was buried in the Isle of Enlhi, now called Bardsee (where hee ledde a solitary life many yeares) Nou. 14. <hi>anno</hi> 542. His bones were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward remoued to Landaff by <hi>Vrbanus</hi> Bishop there, May 7. 1120 &amp; laid before the altar of our Lady toward the North.</p>

A man very learned, eloquent, and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible austerity, of life and conuersation. Hee was also ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tall of stature, and of a comely personage. By his diligence, <hi>Pelagianisme</hi> was quite rooted out, and many earnest proses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of the same conuerted vnto the trueth. With the consent of king <hi>Arthur,</hi> he remooued his Sée from Caerlegion to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenia, which euer since of him is called of the Welch Twy Dewi, and of vs Saint <hi>Dauids.</hi> A place neither pleasant, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, or safe: For (as <hi>Giraldus Cambr.</hi> reporteth of it) it is neither furnished with wood, watered with riuers, beautified with medowes, nor inriched with any kinde of fruitfull soile; affoording plentifully nothing but rockes and barren hils, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement winds and tempests, and lastly the dangers and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries whereunto solitary places n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It séemeth he misliked the frequency of people at Caerlegion, as a meanes to withdraw him from contemplation, whereunto that hée might hée more frée, hee made choice of this place for his Sée rather then for any fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the same otherwise. He sate long, to witte, 65. years, and died at last, <hi>ann.</hi> 642. (hauing first built 12.

He was buried in his owne Cathedrall Church, and some 5. hundred yeares, after Canonised a Saint by Pope <hi>Calixtus</hi> the second. Many things are reported of him incredible, &amp; therefore not worth rehearsing, although I doubt not but God affoorded many miracles to the first infancy of our Church, neither therefore would I be so peremptory in derogating too much from such

little or no memoriall, but their names onely. In his time, the Sée of Saint <hi>Dauid</hi> had seuen Bishops Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragans subiect vnto it (as the foresaid antiquity declareth) to wit, Exceter, Bathe, Hereford, Landaff, Bangor, Saint Assaph, and Fernes in Ireland. <hi>Roger Houeden</hi> (which I account more likely) reckoneth these, Landaffe, Lanpatern in Cardigan shire, Bangor, Saint Assaph, Chichester, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reford &amp; Worceter. While he was Bishop it happened the people of all that Country were wonderfully vexed with the Iaundise, so as great numbers of them died dayly of that disease. By the importunity of his Clergy and Disciples, he was induced to flie the Country, and sayled into Britaine, where the Bishopricke of Dola being void, he was straight way elected vnto the same. Hee had brought thither with him the Archiepiscopall pall of Saint <hi>Dauid,</hi> and vsed it du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life, as did also his Successors there for many yéers, vntill they were compelled by the Pope, at the suite of the Arcbishop of Turon to leaue it, and make profession of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience vnto him, as in former times. By this occasion it fel out that the successors of <hi>Sampson</hi> in Saint <hi>Dauids,</hi> what for want of their pall, or for pouerty or negligence, or by some other occasion, lost their title of Archbishop, and to this day neuer recouered the same. Howbeit they vsed all authoritie belonging to an Archbishop, by consecrating of other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; &amp;c. Neither euer did they make profession of subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction vnto Canterbury vntill the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the 1. king of England, whereof we shall speake more hereafter.

Betwéene this Bishop and the Abbot of Salop there was much contention, and a long suite at Rome about the placing of a Uicar in Blanch-Monastery (the tithe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of his predecessor had giuen to the said Abbot.) The issue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was, that the Abbot, for the quiet enioying of his tithes, was faine to passe all his lands in S. Martins vnto the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop. The like controuersie fell out betwéene him and the Abbey of <hi>Valle Crucis</hi> concerning the Uicarages of Llan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gollen, Wrexham, Ruabon, Chirke, Llansanffcayd and Landegla, the patronage of all which Churches by sentence of the Officiall of Canterbury, and the Abbot of Tallelechew the Popes Delegates, was adiudged vnto the Bishop and his Successors. He gaue two third parts of the title of <hi>Brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eglwis</hi> to <hi>Valle Crucis:</hi> In regard whereof Llandegla was wholly restored to his patronage, in a suit against <hi>Thomas Cantilupe</hi> Bishop of Hereford, concerning the iurisdiction of the Territory of <hi>Horddor,</hi> hee had not so good successe as in the former. The said <hi>Thomas</hi> dying, <hi>Richard de Swinfield</hi> his next successor was content to compromit this matter to the arbitrement of <hi>Richard</hi> Bishop of London, who awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the iurisdiction to Hereford, and the Bishops of Hereford to this day do hold the same. To this Bishop and his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors for euer, <hi>Gruffith Vaughan ap Gruffith ap Madoc</hi> Lord of Yale, gaue the Lordship and Mannour of Llandegla. <hi>anno</hi> 1278. Hee the saide <hi>Anian</hi> was once minded to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his Episcopall Sée from Lanelwy to Ruthlan (which is two miles off) in regard that Lanelwy was but a Countery village, where the Canons could not dwell in any safety, by reason of the continuall warres. King <hi>Edward</hi> the first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised ground to build a Church vpon there, and a thousand Markes toward the charges of building. And letters were written to Pope <hi>Martyn</hi> the fourth the yeare 1485. to craue his licence for this translation. What should be the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and let of procéeding according to this proiect, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ghesse, except happily the Popes death, who deceased 1286.

Notwithstanding whether it were that the Church by them planted had many notable wanes and intermissions, or rather eclipses, in which
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:5993:298"/>
the light of heauenly doctrine was altogether darkened by great persecution, and so no Ecclesiasticall history preserued; or whether the same being preserued, was destroied by perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, scarcely any mention remaineth of any of their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. Onely of London, there are remembred 15. Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and of Yorke 4. The first of these, and the first Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop that euer Yorke had, our histories say was one named <hi>Sampson,</hi> appointed by the foresaid king <hi>Lucius,</hi> the verity whereof I cannot but suspect in regard of the name. For I finde not that the names of the old Hebrewes or Christian Saints were yet in vse It is then also reported that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius Chlorus</hi> the Emperour appointed <hi>Taurinus</hi> Bishop of Eureux to be Archbishop there, as also that King <hi>Arthur</hi> made choice of one <hi>Pyrannus</hi>; and lastly that <hi>Tadiacus</hi> was the last Archbishop before the comming of the Saxons. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had gotten possession of this Realme, the Britons (that were the old inhabitants) being drouen into a corner thereof (Wales and Cornewal) the rest of England was without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny knowledge or inkling of the Gospell, vntill the comming of Saint <hi>Augustine.</hi> And after him a great while the North parts of this realme remained in the darknesse of their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ignorance, till God looking vpon them with the eye of his mercy, gaue this occasion of their conuersion. <hi>Edwyn</hi> King of Northumberland, was very desirous to marry <hi>Edilburge</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sister of <hi>Eabald</hi> king of Kent. She being not onely a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, but a very vertuous Lady; vtterly refused to match with him so long as he was a Pagan, but signified, that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition hee would promise to become a Christian, shee would accept him for her husband. He answered, he could be very well content to do nothing in preiudice of her faith; and to suffer that not onely herselfe, but her seruants and traine should practise what religion they would: And professed with all that it vpon consideration and conference with wise men, Christian religion shold seem more holy and worthier of God then his owne, he would not refuse to embrace the same. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these conditions <hi>Edilburge</hi> was sent vnto him to be his Quéene. And least by keeping company with the Heathen people, she and those that went with her might in time be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with their Paganisme; it was thought conuenient to
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:5993:299"/>
send some learned and Godly man with her, that might not only instruct and admonish them daily, but also minister the Sacraments vnto them, yea, and preach the Gospell vnto Infidels. <hi>Paulinus</hi> a reuerend man was made choice of, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they thought good to consecrate Archbishop of Yorke, which was done by <hi>Iustus</hi> Archbishop of Canterbury the 21. day of Iuly, in the yeare of our Lord 625. or as some account, 622. He mindful of his vocation, as soone as he came into the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, laboured diligently to winne soules vnto Christ, but without any profit at all a great while:

               <p>So long as the King remained obstinate, little good was to be done with the rest of the people. Him therfore he often exhorted to embrace Christ; and preuailed at last so farre with him, as hee promised to doe it, if it might please God to send him victory against <hi>Guichelm</hi> King of the West-Saxons, that had conspired his death. This victory beeing obtained according to his desire; He yet kept not promise, but delayed the matter, vnder pretence of perswading his Nobles first to bee content therewith; And longer still hee would haue delayed it, had not God by <hi>Paulinus</hi> put him in minde of a vision, hee had seene long since (as <hi>Beda</hi> reporteth) and it is this. <hi>Elfridus</hi> that raigned ouer the Northumbers next before him, sought nothing more then the death of this <hi>Edwin,</hi> to whom indeede the Crowne of right appertained. Hée therefore slying from his enemy, ranged vp and downe in many Countries, and that in the most secret manner hee might, till at last hee came vnto <hi>Redwald</hi> King of the East Angles, humbly beseeching him that hee would saue his life by sheelding him from <hi>Edilfrid</hi> his cruell enemy. The king bid him welcom, and promised to fulfill his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. Nothwithstanding which his promise, being offered a great summe of money by <hi>Edilfrid</hi> to betray him, and threatened with warre, if hee condescended not vnto him; he yeelded at last, and determined to gratists him therein, thogh contrary to his word and faith giuen. This resolution of the Kings being vnderstood by a companion of <hi>Edwins,</hi> he called him out of his bed late in the night, told him how the world went, and bid him shift for himselfe; whereunto hee
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:5993:299"/>
answered couragiously, that for his part hee would not first breake with the king; if the king estéemed so little of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as to sell it for money, better it was for him to dye by the appoitment of him that hee knew loued him (though hee loued money better) then by the appointment of his deadly enemy, whom by flying he well saw he could no longer auoid.

Soone after hée was gone, <hi>Edwyn</hi> espied one comming toward him that he knew not, who demanding of him why he sate there at that time of the night, other men being asléepe? What is that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you saith <hi>Edwyn</hi> whether I spend the night within doore or without? Héereunto the other answered, thinke not my friend that I am ignorant of thy sadnesse, &amp; the cause of thy present griefe, I know them very well: But tell me (quoth hee) what reward wouldest thou giue vnto him that should ridde thee of all this care and trouble, and perswade <hi>Redwald</hi> neither to hurt thee himselfe, nor to suffer other to doe it. When he promised to do any thing in the world that lay in his power to performe, the other added; what if hee should also promise thée the kingdome due vnto thée, and the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of thine enemies that séeke thy life; yea and moreouer that thou shalt be the mightiest king, not onely of all thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, but of all the Saxons that euer were in this Isle? Hereunto he answered in effect as before, hée would doe his best to requite so great a benefit. Why then (quoth the other, and withall laid his hand vpon <hi>Edwyns</hi> head) when all these things shall come to passe, and that thou shalt be shewed a more excellent way to direct the course and maner of thy life, then euer was imparted vnto any of thy predecessors; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member by this token (of laying my hand on thy head) to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low without delay the directions that shall bee giuen thee. This hauing saide, hée vanished away to the great woonder and astonishment of <hi>Edwyn,</hi> who had not sate there long; but his companion before mentioned, came running foorth vnto him with great ioy, and told him that <hi>Redwald</hi> by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of the Quéene had altered his determination, and was resolued (whatsoeuer came of it) to stand to his word, and to be true vnto him. To make short, God so mooued his
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:5993:300" rendition="simple:additions"/>
heart that he was not only content to defend <hi>Edwyn</hi> as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore; but also gathered suddenly a great army, and going in person against <hi>Edilfrid,</hi> he ouercame and slue him in the field: whereby it came to passe, that <hi>Edwyn</hi> with one consent of all his subiects was made king. Now this vision (saith <hi>Beda</hi>) God reuealed vnto <hi>Paulinus</hi> the Archbishop, who comming vnto <hi>Edwyn</hi> the king, at a time when he chanced to sit alone, deliberating with himselfe what religion it were best to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; hee stept vnto him, and laying his right hand vpon his head, asked him if he knew that token? Presently the King forgetting all Pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ncely maiesty, fell downe trembling at poore <hi>Paulinus</hi> feet, and said he knew it very well, in so much as, héereafter hee would follow his direction (for matters of Religion) in all things. The King beeing thus wonne vnto Christ, and hauing receiued his badge and cognisance by Baptisme; the rest of the nobility first, and then the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty gaue diligent eare vnto the Bishops preaching, and were conuerted daily in great numbers. It is said that for 36. daies together <hi>Paulinus</hi> the Archbishop neuer rested one moment, but either instructed the people by preaching that flocked continually about him; or else imparted Christ vnto them in Baptisme, which he ministred in the open fields and riuers, Churches being not yet built. King <hi>Edwin</hi> against the time of his owne Baptisme, had caused a little Church to bee erected of boords and timber in the City of Yorke, &amp; dedicated the same to S. <hi>Peter.</hi> Afterward hee laid the foundation of a very stately building round about the wooden Church, which (he being taken away by vntimely death) his successor <hi>Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald</hi> finished. <hi>Sedwall</hi> king of Wales, and <hi>Penda</hi> of Mercia or Mid England came against this good king, and (God in his secret iudgement permitting the same) ouerthrew him in the field and slue him. The Country by reason héere of being full of trouble, <hi>Paulinus</hi> (that saw he might not with safety abide any longer there) sixe yeares after his comming thither, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by water into Kent againe, and there was intreated to take on him the gouernment of the Sée of Rochester then void.

                  <note place="margin">666</note> the Church of Yorke was twenty (some say thirty) yeares without a Pastor by reason of the continuall warres and other troubles that happened by the persecution of <hi>Pagans.

And first, he light vpon certaine Courtiers that had beene beholding vnto his Father for diuers curtesies. By them he was presented vnto the Quéene, as a child for wit and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty not vnfit to do her seruice; Shee by questioning sound the
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:5993:301"/>
inclination of the boye, that hee was desirous to become a Scholler. Therefore shee sent him to one <hi>Cedda,</hi> that of a Councellor and Chamberlaine to the King, had become a Monke at Lindisfarne, whether it might not bee the man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, I discerne not. By him he was diligently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, and being very sharpe-witted, profited wonderfully vnder him. At that time there was a great contention in the Church about the obseruation of Easter; whereof this youth being desirous to bee fully informed, determined to goe to Rome, and study there a while. By meanes of <hi>Eanfled</hi> the Q. aforesaid, and <hi>Ercombert</hi> K. of kent, he was furnished for this voyage &amp; sent along with one or two other. In the way he fell acquainted with <hi>Wulsinus</hi> Archbishop of Lyons, who made very much of him, &amp; stayed him with him a time, to the great increase of his knowledge. Continuing then no long time at Rome, in his returne homeward, hee was ordered by the Archbishop of Lyons aforesaid, who also adopted him to be his sonne. Hee meant not to haue returned into his owne Countrey, but that this Archbishop was taken from him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing murthered by <hi>Brunechildus</hi> the Quéene that had cruelly slaine 9. other Bishops before. Presently vpon his returne home, king <hi>Egfrid</hi> gaue him a house and maintenance, and many noblemen admiring much his learning and eloquence, bestowed diuers things vpon him; at last with great applause &amp; liking of al men, he was chosen Bishop, &amp; sent into France, where he was consecrate by 12. other Bishops: for he refused to take consecration at the hands of the Scottish bishops, that were counted schismatiques in not agréeing with the church of Rome concerning the time and obseruation of Easter. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the seas he stayed somwhat longer then hee néeded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delighted with the company of many learned men of that country: and when he would haue returned, by tempest of weather he was driuen into farre countries, where he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred a long time. Coming home, and finding another man in his place, hee liued a while a priuate life. In which mean space he was often inuited by <hi>Wulfher</hi> king of Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land vnto the Bishopricke of Lichfield. In the ende <hi>Cedda</hi> being remooued (as before is said) he setled himselfe at Yorke, and posted <hi>Cedda</hi> to Lichfield. Then, the first thing hee went
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:5993:301"/>
about was to finish his Cathedrall Church left vnperfect by <hi>Paulinus,</hi> and since his departure very much decaied (for the roofe was fallen, and the walles in many places ruinous) this his Church I say hee repaired, and finished, mending the walles, couering it with lead, glasing the windowes, and moreouer beautified the same with many goodly ornaments. He was so greatly beloued of al sorts of people for his gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, affability &amp; liberality, as many men liuing, but more at their death (especially Cleargy men) would put their goods &amp; children into his hands; the one assuring themselues of a faith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full keeper, the other of a discréete and conscionable dispender.

                  </gap>tuffe very sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The report whereof comming to the eares of <hi>Theodore</hi> Archbishop of Canterbury: it put him in minde of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of that Dioces and the ability of the Country to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine more Bishops. Wherefore hee went about to appoynt two or thrée other Bishops vnder him. Which when <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fride</hi> obstinately refused, and the other ceased not to vrge very earnestly; he appealed vnto the Pope, and went vnto him in person. Some report (I thinke vntruly) that he went about to perswade the Quéene to forsake her husband, and betake her selfe to a monastery; and that the king being greatly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased héerwith, first sought to diminish his authority by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more Bihops, and afterwards made diuers complaints vnto the Pope against him, séeking to haue him depriued. Whosoeuer caused it, certaine it is, that to the Pope he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled. In passing of the Sea, hee was driuen by a contrary winde into Frizia, and staied there all winter preaching the Gospell (neuer heard of in that country before) vnto the king and people, whom before his departure hee conuerted vnto Christ. The Pope was then at the Councell of Constance; where, both by him and his Councell it was ordered, that the state of the Bishopricke of Yorke should not be altered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Wilfrids</hi> owne consent. But <hi>Egfride</hi> the king so fauored <hi>Theodores</hi> deuise, as <hi>Wilfride</hi> at his returne perceiued wel, he must either yéeld vnto it or forsake the country Heerin me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks he was to blame: Not induring to take a repulse in a
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:5993:302" rendition="simple:additions"/>
matter he had trauelled so much in; He rather chose to leaue Bishopricke, country and all, and to liue in pouerty and exile. He went into Sussex, and there indeuouring to conuert the people of that country vnto the faith of Christ, became their first Bishop, and laid the foundations of a Cathedrall church, the Sée being afterward remooued to Chicester. Sée more heereof in Chicester. After ten yéeres banishment, K. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frid</hi> dying, <hi>Alfrid</hi> that succéeded him sent for <hi>Wilfride</hi> and desired him to returne to this Sée of Yorke: which hee did. But after fiue yéeres, the king fell out with him, and forced him to Rome againe. There purging himselfe of all the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations laid against him by the king, he obtained the Popes letters in fauour of him; by meanes wherof, and intercession of many friends, with much ado, at last he was restored once more vnto his first charge; in which after this his last restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee liued peaceably the space of fower yéeres, and died then, being seuenty sixe yéeres of age, October the twelfth the yéere 711. forty fiue yeeres after his first consecration.

One thing also encreased his credite much: <hi>Vrsus</hi> Earle of Worceter had built a Castle

there to some preiudice of the monks, insomuch as the ditch of the said Castle empaired a little of the Church-yard. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> went vnto the Earle (hauing before admonished him to right the wrong) and hauing demanded of him whether it were done by his appointment (which he could not deny) loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king stedfastly vpon him, hee vsed these wordes; Hightest thou <hi>Vrse?</hi> Haue thou Gods curse and mine, &amp; of all hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heades, except thou takest away this Castle; and know thou assuredly, that thy posterity shall not inherite the land and inheritance of Saint <hi>Mary.</hi> This his curse séemed to take effect; for <hi>Vrsus</hi> died soone after, and <hi>Roger</hi> his sonne a very small time enioying his fathers honour, lost the same and was faine to flie the realme for killing an officer of the Kings.

Yet remembring himselfe at last, he went to Rome, to plead his cause before the Pope, and obtained letters to the King, and Archbishoppe of Canterbury in commendation of his cause. These letters preuayling nothing with the Archbishop that would bee wonne by no meanes, and <hi>Thurstan</hi> continuing as obstinate in his resolution: The See remained voide a long time. At last it fell out that a Councell was summoned to be held at Rhemes, <hi>Thurstan</hi> crauing leaue of the King to goe
<pb n="850" facs="tcp:5993:311"/>
thither, could not obtaine it before he had promised that hee would not receiue consecration there. Which promise not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, so well hée followed his businesse, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the comming ouer of other English Bishoppes to the Councel, he was a Bishop ready consecrate as well as they, and that by the hand of the Pope himselfe. So he (and he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I thinke of all the Archbishops of York since the Conquest) neuer made profession of subiection to the Metropoliticall Sée of Canterbury. The king hearing of this dealing, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry greatly offended with <hi>Thurstan,</hi> and forbad him England. Neither could the Pope (meeting with the King at Gisors. and intreating for him) so pacifie his displeasure, as that hee would suffer him to returne. After fiue yeeres banishment, the Pope writ a very sharpe letter vnto the king, signifying that hee would excommunicate both him, and the Archbishop of Canterbury also, if <hi>Thurstan</hi> were any longer kept from his Sée and charge. Hereupon he was called home, and some after reconciled vnto the King. This man is much praysed first for his learning, then for his greate wisedome and discretion; and lastly, for his industry and diligence, his care and painfulnesse, in well gouerning the charge committed to him. Hee was a very kinde man to his Canons, vnto whom amongst other things, hee affoorded this priuiledge, that the yearely profit of their Prebends, being diuided into three parts, it should bee lawfull for any Canon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath two parts of the yeare next ensuing his death, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotting the third vnto the fabricke, that is, toward the repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church. This order hee set downe not onely at Yorke, but at Beuerley also, at Southwell, at Rippon, and at Glocester; all which were Colledges founded by Archbishops of Yorke. Moreouer it is to bee remembred, that hée either founded a new, or renewed and repayred eight Monasteries. One of them was that of Fountaines for white Monks, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at the suppression in 1173. l. 7. d. ob. yearely reuenew. In the latter end of his time, to wit, Iune 4. 1137, a lamentable chance befell his Church and City. By casuall fire Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Church in Yorke, Saint <hi>Maries</hi> without the walles, a hospitall of his owne building, and nine and thirty other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were destroyed, and the whole city almost vtterly consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.

But the blessing and prayer of this holy man (he supposeth) preuailed so much with God, as they were all miraculously preserued from drowning.

This was a greater wound then it might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be cured. Sixe or 7. yeares after it brake out againe, to wit, an. 1207.

Amongst many rich men that were nothing mooued with compassion toward the poore daily perishing for want of releefe, this Archbishop is especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally noted, that had fiue yeares corne in store and would not thresh it out. Being told at last by his officers, that it was much to bee feared, it was consumed by mice, or some other way much the worse for so long standing: hee bid them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer it to the husbandmen that dwelt in his Mannors, vppon condition they should pay as much new corne for it after har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest.

They were scarcely vp, when they saw a blacke smoake rise out of the corne, and felt a most loathsome stinke, which compelled them with all haste possible to get them downe againe.

               <p>WHen the King heard of his death,<note place="margin">1259. <hi>Hen:</hi> 3.40.</note> he determined not to suffer his place to be filled ouer hastily. All other Bishoprickes of England (saith he) haue been in my hands heretofore, but this neuer: Therefore I must be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised how I let it passe out of my fingers. The Chapter after a conuenient space, made choise of <hi>Sewall</hi> their Deane that was brought vp in the Uniuersitie of Oxford, a man modest, vertuous and learned; being well seene not onely in Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, but in Law also and much other good learning. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of his writings remaine and are remembred by <hi>Bale</hi> in his Centuries. Hee was a diligent hearer of <hi>Edmund</hi> of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benden (after Archbishop of Canterbury, and canonized a Saint) at what time hee read the Diuinity lecture in Oxford. This Saint <hi>Edmund</hi> (as <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> reporteth) would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tell his scholler <hi>Sewall,</hi> that out of all question hee should die a Martyr. How farre foorth this prediction fell out true, you shall heare anon. Now the King not liking this speed of the Chapter-men, as not being for his profit, hindred the new elect what hee might; and for want of better matter, alleaged against him that hee was a bastard, and so by the Cannons vncapable of that honour. It was true enough, and how he salued that sore, I cannot tell: A dispensation belike from Rome (where all things were then to be had for money) tooke away that obstacle. I finde he was consecrate by the suffagran Bishops of his owne Prouince, Iuly 23. 1256. a yeare and almost three moneths, after the death of his predecessor. His Deanry being thus voide, the Pope tooke vpon him to bestow the same vpon one <hi>Iordan</hi> a stranger, that vnderstood not one woorde of English, and otherwise vtterly vnwoorthy of that goodly preferment. This <hi>Iordan,</hi> doubting least in taking pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session

This being done, though in hugger mugger, was quickly brought vnto the Archbishops eares; who grieued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely at the same, and sought by all meanes possible to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anull and make voide the Popes gift. The Cannons and Church-men were so amazed with this strange and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary course (strange in those dayes, but afterwards too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) as they knew not what to doe or say. It séemed most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd and detestable vnto them, that so high a dignitie, and an office of such importance, in place and authoritie next vnto the Archbishop, should bee conferred vpon a base, obscure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible fellow. But they stood so in awe of the Popes ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, whereunto the King had subiected, and as it were, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate himselfe, that they durst not make any profession of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. About the same time the Pope sent a commandement into England, that three hundred of the next benefices that fell should bee bestowed vpon certaine Italians that hee named; men ignorant of the English tongue, and though otherwise perhaps worthy the places appointed them (which is greatly to be doubted) yet in that respect most vnfit heere to haue cure of soules committed vnto them. In this iniurious course, our <hi>Sewall</hi> couragiously withstood him; and not onely by word and letter sharply reprehended the Pope, but also in déeds resisted this his tyrannie, vtterly refusing to admit either <hi>Iordan</hi> vnto the Deanry, or any other of his Italians to any other promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his Diocesse For his labour he was quickly suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Wherewith he was so little terrified, as that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, hee stood still stoutly to his tackling, and yéelded not one inch. <hi>Iordan</hi> therefore, whether doubting of good successe, or wearied with trouble, or in regard that hee perceiued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe very odious in Yorke, resigned his Deanry, accepting a pension of a hundred markes out of it. This composition with <hi>Iordan,</hi> nothing appeased the Popes fury: determining belike to make him an example to other, hee first caused his crosse in contumelious manner to be taken from him, and soone after thundring out his greatest excommunication, causing

him to bee cursed throughout England with b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So long he denied to bow his knées vnto this <hi>Baal,</hi> as ouercome with care, and not enduring those continuall mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations, he died at last hart-broken, much better deseruing the name of a Martyr, then many other to whom the Church of Rome hath afforded that title. Lying vpon his deathbed, &amp; perceiuing his end to approach, with watry eies looking sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly towards Heauen, in the bitternes of his soule he made this prayer, which I thinke not vnworthy in this place to be inserted: Lord <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> thou most iust iudge, from whose omnise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He was executed vpon Whitson munday, being the eight of Iune, 1405. and was buried in the East part of the new workes of his Church of Yorke; in which place, as also the field where hee died, certaine miracles are sayd to haue béene done, and are ascribed vnto his holinesse. It is deliuered also, that the king presently after his death was stricken with a leprosie. He was the first Bishop that I finde put to death by order of Law.

By his meanes hée was consecrate Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe of Oxceter, the 25. of Nouember, 1455. at what time hée was not fully twenty yeares of age. The yéere 1460. hée was made Lord Chancellour of England, the youngest Chancellour I thinke that euer was, eyther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or since his time. In that office hee continued till the yéere 1464. viz. vntill the marriage of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the 4.

Presently after his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Winchester, he began to fall, and fell so fast, as if death had not happily staid him; hee had quickly fallen from much, to much lesse then nothing. The king vpon a displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure (how iust God knoweth) discharged him sodainely from
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:5993:332"/>
the office of Chauncellour. His goods were all seased to the kings vse, and himselfe ready to hée attaint by Parliament, had not <hi>Thomas Cromwell</hi> (after Earle of Essex, then his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant) taken great paines in defending him. When that course succéeded not, he was charged to haue fallen into a <hi>Premunire</hi> by exercising his power Leganti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Héereunto hée answered that hee had authority thereto from the King vnder his broad seale (as it was well enough kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen hée could prooue) though that amongst the rest of his writings were now in the hands of his enemies. But (quoth hée) I will neuer stand vpon that point. Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer I haue, I haue it from the king; if it bée his pleasure to haue me in a <hi>Premunire,</hi> let it be so, I must and will be at his mercy. Almost halfe a yéere hée liued néere London to great penurie; one while at Asher (a house belonging to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke of Winchester) and another while at Richmond; the which house, the King had lately giuen him in exchange for Hampton Court All which time, he had scarce a cuppe to drinke in, or a bed to lye in, but what was lent him; for his mooueables and houshold stuffe of inestimable valew, were all taken away to the Kings vse. At last hee was sent downe into Yorkeshire, and there liued all a summer in reasonable good sort. About the beginning of Nouember that yeare, which was 1536. the Earle of Northumberland arrested him of high treason, and tooke order to haue him brought vp to London: but he sel sicke by the way, and died in the Abbey of Leicester, (as it should séeme of a fluxe whereunto a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall feauer was ioyned) when hée had béene sicke the space of 8. daies, viz. Nouember 29. 1530. hauing béene Archbishop 15. yeares, and being within foure moneths of 60. yeares of age. His last words are said to be these: If I had serued God as diligently as I haue done the king, he would not haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen mee ouer in my gray haires; but this is the iust reward that I must receiue for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In his flourishing time, hée beganne the building of two most stately Colledges, one at Ipswich, the other at Oxford; and it is great pitty hee finished them not. Had they béne perfected, I thinke they

I thinke verily (and am able to yeeld good reason of my surmise) that if one man had now in his hands the reuenues of all the Bishopricks and Deaneries also in England, his rents would not arise to so high a reckoning, as the yeerely receits of this Cardinall. Yet was it not his owne purse that gaue him courage to so great an enterprise: for his bounty was such as hee could not but spend all hee receiued. The number of his seruants daily attending in his house were well néere fower hundred, of which there were one Earle, nine Lords, a great number of Knights and Esquires. I reckon not all this while his seruants seruants, which it is thought grew to a farre greater number. Hee obtained leaue of the Pope to dissolue forty small monasteries; the spoile wherof furnished him principally for the building of his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, but opened a gap withall to king <hi>Henry,</hi> to destroy all the rest, as soone after hee did.

               <p>THis <hi>Cuthbert</hi> is said to be descended of the bloud royall of the kings of Ireland, being sonne of one <hi>Muriardach,</hi> and <hi>Sabina</hi> his wife, that was daughter vnto a king there. He was brought vp in the Abbey of Mailros, first vnder his predecessor <hi>Eata,</hi> and afterwards vnder <hi>Boisill,</hi> that succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Eata.</hi> After the death of <hi>Boisill,</hi> hee was made Abbot of that monastery, which hee ruled with great care and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. And not content to looke vnto those onely, the gouernement of whom was especially committed vnto him; Hee vsed often to trauell into the country neere adioyning, sometimes on horsebacke, sometimes on soote, preaching di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently the worde of God, instructing the ignorant in the way of life, and sharply reprehending vice where hee saw cause. And his manner was to frequent especially, the most rude and barbarous places, to which hee thought no body else would resort, least the people there beeing altogether neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, might perish for want of their spirituall foode. He was a very personable man, well spoken, and so mighty in perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as none that ouer he dealt withal was able to withstand the force of his words. Hauing continued this manner of life at Mailros many yeeres, at the importunate request of his old master <hi>Eata,</hi> he was content to leaue the place and to liue once more vnder him at Lindisfarne. But affecting much an Eremeticall and solitary life, he refused to liue with the rest of the monkes, and seated himselfe in the Island of Farne, a desert place 9. miles within the sea, hauing in it neither house nor water. Yet there hee made a shift to liue, labouring with his owne hands till he was chosen Bishop. A great while hee refused obstinately to forsake his solitary life, euen vntill the king himselfe comming ouer vnto him partly by force, &amp; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by intreaty, induced him thereunto. So with much adoo he accepted consecration at last, and receiued the same at Yorke vpon Easter day, at the hand of <hi>Theodore</hi> Archbishop of Canterbury (6. other Bishops assisting him) the yeare 684. in the presence of king <hi>Egfride,</hi> and many of his nobles. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had beene Bishop two yeares, he would needs resigne,

and returned to this Island againe, where soone after hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his life. The day of his departure (to wit March 20.) is consecrate vnto his memory.

Now you shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that vnto the same Bishop belonged two men, vnto whom for the most part he committed the ordering of all his affaires; <hi>Leofwyn</hi> or <hi>Leobwyn</hi> his chaplaine whom hée tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with all houshold matters, and <hi>Gilbert</hi> a kinsman of his owne that dealt in his causes of temporall gouernment. In these offices they behaued themselues so; as the Bishop had cause to commend their diligence, but to blame their rashnes and wilfulnes in many things. Which notwithstanding, he bare withall, either because their industry and care of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, so blinded his eyes as he could not espy their misbeha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour otherwise, or else being loath to deiect them whom he had once aduanced, These men, and especially <hi>Leofwyn</hi> did greatly enuy the credite that <hi>Leulfus</hi> had gotten with the Bishop, and euery where opposed themselues against him, not onely in wordes, traducing his actions, but in deedes, also still thwarting and crossing his endeauours. Whereby it came to passe, that many iarres fell out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. One day amongst the rest, a court being held in the presence of the Bishop, <hi>Leofwyn</hi> or <hi>Leobwyn</hi> (for so also I finde him called) according vnto his wonted manner, gaue <hi>Leulfus</hi> ill spéeches, which he not enduring to heare as heerto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had done <hi>(furor sit saepius laesa patientia)</hi> answerd this salvey Chaplaine somewhat more roundly then hee had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed. Whereupon hee rose straight from the Court in great indignation (<hi>Leofwyn</hi> I meane) and calling <hi>Gilbert</hi> aside, with little adoe perswaded him to carry a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of armed men to the house where <hi>Leulfus</hi> lay, and in a night to kill him; which indéede hée performed with great
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:5993:341"/>
cruelty, murthering not onely the innocent gentleman him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but also his seruants and whole houshold. The newes of this horrible and outragious cruelty, comming vnto the eares of the Bishop, amased him very much and suspecting it was done by the aduice of <hi>Leofwyn,</hi> turning him about vnto him.

So not doubting it would breed much danger vnto him, he got him into his Castle, and presently dispatched mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers vnto the friends and kindred of <hi>Leulfus</hi> that was slaine; protesting that the fact was committed without his knowledge that he was maruellous sorry for it, and if any man suspected him, would be ready to submit himselfe to any order of law, whereby hee might cleare himselfe. Herewith they séemed to be satisfied; but for conclusion of a firme peace amongst them, it was thought sit they should meet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of the matter. They met at a place called Goates-head. The Bishop for his better safegard betooke himselfe vnto the Church with his company. The people (whereof an infinite number were gathered together) abode without. Messages a while passed betweene them, but the more the matter was debated (being very odious of itself) the more the people were incensed. At last it was told them how not only <hi>Leofwin</hi> but also <hi>Gilbert</hi> had been harboured in the Bishops house and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorded countenance of him since the murther: which being once heard (and it was true enough) they all cried out, it was manifest that the Bishop was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> author of this fact. It is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore deliuered by <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> that the Bishop not long before this, amongst many intollerable exactions layd vpon the Countrey by him, had commanded the summe of 400. l. to be leuied at this time That being also remembred, while as all the company stood in a mammering, doubting what course to take, one of some speciall regard among them stept vp, vsing these words, <hi>Short read, good read, slay ye the Bishop.</hi> Heereupon without more adoe they ran all vnto the Church, killed so many of the Bishops retinue as they found without doores, and with horrible noise and out cries bid him and his company to come out vnto them.

But to make the best of a badde match, and to try all meanes of ridding himselfe from the danger eminent, hee perswaded his kinsman <hi>Gilbert</hi> there present to goe foorth vnto them, if happily his death (which doubtlesse hée had well deserued) might satisfie their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The monks (whom he sauoured much, for hee expelled diuers married priests out of his Church of Durham, whom <hi>Walter</hi> was content to beare withall, and suffered onely Monkes there) they prayse him for a man of great wisdome, learning and vertue. Certaine it is, that he was very subtle, whereby (as also by the volubilitie of his tongue, which hée had passing ready at commandement) hée got very farre into the fauour of the king <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, and afterward of his sonne <hi>William Rufus,</hi> vnder whom hée did euen what he list. Unto the latter of these hée prooued very vnthankefull, ioyning himselfe with <hi>Odo</hi> Bishoppe of Bayon in a rebellious conspiracy against him. The Rebels béeing ouerthrowne, he was faine for his safeguard to shut himselfe vp within the walles of Durham. The king hasting thither by greatiournies, besieged him, and after a short time had the towne yeelded by composition, wherein it was conditioned, that the Bishop and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny should depart in safety. So he got him beyond the seas, and liued in exile three yéeres, <hi>viz.</hi> vntill September 11. 1090. at what time the King comming to Durham, recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him to grace, and restored him to his former dignity, that very day three yeares that he departed thence. After that time hée omitted nothing, whereby hée might curry fauour with the King, euer applying himselfe that way whither hée saw him to encline. In all the broile betwéen the king and <hi>Anselme,</hi> hée was the chiefe stirrer against the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishoppe, hoping belike, so to assure himselfe of the Kings fauour, and if <hi>Anselme</hi> should be displaced (which hée ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured) hee thought no man so likely then to succéede him as himselfe. But hée failed in both of these purposes; for the kings displeasure was his death. He was summoned to appeare before the King at Glocester, at a day, before which time (for griefe as it is thought) hée fell sicke. When hée appeared not, and it was tolde the king hée was sicke: he sware by <hi>Lukes</hi> face (that was his vsuall oath) he lied, hée did but counterfeit, and hée would haue him fetcht with a
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:5993:343"/>
vengeance. It appeared the excuse was true inough; for soone after; viz. the second of Ianuary, 1095. he died at Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, hauing beene Bishop 15. yéeres. This man pulling downe to the ground the Church of Durham, that <hi>Aldwinus</hi> had first built, began to erect another farre more magnificent but liued not to finish it. Himselfe <hi>Malcolme</hi> K. of Scots, and <hi>Turgot</hi> Prior of Durham, laied the first thrée stones, Iuly 30. or (as some deliuer, Aug. 11.) 1093. It is said, that lying vpon his death bed, and thought to be past memory (if not dead) diuers Prelates that were in his Chamber, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred about the order of his funerals, and amongst other things appointed the place of his buriall to bée in the church vpon the building whereof hée had bestowed so much. The supposed dead man euerheard them, and gathering his forces together, made shift to breath out these wordes: God forbid (saith hée) that by my buriall you should preiudice the honor of Saint <hi>Cutbert,</hi> for reuerence of whome, neuer any of my predecessors would endure to bée laide there. Bury you me therefore in the Chapter house.

Now that he might haue some colourable excuse of not performing his how, he caused the King to alledge that he might not bee spared out of the realme in his absence: and to make this the more probable, giuing the king 1000. markes, he perswaded him with that kind of golden Rhetoricke to make him chiefe Iustice of England. The like Rhetorick it was that induced the Pope to dispence with his vow, vnto which the excuses before alledged made som way, but could neuer haue effected the busines without that helpe.

The Kings house at Eltham was part of that land. He built the house and gaue it vnto <hi>Elianor</hi> Quéene to King <hi>Edward</hi> the first, as also vnto the king the Castle of Sourton beside Yorke, which likewise he built. A man now of this extraordinary wealth must not content himselfe with ordinary titles: Therfore hee procured the Pope to make him Patriarke of Hierusalem, and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the King the principality of the Isle of Man, which hée held during his life. The yeare 1294. beeing Embassador to the Emperor, the Archbishop of Yorke <hi>Iohn Roman</hi> (vpon what quarrell I know not) excommunicated him. It cost the Archb. 4000. markes fine and his life in the end. Hee died (as it is said for thought.) Sée more in Yorke. Great sturres there were betwéene this man and his Couent of Durham. He informed the Pope that the Prior there was a very sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and vnsufficient man to rule that house, and procured the gouernment thereof for all matters both spirituall and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall to be committed vnto him. Héereupon he sent certaine officers to execute in his name that new obtained authority, which when they came to the monastery, were shut out of the gates and not suffered to enter.

This notwithstanding the Bishops officers made no more adoo, but excommunicated Prior, Monkes, and all, for not obeying their authority immediately. Herewith the king
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:5993:351"/>
greatly offended, caused these officers to be fined, and summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Bishoppe himselfe to appeare before him at a day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; before which time he gotte him to Rome, neuer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting the King with his determination.

He writ also vnto the Pope, in fauor of the Prior, who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the kings letters himselfe, was adiudged a sober and discréete man, whatsoeuer the Bishop had reported of him. So hée was restored to his place againe, but died before hée could get home. During the time of the Bishops disgrace, amongst many other things wherein the liberties of the Bishopricke were infringed, it is specially to be remembred, that the king tooke from him diuers Castles, and lands forfait vnto him by <hi>Iohn Bayliol</hi> king of the Scots and other, (to wit Werk in Tiuidale, Perith and the Church of Simondbury, but <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is Beaumont</hi> one of his successors recouered them againe by Law.

Now was the monke a Bishop without a Bishopricke. Hauing no other home hee was faine to returne to his cloyster, and there for very griefe (as it is to be supposed) within a few daies after died. This <hi>Richard de Bury</hi> was borne at Saint Edmunds-Bury in Suffolke, whence he tooke his surname; for he was the sonne of one sir <hi>Richard Angaruill</hi> knight.
