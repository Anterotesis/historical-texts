            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>His Princely deſires ſeruing him as wings to flye ouer the dangers of the Seas, into <hi>Spain,</hi> there to behold that admirable Lady of the world, (for Birth, Beauty, and all the richeſt Ornaments, both of Minde and Body) the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spaine, (Donna Maria</hi>) Siſter to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the fourth King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> could not truſt the Sea with a greater maſſe of Treaſure, yet ventured ſhe to lock it vp in the boſome of the deepe: <hi>France</hi> in a ſhort time had gotten into her poſſeſſion a richer Flower than her owne Flower <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luce,</hi> and but for a ſhort time kept it: for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Seas, nor Land had charmes ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to hold the vnbounded ſpirit of our Prince, vntill he had arriued at that place, to which the brauery of his reſolution had vowed to carry him. The Heauens had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to waft him vnto <hi>Spaine,</hi> and there, after many weary iourneys, did they ſafely bring him to the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Court, at his royall City of <hi>Madrid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What exultations were made at his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall, what generall acclamations ſhouted out his Welcomes: His Magnificent entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, princely Feaſtings, with all the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities of Kingly Triumphs, that either ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous expences, quickneſſe of inuention, or the cuſtome and quality of that Countrie could bring forth, haue beene already ſo ſhril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſounded out of the Trumpet of <hi>Fame,</hi> that here againe to proclaime them, were to ſet vp a Candle, after a Firmament of lights had ſhowne them to the world.</p>
            <p>Now albeit, (aboue theſe Temptations,) there was in the young King, and our Prince (of themſelues) ſufficient allurements, not to haue them parted aſunder, (they being as Darlings one to another;) for they were a paire
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8180:4"/>
of ſweet-ſounding Inſtruments, ſet to one Tune, and equally ſtrung with the ſame Number of yeares, (or not much differing:) All their thoughts, wiſhes, recreations, ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Actions, being Lines meeting in one Center, and their often-infolded Armes, the circumference to that Center.</p>
            <p>Nay more, albeit, that high-borne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, <hi>Donna Maria</hi> the Infanta, through the naturall Magicke of her Beauty, ſweetneſſe of Voyce, variety of Languages, with all the rareſt and moſt princely comportments, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to her birth was able to faſten, ſuch a power vpon our Prince, that he well might beleeue no countrie in the world but <hi>Spaine</hi> was worth his abiding in it. Adde likewiſe to this boundleſſe Ocean of Delight, other cleere-running ſtreames falling into their Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as the continuall and endeerde Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Infante Cardinall, and the Infante <hi>Don Carlos</hi> (brothers to the King:) bring vp beſides to theſe, all the Honors, comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, congratulations, attendances, and courtly regards beſtowed daily vpon our Prince, by Grande's, Conde's, and Lords of State; the leaſt of which by it ſelfe, but all

of them knit together, being of vertue to make any man conſent to be drawne away in ſo golden a Chariot: Yet there was a heape of Kingdomes (one day to be his owne) which beckond to haue him come and feele their embraces.</p>
            <p>Hee might as farre as from the Court of <hi>England,</hi> to that at <hi>Madrid</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> heare his Royall Father (King <hi>Iames</hi>) often wiſh, to haue his princely <hi>Charles</hi> againe by his ſide. Not that he feared any malitious danger could fall vpon him, (There,) but rather at his being parted from thence, when thoſe two inuincible Pirats of the Sea, (the windes and the waues) ſhould fall out and fight one againſt another, might play the Traitor and take him from vs.</p>
            <p>Hee might heare the Lords of his Fathers moſt Honourable priuie Councell, lamenting for his abſcence: The Nobility diſcontented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſighing, the cleargy ſtill praying for him: the Gentry complaining, and the common people more than madde in their longings, to haue him make a quicke returne home.</p>
            <p>Thus, were the warning-pieces, which continually were ſhot off to giue him notice,

how much the kingdome ingenerall lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for him.

He was no ſooner in the towne, but his deſire was to take a view of his Fleet, being attended by many great Lords of Spaine who had come along to Saint <hi>Andera</hi> with him; the <hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Monterey</hi> being a principall; with many Engliſh of good quality.</p>

His Highneſſe after all that feaſting and triumphing in Saint <hi>Andera,</hi> being deſirous to go aboord that goodly ſhip (the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall of his Fleet) called the Prince, (a title due to it for the brauery and Princely building of it) ſpent ſo much time, that the euening drew on apace, and with the euening a more threatning enemy: for not onely the tyde reſiſted his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming backe (his Highnes being then in his own Barge, &amp; his owne Watermen rowing in it) but a ſtorme began to ariſe, and the billows to ſwel high, before the Watermen had gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> halfe way fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſhips to the towne, the diſtance between the ſhore and the ſhips being at leaſt a Spaniſh league.

ouer that Horizon, denied that comfort, for if they ſhould miſſe the ſhips, they were in doubt to be carried into the maine, the channell where the Fleet anchored, running with an impetuous and irreſiſtable torrent.

            <p>And ſo much greater was the danger, by how much the night (by reaſon of the ſtorme) grew darker and darker: yet at laſt, that omnipotent Arme, which can teare vp rocks from their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that voyce which can call in the winds; and ſtill them with the mouing of his finger, ſent a Doue with an Oliue branch in her bill, as an aſſurance of comfort.

            <p>The Fleet approching neerer and neerer, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Dunkerkers &amp; Hollanders were at it pell mell: Hereupon two Ships of his Highneſſe Fleet, called the ſeauen Starres and the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow (being the formoſt of the reſt) gaue them a Shot and haild them; vpon which firſt came vp foure Shippes ſingled from the reſt, who being asked what they were? they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerd Men of Warre, and of Dunkerks: Our Men bid them goe to the Lee-ward, and ſpeake to the Prince of England; they preſently did ſo, and went vnder our Princes Sterne.</p>

The Hollander ſeemed vnwilling to this, vrging rather the contrary; but his Highneſſe (out of a noble deſire to ſaue the ſhedding of bloud) vſed many gracious mediations to draw them to peace, and preuailed ſo much at that time, as that they parted friends &amp; vpon equall termes; And for preuention of returning to their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, his Highnes ſet them one from the other ſome good diſtance off, and ſo let them goe.</p>

               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:8180:23"/>Memorable therefore for euer amongſt vs, bee the fift day of October, for our Prince his ioyfull Arriuall here in England, after ſo many tempeſts at Sea, and hazardous Aduentures by Land, in his paſſage through other Kings Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions: As thoſe two other fift daies ſtand remarkable to the end of the world; <hi>viz.</hi> the fift of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and fift of <hi>Nouember</hi>; the firſt for the particular preſeruation of our King; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, for the generall deliuery of our Country. Let one red Letter more bee now added to our Calendar, &amp; an Anniuerſary held with thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing to God, and with Belles and Bonefires, teſtifying the ioy of the people in memory of ſo ineſtimable a happineſſe.</p>
            <p>And now to ſhut vp this ſhort Diſcourſe with a matter worthy obſeruation: What an vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected comfort was mixed with the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of thoſe 9. Priſoners. (7. Men and 2. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) when the very ſound of a Princes Name ſtayed the hand of the Law from ſtriking them? Ioy did ſo tranſport the ſoule of the whole Kingdome, that death was loth to do his Office euen vpon thoſe poore condemned Wretches: Mercy ſet a Portcullis before the gates of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſo that when her ſword was vpon draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to cut off the liues of 9. miſerable Creatures,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8180:23"/>
the very breath of our Princes comming put the blow by: In ſtead of that charitable Bell, which at the end of euerie Seſſions, is with a dolefull ſound rung out after mid-night, to put condemned perſons in remembrance of their end, which is to be the next morning, the poore ſoules were cheered vp, with peales from a thouſand Belles long before breake of day, ſo that in ſtead of being cald downe out of the Iayle to go to their deaths, they came as ioyfully from their Dungeon, as if they had beene to haue gone to a Wedding.</p>
            <p>Neither hath this abundant grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Prince giuen glad hearts and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tongues to theſe 9. only (their Pardons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now ſignd) but it flyeth like a gentle gale of Wind, into all the Priſons of the Land, to fanne comfort, and freedome, to all ſuch as lie impriſoned or condemned for petty Crimes.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, to ſaue the Reader a labour of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ouer Leaues, to ſatisfie himſelfe, with a briefe Calender how time went away with the Prince after hee came to Port Saint <hi>Andera,</hi> let him bee thus informed; That his Highneſſe came to that Towne, on the 10. of <hi>September,</hi> (this yeare 1623.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:8180:24"/>The whole Fleete came and met him there on the 11. day.</p>
            <p>In feaſting the Spaniſh Commiſſioners, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueying his Fleete, taking leaue, and other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencies required in a deſigne of ſuch State, 6. dayes more were ſpent.</p>
            <p>On the 18. day he put to Sea; on the 29. day he put into the <hi>Sillies</hi>; and on the 5. of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> landed at <hi>Portſmouth</hi>; ſo that hee continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Sea, in his comming homewards, 18. daies.</p>
