         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the Archbiſhop of CANTERBURY: in

of the Revelation of John.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Prophecie begins in an Expoſition on the 13 Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> Verſe 11. where he
ſaith, <hi>I beheld another beaſt. John</hi> ſaw the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Biſhop of Rome <hi>riſe out of the ſea;</hi> that is, the
great Beaſt, Verſ. 1. but this is not that Beaſt, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and yet a very Beaſt, another Antichriſt,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coming out of the earth]</hi> The other <hi>Beaſt</hi> was to be <hi>raiſed</hi> out of
thoſe Cardinalls that are in the <hi>Sea</hi> of Rome, but <hi>William Laud,</hi> this
Beaſt, was to <hi>come up out of</hi> a Proteſtant Church, where Popery was
buried; and to act in the raiſing of thoſe dead aſhes to life, to bring in
Popery againe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he had two hornes]</hi> Thoſe two hornes are the two ſeats where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he ſate Judge, the one in <hi>temporall</hi> matters, and the other in <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;</hi>
and thus by the <hi>High-Commiſſion,</hi> the <hi>Spirituall Court,</hi> the <hi>Starre
Chamber,</hi> and other places where he ſate in <hi>Judgment,</hi> he <hi>puſhed,</hi> and
cauſed to be impriſoned, whipt, pillori'd, ſtigmatiz'd, and the eares to
be cut off of divers godly people that came before him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Like a Lamb]</hi> Thus: 1. As a <hi>Lamb</hi> is <hi>little,</hi> ſo the Archbiſhop is a
<hi>little</hi> man. As a <hi>Lamb</hi> is of a <hi>meeke</hi> nature, ſo he hath alwayes made a
ſhew as if he had been a meek man. 3. As a <hi>Lamb</hi> couples not with a
Ram, but followes the Ewe, ſo the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> would not marrie, but
followes the Church. And laſtly, as a <hi>Lamb</hi> pretends to be a <hi>type</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo hath he alwayes pretended to do all things in the name of
<hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he ſpake as a Dragon]</hi> At the opening of the Dragons mouth
comes forth poyſon: and thus the poyſon of Aſps hath been alwayes
under his tongue; and in all his actions were great cruelty againſt Gods
people; and the Saints that came before his Judgment-ſeat, became
like a prey to the <hi>Dragon.</hi>

Verſ. 12. <hi>He exerciſed all the power of the firſt Beaſt before him]</hi>
The firſt <hi>Beaſt,</hi> that is, the <hi>Pope,</hi> ſent the other <hi>Beaſt,</hi> that is, <hi>William
Laud Archbiſhop of Canterbury,</hi> a <hi>Cardinalls Hat,</hi> and approved and
authorized all his doings: particularly to thoſe Jeſuites and Prieſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Queene; to the new Book of Common Prayer to be ſent into
Scotland; and thoſe things which were of greateſt moment, he uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had the approbation and authority of the Pope of Rome for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, juſt as <hi>Johns Revelation</hi> foretells.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And cauſed the earth, and them that dwell therein, to worſhip the firſt
Beaſt]</hi> Thus he cauſed Altars of earth and ſtone to be ſet up, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
to be brought in, and the people to be compelled to idolatry and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,
according to the Popes Decrees.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whoſe deadly wound was healed]</hi> This wound was given (not to the
Archbiſhop of the Proteſtant Church, but) to the Pope, in the Reigne
of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, and healed again by Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> but Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> gaſht open that <hi>deadly wound</hi> here, by ſetling the Proteſtant
Religion again; and this deadly wound the Archbiſhop had healed in
part, ſo as he made the Popiſh Church to look up again and live; but
not perfectly to cure her wound, for it is deadly.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And he doth great wonders]</hi> The Archbiſhop hath not
onely done wonders, but made England a wonder to all Nations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the ſight
of men]</hi> The idolatry, and ſuperſtition, and other wonderfull things by
which he cauſed the Church to ſin againſt God, provoked the Lord to
ſend downe fire from heaven on the earth, in the ſight of men: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,</p>
            <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth]</hi> The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
hath been a notable deceiver; for whileſt he did alwayes pretend
to caſt out Popery and faction, he endeavoured nothing more then to
bring it in, and ſettle it amongſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By the meanes of thoſe miracles he had power to do in the ſight of the
Beaſt]</hi> The miracles which he hath done are many, in the eys of Rome
and all the Popes Dominions, of whom he was admired: 1. For pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
of ſo many Prieſts and Jeſuites to live in England by toleration.
2. That he brought in Popery ſo faſt, and by ſo great a power. 3. For
over-topping ſo many Parliaments, and cauſing them to be diſſolved.
4. For eſtabliſhing of ſuch ſtrange Canons, as were by him authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
after the Parliament was diſſolved: and many other things that
he did, which were very wonderfull in the ſight of the Pope.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:121206:3"/>
               <hi>Saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they ſhould make an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to the Beaſt]</hi> That is, to thoſe of the Archbiſhops owne mould,
who came up out of the earth, Verſ. 11. That is, the Popiſh and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laticall
Convocation; and there it was where he took ſuch paines to
frame thoſe wicked Canons, which were the very image of the Popes
own Canons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which had the wound by a ſword, and did live]</hi> Although the wound
was deadly, Verſ. 12. yet the Beaſt had breath again here by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops
meanes, and did live: and he did all he could to heal this wound,
Verſ. 12. that ſo the Beaſt might come to that vigour, and ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
in England, as in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes. And in that this wound
is ſaid to be given with a ſword, it may have relation to that ſword ſent
by the Pope to K. <hi>Henry</hi> 8. ſince which the Kings of England are called
<hi>Defenders of the Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And he had power to give life to the Image of the Beaſt]</hi>
And thus the Archbiſhop had authority from the King for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
of the Canons: the image of the Popes own Canons, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
expreſt on Ver. 14. procured contrary to the Lawes of the Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the image of the Beaſt ſhould both ſpeak and cauſe that as many
as would not worſhip the image of the Beaſt, ſhould be killed]</hi> By what
thoſe <hi>Canons ſpeake,</hi> and the Archbiſhop in them, it is plaine, that he
intended to put to death all that would not ſubmit to the ſaid Canons.
Boyes roſe againſt thoſe Canons, againſt his owne houſe, and for that
<hi>Benſted</hi> was hang'd, drawn and quarter'd: men oppoſed them in the
High-Commiſſion, and for that M. <hi>Quatermaine</hi> was arraigned, and the
Archbiſhop ſought his life. The Parliament voted againſt them, and for
that the Lord <hi>Kimbolton</hi> and the five Members were articled againſt for
Traitors. And thus the warres began, and all that oppoſe them they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to kill: and many a precious Saint hath been killed for oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
theſe followers of the Beaſt, that fight and kill the Saints, becauſe
they will not <hi>worſhip the image of the Beaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And he cauſed all, both ſmall and great, rich and poore,
free and bond, to receive a marke]</hi> That is, let them be who they will
that come before him, it is all one; they muſt be ſure to be puſhed with
his hornes, ſpoken of Verſ. 11. except they have his marke, and that
mark was made two wayes.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>In their right hands]</hi> That is, by bribes; not by covenanting and
making promiſes to him, but by bringing their bribes with them in their
hands. This downright way of bribing was one: the other mark was,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:121206:4"/>
2 <hi>In their foreheads]</hi> This was very notable in the Archbiſhop, that
when any man ever came afore him to be judged in any caſe, if he frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
upon him, and bended his browes, that was a mark of his favour;
but if he ſmiled on him, then the Archbiſhop was ſure to give judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt him: ſo the ſecond <hi>marke</hi> was the bending of his brows,
it was put for them upon his forehead.</p>
            <p>Verſe 17. <hi>And that no man might buy or ſell]</hi> There was no man
more active in the procuring of <hi>Monopolies</hi> from the King, then the
Archbiſhop? he was a carnall man, for poor tradeſmen could not have
their free libertie of trade for him; ad <hi>no man muſt enjoy his owne free
trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>Said he that had the marke]</hi> The Patentees had marks to ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
iron; Butterfirkins, and every thing elſe, before any man was ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to buy or ſell the ſame, or elſe,</p>
            <p>2 <hi>The name of the Beaſt]</hi> that is, he muſt be a Prelate as the Beaſt
is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And indeed, there were none free but they who were growen to ſo
high a pitch, that none durſt meddle with them, what ever oppreſſion
they brought upon the ſubjects; they would be ſure to be free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>And if they had not the Patentees marke nor the Prelates, then they
muſt not buy nor ſell thoſe wares, except they had</p>

            <p>Verſe 18. <hi>Here is wiſdome]</hi> it is a rare thing to finde this out: and

            <p>
               <hi>Let him that hath underſtanding count the number of the Beaſt]</hi> but
he muſt count it, when he that is the Beaſt is ſuſpected, he muſt have
ſomthing to count upon; and then <hi>let him that hath skill in Arithmetick</hi>
take out all the figures out of that name which he ſubſcribeth, who is
ſuſpected to be the Beaſt, and count the ſame which that <hi>number</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth
to.</p>
            <p>For it is the number of a man, and his number is ſix hundred ſixty ſix]
<hi>now it is plaine, that this, is the</hi> Archbiſhop, <hi>he writes his name thus:</hi>
Will. Laud.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:121206:4"/>
And if we take the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of his name thus writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
it will amount to juſt
ſix hundred ſixty ſix, the
juſt number of this Beaſt
here ſpoken of, as is here
expreſſed.</p>
            <list>
               <item>W. is V. twice, that is, 10</item>
               <item>I. is a figure of 1</item>
               <item>LL. is twice 50. that is, 100</item>
               <item>L. is once 50</item>
               <item>A. is no numerall letter.</item>
               <item>V. is 5. more, 5</item>
               <item>D. Stands for 500</item>
               <item>Which in all amounts to the juſt ſumme of 666</item>
            </list>
            <p>And thus you ſee that <hi>Will. Laud</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> both
by his actions, and alſo by his name, appeares to be the Beaſt here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, called by <hi>Iohn another Beaſt:</hi> verſe 11. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks again of the
deſtruction of this <hi>Beaſt</hi> in the 15. Chapter of the <hi>Revellation,</hi> where
he ſaith,</p>
            <p>Verſe 2. <hi>I ſaw as it were a ſea of glaſſe]</hi> the Parliament aſſembled
may be compared to glaſſe, for the cleareneſſe of their Judgements; I
thinke I offend not, if I ſay they are the wiſeſt Aſſembly that ever ſate
ſince the Apoſtles dayes, and they are properly call'd a Sea becauſe all
the fountaines of the Kingdomes flow thither; ſo that I ſay the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are fitly called a Sea of glaſſe. But further they are <hi>mingled with
fire]</hi>
they may be fitly compared to fire becauſe they <hi>purge out the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
droſſe,</hi> and other grievances are <hi>purifying,</hi> and reforming the
Church and State; but that this is to be done by fire, argues ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in this worke, which in truth appeares at this day by the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
warres which the Beaſt of England and his fellow-Prelats; having
joyned with the Beaſt of Rome, have raiſed war againſt the Parliament,
and it is come to a bloody and cruell war, but (through Gods goodneſſe
in the end: when Gods good time is come) we ſhall ſee that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Them that have gotten the victory over the Beaſt, and over his image,
and over his marke, and over the number of his name]</hi> The victory muſt
be complete, the <hi>Beaſt</hi> muſt die, his image muſt be defaced, there muſt
be no ſuch tyranizing over the conſcience as was in the Biſhops Canons.
All Monopolies muſt be taken away, all bribing and injuſtice caſt out, all
ſecret Letters of favour to the prejudice of the State, all pride in the
Clergie, and ſiniſter reſpects muſt be laid aſide before this victory be
complete, and then the Parliament</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:121206:5"/>
               <hi>Stand on the Sea of the glaſſe, having the harps of God]</hi> that is, all
Gods people ſhall flow to them in peace, and ſhall finde a ſweet and
joyfull anſwer to all their addreſſes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>they</hi> (ſhall) <hi>ſing the ſong of Moſes the ſervant of God]</hi> which
he ſung, when the Iſraelites were delivered out of Egypt, and their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
deſtroyed in the red Sea, which ſong is written <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 1.</p>
            <p>Verſe 3. Secondly, They ſhall ſing <hi>the ſong of the Lamb]</hi> which
ſong followes in the next words,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saying, Great and marvellous are thy works Lord God almighty]</hi>
when the Parliament have gotten the victory (as is before expreſt) then
ſhall they ſee that they have not truſted in God in vaine; and they ſhall
acknowledge that they were not delivered by the ſtrength of men, but
by Gods great and marvellous works for them. Therefore they ſhal ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Juſt and true are thy wayes thou King of Saints]</hi> as if they ſhould
ſay, our truſt Lord was not in earthly Princes, for they fought againſt
us, but we waited on thee, and truſted in thy promiſes and thou haſt
made them good unto us in giving us the victory. And therefore ſhall
they go on praiſing God, and ſaying,</p>
            <p>Verſe 4. <hi>Who ſhall not feare thee O Lord, and glorifie thy Name, for
thou art holy]</hi> and having thus beheld Gods goodneſſe in their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,
they ſhall declare it to others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For all Nations ſhall come and worſhip thee O Lord]</hi> For, thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are made manifeſt to them in this great deliverance, which thy
Saints wait for: Which good Lord ſpeedily ſend us, to thy glory, and
the peace and tranquillity both of Church and State.</p>
