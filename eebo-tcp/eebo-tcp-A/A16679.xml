            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:6456:6"/>
had formerly left his Profession, so now of late he was enforced to leave his nation, to worke wonders among the wilde <hi>Irish.</hi> Where report was, hee intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine till he had reduced all those bogs and marishes to plots of <hi>Tobacco;</hi> so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall is he to the State, though preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to himselfe. This, quoth the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidadan,</hi> may bee all easily done, if he exactly observe his geometricall ascents &amp; descents, which by his mathematicall line, which hee hath alwayes in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, with all facilitie may bee attained. For in that <hi>glorie</hi> of <hi>Ilands,</hi> wherein I have long time remained, works of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter difficultie than this have beene effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: but to insist on any of these I will not, because they would seeme incredible to the shallow and barraine apprehension of the vulgar: yet to make instance of one for all, I hold it not altogether fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse. I have seene the seeds of <hi>Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> sowne in a bed of gourds, and in a moneths space the whole bed of gourds were into leaves of <hi>Tobacco</hi> changed.

Whereat the <hi>Varinan</hi> seemed much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed, vowing, that many yeares were not past since hee first set foot in this Ile, how then could it appeare that any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would doe him that favour, being no <hi>English</hi>-borne but a stranger, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for the vent of his commoditie any labour? To which objection I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that the <hi>English</hi> were ever cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous unto strangers, many times appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving better of them, than of their owne naturall inhabitants. And whereas, he could not be induced to beleeve that any Author would addresse his pen to write in his favour: I assured him, that I had read the Titles of divers bookes treating of the use and commerce of <hi>Tobacco;</hi> as the Poem of that English <hi>Musaeus,</hi>

With great thankes went the Apothecary along with them to a neighbour Grange adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, where with all curtesie he was entertained. It chanced one day, that <hi>Usquebaughin</hi> sitting discontentedly in her Garden, began to expostulate the cause of her barrennesse, and thus (though hervertues never before so farre transgressed their limits, or lesse expressed themselves) she proceeded.</p>
                  <p>Wretched <hi>Vsquebaughin,</hi> what crime hast thou committed, what offence hast thou done, or what worke of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:6456:14"/>
hospitality hast thou omitted: That thou (and that onely thou) shouldst be deprived of that commune boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Nature? Others have flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing issues; and though their estates be lesse, yet they know, who shall possesse them: But I (that have no issue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft of the greatest of comforts, what avayleth it me to possesse abundance, when all this shall succeed to a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heire? yet is my griefe enlarged! who will not judge how <hi>Nepenthes</hi> got it? that hath no issue to whom he may leave it; sure (will some imagine) extortion hath been the meanes of his raising, which makes his house so quickly declining. True, true, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy woman) many such surmises will arise from thy barrennesse: though thy husbands vertues be never so transparant. I will retire my selfe therefore to some desolate place, that as, I am deprived of comfort, I may be deprived of light; nor would I have an imputation aspersed on my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands honour, through my defect. Whilst she was descanting thus her own griefes silently, that the silence of the place and privacie of her passions
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:6456:14"/>
might augment them: <hi>Cantharides</hi> (for so was the Apothecarie called) came into the garden, where seeing this disconsolate woman (all a mort) wiping her teare-swolne-eyes, to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister no lesse solace in her afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than she had done before to his, he thus with milde aspect, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate respect, spake unto her.</p>
                  <p>IF griefes be best allayed when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, or afflictions best eased, when they find partners: be not such an enemie to your selfe (sweet Mistris) as so to engrosse your owne passions to your selfe, as to shrowd them from others. Nor indeed can griefes be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. The face is the best Secretary of the heart; and will expresse in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, what passions move disturbance. But it may be, you wish one of more secrecie to impart your woes unto; of secrecie you cannot, of discipline you may. And though judgment wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth yet shall secrecy and fidelity sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place, where more serious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice cannot instruct: Suspect me you need not, for my life is due unto you; and let this protestation serve for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmance: when I cease to be yours, I will cease to be mine owne.</p>

Guest (for so I will be bold to call you:) I know sorrowes are best allayed when imparted, if hope of remedy, or least appearance of release be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed: But so farre is the nature of my sore above the search or reach of cure, that in expressing them I seeme to augment them, because the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of my malady, will instantly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister despaire of remedy: yet to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie your desire (that generally our hospitality may afford content) I will describe my griefes, though by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation I expect no ease.

sufficient) as we have not only a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency in our selves, but have expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and extended our bounties unto others: Yet in this seeming Beatitude, in this height of riches (know my friend) that we are made miserable, yea, in our riches despica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; the cause is drawne from our want of issue, which you know (if ever experience gave you that comfort) to be the principall motive of true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; ministring best solace to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents griefes; yea, and reviveing their memory, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> raked up in the ashes of oblivion. Alas sir, what be these faire buildings, flourishing Medes, spacious Downes, which you see wee are here possessed of? they must of necessity succeed to some, and it may be to some base Tartarian, that will raze and deface the memory of our providence, with his security, riot, and superfl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

above the compasse of remedy, let it be sufficient that I have satisfied you, that can satisfie my selfe in nothing save griefe.</p>
                  <p>This discourse the Apothecary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively observed: oftimes lifting up his hands to heaven, thanking the powers divine, that they had ministred him so ample and expedite an occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both of shewing argument of his thankfulnesse, and meanes to release this disconsolate woman of her pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sivenesse. For this <hi>Cantharides</hi> was excellent for many Cures, but for none so famous as for sterility or barrennesse: for which exquisite Art and knowledge, hee was famous through all the <hi>Burmudoes</hi> Ilands: so that as no place was then more savage, so no Region or Countrey had more fruitfull women in it. Thus therfore, as soone as she had expressed the cause of her discontent, with cheerful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance he thus addressed his speech;</p>

Yet my comfort is, thou shalt not be onely for the generous Gallant, but as well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for <hi>Aminadab</hi> the Pedant, and <hi>Hob-nayle</hi> the Pesant: The very Tinker (with his fine Brasse) shall tinckle on thy sides, and snuffe thee out like Neesing-powder.

But of all Cities, Iles, Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Dominions, or Segniories, none shall entertaine thee in that royalty, or with that generall state at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bionacts: their Long Acres, Uplands and Downe-lands shall flie in a trice to retaine thee in their company; Thou

                     <p>THERE bee three persons I would have thee use with all observances, the Scholler, the Lawyer, and the Poet; I distinguish them, for seldome makes

The Scholler to confirme thy professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by reason, the Lawyer by equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the Poet by invention: One to discusse, another to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and the third to fable These, as by time observing, they may bee eternally won; so by scurvie usage they may bee eternally lost. The Scholler will bee thine, if thou talke in his element; sooth him in his arguments; and call him most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, dogmaticall, and literate <hi>Tris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megistus:</hi> let not one reason (though it be never so wide of sense) passe from him without thine approbation; and when thou art wearie in praising his imperfections, fall to admiration; but let it be,—<hi>Ut pueri Iunonis Ave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Then dispatiate into the pleasantnesse of the seat; the fruitfulnesse of the place; and withall,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:6456:33"/>
of the greatnesse of their Commons; for that they like to heare of, though they seldome see it. These discourses will make the Scholler thine owne; he is thine individuate and incorporate friend; the Ivie claspeth not neerer the Vine, nor the Missell-tow the Oake, than he will knit to thee.</p>
                     <p>THE Lawyer will be thine, if thou compare these present times with those flourishing and impartiall dayes of <hi>Hortensius, Marcus Appius, Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Graccus:</hi> swearing too (for thou must make no bones of oathes) that for pure eloquence, excellent convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, absolutenesse of method, and other proprieties, <hi>Rome</hi> in her glorie (even in the maturitie of her time) never attained so absolute and exact a course in pleading. Then in defence of corruption, (because everie man must live by his trade) talke of brave Senatours, and the bravest Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, would now and then be anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. and for unction dispense with conscience; and tell him withall, exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of authoritie to confirme it. This discourse will so ensnare my young Mowter, as no question (if hee distaste
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:6456:33"/>
smoake) hee will frequent thee for thy many good parts: An oyly tongue (my nimble Bastard) is worth a kingdome.</p>
                     <p>FOR the Poet, I cannot tell what to say to it, he is so oft out of his wits, as he verily imagines himselfe the man in the Moone: There's quick-silver in his braine; and if he were not now and then encountred by Sergeants, and kept under locke and key, hee would verily turne Bedlame. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause phrensie must bee purged, and thou (my Wag-halter) hast vertue and operation to love such, becken to the thred-bare contemned Urchin, give him a pipe on my score, hee'll pay it at the next new play he makes, if the Doore-keepers will bee true to him: and if not, hee'll make thee up some scurvie end of a Ballad, deserves a pipe of smoake. But before thou humour him, I would have thee finde him, and I protest to thee I cannot direct thee to him: many have this name, but as farre different from the perfect straine of a Poet, as the glistering of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worme from the light and splendour of the Sunne. Some come from the camp to the stage, from the pike to the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:6456:34"/>
pen; and few Souldiers will prove good Poets. For the nature of these men (I my selfe have had an itching inclination to this poeticall phrensie) had rather fight with <hi>Bacchus</hi> than <hi>Mars;</hi> and had rather cope with a barrell, than oppose themselves to a quarrell. Others, from an Indenture to a Theatre; the Scribe turnes Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risic; and <hi>Asinus ad Lyram,</hi> expresseth his owne shame by his Scriveners fragments. Others, from mowting to comicke writing: a brave honour to descend to Poet from Lawyer. But amongst these (my brave <hi>Spurio</hi>) thou shalt finde many generous wits pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest with this phrensie, call them to thee, smoake their wits, it may bee they are mustie, and desire soaking: These poore Gnats deserve thine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, even the lowest favorite in <hi>Parnassus</hi> Armourie, <hi>Qui nescit versus, tamen audet fingere.</hi> Take him to thee, hee shall, for his love to Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauldrie, drinke a pipe on my score: What, shall vanitie want smoake? No, (my thrice-renowned Hermaphrodite) smoake thou them here on Earth, and I will smoake them in Hell with pipes

of Sulphur. But I pray thee retaine these last of all others; they will draw company to thee; they are made the verie <hi>Morio's</hi> of our time: and what good wit but either can draw thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to acquaintance with great ones; or is so endeared to the other sex; as by their meanes, thou shalt have creatures of both kindes (and that will make thee for ever) resort to thy shop con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually! Humor me these Poets; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll their devices, though thou never heard of any of them; they love to be tickled: Flatterie they cannot judge of; for they verily imagine their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts out-strip all commendations. But now (my Rogue in graine) if thou couldst set up a private <hi>Refectorie,</hi> for the young effeminate sort (for they would like Adamants draw continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all recourse) I would hug thee eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. Sell mee Potato-roots, Erin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes, all Electuaries, Confections, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, Conceipts, Deceipts, Poma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, Cerusse, with a large recitall of thy brave commodities; and a little smooth-faced <hi>Ganymede</hi> standing at the doore, who<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like another Parret or Mag-pie, may crie ever in one tune:

Get and care not how; forsweare thy selfe and thinke not when; cheat, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect not where.
