            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE languiſhing Church being extreame
ſicke of many dangerous diſeaſes, had once
began almoſt to ſing its <hi>ultimum vale</hi> to
the World, it was ſo turbulently diſtracted by
the contentious opinions of ſome Schiſmaticall
diſturbers thereof: And being in this deepe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady,
many in an honeſt deploration condoled her
eſtate; yet commiſerating her diſtreſſe farther,
they would not leave her deſolate of reliefe and
comfort, but did co unitely concurre in one una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
contribution to elevate and reſtore her to
its former proſperity and priſtine health. Firſt
then they agreed in a concluſive determination
to ſend for all the Neighbours round to viſit and
conſolate her: The Proteſtants were firſt ſent
for, becauſe they were the next Neighbours to
her, who when they beheld apparently her deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
ſickneſſe, every one endeavoured to adde a
<pb facs="tcp:54417:3"/>
ſalve thereunto; one would have caſt her water,
but the two Univerſities dammed up, and ſtopped
the running thereof, for feare it ſhould runne to

there, laboured to finde out her Diſeaſe, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
her to be ſicke of the <hi>Mother:</hi> A third re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
that ſhe could ſcarce attaine to that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity,
ſince ſhe laboured ſo lately of a young
<hi>Suckling:</hi> Another anſwered, that ſhe was abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by one living at the back-side of <hi>Brownes</hi> barn,

ſtrange and prodigious propheſies to his prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ear'd
Auditors, that it ſtuck deeply in her Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,
and from thence ſhe contracted ſo great a
burning Fever, that many Books could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the Flame thereof. They ſent ſecondly to
the Round-heads deſiring their aſſiſtance to help
this diſtorted Church, but they were ſo greatly
imployed at Cheapſide-Croſſe, that they could
ſpare no time to come to her. The puritans were
next ſent for, but they were in ſuch haſty prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for New-England, that their conſciences
could not ſuffer them to ſteale ſo much time, to
comfort the ſicke, which they never could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to doe in their lives. There are many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for ſeverall men appointed, and yet I wonder
extreamely, that one ſhould be deficient: There
is Newgate appointed for Theeves, Bridewell
for idle perſons, the Counters for Drunkards,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>gate for Debtors, Bedlam for mad men, and
<pb facs="tcp:54417:3"/>
Hoſpitals for lame perſons; yet amongſt them
all (I wonder) there is no place for Fooles, but
in their New plantation (I thinke) they wil erect
an hoſpital<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for Fooles, where they may doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
miraculous deeds of charity, yet I hope ſome
of them will be wiſe enough to admit themſelves
there firſt, becauſe charity begins at home. The
Familiſts were next ſent for, but ſome of the
holy Brethren being aſleepe, the others were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
by their wives in a conjunction copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and being ſo zealouſly imployed, they could
not ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffurate ſo much time to come. Thus the
Church being variouſly diſtracted between theſe
Sects, is involved in an irremiable labyrinth of
opinions, and hereupon recontracted ſuch deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
diſeaſes, that it ſtill requireth a more auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary
remedy. The ſureſt way then, that I can
conceive herefrom, is to ſend for the Doctors,
who I ſuppoſe have more ſciential skil to reſolve
us of her malady, but they with their New Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
are ſo imployed in the Tower to defend the
City, for they would otherwiſe willingly have
come, but only they ſtumbled on the proteſtation
and the Tower ſtood in their way, which hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their voluntary readineſſe: But in my opinion
it was well they were excluded by ſo opportune
an obſtacle, for otherwiſe (it is to be feared) they
would have rather brought her former dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>emper
to a deepe Conſumption, and ſo conſequently
<pb facs="tcp:54417:4"/>
ſhe might have layn on her death-bed: but thanks
be to the Omnipotent indulgencie of Almighty
God, who ſent true and skilfull Phyſitians unto
her, to cure her diſeaſe; I meane the Parliament,
that illuſtrious Aſſembly of both Temporall and
Eccleſiaſticall Phyſitians: Theſe as ſoone as
they firſt perſpicuouſly perceived the dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the diſeaſe, which by the long negligence
of time ſhe had contracted, began firſt to caſt her
water, which made ſo many Flye over the Ocean,
that then ſhe did ſeeme reſpectively to recover.
And after, there was ſome hopes of preſervative
health remaining, they thought it moſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to give her next a ſound purge, which made
ſo many impedimen all excrements of papiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
adherents be evacuated from her, that ſhee
began to waxe ſtronger and ſtronger: Thus the
Church was delivered our of the almoſt incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
diſeaſe of popery and ſuperſtition, and ſo
Flourſhed a while; till at length for want of
ſtrong ſuporters ſhe became feeble againe, and by
the imaginarie countenancing of too much licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſnes,
<hi>ſhe</hi> is now ſicke of the Staggers, and
unleſſe ſhe has another purge given her, and that
ſpeedily too, to purge her from Brownianiſme,
neceſsarily ſhe will fall into the former, or as bad,
if not worſe) diſeaſe: For as the one ſwelled
too high in popiſh opinions, and had almoſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmed
her, ſo the latter dives ſo low in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,
that it will (it is ſuppoſed) almoſt ſink her:
<pb facs="tcp:54417:4"/>
But the Judicious and phyſicall knowledge of
the parliament will no doubt accurately cure her;
the beſt way that I can conceive for her recovery
is to be let bloud, and then ſome hopes of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
may be expected to her great health and
proſperity, the Kingdomes happineſſe, and the
Immortall Glory of thoſe illuſtrious Phyſitians
of the Parliament.</p>
