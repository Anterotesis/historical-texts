         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To him-selfe, G. W. wisheth

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou <hi>(euen my selfe)</hi> whome
next <hi>God,</hi> my <hi>Prince,</hi> and
<hi>Country</hi> I am most enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
vnto; It is not vnlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
but some will wonder,
why, contrary to the
worlds custome, I haue
made choyse of thy Patronage for this
booke, rather then the protection of such
whose mightinesse might seeme better able
to defend it; especially considering such a
<hi>Gigantick</hi> troupe of aduersaries haue ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
themselues against the <hi>Truth,</hi> that one
of them <hi>Goliah</hi>-like dares raile vpon a whole
hoast of <hi>Israel.</hi> It may be (I say) some will
wonder, and some scoffe at mee for it; for
which cause (though to answer them with
<hi>sic volo</hi> had been sufficient: yet to shew I will
not like our <hi>Great ones</hi> stand so much vpon
<pb facs="tcp:20902:3"/>
my authority as to make my <hi>VVill</hi> my <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>)
I heere let you know why, and for what
causes I haue done it; the first is this: I
could not amongst all men finde any man,
in my opinion, so fitting for this purpose,
but either my <hi>Worke</hi> was vnworthy, or too
worthie his Patronage. Secondly, it is
said; <hi>Obsequium amicos, veritas odium parit:</hi>
and I doubting my free speech would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make a <hi>Diapason,</hi> pleasing to the eare of
a common <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> thought it best to hold
my tong, or speake to my selfe, whose dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
I am better acquainted with.
Thirdly, seeing I know but what men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
and not what they are; I had rather
indure the <hi>Kites</hi> tyranny, then with <hi>Aesops</hi>
Doues make the Sparrow-hauke my <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion.</hi>
Fourthly, if I haue spoken <hi>Truth</hi> it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to defend it selfe; if not, who-ere be my
Patron, it is I must answere for it. Fiftly, for
asmuch as I know my owne minde best; I
purpose, if need be, to become my own <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate.</hi>
Sixtly, for my owne sake I first made
it, and therefore certaine I am I my selfe
haue most right vnto it. But seauently, and
lastly (which is indeed the principal <hi>Reason</hi>) I
<pb facs="tcp:20902:3"/>
haue made this <hi>Dedication</hi> to thee, poore
<hi>world</hi>-despised <hi>Selfe;</hi> euen to put thee in
minde, (seeing thou hast here boldly begun
to bid defiance to the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and vpon iust
causes quarrelled with the <hi>World</hi>) that thou
take heed to thine owne words, and not
through basenes of minde or vntowardnes
of <hi>Fortune</hi> (to thy euerlasting disgrace)
faintly giue ouer so noble a <hi>Combate;</hi> If euer
aduersitie (as tis like enough) oppresse thee,
yet remember thy owne sayings, and in des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pight
of outward <hi>Destinies</hi> haue a care to
keepe an vndeiected heart still free for <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi>
Or on the contrary, if euer (as tis vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely)
vnexpected <hi>Prosperity</hi> bee cast vpon
thee, then look to thy selfe, take to thee this
poore booke of thine, wherein thou shalt
see the dangers of it, and be, perhaps, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
staid from many a perilous enterprise,
which that estate might else driue thee
into. Reade it, weekely, daily, yea and
howerly toe: what though it bee thine
owne? thou knowest mans nature to
bee so vncertaine, and prone to forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
euen in the best things, that thou
canst not haue too many <hi>Memorandums.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:20902:4"/>
The wisest fall, and therefore euery day was
<hi>Philip</hi> desirous to bee remembred that hee
was a <hi>Man;</hi> thou thinkest I know, still to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
what thou art, I desire in some things
thou maist, but vnlesse thou labour it with
diligent watchfulnesse ouer <hi>affection,</hi> it is at
least much to be doubted, if not altogether
to bee despaired of; thou hast seene many
by an alteration in their estate beene so <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphosed,</hi>
as if they were not the same
men, nor of that <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay remember it, thou thy selfe, and that
but vpon a bare hope, or imagination of
some preferment, hast bin puffed vp and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
aboue measure: consider now then
how much more thou hadst beene so and
what had become of thee if God had not
by dashing those hopes called thee to thy
selfe againe? Alas! if hee had answered thy
<hi>ambitious</hi> expectations to thy desire, thou
hadst bin by this time past recouerie and
not thought of this; but delighted in <hi>villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
bin ouer-mastered by <hi>passion,</hi> rusht into
all <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>presumption;</hi> yet neuer felt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
danger, till it were too late to preuent it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Thou hast oft wisht thou hadst bin borne to
<pb facs="tcp:20902:4"/>
the like means that others are, which might
it haue beene so, now thou seest thou
shouldst hardly, or neuer, haue come to the
knowledge of those things, that are now
showne thee. Tis true, thou hast lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be crost in thy preferments, but thou
seest since that it might haue been thy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
if it had not beene so, and maist per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
thy selfe, whether it be now or neuer,
it will be to thy good. For tell me, hast thou
not often felt, euen when thou wert busiest
to preuent them; <hi>fond loue, ambition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
couetousnesse</hi> and such like <hi>Passions</hi>
then to inuade thee? Hast thou perceiued
it I say? How much more then would
they haue beene ready to assaile thee, when
quite forgetting them, thou hadst wholly
addicted thy self to the things of this <hi>world?</hi>
Let mee aduise my <hi>deare-selfe</hi> then, to make
vse of this thine owne worke, it will be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to thee then all the <hi>world:</hi> for this good
it may do thee, and to this end I made both

               </gap>t and the <hi>Dedication</hi> thereof to thee, that if
euer hereafter the temptations of the <hi>world,</hi>
the <hi>flesh</hi> &amp; the <hi>diuel,</hi> or any occasion should
make thee to forget this mind that thou art
<pb facs="tcp:20902:5"/>
now in: or so blind thy vnderstanding
thou shouldst not perceiue thy owne and
the <hi>Worlds</hi> follies as thou now dost; That
if thou shouldst be in that miserable state as
many are, to haue no feeling of thy danger:
that if thou shouldst bee wofully flattered
and haue no friend that dares, or loues
thee so well to put thee in mind of thy
transgressions.</p>
            <p>Then I haue ordained this to shew
thee what once thou wert, to touch thee
againe with the feeling of thy miseries,
and to bee vnto thee that true <hi>Friend,</hi>
which, free from all faigned inuention,
shal plainely tell thee, what perhaps should
else haue neuer beene brought againe to
thy remembrance. Looke then that for
thy owne sake thou respect this, how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to others it may seeme a trifle. Bee
carefull of thy actions, for seeing thou
knowest the dangerous <hi>Passions</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto

haue a good conscience before God, for

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eaders; I speake to you that
haue vnderstanding; when
these first fruits of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
<hi>Muses,</hi> shall come to
your iudicious censures, Do
not look for <hi>Spencers,</hi> or <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi>
wel composed numbers;
or the deep conceits of now florishing <hi>Iohnson;</hi>
no; say tis honest plain matter, &amp; there's as much
as I look for. If I haue seem'd to err in any thing
suppose me not so obstinate, or wel conceited of my
own opinions, but that I may be perswaded by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that shal produce stronger <hi>reasons</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
If any thing may seeme to haue a doubtfull
interpretation, assure your selues the honestest
meaning in it is mine, and although some may
think <hi>I</hi> haue not so wel ioyned things together as
<hi>I</hi> might haue done, <hi>I</hi> know whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you haue conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the nature of the <hi>Subiect,</hi> &amp; the diuersity of
things therin ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled, you wil accept my good wil
&amp; let my yeeres be an excuse for that &amp; al other
ignorant ouer-sights whatsoeuer. Some no doubt
<pb facs="tcp:20902:8"/>
will mistake my plainnes, in that <hi>I</hi> haue so blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spoken what <hi>I</hi> haue obserued, without any <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi>
additions or fained <hi>Allegories, I</hi> am sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>I</hi> haue not pleased them therein, but should
haue been more sorry if <hi>I</hi> had displeased my selfe
in doing otherwise; for <hi>I</hi> know if <hi>I</hi> had wrapt vp
vy meaning, in dark riddles, <hi>I</hi> should haue been
more applauded and lesse vnderstood, which I
nothing desire. <hi>I</hi> neither feare nor shame to
speake the <hi>Trurh,</hi> and therefore haue nakedly
thrust it forth without a couering. To what
end were it, if <hi>I</hi> (as some do) had appareld my
mind in darke <hi>Parables,</hi> that few or none
might haue vnderstood mee? <hi>I</hi> should doe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be silent; but if it be more in request <hi>I</hi> may
hereafter be obscure enough, yet in this tis not
my meaning, for indeed, if <hi>I</hi> knew how, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
is to be so plaine, that the bluntest <hi>Iober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nole</hi>
might vnderstand mee. Our Grand-vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines
care not for a secret ierk; well wee may
shew an honest wit in couertly nipping them; but
either 'tis in vaine cause they perceiue it not, or
else ridiculous, seeing they only vnderstand it
who will but either malice or flout vs for our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors.
Many may dislike the harshnes of the <hi>Verse</hi>
but you know, although it be not stately, yet it we
<pb facs="tcp:20902:8"/>
enough befits the matter, and whereas <hi>I</hi> may seem
blame-worthy in mixing <hi>Diuinity</hi> with <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</hi>
yet when you haue found my generall ayme;
considered with what reuerent respect <hi>I</hi> haue done
it, and what commendable authorities <hi>I</hi> may haue
for it, I nothing misdoubt your approbation. Those
things which concerne my selfe, may seeme chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish,
nothing pleasing, but you must consider I had
a care to please my selfe aswel as others; and if the
<hi>World</hi> blame mee as to sawcy with her, 'tis for
want of manners, but her owne fault, that would
allow mee no better education. To bee briefe, if I
haue any way offended I am so well perswaded you
wil mildly conster my errors and infirmities, that
<hi>I</hi> rest wholly, and onely on your sound and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<hi>Iudgements.</hi>

I make no question if this book come to your
spelling, it will haue many halting verses, and
disioynted sentenses: for I haue had experience
of your insufficiencie: yet haue <hi>I</hi> striu'd to bee
for your sakes <hi>I</hi> tell you (because <hi>I</hi> would if it were
possible bee vnderstood) as plaine (as they
say) as a pack-saddle, and now the doubt is then
fooles will ride me. If they doe certainly, <hi>I</hi> shall
<pb facs="tcp:20902:9"/>
be rough &amp; vneasie for their tendernes. Though
you vnderstand them not yet because you see this
wants some fine <hi>Phrases</hi> &amp; flourishes, as you find
other mens writings stuft withal, perhaps you
wil iudge me vnlearned. Wel; and right enough.
Yet you will be counted but saucy <hi>Coblers</hi> to go
beyond your <hi>Lasts.</hi> And if that be a fault did not
the subiect and your ignorances, require me to be
in that sort faulty? <hi>I</hi> could with ease haue amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it, for it cost me (<hi>I</hi> protest) more labour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
this plainenesse then if <hi>I</hi> had more <hi>Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi>
trim'd ii, but for feare if <hi>I</hi> speake much, <hi>I</hi>
confound your <hi>Memories, I</hi> will say no more but
this, <hi>Read and welcome,</hi> but <hi>Censure not,</hi>
for your iudgement is weake and <hi>I</hi> vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
renounce it.</p>

               <l>I fell to wondring at each thing I saw</l>

               <l>To keepe those places where the <hi>Muses</hi> hanted,</l>
               <l>I home returned somwhat discontent,</l>

               <l>Vrging expence (perhaps) and telling how,</l>

               <l>When twas through mallice, cause they feard that I</l>

               <l>Exceed their knowledge, and attaine to do,</l>

               <l>MOunted aloft on <hi>Contemplations wings,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And noting with my selfe the state of things,</l>
               <l>I plainely did perceiue as on a stage,</l>
               <l>The <hi>confus'd actions</hi> of this present age,</l>
               <l>I view'd the <hi>World,</hi> and I saw my fill,</l>
               <l>Because, that all I saw therein was ill.</l>
               <l>I weigh'd it well and found it was the <hi>Scoene,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Of <hi>Villany,</hi> of <hi>Lust,</hi> and all vncleane</l>
               <l>And loath'd corruption. Seeing which my <hi>Mind,</hi>

               <l>(That by some <hi>inspiration</hi> ganne to find</l>
               <l>The place was not in fault for this) search't on,</l>
               <l>To find the cause of this confusion.</l>
               <l>And noting euery Creature, there I found,</l>
               <l>That only <hi>Man</hi> was the chiefe <hi>spring</hi> and <hi>ground</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Of all this <hi>vproare;</hi> Yea I soone did see,</l>
               <l>He there was <hi>all</hi> in <hi>all,</hi> and none but he;</l>
               <l>Then being also willing for to know,</l>
               <l>What thing man was, I did begin to grow</l>
               <l>Yet more inquisitiue. An old <hi>Record</hi>

               <l>At last I hapt vpon which did afford</l>
               <l>Much sacred light. It shewed <hi>Man was a Creature,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>First made by God, Iust, and vpright by nature,</l>
               <l>In his owne Likenesse. That he was compounded</l>
               <l>Of soule and body: That this last was founded</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20902:21"/>
Of earth: The first infus'd by inspiration,</l>
               <l>And that the finall cause of his creation,</l>
               <l>Was to set forth the glory of his maker,</l>
               <l>And with him to be made a ioynt-partaker</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Of enldes happines.</hi> Growne much amazd,</l>
               <l>To read this of him for a time I paus'd,</l>
               <l>And finding now in man no marke or signe,</l>
               <l>That ere he was a <hi>Creature</hi> so deuine,</l>
               <l>I knew not what to thinke, vnlesse the same,</l>
               <l>Meant any other <hi>Creature</hi> of that name:</l>
               <l>But prying further on I there found out,</l>
               <l>The resolution of my present doubt,</l>
               <l>I saw the cause of's fall: How with free-will</l>
               <l>He fell from his <hi>first goodnes</hi> vnto <hi>ill:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I saw how he from happines did slide,</l>
               <l>Through disobedience and vnthankfull pride:</l>
               <l>Yea and I found, how by that cursed fall,</l>
               <l>He was bereaued and quite stript of all</l>
               <l>That so adornd him; his <hi>first holinesse,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Was chang'd to a <hi>corrupted filthinesse</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Then he began to draw a <hi>paineful breath,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And was a <hi>slaue,</hi> made <hi>captiue</hi> vnto <hi>Death;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>His body was expos'd to labour, sweate,</l>
               <l>And much disquieting: He got his meat</l>
               <l>With sorrow, care, and many perturbations,</l>
               <l>And then his soule grew subiect vnto <hi>Passions</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And strange distemperatures. More-ouer he,</l>
               <l>So perfect miserable grew to be,</l>
               <l>That if he had not a <hi>Re-generation;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Nothing was left him but meere <hi>desperation.</hi>

               <l>Some profitable notes. First I avow,</l>
               <l>What euer <hi>Man</hi> hath beene, that he is now,</l>
               <l>A Reasonable liuing Creature: who</l>
               <l>Consisteth of a soule and body toe.</l>
               <l>His Bodye's flesh and blood, subiect to sinning,</l>
               <l>Corrupting euen in his first beginning,</l>
               <l>And ful of al vncleannesse: Then his soule,</l>
               <l>Is a pure lasting substance yet made foule</l>
               <l>

Through th' others filthines: much supprest</l>
               <l>By diuers hurtful passions which molest</l>
               <l>And hinder hir proceedings; <hi>yea hee's this,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>A Creature that exceeding wretched is,</l>
               <l>And that he may be sure no fault to want,</l>
               <l>Vaine, Fickle, Weake, and wondrous Arogazt.</l>
               <l>And though his nature heretofore were pure,</l>
               <l>Now nothing is more fading or vnsure.</l>
               <l>But Ile omit at this time to relate,</l>
               <l>The curses Iu'e obseru'd in's outward state,</l>
               <l>For though the body, that before the fall</l>

               <l>Doth now feele hunger, with heat, thirst and cold,</l>

               <l>Yet al this outward change which I do find,</l>

               <l>Not what is best, but what they long to haue,</l>

               <l>Which most men see, but few the lesse eschew it:</l>
               <l>Men rather now, as if t'were no offence,</l>
               <l>Are growne to such a shamelesse impudence,</l>

               <l>For that's their <hi>Motto,</hi> they make modest showes,</l>

               <l>So mean, perhaps: but time brings alteration,</l>
               <l>And a faire woman is a shrewd temptation:</l>
               <l>Then many make their <hi>fained loue</hi> to be</l>
               <l>A cloake to couer their immodestie:</l>
               <l>These will protest and vow, and sweare their life</l>
               <l>Consists in hauing whom they wooe, to wife,</l>

Yet if the villaines can their lust fulfill,</l>

               <l>Their hot affection till they meete another:</l>

               <l>For present safety, they were forc't to slay,</l>
               <l>I must count blamelesse. Thou that hast a <hi>Foe,</hi>

               <l>I thinke it not, for why, the one is steady,</l>

               <l>It is the wild'st and most disorderd'st passion,</l>

               <l>What is the cause I say they doe contemne,</l>

               <l>Sure hence it doth proceed; they doe not know</l>

               <l>Amongst the rest one bolder then was fit,</l>

Stept on a peece of yce which with a crack,</l>

               <l>Swam to the bridge where all the yce was broken,</l>
               <l>The people look't and he for aid did craue,</l>
               <l>But oh! there was no power in them to saue;</l>

               <l>No hope of safegard seemed to appeare</l>
               <l>And when that he had three times whirled bin,</l>
               <l>And that the Arch was like to suck him in:</l>
               <l>Beyond our expectation (in a trise)</l>
               <l>There thrusts betweene a greater peece of yce,</l>

               <l>Beat by the lesser for to giue it way,</l>
               <l>And a while staid it; but he had beene faine,</l>
               <l>When that was gone to take his turne againe,</l>
               <l>Had not, next God, the people stood his friend,</l>
               <l>And sau'd him by a rope that's some mans end:</l>

               <l>No trouble with it, This through <hi>faith</hi> we gaine,</l>
               <l>And 'tis sufficient to make any paine</l>
               <l>Seeme short and easy; yea it cheares a man,</l>
               <l>And tis a help, without the which none can</l>
               <l>Endure to liue: but now great store there be,</l>

               <l>Together through the bad and weake foundation,</l>

               <l>Of <hi>hope,</hi> which I amongst vs men do find,</l>
               <l>Is of vncertaine earthly things, and this</l>

               <l>The mercilesse offenders; but each one:</l>
               <l>Who when he doth perceiue that there is need,</l>

               <l>For it from other causes doth proceed,</l>
               <l>Whereas true proper <hi>Cruelty</hi> indeed,</l>
               <l>Is when a man delights and longs to see,</l>
               <l>Or doe, some deed that's full of Crueltee:</l>

               <l>For to behold men strangely tortured,</l>
               <l>That he out of his bounty promised,</l>
               <l>A large reward to him that could inuent,</l>

               <l>Each sorrow is an entrance into Blisse.</l>
               <l>And that the greatest pleasure we attaine;</l>

               <l>Or two stale egs, they will such yelling keep,</l>

               <l>They would be patient; who can doe withall?</l>
               <l>And also let them of much Griefe beware;</l>
               <l>For there's small ods betweene the same and Care:</l>

               <l>Were wont to say, 'tis wholsome for the eyes.</l>
               <l>VVell he will drinke, yet but a draught at most,</l>
               <l>That must be spiced with a nut-browne <hi>tost.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But then 'twere good they had a bit beside,</l>

               <l>So he that would not drinke, a late for hast,</l>

               <l>Which e're 'twere ended, vp their <hi>Host</hi> was got,</l>
               <l>And then the <hi>drunkard</hi> needs must haue his pot,</l>
               <l>And so he had: but I commend my <hi>cozen,</hi>

               <l>The <hi>Cuckolds</hi> one Can, cost the fooles a dozen.</l>

               <l>Oh yes say they, that's Kingly meate indeed;</l>
               <l>They ask't it, and they had it; but this cheere,</l>
               <l>Quickly drew downe a dozen more of beere;</l>
               <l>Which being drunk, they had got out of Towne,</l>
               <l>But that their <hi>Hostesse</hi> was now new come downe,</l>

With whom they spent ere they could get away</l>
               <l>In kissing and in quaffing halfe that day.</l>
               <l>And fiue times as I heard they took the paine,</l>
               <l>To get on horseback and come off againe</l>
               <l>But at the last iust as the clock strook two,</l>
               <l>They were the sixt time hors't with much adoo:</l>

               <l>Tipling some howre and a halfe at gate.</l>
               <l>So that the night drew on apace and then,</l>
               <l>Thither came riding other Gentlemen.</l>

               <l>Their honest <hi>Host</hi> for all their large expence,</l>
               <l>And former kindnes, quickly got him thence:</l>

               <l>Slunk out of sight, as if she nought esteem'd them.</l>
               <l>And as most will, except a very few,</l>
               <l>She left her old <hi>Guls</hi> to enter league with new,</l>
               <l>Who at their parting thought for to haue kist her,</l>
               <l>But were so drunken that they euer mist her.</l>

               <l>That some suppose, yea and they think so still,</l>
               <l>Their horses brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence against their will.</l>
               <l>For if so bee that they had wanted wit,</l>
               <l>(To come themselues) the <hi>fooles</hi> had been there yet</l>

               <l>Desire to make thee so much feele thy woe,</l>

               <l>With heed and care watch ouer thy affection,</l>
               <l>And in thy doings follow this direction.</l>
               <l>First see if't be thy flesh that mooues thee to</l>
               <l>Those thinges the which thou art about to doe,</l>
               <l>Next to consider well it doth behooue thee,</l>

               <l>And since they thrust thee forward vnto euill,</l>
               <l>Thou hast an ill heart, proud flesh, and the Diuill</l>
               <l>With bad example. Learne oh man to season,</l>

            <l>A gentle warning wil not now suffice</l>
            <l>To make men leaue off their iniquities:</l>
            <l>Yea, I do know their negligence so great,</l>
            <l>Tis not enough for to perswade or threat:</l>
            <l>And therefore Ime resolued ere I part,</l>

            <l>My meaning must not so be vnderstood,</l>
            <l>For the last shooes I had were very good;</l>
            <l>Yea and so farre am I from such a thought,</l>

            <l>Come what come will, I'le call thee back no more:</l>
            <l>So, now he's gone the way that I direct him,</l>
            <l>I wonder how the world will now respect him,</l>
            <l>If that she maruaile why he was not bolder,</l>
            <l>Perhaps he may be when that he is older;</l>
            <l>He hath too smooth a chin, a looke too mild,</l>
            <l>A token that he is not wholly wild;</l>
            <l>But may I reach the yeares of other men,</l>
            <l>If that this loose world be not mended then,</l>
            <l>Ile send a Satyr rougher then a Beare</l>
            <l>That shal not chide and whip, but scartch &amp; teare.</l>
            <l>And so I'le teach him he shall be too strong,</l>
            <l>For all your <hi>Paris-garden</hi> dogs to wrong.</l>
            <l>This Satyr hath a scourge, (but it wants weight,</l>
            <l>Your Spanish whips were worse in eighty-eight,)</l>
            <l>That shall not onely make them howle for paine,</l>
            <l>But touse them, till they hold their peace againe:</l>
            <l>Now if the world, frowne vpon me for't,</l>
            <l>Shall I be sorie? No, 'twil mend my sport;</l>

            <l>Why then; and that's as much as I need doe,</l>
            <l>I giue him leaue to come and lash me toe.</l>
