            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>But to returne, the wind did bluster,</l>
            <l>So we came home all in cluster.</l>
            <l>Our heads hung down, our hands in pocket,</l>
            <l>And all our patience burn't to th'socket:</l>
            <l>Only by the way we tride our skill,</l>

               <l>Bring forth their sharp-heel'd warriours, and they</l>

               <l>Before they die to have had their winding sheet.</l>
               <l>With that i'th' pit they're put, and when they were</l>
               <l>Both on their feet, the Norfolk Chantecleer</l>
               <l>Looks stoutly on his ne're before seen foe,</l>

               <l>His comely crest, and often looking down</l>
               <l>He whets his angry beake upon the ground.</l>
               <l>With that they meet, not like that coward breed</l>

               <l>Although their courage be full tyr'd, their strength</l>
               <l>And bloud began to Ebbe, you that have seen</l>
               <l>A water combate on the Sea between</l>
               <l>Two angry boyling billowes, how</l>
               <l>They martch and meet, and dash their curled brow,</l>
               <l>Swelling like graves, as though they did intend</l>

               <l>As if they wept them for their funeral:</l>
               <l>And yet they fain would fight, they come so neer</l>

               <l>To whisper death, and when they cannot rise,</l>
               <l>They lie and look blowes into each others eyes:</l>

            <head>On the praise of Fat Men.</head>
            <l>LO, precious Rules are here made common,</l>
            <l>For health of either man or woman.</l>
            <l>If thou fat mortal fain wouldst be,</l>
            <l>With cheeks so plump for eyes to see:</l>
            <l>Know feeding hard, and drinking much,</l>
            <l>With sleeping long, will make you such.</l>
            <l>Cram thou until thou fartst at table,</l>
            <l>'Twill make thee fat as Jade i'th' stable.</l>
            <l>If thou thy Buttocks would have spread,</l>
            <l>Sit long after thou hast well fed;</l>
            <l>'Twill make the Hanches large to grow,</l>
            <l>Through gown or breeches making show.</l>
            <l>If thou thy flesh wilt hold together,</l>
            <l>Walk not though it be fair weather;</l>
            <l>All exercise forbear, for that</l>
            <l>But wastes and melts away the fat.</l>
            <l>You see when Bores for Brawn we feed,</l>
            <l>That they're pend up in stigh indeed.</l>
            <l>Which makes their fat more firm and hard,</l>
            <l>Than is the greatest Bacon lard:</l>
            <l>So you the Dining-room may keep,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:106766:68"/>To eat and drink in, shire and sleep.</l>
            <l>Your wiser Germans sit at meals</l>
            <l>So long till it runs down their heels,</l>
            <l>Nor do they think it any scorn,</l>
            <l>For what o'reflows, their rooms adorn.</l>
            <l>In camp you may find out his tent</l>
            <l>From other Nations by the sent;</l>
            <l>For there the Pakings up of Rennish,</l>
            <l>Disturbs no stomach that is squemish.</l>
            <l>To eat and drink, to shire and spue,</l>
            <l>Is custom old, no fashion new.</l>
            <l>Your pills and potions are poor things</l>
            <l>To those more natural scowerings;</l>
            <l>To see a mortal with large pode</l>
            <l>Disburden Colon of his load;</l>
            <l>Or see one which eat apple-pye,</l>
            <l>Till she hath need to let it flye,</l>
            <l>Doth shew that all is right within,</l>
            <l>That sends forth pudding without skin,</l>
            <l>These are the natural conies that shew</l>
            <l>The feeding bodies ebbe and flow.</l>
            <l>For in the microcosm we</l>
            <l>All changes of the great world see,</l>
            <l>Let hungry wight forbear a meal,</l>
            <l>It makes him look like slinked Veal;</l>
            <l>His belly thinks his throat is cut,</l>
            <l>And cramp begins to wring his gut;</l>
            <l>He looketh blew under the eyes,</l>
            <l>And guts do wolf-like trade that lies</l>
            <l>In watry dike in Springs beginning;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:106766:69"/>Then have a care of empty sinning;</l>
            <l>You never shall answer half so much</l>
            <l>To fill, as he shall that doth grutch</l>
            <l>To stuff his chitterlings so well,</l>
            <l>That they no tales of fasting tell.</l>
            <l>I heard rich mortal had a pig</l>
            <l>A present sent to him so big</l>
            <l>That he to eat it was unwilling,</l>
            <l>But strived to sell it for five shilling,</l>
            <l>The pig was sent him with the taile,</l>
            <l>But in the market that must fail,</l>
            <l>For there the mortal would not send it</l>
            <l>But in his family would spend it;</l>
            <l>But bad his man to have a care</l>
            <l>To sel't where he might have his share.</l>
            <l>The body of the pig was sold</l>
            <l>But powdring tub the tail did hold;</l>
            <l>The powdring tub which had not seen</l>
            <l>So much as rump of goose so green</l>
            <l>In twice ten year (tub true to say)</l>
            <l>Would well have serv'd late priests to pray,</l>
            <l>Such as from Coblers stalls have crept,</l>
            <l>And in obedience Sisters kept.</l>
            <l>Their members all with due are spred</l>
            <l>To rub and chafe when they're in bed.</l>
            <l>For after exercise in tub</l>
            <l>Their sisters cause their Priests to rub</l>
            <l>That they their teachers might restore</l>
            <l>For doctrine given in before.</l>
            <l>But leaving brother to expound</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:106766:69"/>Dark place and mystery profound,</l>
            <l>I now intend to bend discourse</l>
            <l>To mortal fat as pampred horse.</l>
            <l>They commonly that are so fat</l>
            <l>No parents are of wicked plot.</l>
            <l>Alas they onely do take care</l>
            <l>To keep their ribs from being bare,</l>
            <l>And that is done by exercise</l>
            <l>Of little bones beneath their eyes,</l>
            <l>Bones that will trundle a whole mile</l>
            <l>VVhile all the body rests the while;</l>
            <l>Yet we have fools within our Nation</l>
            <l>Let strangers pull them out for fashion,</l>
            <l>Bones unto men of precious use,</l>
            <l>That squeeze all fat, all ripe to juyce,</l>
            <l>That man that truly loves his belly,</l>
            <l>To part with them is loth I tell ye;</l>
            <l>He doth as highly prize those bones,</l>
            <l>As Ladies do those precious stones</l>
            <l>VVhich nature made not to adorn her</l>
            <l>So much as please her in a corner.</l>
            <l>These bones in English have name</l>
            <l>VVhich mounsieurs raised have to fame.</l>
            <l>A single one is called a tooth</l>
            <l>From whence tooth-drawer comes forsooth.</l>
            <l>But of tooth-drawers pray know this</l>
            <l>The French the most esteemed is;</l>
            <l>He doth as much by touch of finger</l>
            <l>As figures do for figure flinger.</l>
            <l>But all the learned know that they</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:106766:70"/>Do but pretend to what they say.</l>
            <l>Your French-Tooth-drawer if you observe</l>
            <l>Looks as if he himself did sterve</l>
            <l>To fat his horse, which drew as much</l>
            <l>As mounsiers self doth by the touch;</l>
            <l>For mounsiers horse whose hoofes are horns</l>
            <l>While he cures Teeth the Jade cures Cornes.</l>
            <l>I see a Porter who stood by</l>
            <l>To see mounsier draw's mouth awry</l>
            <l>And pull from well-grown Butchers gum</l>
            <l>A hollow Tooth bigger then's thumb;</l>
            <l>A Tooth Ile warrant in time hath ground</l>
            <l>Of fly-blown beef, many a pound;</l>
            <l>A Tooth had some well-minded Glutton</l>
            <l>But such a phang he'd tue the mutton;</l>
            <l>Porter that stood this sight to see</l>
            <l>Had come on too most certainly,</l>
            <l>The mounsiers horse as if jade knew</l>
            <l>The malady which on toe grew,</l>
            <l>Removed his foot and set it down</l>
            <l>Upon the toe of gazing clown;</l>
            <l>Porter at tread of horse did squeak,</l>
            <l>But jade had gin his corn at tweak.</l>
            <l>Just as the Butchers money paid,</l>
            <l>The Porters cure of corn was made;</l>
            <l>He needs must be rid of his corn,</l>
            <l>For toe from his foot was torn.</l>
            <l>When Porter begins to complain,</l>
            <l>Mounsier to spur his horse was fain,</l>
            <l>So rides away, sans all remorse,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:106766:70"/>Bidding the Porter kisse his arse.</l>
            <l>Porter was lame, and could not follow,</l>
            <l>But aloud begins to hollow;</l>
            <l>But we leave Porter for to howle,</l>
            <l>Till we return to our fat soul;</l>
            <l>For this is quite against profession</l>
            <l>Of mine to make so large digression.</l>
            <l>But now, for rules before we eat,</l>
            <l>And how to chuse right battning meat,</l>
            <l>For spoon-meat, barly-broth and jelly,</l>
            <l>Very good is for the belly.</l>
            <l>For mornings draught your north-down-ale</l>
            <l>Will make you oylely as a Whale;</l>
            <l>But he that will not out flesh wit</l>
            <l>Must at the good Canary sit;</l>
            <l>For 'tis a saying very fine</l>
            <l>Give me the fat mans wit in wine:</l>
            <l>For he's as merry as wean'ling Pig</l>
            <l>That to the Hoggs-trough dances Jig.</l>
            <l>Your beef, your pork, your veal, your mutton</l>
            <l>So it be good as knife ere cut on;</l>
            <l>Your pigs, your capons, turkies, conies,</l>
            <l>Your feeding wight thinks worth his monies;</l>
            <l>But he whose longings to grow thicker,</l>
            <l>Must mingle with good meat good liquor.</l>
            <l>Your Brawn washt down with muskadine,</l>
            <l>Will make your cheeks look plump and fine;</l>
            <l>If you would have a double chin</l>
            <l>Drink no small beer, for thats too thin:</l>
            <l>For he that means to feed his chops high,</l>

               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:106766:71"/>Apt is to fall into a Dropsie.</l>
            <l>Therefore your high rich wines are fit</l>
            <l>T'augment the flesh and help the wit:</l>
            <l>'Twill make the buttocks firm as brawn,</l>
            <l>And skin as pure white as Lawne.</l>
            <l>Turn haunches up with Lady fine,</l>
            <l>And thy fat arse shall hers out-shine.</l>
            <l>Feeding and drinking, smooths the skin,</l>
            <l>And makes the plump one moist within.</l>
            <l>VVho feeds at Vespers and at Mattins</l>
            <l>Their skins as smooth and white as Sattins</l>
            <l>Nere dyed; but we and from the pure Silk</l>
            <l>Of the dead worm (whiter) then Milk.</l>
            <l>As I of feeding much do treat,</l>
            <l>So rules I render after meat.</l>
            <l>VVhen thou from a full meal dost rise,</l>
            <l>Scummer and Urine if tho'rt wise:</l>
            <l>Then pipe of right Varinas take,</l>
            <l>For that doth swift digestion make.</l>
            <l>Then seat thy self in a great chair,</l>
            <l>And thing call'd tatling do forbear;</l>
            <l>So shall you fall into sweet nap,</l>
            <l>Shall ease the burthen of your lap:</l>
            <l>That you no sooner shall awake,</l>
            <l>But you another meal may take;</l>
            <l>Or have at least when you do rise</l>
            <l>Passage for dung between your thighs.</l>
            <l>Another precious rule scarce thought on</l>
            <l>By no means here must be forgotten;</l>
            <l>All vermine which in bed doth creep,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:106766:71"/>From thighs and privy members keep;</l>
            <l>For rhey are creatures break the rest,</l>
            <l>And make men sleep when they should feast;</l>
            <l>Leaving untoucht a wholesome cony,</l>
            <l>Which sweeter is to man then money.</l>
            <l>Take woman fat, with a black hair,</l>
            <l>With colour red, and skin that's fair;</l>
            <l>And turn her up, and you shall see</l>
            <l>Such a strong contrariety,</l>
            <l>Of her white thigh and curled black,</l>
            <l>That bordereth about her knack</l>
            <l>Shall please the skilful eye to see</l>
            <l>Of hues, such rare variety;</l>
            <l>For there is black, and blew, and white,</l>
            <l>Ordained for young mans delight.</l>

            <l>Strong harbours for fat crabs and fleas;</l>
            <l>But I must turn and wind my story</l>
            <l>To those by feeding gain their glory.</l>
            <l>And now should I all wild fowle name,</l>
            <l>That adde to lusty manchers frame;</l>
            <l>I dazle should the readers eye</l>

            <l>Nor of the partridge, nor the pheasant,</l>
            <l>Meat scarcely known to chops of peasant;</l>
            <l>Nor of the woodcock, nor the widgeon,</l>
            <l>Nor the often billing pigeon.</l>
            <l>Nor of the lark, nor the cock-sparrow</l>
            <l>

            <l>Oysters are of strong operation,</l>
            <l>Known to both Sexes of our Nation;</l>
            <l>They're fishes of such rare perfection,</l>
            <l>That they in flesh make an erection;</l>
            <l>And give to mouths want teeth such strength</l>
            <l>That they'le devour a whole yards length;</l>

            <l>For fear I'm thought too full of phlegme:</l>
            <l>But now I something have to say,</l>
            <l>Of food that helps natures decay;</l>
            <l>Of which the food springs from the earth</l>
            <l>Sutes best to those of humane birth.</l>
            <l>In Indies Eastern occident,</l>
            <l>There's fruits that give the taste content.</l>
            <l>Some that have travelled speak of Planton,</l>
            <l>It makes men lusty, women wonton:</l>
            <l>But I believe our English skerrit</l>
            <l>To man or woman adds more spirit.</l>
            <l>But this is clearly my opinion,</l>
            <l>There breeds more sperme of leek and onion;</l>

            <l>They for the learned Doctors call,</l>
            <l>Who straight appear'd in place call'd Hall:</l>

            <l>For which the woman oft was chid.</l>
            <l>The Doctors gravely, and in quiet,</l>
            <l>Ask't him of his usual dyet:</l>
            <l>He told them Parsnips was the meat</l>
            <l>VVhich he most usually did eat;</l>
            <l>By which conjectur'd 'tis by all,</l>
            <l>No root is more spermatical.</l>

            <l>A month these roots he must refrain;</l>
            <l>VVhich willingly my stout Don did,</l>
            <l>And changing food lay still in bed:</l>
            <l>But she before the month had end</l>
            <l>Presented Parsnips to her friend;</l>

            <l>As feirce as a broad shouldred Turk.</l>
            <l>Since Parsnips such a batning thing</l>

            <l>And stick as fast to one another</l>

            <l>The peremptory Jade did rail,</l>
            <l>Her words did bruise like blows of flail;</l>
            <l>But Pothecary having mettle,</l>
            <l>Removed her arse from off the settle:</l>
            <l>And made the whore that sold the Eele,</l>
