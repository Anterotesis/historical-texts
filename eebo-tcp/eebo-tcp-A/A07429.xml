         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

thereof to evill lustes, and seiking of occasiones to fulfill
the wicked desires thereof; I thought it my dutie to indeuour
to draw you to the right vse of Musick and singing, the whilk
<pb facs="tcp:5947:3"/>
being sanctified be gud and honest matter, and holy dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of heart, makes meikle for godlie edification and comfort.
For the measures of poësie &amp; harmonie of musick (as I finde be
daily experience in my awin familie) delytes the mind, and sa
helpes the memorie very meikle, to embrace and keip fast the
matter, and stirres vp and sets the force of the soules affectiones
towards God, in pleasand meditation thereof. The reason is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident
and naturall, because that like drawes to like, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
therein, and that whilk delites, leaues a stamp and printe
in the memory, and moues sa the affectiones, that it is not easie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
remooued. Now it is certaine that measures, harmonie, gud
order, and temperature, are like to the nature of man, &amp; maist
friendlie and amiable thereunto: Seeing the gud constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the bodie, standes in the gud temperature of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
therof; sa hes the saule also the awin sort of temperature:
If not in the nature, yet euidently in the faculties and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones
thereof, meruelouslie mooued and disposed be the measures
temperature, and harmonious melodie of Musick and Poësie.
And the same also I take to be the cause why method and gud
order is the mother of memorie, &amp; delectation in all thinges.
This the God and maker of the saule and spirites of men, knaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
best, hes set downe his haly will and veritie in sacred scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
not onely in plaine and simple prose, as in the storie, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,

and verses, meit to be vttered with the melodie of Musick; be
voyce or instrument; And that but question for memorie

the word of God, that with sanctified zealous &amp; wise

               <p>FOr want of tryall and consideration of their awin

Men in publick charge in Kirk &amp; pollicie, sleuthis,
perverts &amp; misfaris al, and men in private occupations,
runnes loose without feare of God, or aequitable and
charitable dealing with their neighbour, &amp; sa the heap
of this common confusion of sin, growes huge out of
measure; that it is the wounderfull mercie and long
suffering of God, that stayes the consuming fire of his
wrath, from finding out sik mater, and burning there
vpon, to the bottome of hell. My counsel and warning
is therefore to all in the loue of Christ, that they caste
aside the busines &amp; cares of this warld, wherewith they
are haillelie occupied, to the wrak and losse of their
saules, and esteeming the chief earand and turne, whilk
they haue to doe in this warld to be, how, that after a
miserable, short, and vaine life, they may liue happelie
hereafter for euer: That in this consideration, I say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they
take large time, and great paines in this exercise of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and examination of the estaite wherein they stande
before God: sa that they neither sleepe nor eat ane day
or night, before they haue spente some peece of time,
fectfullie and fruitfully, in the wark of tryall; that fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

mooved earnestly to seik and embrace the furniture
and remedie, whilk God of his superaboundant grace,
vouchsafes daily to offer by the preaching of his word,
and profitable writings of his godlie and learned ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
And that this be done by speedy redeeming time
without farder delay: for it is now high time, and fuire
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:5947:24"/>
dayes, our day of the Gospell is past noone, and the Sun

if ye will heare his voice, hardin not your harts, neither
sleipe in ignorance, infidelitie, and sinne, least being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred,
yee perish with the multitude of the foolish,
ignorant, faithlesse and rebellious. For this purpose
then, I exhort and earnestly beseik all and euerie ane,
(specially of you deare flock) after your verie names, to
wey and considder the Scriptures following, whilk
now and then ye heare opened vp and intreated for this
effect; and that with grace and sanctification of your

working of his spirite, and hes promised to sik as will
seik for the samin: Aske therefore the samin earnestlie,
and seik him carefullie, that ye may receiue and finde,
and by all meanes, quicken and steir vp the measure of
that gift whilk ye sall get of your bountiful God. Now
seeing manie things appeir that is not, and Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
as man was deceiued with the Figge-tree, weill
busked with leaues, &amp; fruitful-like a far-off, but found

therefore accursed. We are blinde in our awin faultes,
we passe ouer lightly, we easelie forgiue them, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

yea, and better nor our neighbours. Therefore see that

men, but before God, wha sees the secreet of thy hart:
not in maters knawin to men onely, but to thy awin

sonne, the Lord Iesus Christ, in whome he elected his

               <p>2 Try and considder, if thou haue the right knaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and possession of Christ in thy hart, be faith in his

               <p>4 Considder and examine thy selfe if thou hes the
knawledge, faith, feeling, and injoying of the haly
ghaist, wha calles the chosen effectually, applyes Christ
vnto them, and makes them to apprehend and receiue
him, and all his blessings be a true faith.</p>
               <p>5 Then try thy faith, if thou be assured that God
sent his Christ in the warld to saue thee, and vnlade
thee of the haill burden of thy miserie, and ladin thee
with the rich store of his blessings and perfite happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>

               <p>7 And finally, because there is great hypocrisie in
flesh, and counterfetting of calling, faith, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
be the craft of Satan, as also terrible assailzeing of
the conscience, by his fyrie tentationes. Therefore,
there is great neede here, of a diligent and accurat try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
to finde out the true markes of thy election: &amp; sa of
salvation. First, be the testimony of the spirit: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by the motiones &amp; working therof. Then try weill,
if at any time thou hes found the halie spirit, to speake,
as it were within thee, &amp; testifie to thy spirit, that thou
art the childe of God. If thou hes found in thy hart the
loue of God and Christ, and of the things that he loues,
and the hatred of the Deuill and his warkes. If thou hes
founde a hart to pray and thanke God, to meditate and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:5947:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
delyte in him and his worde, to loue his servands and
children, and delyte in their companie. And finally, if
thou findes hope with patience, and a continuall battel
against sinne, and the intysements of the warld: then
may thou be certaine, that God hes giuen thee to
Christ, na power salbe able to take thee from him, or
separate thee from his loue, or stay him from giuing
thee life everlasting. And here is the joy and peace of
conscience, that continuall feast.</p>
