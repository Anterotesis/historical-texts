            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Lord and Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is the great <hi>Honour</hi> of this <hi>City,</hi>
since the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
in it, that it hath born a much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
proportion to the rest of the Nation, in
<hi>publick Works</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi> than in the
largeness of its Buildings, and number of
its Inhabitants. For when, upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
clamours of our Adversaries of
<pb facs="tcp:101595:3"/>
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> an account was
thought fit to be taken of such <hi>Acts</hi> of
<hi>Charity</hi> as lay more open to the view of the
World, within sixty <hi>years</hi> from the settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Reformation</hi> by <hi>Q. Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
it was found, that they exceeded <hi>all</hi>
that had been done in twice that number of
years in the time of <hi>Popery;</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this <hi>City</hi> did equal the whole <hi>Kingdom</hi>
besides.<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi>'s Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nops. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pismi, <hi>p.</hi> 1219. 1224.</note> And although those who make this
Report, complain of the too great reserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of some <hi>Companies</hi> in making known
their Benefactours; yet upon the diligent
search some persons made, it did appear,
that as to the <hi>best parts</hi> of <hi>publick Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
in founding <hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>Hospitals,</hi> &amp;c.
more was done within that time, than from
the <hi>Conquest</hi> to the <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, besides the large and constant <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
of the <hi>City</hi> in the <hi>Care</hi> of their <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitals;</hi>
many particular <hi>Citizens</hi> did so
great things in several parts of the Nation
upon their own Stocks, that within that
<pb facs="tcp:101595:3"/>
compass of Time, more than <hi>forty Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi>
were built and endowed, and above
<hi>twenty Free Schools,</hi> and upon a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
computation, near a <hi>million</hi> of Money
was thought to be bestowed in <hi>Works</hi> of
<hi>Charity,</hi> in <hi>London</hi> and the two <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the true <hi>Protestant Charity</hi>
of those times; which ran in a clear, free
and undivided Channel, without the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Superstition, or being diverted from
its proper course to serve private ends and
designs. And this brought <hi>Honour</hi> to our
<hi>Religion;</hi> advanced the <hi>Reputation</hi> of
the <hi>City;</hi> and promoted the <hi>Good</hi> of the
whole <hi>Nation.</hi> And such are great and
wise ends; fit to be considered and carried
on by those to whom <hi>God</hi> hath given a heart
sutable to the largeness of their Estates;
which they can neither carry into another
World, nor better employ in this than by
<hi>doing Good</hi> to Mankind with them.</p>
            <p>And as there still continued many and
<pb facs="tcp:101595:4"/>
undeniable Instances among <hi>true Protestants</hi>
of extraordinary <hi>designs</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Members</hi> of this <hi>City,</hi> whom <hi>God</hi>
had blessed in their Imployments; so I have
reason to hope, that this <hi>Age</hi> will afford
remarkable Examples of the same kind to
<hi>Posterity:</hi> That so our <hi>Protestant Faith</hi>
may be always found <hi>fruitfull in good
Works;</hi> which will be the best means
both to adorn and preserve it.</p>
            <p>To perswade and encourage others to
tread in the steps of those worthy <hi>Citizens,</hi>
whose <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> deserve their
imitation, is the chief design of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sermon; which out of due Respect to
the <hi>Order</hi> of your <hi>Court,</hi> I now present
to your Hands; with my hearty Prayers to
<hi>Almighty God</hi> for the continuance of his
<hi>Blessing</hi> on this <hi>City</hi> and the <hi>Government</hi>
of it. I am,</p>

            <p>WHen <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate designed (if
possible) to retrieve the honour of
the Heathen Religion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sozom.</hi> l. 5. c. 15.</note> he easily discern'd that
it was not enough for him to restore the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
to open the Temples,<note place="margin">Hist. Trip. l. 6. c. 29.</note> to appoint the
Sacrifices to be offer'd upon the Altars; but
he found it necessary for them to imitate the
Christians in the strictness of their Lives, in
the solemnity of their Devotions, in the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Discipline, and especially in the
erecting Hospitals, and taking care of the Poor.
For he that would not believe the Christian
Religion to be from God, thought himself
bound to give some probable account, how a
Religion so contrary to the Interests and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of this World, should be able to prevail
against all the arts and power of its many and
potent Enemies; and upon the deepest search
which could be made by himself, or the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101595:5"/>
Wits of the Heathens then about him, they
concluded the flourishing and propagation of
it to be chiefly owing to those things which he
so much commended to the Heathens imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And from hence they inferred, that if
the same things could be brought into Practice
among the Gentiles, they should be able to
supplant Christianity by its own methods, and
restore Paganism by the same Weapons by
which it was overthrown. This was thought
so subtle and artificial a device by him whose
great design was to extirpate our Religion in
a soft and gentle manner, without the blood
and cruelty of former times, that he writes an
Epistle on purpose to <hi>Arsacius</hi> the chief Priest
of <hi>Galatia,</hi> requiring punctual observance of
these Commands; and as to the chargeable
and expensive part, he offer'd large provisions
out of his own Revenue to defray it.</p>
            <p>But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had been beforehand with
him in <hi>Galatia,</hi> having planted Churches with
great success there; and Christianity, by his
means, took so deep root in mens hearts, that
neither the rage and fury of former Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
nor the plausible arts and insinuations
of <hi>Iulian</hi> were able to root it out. It is true,
that these Churches, soon after their planting,
were in great danger of being overrun by the
pernicious Errours of some Seducers of that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101595:5"/>
time; (the apprehension whereof put Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> into that astonishment which he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
in the beginning of this Epistle,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 6.</note> 
               <hi>I marvel
that you are so soon removed from him that called
you into the Grace of Christ unto another Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,</hi>
&amp;c.) yet by the early notice and care
which he took to prevent the spreading of
these corruptions among them, the <hi>Galatian
Churches</hi> recover'd the soundness of their Faith,
and have preserved a name among the Eastern
Churches, though under great variety of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
to this day. Some take notice, that
this is one of the sharpest <hi>Epistles</hi> written by
Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> He appears indeed, by the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it, to have been much surprised and
moved at the news of a great and sudden al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
among them; which he was sure was
not for the better. And by this plain dealing
with them, he knew, till they consider'd bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
they would be offended with him; but
withall he tells them this did best become <hi>a
Servant of Christ,</hi> who, like a good Physician,
hath more regard to the Disease than to the
Palate of his Patient; <hi>For if I yet pleased Men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. 10.</note>
               <hi>I should not be the Servant of Christ.</hi> But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
vindicated his own honour,<note place="margin">Ch. 1, 2.</note> which the
evil reports of the false Apostles made neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary;
and argued with great strength and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
against the imposers of the Law;<note place="margin">Ch. 3, 4. part of 5.</note> he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101595:6"/>
betakes himself to the inforcing the practice
of the general and necessary Duties of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi>
upon these <hi>Galatians.</hi> If they had such a
mind to keep the Law,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 14.</note> 
               <hi>All the Law,</hi> saith he,
<hi>is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou shalt
love thy neighbour as thy self.</hi> It was a vain and
foolish thing for them to contend about kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the Law, who did overthrow the main
design of it, by their heats and animosities
against each other; which, instead of preserving
the honour of the Law, was the certain way
to destroy one another.<note place="margin">15.</note> 
               <hi>But if ye bite and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
one another, take heed that ye be not consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
one of another.</hi> From hence he shews, that
<hi>hatred,</hi>
               <note place="margin">20.</note> 
               <hi>variance, emulations, wrath, strife, sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
heresies,</hi> are as much <hi>the lusts of the flesh
as adultery,</hi>
               <note place="margin">21.</note> 
               <hi>fornication, murther, drunkenness,
revellings and such like;</hi> and as destructive to
mens Salvation; <hi>of the which,</hi> saith he, <hi>I tell
you before, as I have also told you in time past,
that they which doe such things shall not inherit
the Kingdom of God.</hi> And they that are true
Christians <hi>must crucifie the flesh with all these
affections and lusts thereof;</hi>
               <note place="margin">24.</note> such as vain-glory,
love of contention, envying the reputation of
others.<note place="margin">26.</note> 
               <hi>Let us not be desirous of vain-glory, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
one another, envying one another.</hi> But
the Apostle did not think the design of the
Law, or the obligation of Christianity was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101595:6"/>
with abstaining from doing injuries
to others; therefore he proceeds to tell them
what exercise of tenderness, compassion and
readiness to doe good to others were expected
from them by the Law of Christ.</p>
            <p>(1.) If a man, through the frailty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, or the sudden surprise of a
Temptation, be overtaken in a fault, do not,
saith he, trample upon him, nor insult over
him; but endeavour <hi>with the spirit of meekness</hi>
to recover him from his fall; considering that
we carry about us the same load of flesh, and
are exposed to continual Temptations our
salves.<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>(2.) If we see others groaning under the
heavy burthen of their own infirmities, or the
pressures and calamities of the world, do not
add more weight to their afflictions; but put
your own shoulders under to bear a part with
them, to make their burthen more easie to
them; for herein lies a great deal of that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which Christ hath laid on all his Disciples.
<hi>Bear ye one anothers burthens and so fulfill the
Law of Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">6. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>(3.) If it be impossible for men to attend
the service of your Souls and the affairs of
this World together, never grudge nor repine
at the exercise of your kindness and liberality
towards your spiritual Teachers, <hi>v. 6. Let him
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101595:7"/>
that is taught in the word communicate to him
that teacheth in all good things.</hi> Which instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
being mention'd, the Apostle subjoins two
things:</p>
            <p>1. A general Proposition, <hi>viz.</hi> That every
man shall receive in another World according
to the good that he doth in this.<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man
soweth that shall he also reap.</hi>
               <note place="margin">8.</note> 
               <hi>For he that soweth
to his flesh shall of his flesh reap corruption, but
he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap
life everlasting. i. e.</hi> He that looks onely after
his present advantage in this world and dares
not venture to doe any thing out of hopes of
recompence for it in another life, he is said <hi>to
sow to his flesh;</hi> but he that is good and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
and kind to others without hopes of
any other advantage than what God will give
him for it, is said <hi>to sow to the spirit; the Flesh
and Spirit</hi> being opposed as the two Centres of
the different worlds: the great thing to which
all things tend in this world being something
carnal or that relates to the <hi>Flesh;</hi> and the
great principle of another world being wholly
spiritual. And these two <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> are
placed as two Loadstones drawing our hearts
several ways, the one is much stronger, but
at a greater distance; the other hath less force
in it self but is much nearer to us, by which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101595:7"/>
means it draws more powerfully the hearts
that are already touched with a strong incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to it. But the Apostle useth the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of two Fields, wherein the product of the
Seed answers to the nature of the Soil; <hi>so he
that sowes to the flesh, i. e.</hi> that minds onely
his present interest in this world, his harvest
shall be proportionable to his seed, he may
reap advantages to himself in this world su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to his pains and industry; but the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
this world can yield is but of a short
continuance, being of a temporary, transient,
corruptible nature, <hi>he that soweth to the flesh
shall of the flesh reap corruption:</hi> but <hi>he that
soweth to the spirit, i. e.</hi> hath so great a regard
to the rewards of another life, that he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to let go a present enjoyment and bury
it under ground, casting it in as seed into the
earth in hopes of a future resurrection, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he may be condemned as a weak and
improvident man by the men of this world,
yet as certain as there is a life everlasting to
come, so certainly shall all his good deeds
yield an abundant increase and meet with
a glorious recompence then, if there be no
corrupt mixture in the sowing which may
spoil the virtue of the seed, <hi>for he that soweth
to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting.</hi>
And let not men deceive themselves; if they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101595:8"/>
look onely at themselves and the things of this
world, let their pretences be never so spiritual,
if they dare not doe acts of Charity so as to
trust God for a reward, they do but <hi>sow to
the flesh;</hi> and though the world may be chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and men may sometimes deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
yet <hi>God cannot be mocked;</hi> he knows the
hearts, and intentions, and secret designs of
men, and according to them their reward
shall be; <hi>for whatsoever a man soweth that shall
he reap.</hi> This I take to be the natural and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
meaning of the Apostle in those words.</p>
            <p>2. A particular Exhortation, not to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
<hi>in well doing,</hi> which is the same with
<hi>sowing to the spirit</hi> before, and with <hi>doing good</hi>
in the following verse, both which are to be
understood of the Works of Charity; and
therefore we ought to take it in that sense
here. These are especially called <hi>good Works</hi>
in the New Testament; <hi>Dorcas</hi> is said to be <hi>a
Woman full of good Works and Alms-deeds which
she did.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 9. 36.</note> The Widow that was to be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Office in the Church, must be <hi>well reported
of for good Works;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 10.</note> and these presently follow,
<hi>the bringing up children, the lodging strangers,
washing the Saints feet and relieving the afflicted;</hi>
In the <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives him a
strict charge,<note place="margin">Tit. 3. 8.</note> that <hi>he deliver it with great assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
(<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>that they which believe in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101595:8"/>
God might be carefull to maintain good Works;
these things are good and profitable unto men;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 3. 14.</note>
Where the same word is used in the Greek,
that is in the words of the Text. And to the
same purpose other words of a like significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are used,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 16.</note> as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>To doe good and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
forget not;</hi> '<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Charge them
that are rich in this world—that they doe good,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 18.</note>
               <hi>that they be rich in good works, ready to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
willing to communicate. That ye may abound
to every good Work,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> which he
after explains,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 8. 11.</note> by <hi>being enriched in every thing
to all bountifulness.</hi> So that although <hi>well doing</hi>
in the general may extend to every good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet by the particular sense of that phrase
in the New Testament, and especially from
the coherence of these words with the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and following verses, it appears that the
<hi>well doing</hi> here spoken of, is to be understood
of <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Charity.</hi> Which the <hi>Apostle,</hi> as
they were Christians, did suppose them to
practise, but being apprehensive lest the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
they met with in the world,
should make them grow cold and remiss in
this great duty, he therefore exhorts them not
to faint or <hi>grow weary of doing it;</hi> and to that
end he lays down the most powerfull Motive
and Consideration; <hi>for in due season ye shall reap
if ye faint not: i. e.</hi> ye shall not miss of a reward
from God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:101595:9"/>
So that from the words we may take notice
of these two things which deserve our consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</p>
            <p>1. The many discouragements men meet
with in the World which are apt to make
them grow <hi>weary in well doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The mighty incouragement which God
gives to our continuance and perseverance in
it; <hi>for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. The many discouragements men meet
with in the World, which are apt to make
them grow <hi>weary in well doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Precepts of Charity deliver'd by our
Saviour and his Apostles are so plain, so full,
so many, so easie to be understood; and those
Precepts inforced by so just, and reasonable,
and pious considerations, with respect to God,
to the World, to fellow Christians, to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of our Religion, and lastly to our selves,
from the comfort that is in well doing, and
the reward that follows it; that a man must
have great impudence, to profess himself a
Christian, and yet to think himself not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to doe acts of Charity. But notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all this, and much more which might
be said to this purpose, there are too many
still who are ready to find out some plausible
pretences to excuse them from <hi>well doing;</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:101595:9"/>
which being the greatest discouragements to
men from continuing in it; I shall make it
my present business to examin them, and to
shew how little weight there is in them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
being compared with the Authority of
him who hath made this our duty, and the
reward we may justly expect for performing
it. And here I shall pass over the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and trivial Objections, which every one
can easily answer that makes them; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
argue an unwilling mind to perform
their duty, than one unsatisfied about the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of it; and I shall therefore insist
on those that carry a greater appearance of
strength in them; which are chiefly these
two,</p>
            <p>1. From the different <hi>state</hi> of our <hi>Times</hi>
from those when these <hi>Commands</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi>
were given.</p>
            <p>2. From the sad prospect of our own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
which seem rather to call for a <hi>Care</hi> of
our selves than <hi>Charity</hi> to others.</p>
            <p>1. The first pretence is from <hi>the difference</hi>
of <hi>Times;</hi> 
               <q>There was then, say such men,
great reason for Charity which will not hold
now; those were times of persecution for
Religion, and many were driven to great
streights and necessities on that account who
deserved to be relieved, and the Christians
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101595:10"/>
had been worse than Infidels not to doe
good to men that were brought to want
meerly for Christ's and the Gospel's sake;
the Laws then could take no care of these
poor and indigent persons; for the Laws
made them so, being then opposite to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity:
but now our Religion is settled by
the Laws; and we have many Laws made
for a competent provision for the poor,
which will be sufficient if they be put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
and if they be not, what Charity is
this to relieve an idle and disorderly sort of
People who live upon Alms, when it is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Charity to such to make them work and
to provide for their own subsistence?</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the force of the Objection which
seems to have a great deal of strength and
weight in it; but before I give an Answer to
it I must acknowledge the truth of some things
contained therein.</p>
            <p>(1.) That there is a great difference in the
case of Charity, where our Religion is settled
by Law, and where it is persecuted by it. For
a larger measure and degree of Charity is just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
required in a time of Persecution, in as
much as those are the truest Objects of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
who prefer <hi>the keeping Faith and a good
Conscience</hi> before the good things of this Life.
And we ought to look upon it as an unvalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101595:10"/>
blessing, that we have the <hi>Christian,</hi> yea
the <hi>Reformed Christian Religion</hi> settled by our
<hi>Laws.</hi> And God grant it may ever so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue!</p>
            <p>(2.) It cannot be denied that we have very
good Laws for the maintenance of the Poor,
and that they might be sufficient for their
common necessities, if they were duly execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And it is a very just and reasonable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
which our Laws make between the
involuntary Poor, who are made so by the
hand of Heaven, either by Sickness, or Lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or Age, or Children, or Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
the voluntary Poor, who may help themselves
but will not, being idle, dissolute and slothfull
persons. These deserve rather the hand of
Justice to punish them than that of Charity to
relieve them: For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himself is so far
from thinking this to be true Charity, that he
hardly thinks it so to keep such from starving
if we take that Proverbial saying in its strict
and literal sense,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 3. 10.</note> 
               <hi>If any would not work, neither
should he eat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(3.) I grant that it is greater Charity to
put persons upon providing for themselves
than to relieve their present necessities. For
that is the greatest Charity which doth a man
the most good. And he that reduceth a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
and wandring Beggar to the taking
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101595:11"/>
pains for himself and Family cures an ill ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of his Mind; puts him into the way of
Vertue and Sobriety; gives him a lasting stock
for himself and Family (for diligence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
is so) keeps him out of the danger of
the worst sort of Company; gains him more
Friends, who will be far more ready to help
a person industrious in his Poverty than the
most clamorous and importunate Beggar.
And therefore our Laws have wisely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,
that Work-houses are the best Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
for the Poor, who are able to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
But after these concessions, I am far
from thinking the command of Charity to
be swallowed up in our Laws for the relief of
the Poor. For,</p>
            <p>(1.) If our Laws were the best in the
World for this purpose, yet, if they be not
duly executed, they leave as much room for
Charity as if there were none. What if a
Law were made that there should be no Poor
at all among us; but that immediate care
should be taken, upon any man's falling into
decay, that his Stock should be supplied out
of the superfluities of the Rich? If this Law
were not executed, men would be altogether
as miserable in their Poverty, and as great
Objects of Charity as if there were no such Law
in being. For the making of a Law for their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101595:11"/>
supply without putting it in execution, is but
like the Person in Saint <hi>Iames,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 2. 16.</note> 
               <hi>who said to those
who were naked and destitute of daily food, be ye
warmed and filled; but notwithstanding gave them
nothing needfull for the Body; what doth this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit?</hi>
What advantage or satisfaction is it to a
Man to starve with the Law on his side? Or
can men be better fed or cloathed with the
Words of a Law than of any particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
If not, then if care be not taken for the
relief and maintenance of the Poor according
to the Laws, there is as great need of Charity
as if there were none at all.</p>
            <p>(2.) If we suppose the Laws for relief of the
Poor to be duly executed, yet there are many
particular cases of Charity which often happen
which the Laws cannot be supposed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for. The Law takes care onely of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and notorious, and common cases; but
there are continual Instances of singular and
extraordinary cases where relief is as much
wanted, but is rarely challenged. How often
is some mens Reputation a snare to themselves
and Families; who had rather sink silently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the gulf of Misery, than have their wants
made known to their insulting neighbours,
among whom they have lived in as good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
as themselves? How many have been
tempted rather to put an end to a miserable
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101595:12"/>
Life than to be despised and contemned for
their Poverty in their old Age! How many
are unwilling to make known their condition
for fear of a repulse and being thought Liars,
or impudent and common Beggars! How
hardly will some pinch themselves and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
before they will make known their neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities!
and some have been known to have
brought themselves so low, that when their
sad condition hath been discovered, they have
been past all possibility of recovery. I hope
such Instances are not frequent among us.
And yet we are lately told in Print by a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of this City,<note place="margin">Proposals for Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the Poor, <hi>p.</hi> 29. 1681.</note> 
               <hi>That he hath reason to believe
many hundreds have perished through want of late
years.</hi> If this be true, and their case was
known; what a shame and dishonour is it,
in the midst of so much plenty and luxury,
to suffer such a reproach to Christianity to be
among us? But if their case were not known
in time; the stain is not quite wiped off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there ought to be in so great, so rich,
so well-governed a City, a due care taken to
find out as well as to relieve the truly necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous.</p>
            <p>(3.) The obligations of Charity reach much
farther than the force of our Laws doth. For
how small a matter within this City doth
answer the letter of the Law, where Persons
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101595:12"/>
enjoy very great and plentifull Estates? And
is that all which their thankfulness to God,
their love to their Brethren, and the regard to
our Saviour's Commands will draw from
them?<note place="margin">Luk. 6. 36.</note> Is this <hi>being mercifull as our heavenly

               <note place="margin">Matt. 6. 4.</note> Is this <hi>giving our Alms in

               <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 9. 22. 21.</note> Is this <hi>making to our selves

               <hi>being rich in good

               <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 10.</note>
Is this <hi>doing good to all men as we
have opportunity?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 25. 35, 36.</note> Is this <hi>feeding the hungry,
cloathing the naked, visiting the sick and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd?</hi>
Can we imagine that will be a good
answer at the great day, that we have paid
our Rates to the Poor? If the Christian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
had extended no farther, <hi>Iulian</hi> needed
not have been so solicitous to have the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
equal them?</p>
            <p>The true Charity of Christians is a free and
voluntary thing, not what men are forced to
doe by the Laws; It is a largeness of mind, that
disposeth men to doe good to others, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth
every opportunity for that purpose; It
is the flowing of a Fountain which runs freely,
easily and constantly; and not like the pouring
water out of a narrow mouthed Vessel, where
but little comes, and with a great deal of noise.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101595:13"/>
Charity spreads it self like the beams of the Sun,
and warms and enlivens the colder parts of the
Earth; it pierceth into the bowels of it, and
makes it self a passage to those secret and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
objects which are out of the view of the
World. True Christian Charity hath arms
so large to comprehend the whole World
within them; but it is the Life and Spirit of
that Body whereof Christ is the Head; it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
from one member to another, emptying
it self from the larger vessels into the less, and
so by a constant motion and course through
the Body it keeps heat and union in all the
Parts. To doe good because one cannot help
it, is to obey the Law of Necessity and not of
Charity. He that resolves to go no farther
in Charity than the Law requires him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
he would not have gone so far unless
the Law had forced him; which is in effect to
tell the World, he hath not so much as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to Charity.</p>
            <p>(4.) Our Laws give great encouragement
to the best,<note place="margin">Stat. de 39 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 5. &amp; 21 <hi>Jac.</hi> c. 1. 14 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. c. 9. <hi>Co. 2. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit.</hi> 723.</note> the noblest, the most lasting Works
of Charity; such as erecting Work-houses for
the Poor that are able to work, endowing
Hospitals and Alms-houses for the impotent,
distemper'd and aged Poor; setting up Free-Schools
for the Education of Youth. And I
never yet met with any Objection against these
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101595:13"/>
that will not hold against the best designs in
the World. For it is possible they may be
abused, and may accidentally prove an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Idleness to some Persons, and they
may exceed the due proportion of Persons fit
for them, (Although we yet see no great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of that.) Yet what design can the wit of
Man pitch upon in a captious and suspicious
Age, that will not meet with Objections from
those that have a mind to cavil? The best
Religion in the World, the best Church, the
best Government, the best Laws, the best Men
cannot escape the censures of ill-minded Men;
and why should we think the best designs of
Charity should? But some men whose minds
are set upon one particular way of Charity,
are apt to disparage all other ways to advance
their own: which is the common Errour of
Mankind, to think sufficient Right is not done
to the thing they admire, unless they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
all other things in comparison with it.
But it is a part of Charity to allow, approve
and incourage all true ways of Charity; not
to set up bodily Labour against the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Mind; nor the learning of Arts
and Sciences to the disparagement of breeding
men up for Trade and Business; nor to cry
down Hospitals and Infirmaries for the Lame
and Sick and Aged in comparison of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101595:14"/>
for the Young and Strong and Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
For all these are excellent and most
commendable ways of Charity, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of contradiction or inconsistency with
one another, if they do answer the ends of
their Institution. I do not go about to lessen
the esteem of casual and occasional Acts of
Charity done to particular Persons in present
Want; when our Blessed Saviour in the midst
of all his Poverty took care of the <hi>Poor,</hi> for
when he spake to <hi>Iudas</hi> at the Table, the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
supposed it was <hi>that he should give some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the Poor.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 13. 29.</note> What admirable Charity
was this, when he had not whereon to lay his
head, and was at the expence of a Miracle to
give an entertainment to the People, yet he
had an Officer, one of his own Apostles, to
take care of the Poor! And when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
such Blessedness to those who doe
acts of Charity to them, and accounts them
<hi>as done unto himself;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 25. 34. 40.</note> which is the highest expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his gracious acceptance of such Acts
from us, and of the great obligation that lies
upon us to doe them; since we ought not to
think much of any thing we doe for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of our Lord and Saviour, who did and
suffer'd so much for our sakes: Yet when we
compare these with the publick Works of
Charity before mention'd, being done for the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101595:14"/>
same end; we shall find these to exceed the
other in some material circumstances, which
add much to the excellency of them.</p>
            <p>(1.) In the Largeness and Extensiveness of
their design. Other Charities are for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
relief of some poor and indigent persons,
whose bowels are refreshed, and backs are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed,
and hearts are eased, by the kindness of
others to them; but these are soon gone, and
mens Charity cannot follow them beyond the
Grave. But publick endowments of Charity
are to last for ever, and doe good to the Poor
of many Generations. The Ages to come
will rise up and bless their Memory who took
care to doe good to those whom they never
saw; and to provide for such, yea very many
such, whom it was impossible for them to
know. When a man sees a great object of
Charity, as the Widow and Fatherless under
extreme necessities, the Mother weeping and
bemoaning her Children not having bread
to put into their Mouths, and the poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
looking ghastly and frightfully crying
for want of bread, but not knowing where to
get it, the very uneasiness of a man's own
mind at the sense of so much misery in
others, will extort some present relief to still
their cries, and to put such an unpleasing
Idea out of his Fancy. But if the Object it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101595:15"/>
self do not move, yet importunity may: if
that doth not, yet custom, reputation, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
humanity, recommendation of Friends may
prevail on men to be sometimes liberal to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
whom they see under present Wants.
But how much doth all this fall short of a
fixed, certain, perpetual provision for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of those, whom none of those Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
could excite men to shew kindness to?
The other is a more sensible, natural, private
Charity; this is a more rational, generous
Christian Charity; being built upon more
free, and noble, and lasting considerations,
most agreeable to the design and honour of
the Christian Religion, which puts men upon
doing the best things and which tend to the
greatest benefit and advantage of mankind.
And in the comparison of things that are
good, the largest, the most publick, the most
lasting ought to have the preeminence.</p>
            <p>(2.) In their Consequence and Usefulness;
which ought to be especially regarded in Acts
of Charity. For true Charity must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with Wisedom and Discretion.
It is not a man's profuse liberality to every
one that asks; nor making himself poor to
make others rich; it is not squandering away
an Estate among idle and indigent Persons,
that makes him a charitable man; but it is a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101595:15"/>
wise dispensing the Gifts God hath bestowed
upon him for the benefit and advantage of
others. And the greater the Good is that is
received the greater is the Charity in bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. The Schoolmen reckon up seven sorts
of Corporal Alms, and as many of Spiritual;
<hi>to visit the sick,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Visito, poto, cibo, redimo, tego, colligo, condo.</note> 
               <hi>to feed the hungry, to satisfie
the thirsty, to cloath the naked, to redeem the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Consule, casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga, solare, remitte, fer, ora.</note>
               <hi>to entertain the stranger, to bury the dead;</hi>
are the former: <hi>to teach the ignorant, to advise
the doubtfull,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. 2. Q. 32. art. 2.</note> 
               <hi>to comfort the sorrowfull, to correct
the wicked, to forgive the injurious, to bear the
troublesome, to pray for all;</hi> are the Instances of
spiritual Charity. But this is rather a distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
of the different sorts of Charity, than
any just Rule and Measure of our obligation
to the Acts of it. For although in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
spiritual Acts of Charity to mens Souls,
are to be preferred before what refers onely
to their Bodies; yet in particular cases a man
may be more obliged to relieve their outward
necessities than to give them good counsel for
their Souls; <hi>i. e.</hi> when those necessities are
urgent and pressing, and by a present sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
they may have longer time and be in
better disposition to receive spiritual Advice.
Some dispute if a bad man be in greater want
and a good man in less want, which of these
two is to be preferred? And the Casuists say,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101595:16"/>
               <hi>The Work of Mercy</hi> is greater in the former
Case; but <hi>the Work of Charity</hi> in the latter. For
<hi>Mercy</hi> onely relates to another's misery;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cajet.</hi> in 2. 2. Q. 32. art. 4.</note> but
<hi>Charity</hi> takes in other Considerations. So I
say, when the competition lies between the
present supply of some in great want, and
making a lasting provision for more persons
in less want, there may be more <hi>Mercy</hi> in the
former case, but there may be greater <hi>Charity</hi>
in the latter: because the more publick, the
more common, the more usefull the Good is,
the greater the <hi>Charity</hi> is in doing of it. I will
not dispute, whether the breeding up of youth
to Learning, or Labour, be among us the
greater <hi>Charity?</hi> I know no reason why two
such excellent ways of <hi>Charity</hi> should be set
at variance with each other. But certainly
we are not to judge of mens usefulness to the
publick meerly by the strength of their limbs,
or the hardness of their hands, or the nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their fingers. Is it not possible that by
the charitable education of Children in the
ways of Learning and Knowledge some may
arrive at a greater capacity of serving God
and their Country, than if they had been grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in a Mill, or tugging at an Oar all that
while? It is not onely keeping People to hard
labour, or to continual working, which is the
design of Charity; but the most excellent way
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101595:16"/>
of Charity is, to improve all Persons accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their several Capacities, so as to make
them more usefull and serviceable to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
This is not onely <hi>doing Good</hi> to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
persons, but to the whole Nation;
and <hi>Charity</hi> is not barely to be measured by
the quality of its Acts, but by the largeness
of the circumference it fills. The breeding
up some few great and usefull Persons to a
Nation is a Work of Charity the publick
Good is more concerned in, than in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
labours of many industrious Artificers:
who do serve the Publick too in their way;
but there is a difference between those lesser
Stars in the Firmament, that wanted a Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope
to discover them, and those great and
splendid Bodies which influence the Earth,
and direct mens passage in the deep Waters.
That is therefore the greatest and most usefull
Charity, which tends to the improving man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
according to their different Capacities;
some for Labour, others for Trade, others to
be usefull to the rest of mankind with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
either to their Country or to their Estates,
their Bodies or their Souls: And which takes
all possible care to prevent the unspeakable
and innumerable mischiefs which idleness and
debauchery do bring upon mankind.</p>
            <p>(3.) In the Honour they bring to Religion.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101595:17"/>
There are some cases, wherein our Charity
must be so secret,<note place="margin">Matt. 6. 3.</note> that <hi>our left hand must not
know what our right hand doth, i. e.</hi> when there
is danger of vanity and ostentation in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our Alms; but when the honour of
God and Religion is concerned,<note place="margin">Matt. 5. 16.</note> then <hi>Let your
light so shine before men, that they may see your
good Works, and glorifie your Father which is in
heaven.</hi> But how can men see those Acts of
Charity which are done in secret, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously
concealed from the knowledge of
men? And if that were to be taken as a strict
command in all cases, then all the publick
Works of Charity, which are most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
for the Honour of God and Religion
would be forbidden by the Gospel. But
where men do excellent and praise worthy
things for great and good ends, without Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaical
Hypocrisie, it is the general concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Religion and the glory of God not
to have such things kept from the knowledge
of the World.<note place="margin">John 15. 8.</note> 
               <hi>For herein,</hi> saith our Saviour,
<hi>is my Father glorified that ye bear much fruit,
so shall ye be my Disciples.</hi> So shall ye appear
to be my Disciples, for Christ had owned
them for his Disciples before, but this would
manifest their being so to the World; which
would bring the greatest honour to God and
to the Christian Religion. And it is certain
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101595:17"/>
nothing did more advance the reputation of
it in the World, than their singular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
care of the Poor. For they not
onely relieved in the first place those that were
Christians, according to the Apostle's Rule in
the next Verse; <hi>especially to those of the House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
of Faith;</hi> but their Charity extended to
the very Heathens: which <hi>Iulian</hi> takes notice
of with great Indignation:<note place="margin">Jul. <hi>Ep. ad</hi> Arsac.</note> 
               <hi>Is it not a shame for
us not to relieve our own poor, when the Christians
not onely take care of their own but of ours too?</hi>
And by the case of <hi>Lucian</hi>'s <hi>Peregrinus,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that some pretended to be Christians on
purpose that they might be partakers of the
great bounty and kindness which the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
shewed to their Brethren. But such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
as these did not make <hi>them weary in
well-doing;</hi> but still as the Church increased
in Riches by the free and large oblations of
the People; so greater care was taken for the
erecting Hospitals for the reception of the
Poor, who could provide no habitation for
themselves; and this was then always looked
on as a particular concernment of Religion,
and not as a meer political Constitution.</p>
            <p>Thus the matters of Charity stood in the
Christian Church, till men came to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that by the Priest's saying so many
Prayers for the dead, their Souls might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101595:18"/>
out of Purgatory and translated to
Heaven. And when this notorious Cheat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
the stream of mens Charity was diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the Poor, to the making good bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains
for their Souls. And who could blame
men who had spent all their days in Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or raised an Estate by Fraud and Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
if at their death they took care to leave
enough to have so many Masses said for their
Souls, as might by a reasonable computation
serve for their Redemption out of Purgatory
at a marketable Price. When the laying open
these Cheats to the World, gave the first oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to the Reformation, a mighty out-cry
was every where made, that the Foundation
of all good Works was destroyed, and if the
Reformation prevailed there would be no
want of Faith, when every one might choose
what he pleased, but nothing like Charity
was to be expected. To remove the former
Calumny, our Reformers published the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of our Religion; and to take away the
latter, they put that admirable Prince <hi>Edward</hi>
the Sixth upon the new founding the famous
<hi>Hospitals</hi> of this <hi>City,</hi> (for although there were
some <hi>Hospitals</hi> before, such as Saint <hi>Mary Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,
Elsying Spittal,</hi> Saint <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s, yet
they were inconsiderable in comparison of
what they have been since) For by the care
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101595:18"/>
and Charity of the Governours and other
Members of the City, they have yielded a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
support to a mighty number of poor
Children, and wounded and diseased Persons
both in Body and Mind; which being joyned
with another <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>one single Person,</hi>
this <hi>City</hi> may justly vye with any other in the
Christian World as to so many and so great
Foundations, for the best kind of Christian
Charity, in the Education of Youth and the
Care of the Impotent and Diseased.</p>
            <p>Our Religion teacheth us better, than to
have so vain and fond an opinion of our
good Works as to think we <hi>merit</hi> Heaven by
them; but surely our Charity is so much the
greater, if we doe these things out of a sense
of Gratitude to God, than if we think to drive
a bargain with him, and put our imperfect
Works in the Ballance with an infinite and
eternal Reward. Those of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
may think they carry on a better Trade with
Heaven than we doe; and that they have a
mighty advantage in the <hi>overballance</hi> of what
they hope for in exchange for what they part
with; but they had best look well to the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their Accounts, the due value of their
Works, and the reason of expecting such a
disproportionable return; lest at last they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themselves, and totally fail of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101595:19"/>
For in the great day of Account,
all things will be most exactly weighed; and
although the greatest Benefactours rejoyce in
the highest Acts of <hi>Kindness,</hi> yet when any
thing is challenged in a way of <hi>Iustice,</hi> men
do not love to be imposed upon or over-rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in a Bargain. What madness then is it,
for any sinfull Creatures to hope that any
Acts of theirs, being weighed by Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
can bear any proportion in a way of
<hi>Merit,</hi> with no less than the Kingdom of
Heaven? This we utterly disclaim, and owe
all our hopes of Heaven meerly to the infinite
Goodness and Mercy of God through his Son
Christ Jesus: and yet we think our selves never
the less bound <hi>to be fruitfull in good Works;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we hereby testifie our obedience to the
Laws of Christ; our sincere love to God and
our Brethren; our readiness to doe good to
others by the mercies which God hath bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon us; our sense of the obligation we
have to one another, as partaking of the same
nature, and liable to the same infirmities, and
exposed to the same calamities; our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a blessed reward, though not due to
the merit of our Works, but to the infinite
Grace and Mercy of God. And I do not see,
but where men have a due regard to God and
Religion, such considerations as these do more
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101595:19"/>
effectually stir men up to true Acts of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than those mercenary and corrupt Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
in the Roman Church; which look ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like cunning devices to pick the Peoples
Pockets than any real Arguments for Charity.
And upon a carefull examination, it hath been
found, that our <hi>Protestant Doctrine</hi> was so far
from stopping up the Channel that ran so
freely before, that within sixty years after the
<hi>Reformation</hi> more great and noble Works of
Charity were done in founding of <hi>Schools</hi> and
<hi>Hospitals,</hi> than for some hundreds of years
before; and some say from the <hi>Conquest</hi> till
that time of the <hi>Reformation.</hi> But this I have
formerly insisted more upon, on the like Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
            <p>The summe of what I have said is this, that
we have no reason to be <hi>weary in well-doing;</hi>
on the account of our Laws for the common
relief of the Poor; because those Laws can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
provide for all cases of Charity; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they do suppose the greatest Works of
Charity to depend upon the largeness and
freeness of those mens minds to whom God
gives a heart to doe great and worthy things
with the Estates he hath given to them.</p>
            <p>2. But there is another plausible pretence
yet behind, <hi>viz.</hi> from the consideration of
our own Times. <q>Were the times calm and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101595:20"/>
fixed; had we a fair prospect of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, that were a great encouragement to
Charity; but we live in perplexed and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
times, and know not what may become
of us all; mens minds are strangely discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
and full of Fears; and therefore this
is a very unseasonable Time to perswade
them to Charity, when they ought rather to
lay up and secure something against an evil
day.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer,</p>
            <p>1. What times were those the Primitive
Christians lived in, who so much abounded
in Charity?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 11, 12, 13.</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of himself and
his Brethren, <hi>they were hungry and thirsty, naked
and buffetted, having no certain dwelling-place;
labouring, working with their own hands, reviled,
persecuted, defamed;</hi> and yet nothing rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to this World was so much their care
and concernment as providing for the Poor.
For when he went up to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and there
conferred with <hi>Iames,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Gal. 9. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Cephas</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> at his
departure they had nothing to desire of him
and <hi>Barnabas, but to remember the Poor, the
same which I also was forward to doe;</hi> as Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> relates it. And you may see how earnest
he was in it,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8, 9. <hi>ch.</hi>
               </note> by his dealing with the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
when he perswades them to a liberal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution
to the poor Christians in <hi>Iudea,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:101595:20"/>
who then suffer'd much either through Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
or Persecution or both. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had
undertaken for the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Achaia,</hi> (of
which <hi>Corinth,</hi> being a populous and trading
City, was the chief) but the <hi>Collection</hi> not
being yet made among them, he sends some
on purpose to <hi>Corinth</hi> to make all ready against
his coming to them, and perswades them to
great liberality in their giving: for which end
he makes use of the most powerfull and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
arguments and great arts of insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
(1.) He sets before them the Example
of the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Macedonia;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> which is truly
a very extraordinary instance of Christian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
They were under great trouble and deep
poverty at that time themselves, yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> this occasion of more
than ordinary Charity, they not onely strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
themselves even beyond their abilities, but
did it with that cheerfulness and satisfaction
of mind, that they intreated the <hi>Apostle</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of what they had given, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the managing of so good a Work. And
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> seems to speak of it with a kind of
transport, <hi>Moreover, Brethren, we do you to wit
of the Grace of God bestowed on the Churches of
Macedonia; how that in a great trial of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the abundance of their joy and their deep po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
abounded to the riches of their liberality;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101595:21"/>
for to their power I bear record, yea and beyond
their power they were willing of themselves; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us with much intreaty that we would receive
the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the
ministring to the Saints.</hi> Nothing can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the weight of these words and the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phasis</hi>
wherewith they are penned. (2.) He
lets them know what a shame and reproach it
would be to so famous a Church for other
<hi>Divine Gifts</hi> to come behind others in Charity.
<hi>Therefore as ye abound in every thing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 7.</note> 
               <hi>in faith,
in utterance, in knowledge, and in all diligence,
and in your love to us,</hi> (what artificial insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are these!) <hi>see that ye abound in this Grace
also.</hi> (3.) But lest he should seem to press too
hard upon them,<note place="margin">v. 8.</note> he draws off again; <hi>I speak
not by commandment, but by occasion of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness
of others, and to prove the sincerity of
your love.</hi> (4.) Yet he hath no sooner said this,
but he comes on again with the most prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Argument taken from the Example of
our Blessed Saviour:<note place="margin">v. 9.</note> 
               <hi>For ye know the Grace of
our Lord Iesus Christ, that though he was rich,
yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through
his poverty might be rich.</hi> Can any thing be
more moving to Christians than this? (5.) His
design was not to lay a burthen upon them,
but to excite mutual compassion in Christians
to one another.<note place="margin">v. 13, 14.</note> (6.) This would be a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101595:21"/>
to the World of their kindness to him,
and that he had not spoken great things of
them without cause.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 24.</note> (7.) They might justly
expect a retribution sutable to their Bounty;
<hi>But this I say,</hi>
               <note place="margin">9. 6.</note> 
               <hi>He which soweth sparingly shall
reap sparingly; but he which soweth bountifully
shall reap also bountifully.</hi> (8.) This would be
the occasion of many thanksgivings and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to God for them.<note place="margin">v. 12.</note> 
               <hi>For the administration of
this service, not onely supplieth the want of the
Saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
unto God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">13.</note> (<hi>Whilst by the experiment of
this ministration they glorifie God for your profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
subjection unto the Gospel of Christ, and for
your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all
men.)</hi>
               <note place="margin">14.</note> 
               <hi>And by their prayer for you, which long
after you for the exceeding Grace of God in you.
Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.</hi>
               <note place="margin">15.</note>
Wherein he supposes the thing as already done,
as believing it impossible for them to resist the
force of so many Arguments. And yet all
this while Saint <hi>Paul</hi> supposes their condition
to be such as in a little time they might stand
in need of relief from others; which he thought
was so far from being an Argument against
present Charity, that he useth it the other way;
<hi>that now at this time your abundance may be a
supply for their want,</hi>
               <note place="margin">8. 14.</note> 
               <hi>that their abundance may
also be a supply for your want. i. e.</hi> Do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101595:22"/>
what times may come upon your selves
so as to hinder <hi>doing Good</hi> while it is in your
power to doe it; leave those things to the
wise Providence of God; if he think fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
you to want, he that now excites your
hearts to doe good to them, will stir up others
to make up the same measure to you. So
that while the Christians were either under
great persecutions, or in expectation of them,
through the Power of the Magistrates, or the
Rage of the People; yet the <hi>Apostles</hi> pressed
them, and that with great success, to a free,
cheerfull, liberal contribution to relieve those
who labour under greater wants than others.</p>
            <p>2. This very consideration is used as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
in <hi>Scripture</hi> to perswade men to <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
viz.</hi> That we do not know what times
may come upon us.<note place="margin">Eccles. 11. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Give thy portion to seven
and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil
shall be upon the earth.</hi> This seems to the men
of this World a strange way of reasoning,
and it may be they suspect from hence that
<hi>Solomon</hi> was not so wise a man as they took
him to be. <q>What! give away what one
hath because one knows not what times
may come. No certainly, say they, we
ought to get what we can, and to save what
we have, for that reason.</q> The difference
of reasoning in this case proceeds upon the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101595:22"/>
different Principles on both sides. <hi>Solomon</hi>
believed a Divine Providence and they do not.
And he thought that would be particularly
concerned for the good of those, whom no
sad prospect of Affairs could discourage from
well-doing according to their Ability and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>
            <p>II. And so I come to the Incouragement
here given to patient continuance in <hi>well-doing;
for, in due season we shall reap if we faint not.</hi>
Wherein are three things considerable.</p>
            <p>1. The certainty of a future recompence
for well-doing. <hi>We shall reap.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The time of receiving it, not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
but <hi>in due season.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The condition supposed on our parts,
which is continuance in well-doing. <hi>If we
faint not.</hi> Some understand it as relating to
the reward, that we shall receive it <hi>without
fainting;</hi> reaping and harvest being a time of
labour and sickness; but the more natural
meaning of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, seems to be the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the <hi>participle,</hi> as implying the <hi>condition</hi>
on our parts.</p>
            <p>1. The certainty of a future recompence
for <hi>well-doing.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 10.</note> 
               <hi>God is not unrighteous,</hi> saith the
Apostle, <hi>to forget your work and labour of love,
which ye have shewed towards his name; in that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101595:23"/>
ye have ministred to the Saints and do minister.</hi>
Though it be a <hi>work and labour,</hi> though it
may seem uneasie and troublesome for a
while; yet being <hi>a work and labour of love;</hi>
it is but the <hi>work</hi> and <hi>labour</hi> of <hi>sowing,</hi> which
a man goes through the more cheerfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he expects a plentifull increase. He
doth not reap presently the very same which
he sowed, but a wonderfull improvement of
it, when the <hi>seed</hi> being cast into a fruitfull
soil brings forth <hi>some thirty, some sixty, some an
hundred fold.</hi> And this Harvest doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the uncertainty of the Weather;
here are no fears of blasting and mildew, or
locust to prevent the joyfull expectation of it;
no danger of the seed rotting in the ground,
or being pickt up by the fowls of the air;
but <hi>he that ministreth seed to the sower,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 10.</note> 
               <hi>will mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
the seed sown, and increase the fruits of their
righteousness.</hi> His Word is engaged that they
which <hi>sow</hi> shall <hi>reap</hi> a plentifull increase; and
therefore God will not be unrighteous in not
performing his Promise. This men may as
certainly depend upon as that Night and Day
shall follow each other; for <hi>Heaven and Earth
may pass away, but the Word of God endureth for
ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The time of this retribution, <hi>in due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
Most men are unwilling to trust God
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101595:23"/>
too long upon his bare Word; they would
have something in hand, and the remainder
hereafter. And God by the course of his wise
Providence, doth very often order things so
in this World that the most charitable men,
although they may not abound with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
riches, yet generally meet with the fewest
difficulties; and in their straights find more
unexpected assistance than other men. <hi>David</hi>
made it the observation of his own time, that
in all his days though he was then grown <hi>old,</hi>
he <hi>never saw the righteous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 37. 25.</note> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> the charitable
man, <hi>forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.</hi> And
they have far more reason than other men to
hope, that if they do fall into trouble and
sickness, God will have a particular regard to
them;<note place="margin">41. 1, 3.</note> and besides this, they have the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
or rather spiritual contentment that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<hi>doing Good;</hi> and they have more satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
and ease in it, than others have in
hoarding up Wealth for they know not whom.
But none of all these are the reaping here
mention'd;<note place="margin">Ruth 2. 16.</note> They are like <hi>Ruth's gleaning of
handfulls in the field of Boaz,</hi> which shewed a
more than ordinary kindness; notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
which he said,<note place="margin">v. 12.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord recompense thy
work, and a full reward be given thee of the Lord
God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to
trust.</hi> So it is here, they may have better
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101595:24"/>
gleanings and fuller handfulls sometimes in the
common Field of Providence, but this is not
the full recompence which the God of Mercy
will give to those that trust in his Word.
That is onely to be expected at the great Day
when the Lord the righteous Judge shall say,
<hi>Come ye blessed of my Father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 25. 34, 35, 36.</note> 
               <hi>inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
prepared for you from the Foundation of the
World. For I was an hungred and ye gave me
meat; I was thirsty and ye gave me drink; I was
a stranger and ye took me in; naked and ye clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
me; I was sick and ye visited me; I was in
prison and ye came unto me:</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 40.</note> 
               <hi>For inasmuch as ye
have done it to one of the least of these my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
ye have done it unto me.</hi> O the infinite
Goodness and unexpressible Kindness of our
Blessed Saviour, who in the day of Judgment
will interpret all Acts of Charity so much to
the advantage of those that doe them! Who
would deny any thing to a Servant of that
Lord who takes all kindnesses to them as done
to himself, and rewards them accordingly?
What other apprehensions will covetous and
hard-hearted Wretches then have of their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
penuriousness in heaping up riches, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any tenderness or compassion to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of their Brethren and Christ's Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives?
How will they wish ten thousand
times, when it will be to no purpose to wish,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101595:24"/>
that they had rather laid out their money in
<hi>doing good,</hi> than laid it up for those, who may
go to Hell the faster for the great Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they leave behind them. Neither let the
prodigal Fools think they shall escape better,
for being so contrary to the griping and stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
humour of the Covetous; for it is not the
vain and careless squandring an Estate away
in riotous courses will make a man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
more tolerable at that day; but it is
the provident, seasonable, carefull distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Charity for wise and good ends,
which shall meet with so glorious a reward.</p>
            <p>3. Especially, in the last place, <hi>if we faint
not,</hi> and do not repent of what good we have
done, but continue so doing to the end of our
Lives. For this reason I presume it is that
many reserve their greatest <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> to
their Deaths; but it is dangerous putting off
their Repenting and doing Good till they come
to die, for fear their hearts, or those whom they
trust deceive them. But if men begin to doe
well in their health and strength, let them
<hi>not faint</hi> when they come to die; but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
<hi>charitable</hi> as well as <hi>faithfull unto death,
and God will give them a crown of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now my business is to make particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>Application</hi> to this great Assembly <hi>not to be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101595:25"/>
weary in well-doing;</hi> and therefore I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
to You, <hi>A true Report,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>You perceive by this Relation, how much
Good hath been already done in the care of
the Education of poor Children, and in the
cure of and provision for the Maimed and
Distracted, all which are very commendable
ways of <hi>well-doing,</hi> and it is a great advantage
to me this Day, that I am onely to perswade
you <hi>not to be weary in this well-doing, for in due
season You shall reap if ye faint not.</hi> You have
already broke through many discouragements,
and since the sad calamities of Plague and Fire,
which made such desolations among us, You
have done even as to these charitable Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
what hath been to the Admiration
and Astonishment of beholders. Which of us
all who saw the City in its Ruines, with so
many Churches and Halls and Hospitals bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in its rubbish, could ever hope to have
lived to see them rise again with a much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Glory; and our new-built Hospitals to
appear with that Magnificence, that strangers
may easily mistake them for Palaces? We
have lived in an Age that hath beheld strange
Revolutions, astonishing Judgments, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
Deliverances; what all the Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that are still among us may end in, God
alone knows; our unanswerable returns to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101595:25"/>
God for his great Mercies may justly make us
fear, that he hath greater scourges provided
for us; the best thing we can doe for our
selves, is to amend our ways, and to bring
forth fruits worthy of amendment of life; not
barely to own and profess the <hi>Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
but to adorn it, by holy and exemplary
lives, and doing all the Good we can while
we have opportunity. And to that end I shall
offer these Considerations, and so conclude.</p>
            <p>1. The more Good ye doe, the more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
you will find in the doing it. <hi>Therefore
be not weary in well-doing.</hi> There is a certain
secret pleasure and inward satisfaction that
follows <hi>doing Good;</hi> which increases by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
and continuance. This is so far above
the pleasure of the Covetous and Voluptuous
in pursuit of their ends, that it approaches
nearest of any thing we can conceive, to the
satisfaction of the Almighty, who delighteth
in doing Good. It was a remarkable saying
of our Saviour, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preserved,
<hi>It is more blessed to give than to receive.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 20. 35.</note>
How happy do the Poor think themselves,
when those who are Rich are bountifull to
them! But the advantage is on your side;
they are the receivers but you are the gainers.
What you bestow on them <hi>you lay up in store
for your selves:</hi> which will yield far greater
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101595:26"/>
comfort when you come to die than having
raised a vast Estate: for that is onely carrying
a greater account into another World; but
this is a great help to discharge it.</p>
            <p>2. Doing Good is really one of the best
parts of our Religion.<note place="margin">Jam. 1. 27.</note> 
               <hi>True Religion and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled
before God and the Father is this, to visit
the Widow and Fatherless in their Affliction, and
to keep himself unspotted from the World.</hi> It is
not giving a cold formal visit to the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
and Fatherless that makes any part of
Religion, but doing all the good we can to
them, by advice and counsel, by supplying
their wants and taking care of their affairs.
No Duty takes in so much of the substance
of Religion as true Charity.<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 14.</note> 
               <hi>It is the fulfilling
of the Law;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tim. 1. 5.</note> 
               <hi>the end of the Commandment, i. e.</hi> of
the <hi>Gospel;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coloss. 3. 14.</note> 
               <hi>the bond of perfectness.</hi> That, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, all other pretence to Religion is
but flattering of God and meer hypocrisie.
For all our <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Praises</hi> are but verbal
acknowledgments; that which he hath put
the trial of our love to himself upon, is our
love to our Brethren.<note place="margin">1 John 4. 20.</note> 
               <hi>For he that loveth not
his Brother whom he hath seen, how can he love
God whom he hath not seen?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Doing Good to others is taking the best
care of our selves. We all seem very appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
of dangerous times, and very fearfull
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101595:26"/>
what may become of us; the best course eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
wise and good man can take in difficult
and uncertain times, is to doe his own duty
and to leave events to God. And there is no
duty more unquestionable, more safe, more
advantagious, to himself as well as to others,
than <hi>to doe good: i. e.</hi> to be kind and obliging
to all, to forgive injuries, to reconcile ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
to redeem captives, to visit the distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and according to our abilities and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
to relieve those that are in wants
and necessities. This is the way <hi>to dwell safely,
and to be quiet from the fear of evil;</hi> for as long
as God governs the World he will take care
of those who commit themselves to him <hi>by
patient continuance in well-doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Doing Good doth the most answer the
obligations God hath laid upon you by the
Mercies he hath vouchsafed to you.</p>
            <p>And now give me leave to plead with you
the <hi>Cause</hi> of the <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Fatherless Children,</hi>
the <hi>Cause</hi> of the <hi>Wounded</hi> and <hi>Maimed,</hi> who
cannot help themselves, the <hi>Cause</hi> of those who
deserve so much more pity because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pity themselves, being deprived of the use
of their Understandings. If God hath provided
well for you and for your Children, wherein
can you better express your thankfulness for
such a mercy than by your kindness and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101595:27"/>
to those who are destitute of the means
to make them Men. If you have reason to
bless God for your good <hi>Education,</hi> shew it
by taking care of theirs who may hereafter
bless God for your kindness to them. If God
hath blessed you with Riches and a plentifull
Estate in this <hi>City,</hi> and raised you beyond your
hopes and expectations, what can you doe
more becoming the <hi>Members</hi> of this City than
to be kind to the <hi>Children</hi> of those who have
been such and reduced to <hi>Poverty?</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
from what God hath raised you; do not
think much to consider what you have been,
as well as what you are. You can never take
the just height of God's Mercies to you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
you begin at the bottom; and let others
measure your height now, as some have done
that of the <hi>Pyramid's, by the length of your sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi>
by the refreshments they find under you.
Think what God hath brought you to, and
for what end; Was it for your own sakes,
that you might be full, while others are emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
that you might swim in abundance,
while others are pinched with necessities?
Was it not rather to make you his <hi>Conduit-Pipes</hi>
to convey blessing and comforts to
others through your means? When you are
in health and at ease, then think of the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
condition of those who lie in <hi>Hospitals</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:101595:27"/>
under aches and pains and sores, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to comfort them, but the Charity of
good People to them. They cannot represent
their own condition to you, being unable
to come abroad to do it. Be you <hi>good Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi>
to the wounded and hurt, bind up their
wounds with your kindness, and help to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray
the charges of their cures. This is <hi>loving
our neighbour as our selves,</hi> and that is <hi>fulfilling
the Law,</hi> and the <hi>great design of the Gospel.</hi>
Lastly, when you think what a blessing it is
that you do enjoy the use of <hi>your Reason and
Vnderstanding,</hi> pity the poor Creatures whom
God hath deprived of it. How easily, how
justly, how suddenly may God cast you into
their Condition? Shew the esteem that you
have of this Mercy of God to your selves, by
the freeness of your Charity to those that want
it. Therefore, I conclude in the <hi>Words</hi> of the
Text, <hi>Let us not be weary in</hi> any of these ways
of <hi>well-doing, for in due season we shall reap if
we faint not.</hi>
