            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THough I muſt own my ſelf incapable to write upon this Subject, any thing worthy to be expoſed to the publick View, ſince my Education hath not given me thoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Stile and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, altogether neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary

Task-maſters. A full Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of which you have in the enſuing Relation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have made it my Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to give you a clear and particular View of the moſt remarkable Paſſages that happened during the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate time of my Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among thoſe barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Savages. I ſhall offer nothing but Truths, which ten Years Sufferings have made me too long acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with. We were not only baniſhed from our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country, (being Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-men, and my ſelf born
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:52536:7"/>
in <hi>Ratcliff</hi>-Pariſh in <hi>Briſtol</hi>) but from all the Spiritual as well as Temporal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. We were confin'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe whoſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was compoſed of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, whoſe Cuſtoms were Extravagant, and whoſe Uſages almoſt Intolerable; what from the hardneſs of our Labours, and the coarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Proviſions, we were reduced to the moſt preſſing Extremities, which cauſed us to think and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive all Ways and Means to procure our deſired Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; which conſidering how
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:52536:7"/>
narrowly we were watch'd, and how cloſely kept, was almoſt impoſſible to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
            <p>I need not mention here how I made my Eſcape, with two others of my Companions, ſince I have given you an exact Account of it, with all its Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, with what happened afterwards to the Perſon who was inſtrumental in our happy Deliverance, for which we are in Duty bound, during the whole Courſe of our Lives, to own
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:52536:8"/>
the particular Providence of God, to whoſe Aſſiſtance and Protection we owe our preſent Safety.</p>
            <p>The chiefeſt Deſign of my publiſhing this Book, is to Caution all Seafaring Men, whoſe particular Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages carry them into the <hi>Streights,</hi> that they take all poſſible care not to be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan'd by theſe ſubtile Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates who in<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="2+ letters">

               </gap>ſt thoſe Coaſts, where we unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately fell into their Hands; and that reflecting on the Barbarities they muſt expect to ſuffer from thoſe merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

            <p>Another Motive is, That I hope what I write, may be a Means to procure Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for theſe my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, who are now la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under the moſt preſſing Miſeries, and who would be very ſerviceable at this Time againſt the Common Enemy; whoſe

            <head>An Impartial Relation of the poor Captives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Emperor of <hi>Morocco,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN <hi>November</hi> 1681, I went on Board the <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> of 120 Tuns Burden, 7 Guns and 4 Paterero's, <hi>William Bowry</hi> Commander, being bound from <hi>Briſtol</hi> to <hi>Plymouth</hi> for a Convoy, from whence we went with our Convoy (the <hi>Turkiſh Tyger</hi>) to <hi>Cales,</hi> where ſhe left us; when the Fleet was ſafe arrived, we ſtaid there for good Company
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52536:12"/>
or Convoy; but none coming, our Merchants went to a French Commander of 26 Guns that was bound for <hi>Marſeilles</hi>; who agreed with them to carry us ſafe thither: In order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he went aboard and fired a Gun, which hearing, we ſet ſail after him. We were not above three Leagues out of <hi>Cales,</hi> but he hoiſted his Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſails, and left us; however we got ſafe to <hi>Malaga,</hi> where we again waited for a Convoy: but after we had ſtaid there a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time, expecting we ſhould have met with one, we were forced to go without, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loaded with Herrings which were likely to be ſpoiled. From thence we went to <hi>Allicant,</hi> where we met with two <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings</hi> bound for <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> one of 16 Guns, the other of 22,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52536:12"/>
with whom we ſet Sail about Four a Clock in the Morning: and four hours after we met with the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Frigat, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from whence we came? We gave them account whence we came, and whither bound. We ask'd from whence they came? they anſwered, From <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier.</hi> We enquired what was the beſt News there? they anſwered, Good News, for they had made Peace with <hi>Algier</hi>; ſo we brought to, and our Maſter hoiſted out his Boat, and went aboard them, and procured a Copy of the Articles of Peace made between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Algerines:</hi> after which he ſailed with the two <hi>Flemings</hi> in Company to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles,</hi> where we lay 19 days for Pratique, which being gained, we went into the Mould and delivered our Loading; after
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52536:13"/>
which our Maſter was very ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent for us to take in our Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo return; but the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants ſaid we muſt wait a while, and we ſhould have it; ſo we took in our Ballaſt, and our Maſter took in the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants at <hi>Santra Pee:</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards we went to <hi>Santra Pell,</hi> and took in Loading of Oil, and ſet Sail for <hi>Briſtol:</hi> but coming homewards, we put into <hi>Malaga,</hi> where there was a Ship that came from <hi>Tunis,</hi> bound for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> in which were two Lions and two <hi>Barbary</hi> Horſes, being a Preſent for the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, whoſe Commander came on board us, to give our Maſter a Viſit. We enquired of him whither he was bound? he ſaid, To <hi>Tangier,</hi> but to make no ſtay but one day. Our Maſter told him he ſhould be glad of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52536:13"/>
his Company homewards: who ſaid he ſhould be likewiſe glad of his Company; upon which our Maſter went aſhoar, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome Concerns with the Merchants. The ſame day the <hi>Londoner</hi> ſail'd away, leaving us behind. Next day, being the 2<hi>d</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1681, in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning we ſet Sail alone; and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming within ſix Leagues of <hi>Tangier,</hi> we ſaw a Ship give us chaſe, when they came up with us, ask'd us whence we came? we ſaid from <hi>Marſeilles.</hi> We en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the ſame of her; who anſwered, From <hi>Algier:</hi> ſo he bid our Maſter hoiſt out his Boat: our Maſter anſwered, he would not for any Ship he ſhould meet withal. Our Maſter further told him, he ſhould hoiſt out his Boat if he had any thing to do with him, and if he came to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52536:14"/>
him, he ſhould ſee he had a Paſs; ſo he ſent his Lieutenant aboard us in his own Boat, to whom our Maſter ſhewed his Paſs, and he acknowledged it to be good, and calling to his Commander, told him the ſame, who never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs deſired our Captain to come abord with his Paſs: our Maſter told him, that if the Lieutenant would ſtay on board us, one of our Men ſhould go aboard, and ſhew him the Paſs. The Lieutenant agreed thereto, and when the Captain had view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Paſs, the <hi>Moors</hi> went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own Ship, and loading their Piſtols they ſtuck them in the Waſte-band of their Drawers under their Coats, and every one of them had likewiſe a Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs ſtuck on their Waſte: ſo they entred aboard us all at once, firing their Piſtols, and cut and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52536:14"/>
wounded us with their Cutlaſſes. <note n="*" place="bottom">When they meet with any of our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-Men of ſmall Force, having but 8 or 10 Guns, they often deceive them, by telling them they are <hi>Algerines,</hi> getting the Maſter on board them to ſhew his Paſs; when he and his Men are on board, they enter them, and take their, Ship.</note> They had on board them 300 Men and 16 Guns; when they had thus taken our Ship, they carried us to <hi>Sally,</hi> and ſent our Ship into <hi>Memora,</hi> having ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us in a place under Ground: our Diet they gave us was a little black Bread and Water. There they kept us four days, and then ſent us to <hi>Memora</hi> to diſcharge the Ship they took from us, and ſent the Oil with which we were loaden, in Skins, upon Camels and Mules, to the Emperor of <hi>Morocco.</hi> After we had work'd there very hard all
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52536:15"/>
Day in delivering the Ship, they put us down in the Hold of their Ship in Irons, and afterwards ſent us to <hi>Macqueneſs,</hi> where the Emperor's Caſtle is, and where he keeps all his Slaves, and we were delivered up to the Vice-Roy, (the Emperor being then in Camp againſt a City to the Southward, called <hi>Tarradant</hi> in <hi>Barbary</hi>) and by his Negroes we were driven to work all day, driving and curſing of us, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us turn <hi>Moors,</hi> and at Night we were driven to a place where the reſt of the Chriſtians lay, being like a Vault under ground.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1680, the Engliſh Captives that were under this inhuman Tyrant, the Emperor of <hi>Morocco,</hi> bewailing their own Condition, making moan to one another, and praying to God for Deliverance, at laſt concluded
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52536:15"/>
amongſt themſelves to draw a Petition to our late King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> giving him to underſtand their miſerable Condition in this Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity: which being done, the King took it into Conſideration, and ſent over Captain <hi>Francis Nicholſon</hi>; who being come, and ſeeing the Cruel Bondage his poor Country-men were in, their hard Labour and cruel Fare, having therewith many cruel Stripes and Blows, he could not but lament their Condition, and prayed God that he might come to ſome Compoſition with that Helliſh Tyrant for them. The Emperor at the ſame time ſent for the Shack, or Chief o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Jews in his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and bid him build a Town, which would be better for the Jews than the Cane Houſes, (his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52536:16"/>
Name was <hi>Abraham Memoran</hi>) and at that time Captain <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholſon</hi> made an Agreement with the Emperor for the Chriſtians, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Portugueſe</hi> were delivered him up, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror wiſhing them a good Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Tangier</hi>; the Captain took them out of the Town that Night, which the Shack of the Jews hearing of, that came to the Emperor, telling him, if he would let him have the Chriſtians to build the Jews Town, he would give him as much Money as the Captain had agreed with him for: the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror bid him come again in the Morning. Then the Shack or Chief of the Jews went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately home to his Houſe, and got a Preſent ready, and ſent it in to the Emperor's Wife, that ſhe might follicite the Emperor
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52536:16"/>
for him: which having received, ſhe ſent word back by the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs, that ſhe would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prevail with him, which ſhe did. And the next Morning he ſpoke again with the Emperor, who immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent out his Negroes to drive back the Chriſtians, which were hurried again to their Works in a cruel manner. The <hi>Moors</hi> of his City <hi>Macqueneſs</hi> ſeeing that, curſed the Jews for doing it: But the Captain could in no wiſe prevail with this grievous Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the Emperor, (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Captain had done what in him lay to have got the Chriſtians away) who ſaid he would not part with them till the Town was finiſhed. So they went to work with great Chops, and Baskets to carry Earth in; and the Negroes were ſet over
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52536:17"/>
them to keep them at it from Morning to Night. When the Town was finiſhed, he put in his Negroes: but the Curſe of the Jews fell upon their own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, his Miſchief returned on his own Head, as will ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſhewn. In the mean time the poor Chriſtians were grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly hurried and puniſhed by thoſe Helliſh Negroes at the Command of this wicked and inhuman Tyrant the Emperor, and had ſcarce time to take any Nouriſhment, or eat any of their bad Bread that was allowed them, but with a great many Threats, Stripes and Blows by the Negroes, bidding them turn <hi>Moors.</hi> In which conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they prayed to God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them in their Faith; in which, through his Aſſiſtance, they remained conſtant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52536:17"/>Sometime after Captain <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholſon</hi> being gone from thence, the Emperor laid Siege againſt a City called <hi>Tarradant,</hi> in the South-part of that Dominion, being kept by a King whoſe Name was <hi>Mully Hammet:</hi> and having been there a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time, he ſent to the Chief of the Jews, to bring him up ſome Goods which he wanted from <hi>Macqueneſs.</hi> When he had gotten Mules, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them to the place where Emperor was in Camp, the Vice-Roy's Son being there with the Emperor, went to the ſaid Shack or Chief of the Jews, and deſired him to aſſiſt him with ſome Money, and his Father would repay him, when he, <hi>viz.</hi> the Chief of the Jews, ſhould return to <hi>Macqueneſs.</hi> He told him his Father owed him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52536:18"/>
ſeveral thouſand Ducats, and would not pay him any, for as yet he could get none from him: and ſaid moreover, if he ſhould die and periſh, he would not lend him a penny. Of which Paſſages he acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Father, writing a Letter thereof to <hi>Macqueneſs.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Chief of the Jews went to <hi>Macqueneſs</hi> to the Vice-Roy called <hi>Coid Birry,</hi> and told him he had acquainted the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of the Care he had in his Abſence of his Caſtle and Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he taking little notice of him, but returning him Thanks for his Kindneſs, he went away. But <hi>Coyd Birry</hi> the Governour (being ſo called in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's Abſence) ordered one of his chief Negroes in a little time after to go and take ſuch a Horſe which he deſcribed to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52536:18"/>
him, and go to the place where the Country-People kept their Market, to ſee if he could find the ſaid Chief of the Jews; and if he ſaw him, take little notice of him; but if he had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, watch as he went home to his Houſe, and kill him. The Negro did as he was ordered, and eſpying the Shack, or Chief of the Jews, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home to his Houſe, in a Road which lay through a parcel of Olive-Trees, the Negro came to him, pretending Kindneſs to him, being glad to ſee him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and riding by his ſide along on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, ſpied his opportunity very diligently, ſo ſpurred his Horſe over him, rode upon him and trode out his Brains. Word there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was quickly carried to the Vice-Roy, that the Chief of the Jews was killed, at which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52536:19"/>
he ſeemed to be ſorry, that the People might take no notice thereof, and acquainted the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror therewith, and had made ſearch, but knew not who had done it. The Emperor ſent him word back, that if he did not find out who did it, he would cut off his Head, and ordered the ſaid Vice-Roy to put the Governour of the Jews Son to be the Chief in his ſtead; but the old Jew was ſoon forgoten by the Emperor.</p>
            <p>When the Emperor had laid Siege ſome Years againſt <hi>Tarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> and could not take it, he returned home to <hi>Macqueneſs.</hi> After he had been at home a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time, he went againſt that City with about 70000 Horſe and Foot, and declared that if any Chriſtians knew what belonged to mining, he would ſet them
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52536:19"/>
to work; and if they took the Town, they ſhould have their Liberty; ſo four Engliſh Men undertook the Work, the <hi>Moors</hi> digged, and they gave Directions. The Mines being finiſhed, and 30 Barrels of Engliſh Powder row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into the Mine, and a Train laid; the Chriſtian that fired it was blown up: and a Breach was made in the Caſtle-Wall, but they could not enter, their Enemies fired ſo thick upon thm, killing a great many of <hi>Mully Iſhmaell</hi> the Emperor's Men. They mined again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Burges,</hi> or ſmall Forts: after Powder was put in, and a Train laid, he that gave fire to it, had his Arm ſtruck off, the <hi>Burg</hi> was blown up with the People thein. And the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Mully Iſhmaell</hi> coming to view the Breach, and being told
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52536:20"/>
by the People, the Chriſtian had loſt his Arm, he ordered his chiefeſt Doctor to take care and heal him; for in caſe he did not ſee to him carefully, he ſhould loſe his Head. <hi>Mully Hammet</hi> got up his People to the Breach, and kept out the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and his Forces, that they could not enter. Afterwards <hi>Mully Hammet</hi> went out of his Caſtle with a ſmall Guard, and meeting with ſome of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's Scouts, one of them knowing <hi>Mully Hammet,</hi> cock'd his Piece and ſhot him to death: Then <hi>Mully Hammet</hi>'s Guard fought with <hi>Mully Iſhmael</hi>'s Scouts, and there were ſeveral killed on both ſides. Some of <hi>Mully Hammet</hi>'s Guards retired into the Caſtle, and acquainted the chiefeſt of them that were in the Caſtle, that their King
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52536:20"/>
was killed: preſently they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed <hi>Mulle Rann</hi> (being the chiefeſt of the Governours in <hi>Mully Hammet</hi>'s time) to be their King. Which News being carried to the Emperor by his Scouts, he enquired who had killed <hi>Mully Hammet?</hi> they told him one of the Scouts, which he ſent preſently for by a Meſſenger, and bid him acquaint him that he ſhould have a good Reward for killing him; he being brought before the Emperor, expecting a great Reward for ſo doing, after he had examin'd him, he rewarded him with calling of him Dog, and ſaid he ſhould die for killing <hi>Mully Hammet,</hi> and immediately cauſed him to be made faſt to a Mule's Tail, and ſo had him dragged through the Camp, and ordered one to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and declare, that it was for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52536:21"/>
killing of <hi>Mully Hammet</hi>; he was dragged ſo long till his Body was torn in pieces; after that he had him put in a place where the Country People uſed to come into the Camp. <hi>Mully Ran</hi> kept the Caſtle and City, and the Emperor's Forces made more Mines in order to take the City and Caſtle, which being finiſhed, they blew up the Town-Walls, and ſeveral ſmall Forts, with the People in them, and made ſo great a Breach that <hi>Mully Iſhmaell</hi> entred his Men and took both the City and Caſtle, and promiſed the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he would be kind to them: but when he took the Town, he ſecured their Arms, Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and Treaſure, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the People of that place to <hi>Macqueneſs:</hi> and being come down to <hi>Macqueneſs,</hi> he put all
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52536:21"/>
the Chriſtians, and ſeveral hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of the Natives to work there to make a Court, and Houſes for his Women. And coming on a certain time, (as he uſes conſtantly to do) although it rained very faſt, as he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into one of the Houſes, the Maſter-Workman and his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants going to hoiſt up a piece of Timber, the Rope that held it broke, and the Timber fell, with which he ſuddenly retired back, and ſent for the Maſter-Workman in great Paſſion, threatning him for taking no better care: he told him he was as careful as he could be for his Life in doing it, ſaying, it was a Miſchance he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; nevertheleſs he took a Piece out of one of his Boys Hands, and ſhot him to Death, and went among the Chriſtians
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52536:22"/>

raving and tearing as if he would have killed them all, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Negroes and Guard to beat both the <hi>Moors</hi> and the Chriſtians that were at work; which they did with ſuch Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that many of them had their Heads and Arms miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly broken, making his Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings more like a Slaughter-houſe than a place of Work; and at the ſame time ran two of his <hi>Moors</hi> through with his Launce. So that he makes no more to kill a Man at his Pleaſure, than to kill a Dog.</p>
            <p>In a little time after the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was come to <hi>Macqueneſs,</hi> the three Chriſtians that were Miners, deſired their Liberty as he had promiſed: He granted it, and ordered a Letter to the Governour of <hi>Sally,</hi> that he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52536:23"/>
ſhould ſend them away by the firſt opportunity; a Ship being ready, they deſired their Liberty, being at <hi>Sally,</hi> in order for their Journey; but the Governour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of granting it, abuſed and railed on them, ſaying, they ſhould pay him ſo much a Head, or they ſhould not go. The Engliſh Man that loſt his Arm, turned back and acquainted the Emperor thereof, telling him what the Governour ſaid, who wrote a Letter and ſent him with two of his chief Negroes, ſaying, If he would not let them go off, he would cut off his Head: The Governour hearing that, durſt not detain them any longer. So the three Engliſh Men, whoſe Names were <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Chalender, Robert Jackſon,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin Newman,</hi> through the Goodneſs of God arrived at
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52536:24"/>
               <hi>London,</hi> and came again to their own Country.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1683, Captain <hi>Venetia</hi> the younger, a Pirate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Sally,</hi> met with one Mr. <hi>Bellamy,</hi> an Engliſh-Man, who was bound for <hi>Leghorn</hi> in a Pink of 8 Guns, to whom he gave Chaſe: and when he came up to Mr. <hi>Bellamy,</hi> the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate examined him from whence he came? he anſwered, From <hi>London</hi>; and enquired likewiſe of him whither he was bound? who ſaid, To <hi>Leghorn.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy</hi> asked him from whence he came, and what Place he belonged to? he ſaid, To <hi>Algier.</hi> The Pirate commanded <hi>Bellamy</hi> to hoiſt out his Boat, and bring his Paſs aboard, who anſwered, he ſhould hoiſt out his own if he had any buſineſs with him,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52536:24"/>
which he did, and ſent his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant aboard on <hi>Bellamy.</hi> One of Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi>'s Men that had been a Captive in <hi>Sally,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid Pirate, told the Maſter he knew him very well, and that he belonged to <hi>Sally.</hi> When the Lieutenant came to <hi>Bellamy</hi>'s ſide, Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi> placed ſome of his Men with their ſmall Arms at the entring, and ſaid, one Man ſhould not enter him ſave the Lieutenant, who viewed Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi>'s Paſs, acknowledging it to be good. The Lieutenant returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board their own Ship, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Captain, ſaying, We'll fire at them and afright them; in order to which, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to make ready; the Pirate firing at Mr. <hi>Bellamy,</hi> he fired at them again, ſo they fought a conſiderable time:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52536:25"/>
Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi> killed and wounded about thirty of his Men, and he wounded ſome of <hi>Bellamy</hi>'s Men: but for want of Powder Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi> was forced to yield. When <hi>Venetia</hi> had taken him and his Company, and brought them aboard his own Ship, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeveral of his own Men in their ſtead, he began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi> why he had killed and wounded ſo many of his Men? Who anſwered, he would have killed all the reſt, and him too, if he had had Powder; with that the Pirate cut him down with his Cutlaſs, and rip'd him open, and ſaid, there was an end of a Dog, ſo threw his murdered Body into the Sea, and carried all his Men into <hi>Sally,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Macqueneſs.</hi> Thus have theſe bloody Heatheniſh Crew de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52536:25"/>
many of our Country-men, telling them they belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Algier,</hi> when they belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Sally.</hi> I pray God keep all my Country-men, and all good Chriſtians out of the Hands of that barbarous and inhuman Crew, the worſt that live upon the Earth! and that all may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of them, hath cauſed me thus to write; being one that by ſad Experience, and from a certain Knowledg I have had of them, can aſſure theſe things to be nothing but a real Truth; and bleſs God, that he has thought me worthy to eſcape them, and that I am now come ſafe to the Land of my Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1685, a Ship being bound from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> in which were four
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52536:26"/>
Women, two of them being Mother and Daughter; one of thoſe Heatheniſh Pirates meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, gave them Chaſe, and coming up to them, examined them ſtrictly from whence they came, and whither bound? who told them as afore, From <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to <hi>Barbadoes</hi>; (the Pirate was <hi>Venetia</hi> the younger, who had 300 Men, and 18 Guns) after the Commander had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the ſame of them, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood what they were, they telling him, that they came from <hi>Algier</hi>; ſo they demanded of him to ſhew his Paſs, and ſaid he muſt hoiſt out his Boat; they ſeeing him not provided with Guns to defend himſelf, could make no Reſiſtance, which being done, the Captain of the Pirate took them into his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, and would ſhew himſelf
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52536:26"/>
kind to them, treating them, and giving them Dates. In the mean while the Lieutenant and <hi>Moors</hi> girded their Piſtols and Cutlaſſes on their Waſtes, and with the Engliſh-man's Boat went aboard his Ship, and took all that were aboard him, with the four Women. And the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain asked who the young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was, and whether ſhe was ever married? Account being given him concerning her, he ordered her to be put in the Cabin, leſt any of his own barbarous Crew ſhould offer to lie with her, and ſo ſailed away for <hi>Sally.</hi> Being come there, the Captain of the Pirate brought them they had taken to <hi>Macque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and the Women were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before the Eunuchs. The Captain giving an account to the chief Eunuch, that one of

thoſe Women was a Virgin; but for the Men, they were driven by the Negroes to hard Labour. And afterwards all the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of the Ship and the 4 Women were brought up to <hi>Macqueneſs</hi>; the Women were brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperor's Eunuchs, and an account given to the Chief of them by the <hi>Moors</hi> Captain, that one of them was a Virgin, and ſhe was immediately ſent to the Emperor's Women: and the Eunuch ſent to the Vice-Roy, acquainting him how he had diſpoſed of the Virgin, who ordered the other Women to be brought to his Houſe, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Negroes to drive the poor Chriſtians to hard Labour, who at Night were lock'd up amongſt the other Chriſtian Captives, having no Suſtenance allowed them for that day; and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52536:27"/>
what their poor Brethren offered them, they could not eat, being ſuch Bread as I have already deſcribed, ſo bad, that the Beaſts in that place refuſed to eat it: and what betwixt their Diet and Lodging on the cold ground, together with the Negroes hard Uſage, many of them fell ſick. And to add to their Extremity, were threatned and abuſed by the Negroes to turn <hi>Moors</hi>; but they daily prayed to God to ſtrengthen them in their Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in his great Mercy work ſome way for their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of this dreadful Bondage.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the chief Eunuch ſent word to the Emperor, that he had a Chriſtian Virgin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt of his Women. The Emperor ordered him to ſend her up to the Camp, with
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52536:28"/>
a parcel of his Eunuchs to guard her thither. When ſhe came to the Camp, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror urged her, tempting her with Promiſes of great Rewards if ſhe would turn <hi>Moor,</hi> and lie with him. She earneſtly deſired of the Lord to preſerve and ſtrengthen her to reſiſt his earneſt Perſwaſions, and great Proffers, which he uſed, to have his Deſires fulfilled. When he could not prevail ſo, he fell to threatning her, and put her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Negro Women, and threatned to kill them if they offered to ſhew her any Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where they kept her, beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and abuſing her for ſeveral days. She prayed ſtill to the Lord to ſtrengthen her, and held a Reſolution to withſtand him; who again ſought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with her, tempting and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52536:28"/>
promiſing of her great things, if ſhe would turn, which ſhe ſtill refuſed: ſo he cauſed her to be ſtript, and whipt by his Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs with ſmall Cords, ſo long till ſhe lay for dead; and he cauſed her to be carried away out of his Preſence that time, and charged his Women none of them ſhould help her till he ſent for her, which was not till two days after, and in the mean time to have no Suſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance but that black rotten Bread: at which time he ſought again to prevail with Promiſes and Threats, which ſhe ſtill withſtood, praying to the Lord that ſhe might be preſerved from him, and be delivered from his cruel Hands. Then he prick'd her with ſuch things, as commonly his Women uſe inſtead of Pins, being as ſharp.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52536:29"/>
Thus this beaſtly and inhuman Wretch by all ways he could invent, ſought to force her to yield, which ſhe reſiſted ſo long, till Tortures, and the hazards of her Life forced her to yield, or reſign her Body to him, tho her Heart was otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined. So he had her waſh'd, and clothed her in their faſhion of Apparel, and lay with her; having his Deſire fulfilled, he inhumanly, in great haſte forc'd her away out of his Preſence; and ſhe being with Child, he ſent her by his Eunuchs to <hi>Macqueneſs</hi> (who delivered her with the Emperor's Charge concerning her) to the chief Eunuch, and after that ſhe was delivered of two Children.</p>
            <p>About four Years ago, two Engliſh-men and a French-man
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52536:29"/>
being at <hi>Memora</hi>; and as they were paſſing along the River, on a certain time in a Boat, with ſome <hi>Moors,</hi> one of which was a Lieutenant, he ordered the Chriſtians to go on Shore to fetch a little of their black Rusk and Water: And as they were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing along the River to take their Pleaſure, the Chriſtians ſaid one to another, Now is the time, with the Lord's leave, for us to ſee for our Liberty: The French-man ſaid, The <hi>Moors</hi> would be too many for them: The Engliſh-men ſaid, Fear not, let us truſt in the Lord, and he'll deliver us. So they going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board with their Bread and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Lieutenant bid them get out their Oars, and pull up like Dogs as they were; which they bore patiently. At Night ſome of the <hi>Moors</hi> lying down, they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52536:30"/>
fell upon thoſe <hi>Moors</hi> that were awake. They then fearing the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> would be too hard for them, called out, and awaked the other <hi>Moors.</hi> Then the Lieutenant and other <hi>Moors</hi> came, and he drew his Knife, and ſtabb'd one of the <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> to death, the other knock'd him down, and they fought ſo long till Blood was ſpilt on both ſides. The next day the <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> and <hi>French-man</hi> were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up to <hi>Macqueneſs</hi> in Irons, before the Emperor, and by the <hi>Moors</hi> was informed of what was done. The Emperor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Examination, told them if they did not immediately turn <hi>Moors,</hi> he would kill them. The <hi>French-man</hi> yielded: the Emperor then threatned the <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> if he did not turn, he would quickly kill him. He
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52536:30"/>
made Anſwer, God's Power was greater than the Devil's; and let him do what he would, he ſhould not make him turn <hi>Moor.</hi> The Emperor called for his Sword, and immediately fell to cutting him, threatning him ſtill to turn; he ſaid he was brought up in the Faith of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and he would not forſake it. Then this inhuman Wretch in great ſpleen cut him till he fell down, and hack'd and hewed him as if he had been butchering an Ox, and cauſed the Negro Boys to run his Body full of Holes with Knives, till his Body was as full of Holes as poſſible it could be; when he had ſo done, Bring, ſaith he in his own Language, four Engliſh Dogs to fetch that Dog away: and as they carried his Body away, the Negro Boys
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52536:31"/>
ſtoned them, ſaying, that ſhould be the end of them if they did not turn <hi>Moors</hi>; but they were glad to go quietly without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering again; if they had made any Reply, they had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly been fallen upon by the Negro Boys. So their greateſt Satisfaction was, his dying in the Chriſtian Faith, and his counting that more precious than his own Life, holding the ſame ſtedfaſt before that cruel Tyrant, whilſt he had Breath in his Body. Then they carried him to the place where they lodged under ground, ſo took off his Irons and kept him there all Night, and the next Morning carried him where he was to be buried, the Negroes ſtill ſtoning of them as they went along. As ſoon as they had laid his Body in the Ground,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52536:31"/>
they were hurried by the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes to work again after their uſual manner.</p>
            <p>The Tyrant coming a certain time to view his Work, exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what was the reaſon they went no faſter on? They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Several of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were fallen ſick: So this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human Tyrant went to the place where they lay, which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ground (acting the part of <hi>Herod,</hi> in killing at his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as well as of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who of old encreaſed the Iſraelites Bondage, in cauſing them to make Brick, and allowing them no Straw. But we read of the End of thoſe cruel Tyrants.) So by the Emperor's Order his Negroes fell to haling and drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them out of that place, when in that weak and feeble condition that they could not
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52536:32"/>
ſtand on their Legs when drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged before him; he inſtantly killed ſeven of them, making their Reſting-place a Slaughter-houſe. The very <hi>Moors</hi> were terrified to ſee ſo inhuman and bloody an Action. It is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>The more Rain, the more Reſt:</hi> but God knows it was moſt commonly our Lot to be driven and kept cloſeſt at our Work when it rained; yea, when it rained moſt faſt, our Work was nothing leſſened, but the more encreaſed: and beſides the Chriſtians, he ſets thouſands of his own Natives to work with great Chops, and to carry Earth on their Heads in Baskets from one place to another. And let it rain never ſo faſt, (there falling ſtore of Rains in the Winter Seaſon) he'll ſtay by them, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Negroes to drive them
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52536:32"/>
with Whips of ſmall Cords and Sticks from Morning till Night; and if he's minded to eat, he often ſends home to his Caſtle, and hath his Victuals ſent him, leſt the Slaves ſhould neglect his Work.</p>
            <p>He hath great Buildings in his Caſtle, which will not be finiſhed in his time, and there he keeps the poor People at work, in order to ſuppreſs and keep them low.</p>
            <p>His ſmall Forts at his Caſtle are more for a ſhow of great Strength, to make his Enemies afraid, than for any uſe he puts them to, making them into Store-houſes, and turning them to ſuch-like uſes.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1688, the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant coming out one time to ſee his Works, as conſtantly he did,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52536:33"/>
a ſort of ſtuff they uſed inſtead of Mortar, being Earth, Lime and Sand mixed together, to build their Walls with; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up a handful thereof, he did not like it: upon which he ſent his Negroes to fetch the Maſter-Workman to him, which being haled by the Neck before him, he asked why more Lime was not mixt with the Earth? he made anſwer he wanted Lime, and that was the reaſon the Stuff was no better: he ſent for the Shack of the Negroes and Chriſtians that were at work, examining him after the ſame manner? who ſaid he wanted Mules to bring them Lime: he then ſent for the Mules to ſee how many there were, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of his number, which the Negro ſaid he had at his Houſe, and was lame, he ordered his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52536:33"/>
Boys to keep him faſt, while he ſent ſome of the reſt to enquire whether the Negro ſaid true? but they finding not the Mule that was wanting, he ordered the Negro, immediately to be ſtript unto his Drawers, and faſtened to a Mule's Tail, which was done, and he was dragg'd ſo the ſpace of half a Mile to Priſon, there to remain; and had the Maſter-Workman ſtretch'd out by four Negroes, two at his Hands and two at his Feet, beating of him till he could not turn himſelf, bidding him take care of his Mules, ſaying, if when he came again he found ſuch bad ſtuff for his Work, he would cut off his Head. So immediately he ſent his Negro Boys to fetch the ſeventy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that were at hard Labour making a Wall; ſo asked one
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52536:34"/>
of them if he could ſpeak his Language? who ſaid he could, examining him in like manner about the Stuff? who anſwered, he durſt not for fear acquaint him of the Badneſs of it: ſo he took one of his Sticks they uſed to carry after him, and calling him Dog, bid him hold his Head fare to ſtrike at: having ſtrucken him down, he knocked down all the reſt with his own Hands, and broke their Heads ſo miſerably, that the place was all bloody like a But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher's Stall, and none of them durſt make Reſiſtance, for if they had, he would preſently have killed them. So he bid them riſe like Dogs as they were, ſaying, if they uſed any more ſuch bad Stuff in his Work, he would kill them all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:52536:34"/>In 1689, the Emperor ſent down to the Coyde, or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Tangier,</hi> to take a view of <hi>Alarache,</hi> where was a Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon belonging to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Governour taking view thereof, he ſent him far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Orders to prepare for the taking it, if he could poſſibly. So ſending back to the Emperor to provide him Forces, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror ſent him down 40000 Horſe and Foot, beſides the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he had there: And he laying Siege to the Place, the Spaniſh Boats fetch'd off the Officers Wives and Children. They af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards raiſed a ſmall Fort, to keep all ſmall Veſſels or Boats from fetching any Thing off. Which the Friars taking notice of, hoiſted up a Flag of Truce; and came to a Treaty with the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52536:35"/>
Governour of the <hi>Moors,</hi> till they had been with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror at <hi>Macqueneſs.</hi> When come thither, they told him, that if he would let them go, and take what was their own with them, they would give him the Place, with the Chriſtians, and all the Ammunition and Guns. To which he agreed, ſaying, He would. They returning again to <hi>Alarach,</hi> ordered the Governour of the <hi>Moors</hi> to make a Feaſt; and going to their own Gariſon, told their own Governour, that they had made an Agreement with the Emperor, and that they ſhould march into <hi>Ceuta</hi> in their own Arms, ſaying, They had better do ſo, than go into Slavery amongſt the Chriſtians. The Governour, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> dining together: When Dinner
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52536:35"/>
was over, he bid him ſend for his Men, and ſend them with all ſpeed to <hi>Ceuta.</hi> They being come, he commanded them to lay down their Arms; which he, (to wit, the <hi>Moors</hi> Governour) quickly ſecured, telling them, they muſt go up to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror at <hi>Macqueneſs,</hi> for he had a mind to ſee them, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they muſt return to <hi>Ceuta.</hi> So the <hi>Moors</hi> took the great Guns, with their Carriages, Muskets and Powder, carrying them all to the Emperor, with a Band of Men to guard them thither. Being come thither, he ſet his Negroes to drive them to work; ordering the great Guns to be unmounted, and laid flat on the Ground betwixt the two Walls, with thoſe Guns that were brought from <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi> So the Negroes kept them
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52536:36"/>
at hard Slavery, beating and whipping them all day long; and at Night they were to lodg under-ground; allowing them ſuch Bread as his other poor Captives have, and Water to ſuſtain them alive.</p>
            <p>After the poor Chriſtians had undergone their hard Labour and cruel Stripes, for the ſpace of five Months time, many of them fell ſick and died: then this Tyrant came and enquired, what was become of them? they gave him account, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred of them were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Moors,</hi> and five hundred were dead. After that the poor <hi>Chriſtians</hi> concluded to draw a Petition to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and lay before him their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Condition under this Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Emperor, having but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52536:36"/>
now and then rotten Bread, and Water when they could catch it, and therewith cruelly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to add to their Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Petition; and viewing it, declared to his Council what a Condition his poor Subjects were in under this cruel Tyrant the Emperor of <hi>Morocco.</hi> And the ſaid King took it into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and ſent over an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador to the Emperor, to ſee if he could agree with him for his Subjects that were there in Slavery. The Ambaſſador be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, an Agreement was made betwixt them, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould give a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Moors</hi> for an hundred <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi> And for the Souldiers Wives that were not carried off, and young Children, they agreed for 4 <hi>Moors</hi> a Head. The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52536:37"/>
bargained with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, to have the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> down to <hi>Tittivan,</hi> lying near unto <hi>Tangier,</hi> and there to remain till the <hi>Moors</hi> were brought over, and left at <hi>Ceuta,</hi> a Place not far from thence. After which the Ambaſſador returned home to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> acquainting his Maſter what a miſerable Condition his poor Subjects were in, working from Morning to Night, allowing them nothing but old rotten Barley-bread and Water; not ſuffering them to have any thing to lie upon, after their hard Labour and cruel U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage by the <hi>Moors,</hi> nor no Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel to wear, but daily beating them, and often with his own Hands, to force them to turn <hi>Moors.</hi> The King of <hi>Spain</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Ambaſſador to take as many <hi>Moors</hi> as he had agreed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52536:37"/>
for: So he went and got the <hi>Moors</hi> together, and went over to <hi>Ceuta</hi> with them; when being come thither, he went to <hi>Tittivan</hi>; and leaving the <hi>Moors</hi> in <hi>Ceuta,</hi> he ſpoke to their Governor, told him the <hi>Moors</hi> were ready at <hi>Ceuta,</hi> and that as many <hi>Chriſtians</hi> as he was pleaſed to ſend to <hi>Ceuta,</hi> there ſhould be ſo many <hi>Moors</hi> ſurrendred as they had agreed for. When the <hi>Moors</hi> were all deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up, and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> brought in; The <hi>Moors</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour brought them up to <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queneſs</hi> to the Emperor; the Emperor enquired of them how they had fared in Chriſtendom? They anſwered, they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them a Jacket and a pair of Breaches once a Year; and for their Proviſion, they had a certainty of Rusk, and hot Beans once a Day. But being come
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52536:38"/>
to their own Country, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to lament the Chriſtian Captives poor Condition, ſeeing daily what they endured with Hunger, Cold and Stripes; and many times the Tears fell from their Eyes for Grief to ſee it; ſome of the <hi>Moors</hi> ſaying, We are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> (privately to them) but durſt not publickly own it: And at another time told the Captives, (when they ſaw the Emperor's Cruelty, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten murdering one or other at his Pleaſure; and themſelves had nothing allowed them but a little of that rotten Barley-bread, and a little Butter that ſtunk) that they had rather be in <hi>Spain</hi> than there. And ſome of the <hi>Moors</hi> got back again into <hi>Spain,</hi> acquainting the People there what a cruel Tyrant their Emperor was, and how miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52536:38"/>
he uſed the poor Chriſtians. And when the Spaniſh Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador returned with the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> into their own Country, the King asked them how they had fared? Who gave a large Account, as aforeſaid, of the hard Bondage and Slavery the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of <hi>Morocco</hi> had kept them in whilſt they were under him. The King ſaid, it was well they had kept their Faith, as they had done, whilſt there. And his Ambaſſador drew a Petition to the King his Maſter, imploring his Favour to remember them that were left behind, and take their ſuffering Condition into his Chriſtian Conſideration; which he did, and ordered them ſome Relief. Thoſe that were left behind, likewiſe petitioned him to allow them ſomething Yearly: Which was done, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52536:39"/>
care taken that it ſhould be ſent over for their Uſe: As likewiſe our Factories at <hi>Cales</hi> and <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> having enquired how it was with them; and underſtood the Engliſh fared no better than the reſt, contributed towards their Neceſſities, and ſent it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from <hi>Cales</hi> to <hi>Tittivan,</hi> to one Mr. <hi>Anthony Packer</hi> a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant there, deſiring him to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it them for their Relief: Who accordingly did, and they therewith bought them a few Clothes to cover their Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. So they wrote back to Mr. <hi>Anthony Packer,</hi> and to the Factories, returning them Thanks for their Kindneſs in remembring them, praying to God to proſper them in their Affairs. And I beſeech God to open the Hearts of our Gracious King and Queen of <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:52536:39"/>
as he hath done others, to grant ſome Relief for their diſtreſſed Subjects that are yet in that place, whoſe cruel Sufferings I could do no leſs than acquaint them with, being when I left them, in as poor a condition as ever.</p>
            <p>The poor Chriſtian Captives that are taken by any of thoſe Helliſh Pirates belonging to the Emperor of <hi>Morocco,</hi> are brought up to <hi>Macqueneſs,</hi> being kept at hard Work from Day-light in the Morning till Night, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Earth on their Heads in great Baskets, driven to and fro with thoſe barbarous Negroes by the Emperor's Order: and when they are drove home by the Negroes at Night to their Lodging, which is on the cold Ground, in a Vault or hollow
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52536:40"/>
place in the Earth, laid over with great Beams a-thwart, and Iron Bars over them, they are told in there like Sheep, and out in the Morning; and if any be wanting, he quickly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures the Negroes, and ſends out a parcel of his Guard to look for them. Their Food is Bread made of old rotten Barley, and their Drink Water when they can get it: Many times when they are hurried to their Work in a Morning, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether they ſhall be able to undergo their Afflictions till Night: and when they are drove home, expecting Reſt, the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſends ſome of his Negroes to hurry them again to work, either to hale down Walls, cut Gates, or the like, keeping them both Night and Day many times without either Bread or Water,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52536:40"/>
which is all their Suſtenance: when they have done that, the Negroes dare not to drive them home before he gives order, leſt they be killed for ſo doing; when they have his Order, they drive them home, tell them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ſo lock them up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Day-light in the Morning. And in this Captivity I have been, with the reſt of my poor Country-men for the ſpace of Ten Years, being ſo long ſince taken; but now, through the Mercies of God, I am come to ſee my Native Country, and cannot but condole their Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries I have left behind under that cruel Tyrant the Emperor of <hi>Morocco</hi>; beſeeching Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, that none of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men may ever come to have a ſhare under that hard Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter. There are three hundred
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52536:41"/>
and forty <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> Subjects of our Gracious King, in this ſore Captivity.</p>
            <p>This Emperor, as I have been informed, touching his Birth or Deſcent, was begotten of a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro Woman by a white Man, one of the nobleſt of their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in that time, and is a <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latto</hi> by his Colour; but when he's in a Paſſion, he looks juſt as he is, as black as an Infernal Imp; which his Natives take notice of, and can tell when he's angry. For his Apparel, he wears a fine Holland Shirt, with Sleeves ſo large that will make any ordinary Man a pair of Drawers, beſides a large pair of Drawers of the ſame, with Breeches over them, and next to his Shirt a Garment of as fine Stuff as can be had, made of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52536:41"/>
the faſhion of a Waſtcoat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sleeves, and over that a Coat of as fine Cloth as can be bought, made almoſt of our faſhion; he wears over that a ſort of Garment which they call a <hi>Shilham,</hi> or <hi>Barnooſe,</hi> but we may call it a ſhort Cloak, being wrought all over with Silver and Gold, with a Cap to go over his Head, having at the top of it a great Bob with a Fringe, and at the bottom a great Fringe all round it: on the lower part from his Breaſt it is open, and the upper part made faſt; and over that in cold Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he wears a Cloak, with a Cap to put over his Head: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Head he wears ſometimes a Turbet (as they call it) made of Silk; and when it is hot Weather, he wears a Garment made of a ſort of Stuff like
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52536:42"/>
fine Crape, and a Hat; and on his Legs he wears fine red Boots, but different from our Faſhion: he's oftner on Horſe-back than on Foot; his Guard, which are of different Stature, wear ſome of them Shoes, and have over their Shirts and Drawers only Cloaks with Caps, ſome light coloured, and ſome dark: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he has an hundred follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and at other times fifty, and ſometimes more, he having thirty thouſand Negroes of his own Slaves.</p>
            <p>Every one of his black Guard have a Piece, and he has three or four Launces carried after him, and ſeveral Pieces ready charged, to kill with at his Pleaſure ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Chriſtians or his own Natives. When he falls out with his Guard, he ſtrips and takes their Clothes, from them
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52536:42"/>
and puts them in Irons, and ſets them to work. He ſeldom returns home after his going out in a Morning, without killing one or other before he returns, by running of them through with his Launce, ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, or dragging them at a Mule's Tail, either Men or Women, ſeldom repenting for what he has done; <hi>Mahomet</hi> their great Prophet poſſeſſing them with a Belief, that if he kills any one, he merits Heaven by ſo doing; but if any Perſon ſhould kill him, he cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void going to Hell. He has Water carried after him by a Boy, which he drinks, to make the People believe he drinks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe; and likewiſe hath ſhort Sticks carried after him daily, to beat the poor Slaves at his Pleaſure, which is hourly,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52536:43"/>
to vex and puniſh them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in nothing more.</p>
            <p>He was firſt made a <hi>Coyde</hi> or Governour of ſome part of the Country, and by his Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Affability to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he gained Reſpect from them in that Country. <hi>Mully Sheade</hi> being then King, and living in the City of <hi>Fez,</hi> there died; and the Inhabitants there being all <hi>Whites,</hi> and he a <hi>Molla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> they cried up <hi>Mully Hammet. Mully Iſhmael</hi> being then beloved of his own People, he raiſed a ſmall Army, and went againſt the ſaid City and won it: having conquered <hi>Fez,</hi> he ſtill ſtrove to oblige the People; and one <hi>Guillan</hi> raiſed a ſmall Army, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom <hi>Mully Iſhmael</hi> went. <hi>Guillan</hi> being a great Friend to our Nation, the Governour of <hi>Tangier</hi> offered him Aſſiſtance
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52536:43"/>
if he was pleaſed to accept it: he returned him Thanks, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it was bad enough for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his own Army to be conquered, and it would be worſe for the Chriſtians if they ſhould go with him; but engaging himſelf, <hi>Mully Iſhmael</hi> conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and his People carried his Head up to <hi>Macqueneſs.</hi> When I was there, the Emperor kept two of <hi>Guillan</hi>'s Sons in his Caſtle, and had them at School amongſt his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, becauſe of their Father's Courage and Stoutneſs.</p>
            <p>Our Engliſh Governour was concerned at the loſs of <hi>Guillan</hi> and his People. When the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror had won moſt of his Country, and conquered <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radant,</hi> he ſoon after came to <hi>Macqueneſs,</hi> and ordered all his Baſhaws or Governours to build
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52536:44"/>
Walls and great Houſes upon their own Charge, on pain of loſing their Lives. Some finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Houſes, and ſome could not, having not wherewith to do it, being brought ſo low, he cauſing it to be ſo, that they might not rebel againſt his chief Son called <hi>Mully Sedan,</hi> for whom he hath the greateſt Eſteem above all his Sons, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he may ſucceed after his Deceaſe: but I hope in God, and wiſh it may never be, for the young Tyrant imitates his Father too much in cutting and killing the Slaves as bad as he almoſt, that the People begin to dread him as well as the old one.</p>
            <p>The Emperor's Caſtle hath four Gates belonging to it. The City of <hi>Macqueneſs</hi> is an old decay'd place, the Caſtle ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52536:44"/>
diſtant from it, and walled in ſome places double, and has a few old Iron Guns mounted upon them: For the Braſs Guns that were taken from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he's afraid to leave them with any of his Governours, leſt they riſe againſt him, and had them brought up to <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queneſs,</hi> plac'd within the Caſtle Gates betwixt two Walls flat upon the Ground. The Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings within the Walls are very high, and ſeveral ſmall Forts round the Caſtle-Walls. And lately he ſet the People to build two new Towns, (with which to plague his Country People, to bring them as low as he can) which I think will never be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in his time; and if he did it on his own Coſt and Charge, he would not have ſo many Buildings. When Taxes
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52536:45"/>
are brought him in, he treaſures it up, taking but little out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>The common Diet the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror uſes to eat, is made like a kind of Grain; they call it <hi>Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ozoo,</hi> being boiled and mixed with their Butter, which is far more loathſome and ſtrong to us than our Butter in <hi>England</hi>; being put into Platters, they put thereon Mutton cut in ſmall pieces: So he ſits down, and thruſting his Hand into it, he ſhakes it a little to and fro, crambing it in his Mouth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When he has done, he calls his Negroes to take what's leſt to eat while he ſtands over them, and they are in great fear left he kill them; which he certainly would do, if one ſhould eat more than another. Their Drink is commonly Water; 'tis
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52536:45"/>
ſaid, he'l drink Wine; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he makes invalid the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of their great Prophet <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> who told the People, It was a great Sin to do it; yea, and he'l often be drunk too, (to the ſorrow of his poor Slaves); though if any of the reſt, if it be the greateſt among them, be found in the like Caſe, if he comes to the knowledg of it, he'l kill them. His Guards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him are made up of Negro Boys, of fourteen, ſixteen, or eighteen Years old. If he calls for the greateſt Man in his Country about the leaſt Crime, they preſently run like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hounds; and they come Collering of him, as if he were a Bullock to be ſlaughtered: When he's hal'd ſo before the Emperor, he either kills him, or he's beaten, or put in Irons,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52536:46"/>
and thrown into Priſon; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner he governs his own People.</p>
            <p>When he had Buſineſs with our Nation, and asked Advice of the Chief of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, none durſt ſay his Concerns would go Well or Ill, for fear he would diſlike what they ſaid, although he would often require them to do it: So he firſt gives his own Judgment of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and they ſay as he does. He is ſeldom true to his Word, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cheated moſt Kings and Princes that have had any thing to do with him; as in the Caſe of the <hi>Algerines,</hi> who made him pay dearly for it.</p>
            <p>Whilſt I was there, he made Peace with <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>France</hi>; but ſoon broke it, taking ſince that time ſeveral Dutch and French Ships, making Slaves of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52536:46"/>
their Subjects. If he ſwears one thing to Day, he'l ſwear quite another on the Morrow. Yet he did not out-wit (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Falſhood and Treachery) the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Ambaſſador, who ſurrendred not one of the <hi>Moors,</hi> till the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were got into the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Gariſon.</p>
            <p>If any Chriſtian King or Prince ſends an Ambaſſadour to this Emperor, (as in my Time there have been from <hi>England, Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi>) when they come thither, he makes them wait a conſiderable time: And he's ſo high in his own Conceit, that except they be Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, he regards them not; and when they come before him, he'l be either in his Stable, or on Horſeback, or ſitting on an heap of Earth, and ſo ſpeaks
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52536:47"/>
to them by an Interpreter, (and he will not allow a Penny to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Charges, nor any Place to lodg in, be they who they will) and ſo ſends for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the White-men, being Baſhaws or Governours, the chiefeſt of his Country, who dare not for their Lives be Judges to ſpeak otherwiſe than what he ſays firſt, for fear of him.</p>
            <p>About twelve Years ſince, he ſent an Ambaſſadour over to our late King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, to Congratulate his Majeſty, and Treat with him for Peace, or the like; and in the mean time ſent out his Pirats to take our Engliſh Ships. Our King not thinking him to be ſo falſe, ſent him a Preſent over by <hi>Hammet Benhado</hi> the Emperor's Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador; who is now as bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous to the poor <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52536:47"/>
any belonging to the Emperor. He never goes to reſt, but when dead Sleep overcomes him, and make him ſo drowſy, that he can't hold up his Head; and as he goes to reſt, he often kills one or other of his Negroes, at home as well as abroad. Then in one of his Rooms in the Caſtle, he lies down on a kind of Quilt on the Ground; and ſleeping that Night, he riſes early in the Morning, and falls to his old Tyrannous and Inhumane Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, domineering over his poor Slaves, and ſets the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes to whip, ſtone and beat them, to work harder than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times it's poſſible for them to think they can hold out or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure till Night. The poor Chriſtians, the Engliſh Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, daily praying to God, if it be his Will, to ſupport them
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52536:48"/>
in this diſtreſſed Condition, and to keep them and deliver them from under this miſerable Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion they are under, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Hands of that bloody Tyrant: And when they think of their Native Country, and the Government thereof, they cannot but greatly lament their own Condition, erecting their Prayers to Heaven for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their own King and Country; and that God would be pleaſed to open their Hearts to remember them in this ſad and deplorable Condition. Thus bemoaning one another, they commit their Caſe to him, who is the wiſe Diſpoſer and Orderer of all things, without whoſe Permiſſion nothing can be acted or done, who can in his due Time grant them Relief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:52536:48"/>On Fridays the Emperor goes to his Place of Worſhip, having firſt viewed his Slaves, being of ſeveral ſorts, both <hi>Chriſtians, Negroes,</hi> and a ſort of People called <hi>Brabboes</hi>; the laſt ſort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Natives of the Country, which he ſuppreſſeth ſo much, that they are not able to pay him Taxes, keeping them at as hard Slavery as the reſt. If he kills none in the Morning before he goes to Worſhip, they dread him for fear he will at his return: he rides thither and back again, going about Eleven of the Clock, and returns about One, againſt which time the poor Slaves order one or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to watch, and are in as great fear when they ſee him as if they muſt all be deſtroyed; and they all work more hard that day than all the reſt of the Week.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52536:49"/>
He killed ſeven and twenty <hi>Moors</hi> on one day; but there's none can tell the ſeveral thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of poor Souls this unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Tyrant hath ſlain ſince his Reign, which is now about two and twenty Years.</p>
            <p>For his Women I think he knows not the number of them, he hath ſo many, both <hi>Whites, Blacks, Mollatoes,</hi> and <hi>Copper-colour'd</hi>; and for Apparel they have a piece of Silk of a Red or Yellow Colour, which they wear over their Heads. They wear Shifts or Smocks made of fine Linnen, big enough to make two Shifts, and fine Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that will reach down to their Heels, which are open or ſlit in the middle; and their upper Garment is fine Flannel, and a Silk Girdle about their middle upon each of their Breaſts they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52536:49"/>
wear Silver or Gold Pins, with which they faſten their upper Garment; and upon the Wriſts of their Hands they wear on each a Silver Shackle, and likewiſe upon the Small of their Legs; and on their Feet red Slippers. He hath ſtore of Children of ſeveral Colours. He hath built within his Caſtle fine Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings for himſelf to live and lodg in; and for his Women he hath built very fine Houſes, two Courts very ſumptuous; in the bigger of them are ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two Marble Pillars, each at leaſt three foot thick, to ſupport the fine painted Works above; in the middle of the greater Court is a Marble Ciſtern with curious Spring-Water, which ſprings or boils up in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle thereof, and comes from a Fountain about two Miles from
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52536:50"/>
the Caſtle. If he deſires to lie with any of his Women, he ſends an Eunuch to fetch whom he pleaſes: ſhe being come, he lies with her, after that he bids her begone; being as inhumane in this as in the reſt of his Actions; and away ſhe goes, leſt he kill her. He allows his Women a quantity of Flower, and ſends his Eunuchs to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it them out; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times goes to look over them himſelf, leſt his Eunuchs cheat him. One of his Women came to him carrying a young Child in her Arms, deſiring him to allow her a little more Flower and Butter; he bid her ſtay a while, and ſhe ſhould have it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then he called for ſome of his Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs, and killed her, and cauſed them to pull the young Child in pieces Limb from Limb.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:52536:50"/>It's his Pleaſure ſometimes to ſhew his Women his fine Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: before he goes, he ſends his Eunuchs to drive away all the Men out of their ſight, riding with a Lance himſelf before the Women, being two or three hundred following, where he rides in great Pomp, extolling this and the other Work, and admiring the Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereof; but the Women dare not to ſpeak a word other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than as he himſelf doth.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1688, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of <hi>Morocco</hi> ſent a Letter to the <hi>Algerines,</hi> acquainting them that he heard they had a great many Chriſtian Slaves; and ſince he had a great deal of Work to do, if they would ſell him any of them, he would give them 150 Dollars a Head
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52536:51"/>
for five hundred of them, and ſend them away with all ſpeed. They gathered three hundred French Men, and brought them to <hi>Tittivan</hi>; being landed there, the Governour had them to <hi>Macque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to the Emperor, to ſee them, and asked him if he liked them? who anſwered, Yes. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by the Emperor's Order they were driven away by the Negroes in a barbarous manner. The <hi>Algerines</hi> expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Money from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, having waited a long time for Payment, they reſolved at once to demand it from him. When they asked him for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he anſwered, he did not uſe to give Money for Chriſtians that were brought into his Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then they charged him with breach of Promiſe, ſaying, they hoped he would not ſerve them
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52536:51"/>
ſo. He ſaid, if they did not retire out of his Country, he would cut off all their Heads. So they retiring to <hi>Algier</hi> with ſpeed, acquainted the King and his Pateroons how they had ſped with the Emperor, giving Relation of what he ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Chriſtians. The King preſently rais'd an Army of 50000 Men, preparing Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and Field-pieces, who marched through <hi>Trimſind,</hi> a place at or near the Emperor's Dominions, where they entred without Reſiſtance; and as they paſſed along, ſeveral of <hi>Mully Iſhmael</hi>'s People ran to them: <hi>Mully Iſhmael</hi>'s Coydes, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, acquainted him that the <hi>Algerines</hi> were coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: <hi>Mully Iſhmael</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, raiſed an Army of Eighty thouſand Horſe and Foot,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52536:52"/>
and made his Son <hi>Mully Sedan</hi> General thereof. Whilſt his Army was a preparing, the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerines</hi> were got up as far as a Town called <hi>Tezzo,</hi> within two days Journey of <hi>Fez,</hi> where they pitch'd. <hi>Mully Sedan</hi> went againſt them; and being there, the <hi>Algerines</hi> wrote a Letter to <hi>Mully Iſhmael,</hi> acquainting him, that they did not come to fight with his Son, but to have met himſelf in Perſon: he ſent them word back that his Son was able enough for them. Soon after they had received his Letter, they engaged <hi>Mully Sedan</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and ſlew abundance of them. Many of <hi>Mully Sedan</hi>'s People deſerted him, joining with the <hi>Algerines.</hi> Then he ſent with all ſpeed to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror his Father, giving him account what had happened.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52536:52"/>
When <hi>Mully Iſhmael</hi> underſtood that, he gave out, that if any Chriſtians would help, and ſtand by the great Guns, if he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed againſt the <hi>Algerines,</hi> he would give them their Liberty. So eight <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> told him they knew what belonged to the Guns, and they would go with him. So he ordered an hundred <hi>Moors</hi> to aſſiſt them, and to take out ſix great Guns (that they judged might be moſt ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) from the place where they lay betwixt the Walls. They told him they wanted Carriages: He ſent for Carpenters im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, charging them to make Carriages ſtrong and good, and that with all ſpeed, upon pain of loſing their Heads in caſe they neglected. <hi>Mully Sedan</hi> again ſent the Emperor his Father word, that if he did
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52536:53"/>
not haſten to Battel, the <hi>Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi> would be in <hi>Fez</hi> in four days time. <hi>Mully Iſhmael</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, was forced to go with all ſpeed, raiſing what Forces he could, leaving for haſte his Field-pieces behind him. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror being come where his own Army lay, he made Peace with the <hi>Algerines</hi> General, and in order thereto, gave forty eighty Mules laden with Gold, and an Horſe and Furniture worth 200000 Crowns.</p>
            <p>About a Month before I came from <hi>Macqueneſs,</hi> one of our own Nation, namely <hi>Elias Roberts,</hi> being by the ſaid Emperor put to look after a parcel of Sheep, he came himſelf to view them; and telling them over, found three of his number wanting, who thereupon ſent for one of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52536:53"/>
his chief Negroes that kept an account of them, and examined him what was become of them? he replied, the Chriſtian kept, the Key, and lock'd them up every Night, and carried it with him to the place where he went to ſleep under Ground. The Tyrant immediately ſent his Blood-hounded Negroes to fetch the poor Chriſtian, who was not far from them; being come, he asked him what was become of thoſe Sheep that were want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? he made Anſwer, he went home every Night, having firſt faſtned the Door, and that the Negro had a falſe Key to the Door; ſo turning to the Negro, and upon Examination finding him faulty, he preſently ſhot him to Death, running his Launce through his Body in ſeveral places, and threatned the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52536:54"/>
for not acquainting him therewith ſooner, ſaying, if he would not turn <hi>Moor,</hi> he would kill him, as he had done the <hi>Negro,</hi> who lay dead before them. The Chriſtian boldly replied, he was brought up in the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, and he would not turn <hi>Moor,</hi> and that he feared God, whoſe Power was greater than his; ſo the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror fell to cutting him, and afterwards had him very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanly ſtretched out by thoſe bloody Negroes, and beaten till he was left for dead. Then he went away to his Works where Engliſh Captives were, and told them he had killed one of the Dogs their Brother, for taking no better care of his Sheep, calling them Dogs in his own Language, and bidding them fetch that Dog away; five or
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52536:54"/>
ſix of them went and brought the poor Man away, who had been ſo cruelly beaten by the wicked Wretch, his Body was ſo exceedingly bruiſed, he could not ſtir neither hand nor foot; neither could he feed himſelf for ſeveral days, but as we help'd him. Yet through God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he was pretty well recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before my Departure from thence. And thus when the poor Captives are by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful, and rather, as we may term him, inhuman Brute, beaten and killed at his pleaſure, none dare make any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to him; for inſtead of taking any Pity of them, he matters no more to kill a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian than to kill a Dog; and if any of them ſeeks for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from this Tyrant, he's either killed, or ſorely beaten
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52536:55"/>
by either him or his bloody Negroes.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Moor,</hi> one of the Natives of the Country, having Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on me, and ſeeing my ſad Condition that I was kept daily in, which I cannot at large inſert here, came to me, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Language, being Arabick, knowing I could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him; and he asked me if I would go to my Native Country? I replied, Are you in earneſt or not? he anſwered, Yes, and would direct me, and go along with me himſelf to <hi>Marſegan,</hi> a Gariſon belonging to the King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> I told him, if he expected any Reward or Satisfaction from me for his Pains, I had nothing to give him; he ſaid he knew that by my Condition. So I enquired of him where he lived? he anſwered,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52536:55"/>
at a place called <hi>Aſſimore,</hi> which is not far from the Chriſtian Gariſon; and he ſaid, he would truſt to the Benevolence of the Governour of that place, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided I would ſpeak to the ſaid Governour for a Gratuity for him, when we ſhould arrive there: I told him I ſhould be worſe than a Jew, if I did not do that; and they themſelves count the Jews the worſt and falſeſt of all People. Then I asked him in what time we ſhould provide for our Journey? he ſaid, as ſoon as I could find con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient opportunity; and I far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prevailed with him to take in two more Engliſh-men along with us, whoſe Names were <hi>Triſtram Bryan,</hi> born in <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and <hi>Edward Tucker,</hi> who came from <hi>New-England.</hi> And in five days time after we were
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52536:56"/>
fitted with a ſmall quantity of Bread for the Journey, ſuppoſing we might accompliſh our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in ten Nights time, for we muſt of neceſſity hide our ſelves in the Day for fear of being diſcovered; yet we found it difficult enough to perform in two and twenty days, in which time we were put to great Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and Neceſſities on the way. The Particulars are as follow.</p>
            <p>On the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1692, in the Evening, we ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from <hi>Macqueneſs,</hi> and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled as far as we could that Night in great fear of being purſued, with our <hi>Moor</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us in the way, knowing that if they had found us, we had been killed, if not burnt, which would have been the <hi>Moor</hi>'s Lot had we been taken:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52536:56"/>
towards day we had a great River to paſs; when we were got over, we found a ſmall Coppiſe or Wood, where we reſted the Day following, being the 27<hi>th.</hi> In the Evening when the Sun was ſet, our Guide was forward to be going, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how the Event would prove, and I had much ado to perſwade him from going before 'twas dark. When we came into the Road out of the Wood we met ten <hi>Moors,</hi> and Mules and Aſſes laden with Goods for the Emperor, being Iron, which they had taken from one <hi>Savage</hi> an Engliſh Maſter that came from <hi>Bilboa</hi>; ſo we followed our Guide the <hi>Moor,</hi> who gave them the time of the Night, and they him likewiſe; and ſo we paſſed that time without any further trouble, they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52536:57"/>
us to be <hi>Moors,</hi> being we had on their ſort of Apparel. So we travelled that Night, making what haſte we could, and ſtill in great fear, leſt we ſhould have been diſcovered by the <hi>Moors:</hi> when we reſted, it was towards Day, in ſome Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles or Buſhes, ſeeing them paſs along by us, driving of Sheep and Bullocks; but through Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they did not ſee us. And the next Night, being the 28<hi>th,</hi> we travelled all Night; and when Day appeared, we could not find a convenient place to lodg in, which we ſought for; and about Sun-riſing we found a place betwixt two Mountains where were Holes made with the Winter Rains coming off the Hills near a Path-way, to which we made, and eſpied ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Moors</hi> who went along
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52536:57"/>
the Road, that had Mules and Aſſes loaden with Iron, who ſaw us not. Some part of the Day we ſlept; and the <hi>Moor</hi> and I watcht; in which time the <hi>Moor</hi> gathered Palm, and made a Sling, to ſling Stones at Lions and other wild Beaſts that appeared.</p>
            <p>So in the Evening, after Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, (being the 29<hi>th</hi>) we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled till we came to a River<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, where were a great parcel of <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Mules</hi> a baiting, that had Bail-Goods, which the <hi>Sally-Moors</hi> had taken in Prizes, to carry to the Emperor at <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queneſs</hi>; who ſtrictly enquired of our <hi>Moor,</hi> from whence we came, and whither we were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? He made anſwer, To <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and came from <hi>Macqueneſs,</hi> and ſo our <hi>Moor</hi> bad them Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night; and we travelled on
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52536:58"/>
(without further enquiry) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the River-ſide before we could get over. When we were over, there were a great many Bramble-buſhes and Ruſh-buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; and our <hi>Moor</hi> feared there were Lions in that Place, ſo we made what haſte we could up a Hill, on the top of which was a great Plain; and being very thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, we travelled on a good way further, and heard a noiſe of Frogs and Toads; to which Place we came, and found a ſtanding Water, which ſtunk; however we drank thereof to ſtay our Thirſt, and 'twas ſweet to us: and ſo went on till we found a ruined Caſtle, which had formerly belonged to the <hi>Portugues,</hi> at which our <hi>Moor</hi> would fain have reſted; but I told him there might happen to be <hi>Moors</hi> there, becauſe they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52536:58"/>
reſted in ſuch Places in the Night. So we went fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till we came to a place where grew a great parcel of high Weeds, and there we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted that Day.</p>
            <p>The 30<hi>th</hi> at Night, after Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, we ſet forwards; but were very thirſty, the Sun having ſhone hot upon us that Day, having lain without ſhelter, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Weeds. I asked our <hi>Moor,</hi> how long it would be e're we could find any Water? He ſaid, A little further there was a ſmall River; but we thought it a long way to it, our Throats being ſo parch'd with Drought; ſo we drank Water, and eat a little Bread, which did greatly refreſh us; and we went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward till near break of Day, where we reſted in ſome Weeds till about two in the Afternoon;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52536:59"/>
at which time three Women di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed us two or three times, but ſaw not our Faces: So we three went forward, and our <hi>Moor</hi> ſtood, and enquired of them the way to <hi>Salley.</hi> Then the Women asked from whence we came? Who anſwered, From <hi>Tapholet,</hi> which was a City in that Country. They further asked, if he had lain in that place all Night? and asked what they were that were with him? He told them, Three of his Neighbours, and that they had lain there all Night, being Strangers. They ſaid, It was a wonder that the Lions had not deſtroyed us, there being ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in that place, they devoured ſome of their Cattel almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Night; and they told him it was about four Leagues to <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:52536:59"/>After Sun-ſet (<hi>July</hi> 1.) we travelled till we came to a Wood, where the <hi>Moor</hi> would have had us to reſt; but ſeeing of Lights which the Country People had in their Tents, and hearing a Lion roar thereabouts, we went further, and came to a ruined Tower, where was a good Spring of Water; we drank and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed our ſelves, but durſt not ſtay for fear of <hi>Moors</hi> being in that place; and going a little farther, we came into a Valley, where was a Hole the Winter Rains had made, there we reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and after the Sun was riſen, two <hi>Moors</hi> came to cut Palm: At which I awaked our <hi>Moor,</hi> who ſpoke to them, and gave them the time of Day, and they likewiſe to him. They enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him from whence he came, and whither he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52536:60"/>
He told them, he came from beyond <hi>Tapholet,</hi> and was going to viſit a great Saint at a Town called <hi>Temſnah</hi>; and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed further, if there were none with him? He anſwered, there were three more. They asked, if we had lain there all Night? He ſaid, we had; They ſaid, it was to be wondred that the Lions had not devoured us; and came to look at us where we lay, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Arabick</hi>; but the <hi>Moor</hi> told them, we could not ſpeak that <hi>Lingua</hi>; and we were covered all over with our white Blankets, being ſuch as the <hi>Moors</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly wear. So they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and left us, telling us, We did well in going to viſit the Saint. So we got up, and eſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a parcel of Buſhes a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance off, we removed thither, leſt the two <hi>Moors</hi> ſhould have
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52536:60"/>
informed of us at <hi>Salley,</hi> and ſo have come back to the place and found us. The Buſh where we were hid, was near a River-ſide, but we durſt not go to drink thereat, by reaſon of People which paſſed to and fro there by us all Day long.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 2. After Sun-ſet, we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to go over the River; but it being ſo ſtrong a Stream, and deep, we could not paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it: And in our going a great way further up the River-ſide, there happened to be ſeveral of the <hi>Moors</hi>; yet being Night, they ſaw us not, ſave only one Man of the Natives, which had tied up a bundle of Canes faſt together to paſs over the River with them; to whom our <hi>Moor</hi> gave the time of the Night; and he anſwering with the like to us, we parted: and going higher
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52536:61"/>
up, we found a place not ſo deep as the other part of the River; ſo got over, and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up a Hill on the other ſide, where we found ſome Buſhes, and there we reſted, and our <hi>Moor</hi> lay on the out-ſide of them. In the Morning when the Sun was riſen, came by us two <hi>Moors</hi> with two Aſſes, who ſaid one to the other, it was wonder the Lions had not devoured that Man, meaning our <hi>Moor,</hi> who they ſaw lying by the ſide of the Buſhes.</p>
            <p>On the third Inſtant, after the Sun was ſet, we ſet forward, endeavouring to get to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide: but there being ſeveral People in the way, watching with their Dogs to keep the wild Beaſts from their Gardens; which we hearing, were fain to flee further from them: ſo
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52536:61"/>
we travelled a little further, and reſted among ſome Ruſhes.</p>
            <p>The next Night, being the 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> we travelled after Sun-ſetting as far as we could, being weary and faint, and reſted</p>
            <p>On the 5<hi>th</hi>; on which Day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sun was ſet, we ſet forward, and travelled till we came to a place where was a ſtanding Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being thereto led by a noiſe of Frogs; which although the Water ſtunk, yet drinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it was ſweet to us; with that, and a little Bread, we were much refreſhed; but at this time our Bread was gone, ſo we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled a little further, and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>The 6<hi>th</hi> Inſtant, after Sun-ſet, we went forward, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a great many Lights which the Natives had in their Tents where they lodg: So we
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52536:62"/>
parted a while one from another, to find out the Roads. At length I came to a place where the Country People uſe to go to Market, where we again met together; and travelling awhile, we heard ſome Dogs, as I thought, did ſcent us; and near that place we met with a Lion lying by the Way-ſide; which the <hi>Moor</hi> ſeeing, before he rouſed, he ſtruck him fair over the Head. So the Lion roared at him, and followed us half a Mile or more; but our <hi>Moor</hi> kept ſlinging of Stones at him ſo faſt, that he left us. Then we came to a Valley, where was a Wood on each ſide: When Day appeared, we reſted in the Wood, having no Bread to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain us; but we durſt not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Wood till it was Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, for fear of the Lions:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52536:62"/>
We then found a piece of Pot in the Wood, with which our <hi>Moor</hi> brought us ſome Water out of the Valley; for we durſt not fetch it our ſelves, leſt the People ſaw us: ſo when the <hi>Moor</hi> had brought us a Pot full of Water, (but in the mean time we were lamenting our ſad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for want of Bread, having then no Suſtenance but Palm-Berries, Graſs and Weeds, and any thing we could eat, which was ſweet to us) he ſaid, in his own Language, God was great. So went from us about the ſpace of four Hours; in which time he ſold his Saſh, and bought us a ſmall quantity of Bread (about a pound and an half) therewith, and brought us a little of it, which we ate; and he fetch'd us a little more Water in the Pot: After we
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52536:63"/>
had eaten and drank of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we went to ſleep, two of us watching.</p>
            <p>On the 7<hi>th,</hi> after Sun-ſet, we travelled on; and the <hi>Moor</hi> ſlung Stones, whilſt we paſſed through the Wood, leſt there ſhould be Lions lurking thereabouts: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving refreſhed our ſelves with the Bread and Water, we reſted amongſt ſome Brambles, but could find no more Water that Night.</p>
            <p>Then on the 8<hi>th</hi> Day at Night we came to another Wood, in which we travelled a great way, and kept two of us awake to watch againſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and other wild Beaſts.</p>
            <p>On the 9<hi>th</hi> we ſet forward, and travelled in the ſame Wood, and ſtill had no Water.</p>
            <p>The 10<hi>th,</hi> after Sun-ſetting, we went till we came to an Hill
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52536:63"/>
of Rocks; at the bottom where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we found a Spring of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and drinking thereof, we were greatly refreſhed: and there was a little River, from which we went, till we came to ſome Trees or Buſhes, and there reſted.</p>
            <p>About eight a Clock in the Morning, <hi>July</hi> 11. (it raining faſt) we ventured to travel that Day, after we had rubb'd out a little Corn, and eaten, that the <hi>Moor</hi> had brought us, having no Bread to eat: ſo went to the top of an Hill, on which grew a Tree, which we climb'd upon, and eſpied the Sea at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from us. We travelled all that Day, and the Night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, till towards Day, that we reſted, but had neither Bread nor Water.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:52536:64"/>On the 12<hi>th</hi> at Night, after Sun-ſetting, we travelled a good way, and heard a noiſe of Frogs and Toads; to which we made, and found Water, which we drank of; and although it was very brackiſh, yet it was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to us, by reaſon of our ſore Drought. A little from thence we met with a Perſon of Quality, as we judged by his Habit and Attendance, having ten Men with him; to whom our <hi>Moor</hi> paid his Reſpects, and gave him the time of the Night. He anſwered him again in his own Language, and asked him whither we were going? Our <hi>Moor</hi> anſwered, To <hi>Santa Cruſe:</hi> So he bid us, God ſpeed: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our <hi>Moor</hi> asked him from whence he came? He anſwered, From <hi>Aſſimore.</hi> So we depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted away, and travelled till we
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52536:64"/>
found ſome Buſhes, wherein we reſted that Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 13. After Sun-ſetting we ſet out, and came ſo near to <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimore,</hi> that, liſtening, we heard the People in it, and ſaw the Town, which ſtood on the South-ſide of a Hill, and a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by the Town, which was ſo deep, that we could not get over, becauſe one of our Men could not ſwim. Then we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled along the North-ſide of the River, till we came to a place where Cains grew, and there we reſted by the River<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 14. After it was Day, our <hi>Moor</hi> went to ſee his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which dwelt there in that Town. We having been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time without Bread, I requeſted our <hi>Moor</hi> to bring us a little, (which he did) and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52536:65"/>
likewiſe to ſee if he could find any thing to carry my Country-man over the River; and about four in the Afternoon he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſome Bread, and ſaid, he had found a Tree. After Sun was ſet, we went to view it, and found it not fit to ſwim withal: So we returned, and went back to the Cains, and there ſtaid.</p>
            <p>On the 15<hi>th</hi> Inſtant, when the Sun was riſen, I deſired our <hi>Moor</hi> to go and enquire of the People, where we might paſs over the River? The People told him, there was no other Paſſage but by a Boat at the Town. So our <hi>Moor</hi> went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a League further in the Country, where he ſaw a Man and a Woman upon a Mule croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the River, and marked the place with ſome Stones, that we
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52536:65"/>
might find it, and ſo returned to us, and reſted till Sun-ſetting. So we ſet forward, and had gone but a little way before we heard a Lion roar, but he did not come in our ſight; then we came to the place where the <hi>Moor</hi> laid his Mark, and ſat down to conſult how to paſs over there, we hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of People in a Garden were near at hand: And in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, we heard a Lion juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind us; ſo we haſtened and got over the River, and travelled a little further, and reſted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 16. After Sun-ſetting we travelled about a Mile further, where we ſaw a Town, that our <hi>Moor</hi> ſaid was a Saint's Town, to which the People, that were not able to pay their Taxes to the Emperor, fled for Refuge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:52536:66"/>
               <hi>July</hi> 17. After Sun-ſetting we travelled; and going till about Midnight we came within call of the Gariſon, <note n="*" place="bottom">The diſtance between <hi>Macqueneſs</hi> and <hi>Marſegan,</hi> being two hundred Miles or more; but travelling in the Night, occaſioned our miſſing the Way: ſo that we went at leaſt three hundred Miles before we came to the Gariſon.</note> which was at <hi>Merſygan,</hi> belonging to the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>: So I called out, and the Souldiers made anſwer to me, and asked what we were? I replied, We were three Chriſtians and a <hi>Moor:</hi> Which they preſently acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Governour of, and bid us haſten nearer, leſt there ſhould be any <hi>Moors</hi> in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us. Which we did, and running to a wrong place, they called to us again to make to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52536:66"/>
the two Draw-bridges, where we ſate down. So the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the reſt of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, came to the Wall; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had examined us, he and the Guard let us in; and he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Servants to bring us into the Houſe, and to give us ſome Relief; and he himſelf came to us, and wondred that ſo little ſatisfied us in our eating and drinking: So had us into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Room, and asked me, If I did not know of three Men that were taken by the <hi>Moors</hi> from that Gariſon? I anſwered, I knew of two, but not the third. He bid me ſpeak to the <hi>Moor,</hi> and ask him, If he would undertake to bring them thither to that place? So I ſpoke to the <hi>Moor,</hi> who bid me tell the Governour, That he would endeavour it to the utmoſt of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52536:67"/>
his Power. So the Governour ordered us a Lodging; and in the Morning ordered his Clerk to write a couple of Letters, and gave them to the <hi>Moor,</hi> with forty pieces of Eight for bringing us thither, ſaying, If he did bring the two Portugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he would give him as much more as ſhould maintain him and his Family as long as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The <hi>Moor</hi> ſaid, He would do his endeavour. So the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour ordered Dinner for us: And about four a Clock he again ſent for me and the <hi>Moor</hi>; and bid me tell him, in his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, That if he feared any thing in his Return, he would ſend ſome of his Troopers to conduct him on the Way. The <hi>Moor</hi> made anſwer, He ſhould go more ſafe alone. After Sun was ſet, the Governour gave
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52536:67"/>
him Victuals to ſerve him, till he could ſhift for himſelf. And the <hi>Moor</hi> taking his leave, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and went on his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
            <p>About three Weeks after, a Portugueſe Man of War came into that Gariſon to fetch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 1800 Souldiers off from thence: So I deſired of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour we might go aboard with them: Which he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and in four Days after we had been aboard, moſt of the Souldiers being come off, the Captain ſent a Letter to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, by the Coxon of the Pinnace, deſiring him to haſten the remainder away. When the Pinnace went aſhore, his Crew wondered to ſee any <hi>Moors</hi> there, and asked, What they did there? The Portugues told
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52536:68"/>
them, They came with a Flag of Truce, to treat for three <hi>Moors</hi> they had taken. They offered the Governour two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Dollars for them, being one of them was a Shack, or Governour; or Bullocks, or Sheep, or Corn, in lieu of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. He anſwered, No; for they had taken three Troopers belonging to his Gariſon; and he heard that two of them were at <hi>Macqueneſs.</hi> They replied, They knew by whom he heard that, for the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that the <hi>Moor</hi> brought, had acquainted him therewith; but he had paid dearly for it, for, ſaid they, he was taken with the Pieces of Eight, and Letters about him, and carried up to the Emperor and burnt: At which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour was very ſorry when he heard it. The Governour
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52536:68"/>
then told them, he heard two of his Troopers vvere alive at <hi>Macqueneſs,</hi> but he feared the third vvas dead, becauſe he heard nothing of him; and bid them go up to the Emperor, and prevail vvith him, if they could, for the two <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and bring them, and they ſhould have the three <hi>Moors.</hi> They told him, they could not do that. He made anſwer, Then they ſhould never have the <hi>Moors.</hi> So at Night when they came on Board, I asked them what was the beſt News? Who ſaid, Very bad; for they had ſeen a parcel of <hi>Moors,</hi> who had given account to the Governour, that the <hi>Moor</hi> that brought us to the Gariſon, was taken and burnt. At which I was much grieved, knowing the poor <hi>Moor</hi>'s true-heartedneſs towards
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52536:69"/>
us, in bringing and directing us on our Journey, vvhen vve made our eſcape from <hi>Macque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> So ſetting ſail for <hi>Lisbon,</hi> through God's Mercy we ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrived there, and vvent to the King's Palace, giving him Thanks for the Kindneſs the Governour had beſtowed upon us, and the <hi>Moor</hi> that brought us to the Gariſon.</p>
            <p>When vve came thither, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Nobility enquired of us, What Nation vve vvere of? and told us, if vve deſired it, vve might ſpeak vvith the King; and acquainted him of us, vvho ordered us to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; and enquired of us if vve could ſpeak French or Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe? I ſaid we could ſpeak ſome <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> and a little <hi>Lingua Franc:</hi> So he enquired from vvhence vve came? And
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52536:69"/>
I gave him account of our nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row eſcape from that Slavery vve had been in under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and told him how our Bread vvas gone in ten Days time, and that vve had been two and twenty Days in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Macqueneſs</hi> to the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, and did eat nothing but Reach till the 23<hi>d</hi> Night. He much vvondered how vve vvere kept alive the reſt of the time after our Bread vvas gone. I told him, through God's Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance vve had ſhifted as vvell as vve could; for our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being ſweet to us, had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us to run theſe great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards vve vvere expoſed to. He further enquired after thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that are ſtill in Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; of vvhich I gave him an Account of all I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member:
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52536:70"/>
And deſired him, out of the abundance of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Clemency to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them in their Afflictions. He told me, it vvas more than he ever heard before, and ſaid, he vvould, before Winter came, take care to ſend them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, to buy them Victuals and Clothes; and enquired of me, Whether any of his Subjects deſired me to lay their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition before him? I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, No; but (by God's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion) I had in part under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone the ſame Afflictions they were in, and knew vvell e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough how it vvas vvith them. He made anſwer, God vvould bleſs me for it. He likewiſe asked, If I knew vvhat num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Ships vvere at <hi>Salley?</hi> I told him, eleven Sail. He ſaid,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52536:70"/>
He knew <hi>Venetia,</hi> for he had formerly been at his Palace. I ſaid, It was our late King <hi>James</hi>'s Pleaſure to give him his Liberty; vvith much more that paſſed betwixt us.</p>
            <p>VVhen this <hi>Venetia</hi> returned home to the Emperor, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror ordered him to build a Ship; and ſeveral Engliſh-men, that were newly taken Slaves he cauſed to draw Timber in a Cart from <hi>Memora</hi> to <hi>Salley,</hi> (which was twelve Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant) like ſo many Oxen, driving and whipping of them in a very barbarous manner.
