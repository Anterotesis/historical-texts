            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100598:5"/>
be in respect of your self, to break open that
light to you, and to prepare it to you, with
that brevity I may, and with what plainenesse
I am able; beseeching the God and Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, who must be when all
failes, the wonderfull Counsellor, to give you
the spirit of revelation, and that after you have
suffered a while by these outward temptations,
doubts, fears, desertions, distractions, which
the Letter mentions, hee would make you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
stablish, strengthen, and settle you. And
this I verily think will be the unexpected, yet
happy, joyfull, and most glorious end of them;
For since I have observed and seen the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
ruines of the soule, and seeming graces of
many men, by being rockt a sleep in a quiet,
still, calme, easie performance of duties; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
such awaking temptations and tumults
within, which it self complaines of: I say
since I have observed what a deale of mud is
in the bottom of such standing Pools, and what
a deale of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ilth is in such Moats, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
at ease, and not emptied from vessell to
vessell, next unto the donation of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
to a man, I have accounted such tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s
heart-storms and uproars, together with
the fruitfull strange effects of them, the second
mercy. For I never saw that man kept from
secret putrefaction and corruption, that was
not usually salted with such temptations (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in a Christians first Apprentiship) which
usually preserve him entire till death. And
therefore (Dear Sir) faint not, for Jesus Christ
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100598:5"/>
will raise a world of blessings out of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Chaos and confusions. But I make hast to
answer. Before your reply to my first Letter;
your complaints are many.</p>
            <p>Your first trouble is, concerning your distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances
in civill affairs, by the secret injection
of Religious thoughts; so that you know not
how to follow the one, without hazard of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the spirit, and breaking your peace, in not
maintaining and nourishing the same time the
other: and hence being drawn to go two
waies at the same time (which you cannot wel
do) your heart is disquieted, and your peace
much interrupted.</p>
            <p>This of yours, puts me in mind of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of an honest, yet plain man, to an able
Minister once, who in bewailing his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to him, among other miseries, that was not
the least: (<hi>viz.</hi>) that he was exceedingly
troubled with good thoughts, so that he could
not follow his place, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e very oft he did

this may be thy accepted time, and if thou dost
not take it, it may be thou shalt never have it
again? I have forgot the Ministers answer,
but I am sure in these complaints you go not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone:

he had murdered his body, out of conscience to

            <p>Your thoughts I know, are not likely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

which concurring together in a good action, or

discovery whether they are from Gods spirit or

            <p>1. If it be suggested for Gods ends, its from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

not from Gods spirit, but nature, and their own

brings Grace into captivity, (which <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines

the intention of him that made it: so to thinke
of good things, it is from the spirit, I grant, but
to think of them in such a season that God sets
you a worke to minde and follow other occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
its from the enemy of Gods spirit, and
your owne peace; for as it is a sinne to nourish
worldly thoughts when God sets you a worke
in spirituall heavenly imployments, so it is (in
some respects) as great a sin to suffer your self
to be distracted by spirituall thoughts, when
God sets you on worke in Civill (yet lawfull)
imployments: such thoughts (I conceive) are
but the leven of Monkish holinesse, if they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
you from your lawfulfull affaires, when the
Lord calls you to follow them. For the Lord ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
calls you to two divers imployments at the
same time, unlesse you make the one to be a
meanes to further the good of the other; which
such pious thoughts in some civill imployments
doe, it being no peece of Christian wisdome or
honesty to turne round in worldly imployments
so long till by giddinesse wee fall down, but by
secret steps ever and anon to look up to heaven
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100598:8"/>
and to behold the face of God, to whom onely
therein wee are to approve our selves. But
yet it seemes your thoughts are so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
subservient the one to the other, that you
are distracted and molested, and your peace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted,
and your Christian course made trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom,
and an heavy burthen, which surely can
not be by the yoke of Jesus Christ, therefore
you must first bring your troubles in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to this issue, either you may follow your Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
affaires, and nourish these thoughts as helps
to maintaine your peace and make you heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
minded in them, (and if they serve sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to such an end, why are you troubled with
them?) or els you cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ollow God comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
in civill actions, unlesse you banish from
you thoughts which doe so miserably distract
you, and then why doe you fear you shall grieve
Gods Spirit, if at the same time you do not give
entertainment to them, the unseasonablenesse of
which, speaks plainely they came not from the
spirits suggestions, besides their hinderance of
comfortably walking with God, which the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
themselves can never hinder.</p>
            <p>But you will say, when is the season of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
such thoughts.</p>
            <p>I answer, Entertaine those thoughts as (it
may be) you have done some friends, who came
to you at that time you have businesse with
strangers, (whom you love not so well as your
friends,) you have desired them to stay a while,
untill you have done with the other, and then
you have returned to your friend, and when
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100598:8"/>
the other hath been shut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>out of the doores, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath had the welcom, and hath lodged with
you all night, and thus you have grieved nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but pleased both. It is so in this case,
Worldly employments are our strangers, yet
they must be spoke with, Religious thoughts
and practises are our friends, these come unto
us while God calls us to parley with the other,
you cannot speake with both at one time, in
one place, without much perplexity: take
therefore this course, make much of the good
thoughts, but parley not with them till your
businesse is done with strangers; and towards
evening, which is your season, set some time
apart every day for meditation, and then make
them welcome; then consider and ponder well
what was suggested to you in the day time, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t every good thought to the bran, for then is
your season, and after that let them sup and
lodge with you all night, and keep the house
with you every day. And surely, when the
Lord Jesus shall see what a friend you shall
make of his Spirit, and how wisely you walke
therein, you shall not need to feare any grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of it, or unseasonable times: nay (I
say) you will most fearefully grieve his
Spirit, if you parley with the conceived sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
of it at unseasonable times, <hi>What
thou dost, doe it with all thine heart.</hi> saith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
Eccle. 9.</p>
            <p>Therefore when you are to pray, confer, or
meditate, do it with all your minde, and all
your thoughts, and all your strength. So when
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100598:9"/>
God calls you to worldly employments, do
them with all your mind and might, and when
the season of meditation comes, take it, which
glorious ordinace of God, although many
Christiane use it occasionally, and against some
good time, or when they have leisure meeting
with them, yet to set some time apart for it
in a solemn manner every day, and that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
as wee doe for prayer generally, where
is the man to be found that does thus? Those
men that thus neglect their season of musing and
entring into parley with Gods Spirit dayly, may
be well said to grieve the Spirit, <hi>through the
neglect of which ordinance, Gods S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

apprehend that for that time God calls you

worke of Christ, and see how greatly it honours
Christ in attending on him, Oh what peace
should a Christian enjoy, notwithstanding all
his distractions every day! And how easily
would such devout thoughts you speak of, be
repell'd like darknesse before the light, for the
noblenesse of those good thoughts you speake of
presenting themselves against the mean and

see a glory in the meanest service you performe

not onely in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rmities do not, but the greatest
sinnes cannot make a breach of Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and the soul that is once really (not
rationally) wrapt up in the Covenant of grace.
Indeed grosse scandalous sinnes, nay infirmities,
when they are given way to, and not resisted,
may keepe the soule from the fruition for a time
of Gods Covenant, but never from the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>jus</hi> and right unto it; for as the habit of
Faith or Grace gives a man a constant right to
the promise and Covenant (which seed ever
remaines, which habit ever lasts, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 9.) so
the act of Faith or Grace gives a man fruition
of the Covenant and the benefit of the promise,
and hence by the acting and venting of some
sinnes wherein there is included the neglect of
the exercise of grace, He that is really in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with God, may be deprived of the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100598:10"/>
of it; yet seeing the seed of God, and the
habit of grace ever remaines, he cannot by any
sin break his covenant, for the covenant of
grace is absolute, wherein the Lord doth not
onely promise the good, but to begin and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and fulfill the condition absolutely, without
respect of sin, <hi>ex parte creatur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>:</hi> Indeed if
Gods covenant of Grace did (as that of works)
depend upon man to fulfill the condition, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sufficient grace to fulfill it, then grosse sin
might well breake the Covenant: but seeing
God hath undertaken to fulfill the Covenant ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,
notwithstanding all the evills and sins
of the soul, no sinne can possibly break that
knot and covenant which so firme and resolute
love hath once knit. And therefore, if this be
a good argument, Infirmities cannot break co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venat:
What cause have I to be humbled for
them? so as to say, It is thy mercy Lord that
I am not consumed for them (as you write)
you may upon the same ground say so, If the
Lord should desert you, or you forsake the Lord,
and so fall into the foulest sinne, which I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
corrupt conscience dares not be so bold as
to think or allow of.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I say the least sinnes or infirmities <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
do break the first covenant of workes: and
hence you do not onely deserve, but are under
the sentence of death, and curse of God, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after the least hairs-breadth, swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
from the Law by the smallest sinne, and
most involuntary accidentall infirmity. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Tenor of the Law, the soul that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100598:11"/>
sinneth shall die: and <hi>cursed is he that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

               </hi>) in respect
of God against whom it is committed, as hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
and as great as the greatest. For it being
an infinite wrong being the dishonour of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Majesty, there can be no greater wrong
then an infinite one, unlesse you can imagine a
thing greater then that which is infinite; and
therefore in this respect, there is as much ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome
and mischiefe done against God in the
least, as in the greatest sinne: And therefore
it, and whosoever commits it, deserves death
for it, as if they had committed the foulest sinne
in the world: and therefore after the least and
smallest infirmities, you may from hence see
what cause you have freely to be humbled, and
to confesse for them how worthy you are to be
destroyed; yea, even to look upon your self
as lying under the sentence of the Law and
death, immediately after the commission of
them, and so to mourne bitterly for them.</p>
            <p>But you will say,<note place="margin">Object.</note> a Christian that is under
the Covenant of grace, is not within the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of workes, that Bond is cancelled, the
last will must stand: and therefore he being
out of that Covenant, no sinnes of his can be
said to breake the Covenant, for no man can be
said to breake that Law under which he is not,
and which he is not bound to keep.</p>
            <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> Every beleever hath a double being

            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:100598:11"/>
First, he may be considered as united to, and
having a spirituall being on Christ; and so it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
true, he is under grace, and the Covenant of
Grace, and not under the Law, nor the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of workes; and hence not being under
the Law, nor bound to keep it as a covenant of
life (though it be a rule of life) no sinne can
condemn him, there being no condemnation to
them that are in Christ Jesus. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. But
as Christ is above condemnation, and law, and
death, and curse, so is he. And this truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
is the foundation of a Christians joy
and peace, and glory every day; yet so, as
though sinne doth not condemne him, yet he
hath good reason to say, it is mercy, and meer
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rcy, Lord, that I am not consumed, that I
am condemned. For sinne is the same; nay
grace and Gods love aggravates sinne; for to
sinne against the law deserves death without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
but to sinne when grace hath received
me, and loved me; when the blood of Christ
hath bin shed abundantly to deliver me from
sin; Oh this makes the most secret silent sinne
a crying one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> So that if you do consider this
well, you may see what little cause there is to
have your heart rising against the deepest humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
for the least sinne, though you be in
Christ, and under grace: For as <hi>Daniel</hi> when
he was put into the Lions den, had not he cause
to wonder that he was not torne in pieces by
them? and why? because it was not from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
defect on their parts to teare him in pieces,
but from the omnipotent power, and mercy,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100598:12"/>
and grace of his God, that muzzell'd their
mouths; so though no Lion can teare, though no
sinnes can hurt or condemn a Christian, as hee
is considered in Christ; yet, hath no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he cause
to confesse and wonder, and say, Lord, it is thy
meer grace and mercy that it is not so? (which
is the act of humiliation you letter saith you can
hardly come unto) and why? not because Gods
grace puts any lesse evill in sinne, but because it
is meerely grace that keeps it from spitting that
venome which otherwise it would.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A Christian may be considered in
respect of his naturall being in himselfe, and
thus he is ever under the Law, and as oft as hee
sinneth, under the sentence of death (and as
the Apostle speakes) by nature even we (justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
quickned) are the children of wrath as
well as others. And thus after the least invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
accidentall si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne, you may easily see
what cause you have to lie down deepely hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
mourning under the sentence of death,
and Gods eternall curse, as a condemned man
going to the execution, to feel that fire that
shall never go out; looking upon your self as
you are in your self, a forlorn castaway every
moment: and this truly understood is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of a Christians sorrow, shame, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of face, self-loathing, self-forgetting,
self<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>forsaking, and condemning every day: and
(believe it Sir) it is no small piece of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
skill and work, to put a difference between
himselfe and himself, himselfe as he is in Christ,
and so to joy and triumph, and himselfe as hee
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100598:12"/>
is growing on his first root, and so to sorrow,
and loath, and condemn himself: so that (to
wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de up all that I have said) looke upon your
selfe as in Christ, you may say these involuntary
infirmities do not, shall not, condemn me.</p>
            <p>But Lord it is grace, Grace that it is not so,
and this is Evangelicall humiliation. Look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
upon your self, as you stand on your own
bottom, and live in your owne nature, and so you
may say after the least infirmity; I have now
broken a most holy and righteous Law, and
therefore I am already condemned: O woe is
me, I have already undone my selfe by mine
iniquity: and this is Legall humiliation, which
serves for mortification, as the first for vificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I know it is very difficult to bring the heart
to acknowledge freely it deserves death after so
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mall an involuntary offence: but when the
Lord reveales two things, First, himself in his
glory, Secondly, how the least sinne strikes
him: I perswade my selfe the vilest heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be forced to confesse how just God
should be in his severest proceedings against
him. And withall consider, the more invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
any sinne is, the more strong and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
it is, and the more naturall, the more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
as to be a naturall Thief is farre worse
then to be a deliberat thiefe, who sometimes
steales; and therefore (good Sir) take heed of
looking no deeper, nor seeing no further then
the bare act, and unvoluntarinesse and acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talnesse,
and suddennesse of your infirmities:
for if you do, you look through the wrong end
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100598:13"/>
of the glas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, and they will appear so small, that
you will find it a very tough work to bring your
heart consentively to say (if I may say and use
your owne phrase) It is thy mercy Lord that I
am not consumed for them: but look upon
them as indeed they are, in respect of that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
glory, you strike doing the greatest mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes
to God by them, and (which makes
them the viler) as they are so strong, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
remove them; and so horrible, as that it is
naturall to you to commit them, &amp;c. And
surely you will not (through grace) finde such
thoughts haunt you long; not but that they wil
be (haply) rising and tempting, but never all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
vexing and prevailing. Satans ground
reaching as far as the minds of Gods people,<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
and therefore so farre he may come, and there
he may walke, (for the came into the minde of
innocent <hi>Adam.</hi> nay <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> by his sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting
temptations) but the heart is Christs
peculiar pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ession and purchase; and if he shall
still there offer to come in and vex you, and
prevail against you, and to lodge his suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
this or any other way with you, you have
Law and Christ on your side, by this little light
now given you, to cast him out.</p>
            <p>The third thing that troubles you, is the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranking
of the Persons in the Trinity,<note place="margin">Quest. 3.</note> for though
you thinke the holy Ghost is God, yet you
have not so high a repute of him, as of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Sonne, because the Sonne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresseth
himselfe to God the Father in all his
prayers and acknowledgements, in a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100598:13"/>
manner then unto the holy Ghost, and
therefore you would know if the word Father
(as in the Lords Prayer,) includes not the Unity
in Trinity.</p>
            <p>To this briefly consider three things.</p>
            <p>1. Without all question,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> the same God
which lies under that relative property of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is the same God with the God-head of
the Sonne, and the God-head of the holy Ghost,
there being not three Gods; and therefore the
God-head of the Sonne and Spirit, are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
but included in the Godhead of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when we looke upon the Father as God,
in the Lords Prayer, or any where else.</p>
            <p>2. But secondly, the Father as Father, is
never taken for the same holy Ghost in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
nor the Sonne as Sonne, is taken for the
Father, nor the holy Ghost as holy Ghost, is at
any time taken for the Sonne: For it is a rule
in Theologie, though the <hi>res subs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rata</hi> the thing
that lies under the Relative property (<hi>viz.</hi> the
God-head) of every person, be common and
communicated, yet the same God-head consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as clothed with his Relative property (as
Father, Son and Spirit) it is not common, but
peculiar. For the God-head of the Father as
Father, is not the God-head of the Son as Son,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. Hence it followes that when Christ ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>seth
himselfe to the Father as Father in
Scripture, it is not because he is either a diverse
or greater God then the holy Ghost, but it is for
two other reasons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:100598:14"/>
1. Because the Father as Father, received
primarily the wrong that sinne did against his
worke of creation. For the Father being the
first Person in order, and creation, the first transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
act (as election and reprobation were the
first immanent) hence this worke is attributed
chiefly to God the Father, in respect of our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
apprehension; and hence man sinning
then when he was onely made, this is chiefly
attributed to be against the Father, because his
worke appeared to be chiefly there, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Son, for his worke chiefly appeares
in redemption, hee being the second Person,
and this the second main and wonderfull work,
neither against the holy Ghost, for his worke
chiefly appeares to us in application, being the
third Person, And this the third main act that
ever God will do, or show forth to the world
in this life: hence God the Father receiving
to our apprehension, the wrong in creation by
sinne, he is the Person that is to be satisfied and
not the holy Ghost. And hence Jesus Christ
in all his prayers hath a most speciall eye to him,
and not to the holy Ghost (as holy Ghost) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he came into the world by his death, and
intercession, and strong cries, to satisfie God
the Father, and not God the holy Ghost as a
third Person. And hence it is said, 1 John. 2.
1. 2. <hi>If any man sinne, we have an Advocate
with God the Father.</hi> (not God the holy Ghost)
because he was (to our apprehension) the
Person wronged: and hence we are after sins
committed chiefly to eye the Father in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100598:14"/>
and to go to him for pardon with our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
with us, because to whom offence is
chiefly offered, from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>im chiefly pardon and
reconciliation is to be expected.</p>
            <p>2. Therefore Christ addresseth himselfe
chiefly in his prayers to God the Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee is the originall and first cause of all
good, because he is the first Person in order of
subsisting, and therefore first too in the manner
of conveying. I know the God-head is the
originall of all good: but consider the Persons
one with another, and so the father is ever the
first in operation, as the holy Ghost is the last
in consummation, for all good comes from the
Father, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 17. through the Sonne by
the holy Ghost. And hence in all our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
we are to looke for all good from the Father,
for his Sonnes sake to be conveyed us by the
holy Ghost: and hence it is said, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 10.
<hi>No man com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s to me but whom the Father draws:</hi>
Why? It is the immediate office and worke
of the holy Ghost to draw and apply the soul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ, why then is it said, <hi>Vnle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
draw?</hi> The reason is, because that which
was perfected and consummated by the holy
Ghost, was intentionally and by way of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and decree begun originally by the Father;
and this is that which Christs words have chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reference unto (<hi>viz</hi>) the Father through the
Son by the holy Ghost draws.</p>
            <p>But I have waded too far in this Divinity,
the cleer knowledge of which is reserved for us
in heaven: But thus much to satisfie you, yet
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100598:15"/>
the word Father in the Lords Prayer, I conceive
under correction, as it doth not exclude any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the God-head, so its chiefly set downe
there, not so much to denote the Person of the
Father, as the affection of God as a Father to us
his Sons by Christ, which we are to believe in
our first approaching to our prayers, to be as,
nay to transcend the affection of any father to
his Son: when we com to call upon him for
those six things which the Petitions set down,
for those three ends, kingdom, power, and
glory, which the Prayer concludes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
            <p>Your fourth trouble is your aptnesse to go to
God immediately,<note place="margin">Quest. 4.</note> especially when his graces
are most striving in his ordinances, contrary to
that of Christ, <hi>Yee believe in God, believe also in
me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So indeed it is usuall for religious nature often
to out-run and get the start of grace;<note place="margin">Answ.</note> as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
in many other, so in this case you put;
looke as it is with every man when God awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
him effectually, he first seeks to his kitchin
physick to save himselfe, by his duties, praying,
mourning, re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orming, endeavouring, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
working, before he will seeke out to the
Physician, and to Christ to save him. Because
it was naturall to <hi>Adam</hi> to seeke to live by his
working, it is naturall to every Son and branch
of that root, to seeke to save himselfe by doing
as well as hee can, or as God gives him
the strength and grace. So it is here. It was
naturall to <hi>Adam</hi> to depend upon, and go to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100598:15"/>
God immediately, as a creature to a Creator,
as a Sonne to go nakedly to God as a Father:
Christ was not then known, nor seen: so it is
naturall to every man, when rectified Nature
is stirred up, to go immediately to God. It is
grace in the second Covenant that reveales and
drawes to Jesus Christ, and to God by Christ,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25.</p>
            <p>For cure of this distemper, ponder but these
three things.</p>
            <p>1. Cleerely convince the soule that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,
invisible, and most holy God, that
dwelleth in an un-approachable light, hath set
out himselfe to be seen, or made himselfe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
visible in Jesus Christ, so that he would have
no man looke upon him any other waies, then
as he hath revealed himselfe in his Son: In
whom (though in all other creatures his <hi>vesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi>
and footsteeps are to be seen) as he is God,
the face of God is to be seen, which no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is able to behold, but there, being the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his glory<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and the expresse Image of
his Person, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. And as hee is man,
the very heart of God, both in respect of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and will to be seen; So that in and
through Jesus Christ, especially his humane
nature, the glory of the great God breakes out
like the Sun through the clouds most brightly, in
respect of us, and therefore in and through his
humane nature we are onely to behold God, in
whom all that a Christian desires to know, is
to bee seen, which is the face and heart of so
deare a friend. 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 6. Ioh.</hi> 14. 9, 10. For
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100598:16"/>
we know by too lamentable experience, how
the whole world vanishing in their smoaky
thoughts of the glory of God, as he is conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in himselfe, and not able to conceive or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the knowledge of him, did hence invent
and set up I makes as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>it objects for their drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
staggering understanding to fasten upon,
and to be limited with, and hence adored God
before these, (as our Popish Hypocrites doe
before the Altar) and in these, and at these, as
Papists doe in respect of their Images. Hence
the Lord to cure this inveterate naturall malady,
hath in the second Person, united himselfe to
man Christ Jesus, through whom we are both
able to our everlasting wonderment to see him,
and also here bound onely to behold him, who
as he is a sit handle for our faith, so he is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it
object for our weak mindes to behold the glory
of the most high God in. Wherefore then do you
offer to go unto God without Christ, when as
you are not so much as to looke upon God, but
as he appeares in Christ. Is not the humane
nature of the Lord Jesus more easie to be seen
and conceived of, then the invisible unlimited
eternall God-head?</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, See evidently that there is not
any dram or drop of God you have, especially
in Gods ordinances, but it issues from the blood,
and is purchased by the intercession, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
unto you by the hand of Jesus Christ.

            <p>Oh Sir, me thinks the sad meditation of this,
should make you in all Gods ordinances, where
you are apt to say you go immediately to God, to
hasten suddenly in your thoughts, affections,
praises, to Jesus Christ. Nay, me thinks you
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100598:17"/>
should speedily have your heart elevated and
lifted up to Jesus Christ, and say, I receive
this, and taste this from Jesus Christ. Oh, but
this is but a taste of the hony-comb with the
end of my rod, and if this presence of Christs
Spirit I feel now be so sweet, what is himselfe
then?</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, Labour for increase of love and
familiarity with Jesus Christ, by taking notice
of him, by comming often to him, by musing
daily on his love, as on a fresh thing, by bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
slavish false feares of his forgetfulnesse of
you, and want of everlasting love towards you:
and then you know love will carry you speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him: <hi>amor meus pondus meum.</hi> nay, grant
that you have been a stranger to Christ, yet
restore the love of Christ to life againe in your
Soul, and when you come to his ordinances
where he dwells, your Soul will make its first

it hath seen him, as we do them wee love, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
whom wee have been greatest stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
            <p>Your fifth trouble is, you know not how to
apply absolute promises to your selfe,<note place="margin">Quest. 5.</note> as in <hi>Heb.</hi>
8. because they are made indefinitely without
condition. Conditional promises you say you
can, if you can find the qualification that gives
you right to the good of the promise within
you.</p>
            <p>This usefull fruitfull question,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> how to apply
absolute promises to ones particular, deserves a
larger time and answer, then now in the midst
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100598:17"/>
of perplexities, I am able, yet willing, to give.
For when the Lord saith absolutely without
condition, that hee will take away the stony
heart, and he will put his feare into his peoples
hearts, &amp;c. and these kind of promises are
made to some, not to all, to those only whom
the Lord will, and in generall to his people,
Hereupon the Soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of many Christians, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
such as question Gods love towards them,
are most in suspence: and therefore when they
complaine of the vilenesse of their hearts and
strength of their lusts, let any man tell them
that the Lord hath undertaken in the Second
Covenant, to heal their backslidings, and to
subdue their iniquities, they will hereupon
reply, it is true, hee hath promised indeed to
do thus for some absolutely, though they have
no good in them, but I that feele so vile a heart,
so rebellious a nature, will he do this for me,
or no? and thus the Soule floats above water,
yet feares it shall fink at last, notwithstanding
all that God hath said. I will answer therefore
briefly these two things in generall.</p>
            <p>1. I shall shew you to what end, and for
what use and purpose God hath made absolute
promises, not onely to them that be for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
his people, but to them that in respect of
their estates and condition are not.</p>
            <p>2. I shall shew you how every Christian is
to make use of them, and how and when hee
ought to apply them. For the first of these.</p>
            <p>1. First, I conceive that as in respect of
God himselfe, there are many ends which I
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100598:18"/>
shall not mention, as being needlesse, so in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of man, there are principally these two
ends for which the Lord hath made absolute
promises.</p>
            <p>1. To raise up the Soul of a helplesse sinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
cursed lost sinner in his owne eyes, to some
hope (at least) of mercy and help from the
Lord. For thus usually every mans Soul is
wrought, to whom the Lord doth intend grace
and mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y: he first turnes his eyes inward, and
makes him to see he is stark naught, and that he
hath not one dram of grace in him, who thought
himself rich, and wanting nothing before, and
consequently, that hee is under the curse and
wrath of God for the present, and that if the
Lord should but stop his breath, and cover his
face, and take him away, which he may easily
do, and is to be feared he will, that he is undon
for ever. Hereupon the Soul is awakened and
falls to his kitchin physick, as I spake before,
prayes, and hears, and amends, and strives to
grow better, and to stop up every hole, and
to amend it selfe of every sinne, but finding it
selfe to grow worse and worse, and perceiving
thereby that he doth but stirre, and not clense
the puddle, and that it is not amending of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that he must attain to, but he must believe,
and make a long arme to Heaven, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Lord Jesus, (which so few know, or
ever shall enjoy) and hereby quench the wrath
of God; I say, finding he cannot do thus, no,
nor no meanes of themselves can help him to
this, hereupon he is for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aken of all his self wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100598:18"/>
and of all his vaine hopes, and now
sits down like a desolate widdow, comfortlesse,
and sorrowfull, and thinks there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o way but
death and hell, and the wrath of a displeased
God to be expected. And if any come and
tell this Soul of Gods mercy and pitty to sinners,
I saith he, its true, he is even infinitely mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
unto them who are rent from their sinnes,
and that can believe, but that I cannot do; and
am sure shall never be able for to do, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what cause have I but to lie downe in my
sorrow, and to expect my fatall stroke every
moment? Reply againe upon this Soul, and
tell him, that though hee cannot believe, or
loosen his heart from sinne, yet that the Lord
hath promised to do it, that he will subdue all
his iniquity, and he will pardon all his sinne,
and that he will cause men to walk in his waies,
&amp;c. True, saith the Soul againe, hee will doe
thus for his owne people, and for them he hath
chosen, but I never had dram of grace in my
heart, and there is no evidence that the Lord
is mine owne, or that I am his: Here againe
the Soul lies downe, untill the Lord discovers
to the Soul that he will doe these things for
some that have no grace, or never had grace,
for these promises were made to such.</p>
            <p>Here upon the Soul thinkes thus; These pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
are made for some that are filthy, for why
should God poure cleane water upon them, for
some that be hard-hearted, for why should hee
promise to take away the stony heart from them,
&amp;c. and if unto some such, and I being such a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100598:19"/>
one, why may not the Lord possibly intend and
include me, seeing hee hath not by his promise
excluded nor shut me out? Indeed I dare not
say he will, but yet how do I, or men, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells
know, but yet I may be one? Hereupon
Hope is raised to life againe; seeing God hath
undertaken the worke for the vilest, it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
he may doe it for me, now when I am
vile and can doe nothing for my selfe. And
thus you may see the first end and use of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
promises, to be as it were, twigges to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the sinking Spirits of hopelesse, helplesse,
distressed Souls.</p>
            <p>2. The Second End and Use of them is this.
To create and draw out faith in Jesus Christ in
the promises. For as the Law begets terror, so
the promises beget Faith. Now no conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
promise firstly begets Faith, because hee
that is under any condition of the Gospel, in
that man there is a presupposed faith. Its Gods
absolute promise that firstly begets faith, for
faith is not assurance, but the comming of the
whole Soule to Christ in a promise, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 35.
And then the Soule believes in Christ, when it
comes to Christ, now this God workes in the
Gospel. 1. The Soule is raised up by hope.
And being raised, it Secondly comes to Christ,
which is faith, by vehement unutterable desire.
And being come to him, it 3. Embraceth
Christ by love, and thus the match is made, and
the everlasting knot is tied.</p>
            <p>Now as you have heard, the absolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
workes hope of reliefe from Christ: and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100598:19"/>
if it workes hope, it also workes a desire, or
comming to Christ by desire. Oh! that thou
Lord wouldst honour thy grace, thy power, thy
love, thy promise, in helping me a poore cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away.
And thus faith is created (as it were)
by this absolute promise: for it cannot but
move the heart of any one that ever felt his
want, to cry mightily to the Lord for help, if
he hath any hope, seeing the Lord hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to do it for some. Oh saith the Soul, that
thou wouldst do it for me: And surely, were
it not for this absolute promise of God, no Soul
would desire, because he would have no hope
to be saved, or to seeke for any thing as from
the hands of God. And thus you see to what
end God makes, and to what use a Christian
may put these absolu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e promises.</p>
            <p>2. For the second thing (<hi>viz</hi>) How and when
a Christian may apply these promises.<note place="margin">How to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, every Christian is either,</p>
            <p>1. Within Covenant with God, and knowes
it, or</p>
            <p>2. Within covenant with God, and knows it
not, or</p>
            <p>3. Out of covenant indeed, for his present e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
and condition, yet he is <hi>in fieri.</hi> or making
towards it.</p>
            <p>1. If he be in Covenant and knowes it, then
you may easily perceive how and when he
ought to apply promises unto himselfe, for he
may boldly conclude, If God be his God, then
all the promises of God shall be made good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; if he be a Sonne of God, he may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100598:20"/>
challenge at all times at the hands of God,
(nay if in some respects, at the hands of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
it selfe) the fulfilling of God the Fathers
will delivered in the severall Legacies of the
promise bought by the blood, and sealed by the
same blood of Jesus Christ, that they may
and shall be made good unto him that is clear.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, If he be in covenant and knows
it not, and questions hence whether God is his or
not, and consequently, whether the promises
belong unto him: then the rule is to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
let him so sue and seeke for the good of
the absolute promise, untill by reflecting upon
his own acts, herein he perceive himselfe ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and dignified with the qualification of some
conditionall promise, and then if he can finde
the condition or qualification within himselfe,
then as you judge and write, he may conclude,
that the conditionall promise belongs to him,
and if one promise, then all Gods promises, and
therefore that absolute promises are his owne,
because at least one conditional promise is. For
no unregenerate man is within the compasse of
any one conditionall promise of grace, unlesse
you will say he is under the everlasting love of
God, the promises of grace being but the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
between the eternall purpose and decree of
love, and the glorious certain execution of that
love in time. The promise being the breake
day of Gods most glorious love, which must
shine out in time.</p>
            <p>But here you will say is the difficulty,<note place="margin">Object.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi>
how I should to seeke for the good of absolute
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100598:20"/>
promises, as therein to finde my self within the
compasse of some conditionall one.</p>
            <p>I answer, It is done chiefly by three acts.</p>
            <p>1. By being humbly contented, that seeing
the Lord hath absolutely promised, to work and
doe all for the Soule he intends for to save, even
when it can doe nothing for it selfe, and that
he hath taken the worke into his owne hands;
so that it is his promise, offer, office and honour
to doe all, that therefore you lie downe, not
sluggishly, but humbly at the feet of God, and
contented to have him to be your God, and for
ever to be disposed of in any thing by God, if
he will fulfill his covenant in you, contented to
part with any sinne, if he will rend it from you,
contented to know any truth if he will reveale
it to you, contented to do any duty if he will
enable you, contented to shine bright with all
his glorious graces, if he will create and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
them in you, contented to beare any evill
if he will lay his hand under your head, and
thereunto strengthen you; and so seeing the
Lord promised to undertake the work for some,
put out the work, and put over your Soule to
him, that he would fulfill the good that his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
promiseth in your selfe. Now when you
do thus, which (no question) you and many a
Soul doth, many times reflect upon this act,
and see if you cannot or may not finde your selfe
by it under the condition of some conditionall
promise, and if you do, then are you bound to
believe all Gods promises are and will be <hi>Yea</hi>
and <hi>Amen</hi> unto you. Now that you do so by
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100598:21"/>
this act, it selfe speake: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ainely, for how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
conditionall promises <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> made to the meek?
<hi>Blessed are the meek, Mat.</hi> 5. and to the hum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble?
whom god will raise up. For this is not
saving meekenesse, to be quietly contented to
be, or to do, or to bear any thing that the Lord
will have me from mine owne strength and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
but to be, to do, or to bear any thing
that the Lord will have me, if the Lord enable
me. Many a stout heart would gladly have
Christ, but if he cannot have him in his owne
termes, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ and his lusts, Christ and the
world too, or by his owne strength and power,
he will have none of him, but desperately casts
him away, and saith, what shall I looke after
him any more? I cannot pray, I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
I cannot breake this vile and unruly will,
this stony adamant heart, thus the pride of a
mans heart workes. Now he that is truly
meekned and humbled, he is contented gladly
to have God his God, and Christ his Redeemer,
and that upon Jesus Christ his owne termes.
First, on his owne covenant; now what is that?
why it is this, I will give you the good, and
worke in you the condition too; I will give
you my selfe, and therefore will not sticke to
give you an eye to see, and a heart to receive
too. This is the covenant; now hereupon a
humbled Soul accepts of Christ according to his
covenant, on his owne termes thus, <hi>viz.</hi> upon
that condition Lord, that thou wilt humble me,
teach me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perswade me, cause me to believe,
and in every thing to honour thee; Lord, I am
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100598:21"/>
contented gladly and joyfully to have thee, doe
therefore what thou wilt with me. Just as a
sicke man tells his Physician, who comes not to
him on thesetermes, If you will make your self
halfe whole, then I will cure you, and doe the
rest for you; but being utterly unable to cure,
or to know how to cure himselfe, he tells his
Physician, I am content you should begin and
perfect the cure, and so honour your skill and
love in me, to be contented to take any thing if
you will give it me, and if I offer to resist that,
you should bind me, and so do any thing with
me.</p>
            <p>2. The second act is, earnestly to long and
come to Christ, to cleave unto Jesus Christ by
servent and ardent desire, that he would make
good those absolute promises to you, seeing that
they are made to some, and that they doe not
exclude you; for when you ponder well, and
see what wonderfull great things the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
to some, whose heart cannot but be stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up to say, as that woman in another case,
<hi>Lord, give me of that watè<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to drinke?</hi> and as
they in the fifth of John, <hi>Lord, evermore give
us that bread.</hi> Now doing this, reflect upon
this Second act, and see if unto it, no conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
promise belongs, and you shall find an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative
answer from the word. For what is
this longing after the good, not of some (which
many hypocrites do) but of all the promises,
but that which the Scripture calls thirsting, who
are commanded to <hi>come and drink of the waters
of life freely.</hi> Isa. 55. 1, 2. and hungring, to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100598:22"/>
which all good things are promised, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 6.
and which comming to Christ (as I spake even
now) who hath given this as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irst fruit of
eternall election, and which kind of people he
will never cast away, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 37. Now when
you see these promises belonging unto you, why
dare you not conclude but that all these absolute
ones are yours also.</p>
            <p>3. The third act is this, Seeing God hath
promised absolutely such good things in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Covenant, but hath not set downe the
time when, or how much grace he will give;
and seeing onely he can helpe, therefore looke
up, and waite upon the Lord in the use of all
knowne meanes, untill he makes good what
he hath promised to do, and performe, and
worke for you. Say as beggars that have but
one doore to go to for bread, if none heare, or
hearing help not, lay themselves downe at
the doore, and say, I will wait here, I am sure
I perish if I goe away, or quarrell with them
in the house, because they helpe me not so soon
as I would, and therefore I will waite, for it
may be their compassions may move them as
they passe by to helpe me. So doe you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a Soul comes and longs for the good of the
promises, but if the Lord doe not speedily help
him, he goes with discouragements, fears, and
discontents, or despair, or sinne away, and saith
one of these two things, either I shall never
have helpe, or I come not truly, and hence I
feel no helpe. Oh remember that bread is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be had at the doore, to be distributed when
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100598:22"/>
the Lord seeth need, not when we would, or
thinke wee have need, and therefore wait
here and say, if I perish, here I will, at the
feet of God, and at the feet of the promises and
covenant of God, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now reflect upon this act, and see if you
may not finde some conditionall promise an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
unto it, which surely you may, and I will
name you but two, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 29, 30, 31. and
<hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 4. and if the conditionall promise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to such a Soul, you may easily conclude
the absolute promises are your owne, and the
chiefest use you are to make of them when you
know them that they are your owne, is to
presse God to make them good daily to you:
and to believe as verily and really, as if you had
the performance of them, that they shall. It
may be you will aske me, how shall I know
whether I have these conditions truly in me?
I answer, sincerity is a very witnessing grace,
the frequent meditation of the Scripture will
give you much light, to judge of the sincerity
of them, and that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speakes
1 Cor. 2. 12. I say unto you, <hi>We have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the spirit of the World, but of God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we know.</hi> (or may know) <hi>the things that are
freely given to us of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, If he be out of the covenant, but
yet God begins to worke with some common
worke of his grace upon him: all that I would
say to him, and all the use he can make of such
absolute promises, consists in these things.</p>
            <p>1. Let him consider the freenes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of Gods
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100598:23"/>
promise, whereby he may be stirred up to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
some hope it may be made good to him in
time. For the promise is very free and large, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
none (except those that sin unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly)
be their sinnes and natures never so vile
before God, and yet not including any by name,
for that is in the conditionall promise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
hence such an one is to make this use of it, who
knowes but the Lord may have pitty upon
me in time; and so hang thy hope upon
him.</p>
            <p>2. Let him consider the worth and price of
Gods promise bought by blood, and for which
some men would give a thousand worlds for the
benefit and comfort of; and hereby raise up his
heart, as by the freenesse of it to hope, so by
the price of it to esteem of the thing promised, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
pearls, and all the honour and pomp of the
world.</p>
            <p>3. Let him consider the fulnesse of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
which is a plaister as big as his sore, just
answerable to all his wants, nay infinitely more
large then his wants. And surely these three
things will draw his heart to long for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and then you know what is conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
promised and bequeathed to them that thirst:
For similitude is the ground of love. Now
when the fulnesse of the promise is seen, there
will appeare such a suteablenesse and fitnesse of
the promise to his soule, that hee cannot
but long for it.<note place="margin">Quest.</note> Thus much for the fifth trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>Your sixth trouble set downe in two heads,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100598:23"/>
put into one for brevity, <hi>viz.</hi> secret unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to seeke God in the strictest sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mn servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
before you enter into them; wearinesse
of them while they last, and glad when they
are gone: the reasons which you mention are,
partly feare of not using them aright, together
with melancholy, and lastly, the strictnesse of
them.<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is very true, there is abundance of wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in our hearts, which naturally seeke to
have their liberty abroad, and cannot endure to
be pent in the narrow room of holy performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
extraordinary duties, &amp;c. no more then chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
can be pent up from their play. And hence
it is weary of them, and glad to think of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tures
and ends. And truly it is one of the most
grievous miseries that a holy heart can feel, and
I beseech the Lord of heaven and earth to keepe
you, and me, and all his for ever, while wee
are here in our valley, under the sense of such
distempers as our greatest misery. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me thought it was a solemn sweet speech
of an honest man to his friend, who seeing him
oppressed with such distempers as you mention,
and perceiving him to droop under them, hee
came chearefully to him, and suddenly said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, I can tell you good newes, the best that
ever you heard, <hi>viz.</hi> Assoon as ever you are
in Heaven, you shall serve Christ without wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse:
Which words well thought on, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
the man. That which I would speak with
as much tendernesse of compassion as I am able
to you, I refer to these things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:100598:24"/>
1. That a child of God is never usually wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uty, but rather of his vile heart, to
thinke of, and to looke upon, that in the duty
<hi>Christs yoke is easie, and his burthen light,</hi> to
him that takes it on his necke, and puts his Soul
under it. The duty nakedly considered in it
selfe, is glorious in his eyes, and sweet to his
Soule, and hence sometimes never well, but
when he considers his dead, blinde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> barren, and
senselesse heart that he is to carry to the duty,
and that he feares, and hath felt will abide with
him in the duty: Oh! this grieves, here the
Soule pincheth. An Hypocrite is weary of the
duty, a childe of God rejoyceth in it, but hee
is weary of his sinne, and unsavourinesse and
wearinesse in the duty. I perswade my selfe
Sir that you may soone mistake your spirit here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
you thinke you are unwilling to come to
the duty; and are weary of it, when indeed,
it is your glory, joy, and love; but it is because
you feare you can doe it no better, that troubles
you, that you have such a vile heart in it. And
if your trouble be from hence, the good Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
it in you daily; and withall, blesse the Lord
and say, Lord, though I am weary of my vile
heart, in these daies of humiliation, in these
Sabbaths, yet I blesse thee, the daies and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
themselves thou knowest are deare unto
me, It is not Lord because I am weary of thy
word, but because I can doe it no better, I am
weary of my selfe, and this vile heart; here
is much love in such a spirit to the Lord. And
believe it Sir, your love wants not its recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100598:24"/>
and remember that the Lord respects
you not according to your duties done, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your love in them, and to them.
And therefore those duties you are ashamed
to owne, the Lord will not be ashamed to
crown.</p>
            <p>2. Consider you must and shall be baited
with these distempers of heart, sometimes
more, and sometimes lesse, as long as you live.
It is part of <hi>Pauls</hi> body of death which hee
must carry with him, till he come to bury him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <p>3. Those means which may helpe you to be
freed from them (a little at least) are these a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
many.</p>
            <p>1. Be but truly and really, not by fits and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
sensible of them, men in deep miseries, are
not unwilling to be helped out.</p>
            <p>2. Judge ye not rigorously of God, although
he we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e a bloody austere God, as he did of his
master whose talent he had, and hence never
improved it; but looke upon God as having a
Fathers heart and affection towards you in the
meanest and greatest performances; which
is double, either to give you strength to do
what you cannot <hi>(I can do all things through
Christ)</hi> or having come to him for it, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of what you would do for him, as if it
were done; and this will make you joy in the
poorest performance, that though it be never
so full of vilenesse, yet the Lord out of his father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
love, accepts of it as glorious.</p>
            <p>3. Renew morning and evening by sad and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100598:25"/>
solemne meditation, the sense of Gods love to
you in Christ; and in every duty that he sets you
about, and love will love and like the yoke,
and make the commandements that they shall
not be grievous to you.</p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly done with your new trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
which you mention, you say, because you
may not have the like opportunity of writing
again. It may be so, and therefore I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to satisfie you, which I beseech the Lord
himself to do.</p>
            <p>Next you come to reply to my first Letter,
of which I have kept no copy, as I never did
of any, and hence may and doe forget what I
writ then unto you. So much light as your
Letter lends me to bring things to mind, I
will gladly take, and be more briefe in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
            <p>You finde the strength of grace to be got in
you rather by argumentation,<note place="margin">Quest. 1.</note> then inward
communication and influence arising from the
union to Christ. And this troubles you.</p>
            <p>To which I answer these three things.<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. That as the old sinnefull nature is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
from <hi>Adam</hi> the first to us, without any
argumentation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so the new nature, which is
the seed, foundation, and plot of all grace, is
diffused into us by the second <hi>Adam</hi> when we
are united to him, without argumentation. It
is onely by divine operation. The Lord leave
not me, nor any friend I have, to a naked Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
illumination and perswasion.</p>
            <p>2. That to the increase of those habits, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100598:25"/>
drawing out the acts of the new creature, the
Lord is pleased to use morall and rationall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions;
as in the instance you gave, Christ
died for us, then hence the love of Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straines:
but remember withall, It is not the
bare meditation, or strength of reason or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
that elicits such divine and noble acts
in the heart and affection, but it is the blood of
Christ sprinkling these serious meditations, that
makes them worke such graces in the Soule;
which I might shew at large: which blood is
the salve, though argumentation is the cloth or
leather to which it sticks, and by which it is
applied; but from such leather comes no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
all of it is from the blood of christ, which
by argumentation heales the Soule. For if it
were nakedly in the argumentation to stir your
heart, and to worke strength of grace, what
should be the reason that some times you are no
more moved by all your argumentations, then
a mountaine of brasse is by the windes? why
should the same truth affect you at one time,
and not at another, when you are as fitly dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
be affected as at the first? Therefore consider
it is not your reason and argumentation, but
Christs blood that doth all, by as admirable, and
yet secret operation.</p>
            <p>3. Your union to Christ on your part is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
and partly wrought by the understanding,
and hence the good that you get by it at any
time, it is from your union, or part of it at
lest.</p>
            <p>Againe you aske me,<note place="margin">Quest. 2.</note> whether <hi>Calvin</hi> doth
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100598:26"/>
not expresse fully my thoughts about our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
union, in his <hi>lib. 4. cap.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>I answer, I have forgot what he hath writ,<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
and my selfe have read long since out of him,
and for the present I have no bookes about
me where I am, and therefore cannot satisfie
you in this, neither know I when I shall seeke
to finde out the booke and place; If I have
leisure, I will either write to you, or tell some
of your friends before I am gone, what he hath
said or writ that way, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Againe thirdly,<note place="margin">Quest. 3.</note> You desire me to tell you
how my selfe came to the cure of Atheisticall
thoughts, and whether they did weare out,
or whether they were rationally overthrown.</p>
            <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> at first they did wear out, mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with fruitlesse and dead-hearted company,
which was at the University.</p>
            <p>2. The Lord awakened me again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and
bid me beware lest an old sore broke out again:
and this I found that strength of reason would
commonly convince my understanding that
there was a God, but I felt it utterly insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to perswade my will of it unlesse it was by
fits, when as I thought Gods Spirit moved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Chaos of those horrible thoughts; and
this I thinke will be found a truth.</p>
            <p>3. I did groane under the bondage of those
unbelieving thoughts, looking up, and sighing
to the Lord, that if he were as his workes and
word declared him to be, he would be pleased
to reveale himselfe by his owne beames, and
perswade my heart by his owne Spirit of his
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100598:26"/>
Essence and being, which if he would do, I
should account it the greatest mercy that ever
he shewed me. And after grievous and heavy
perplexities, when I was by them almost for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to make an end of my selfe and sinnefull life,
and to be mine owne Executioner, the Lord
came between the bridge and the water, and
set me out of anguish of spirit, (as she prayed
for a child) to pray unto him for light in
the midst of so great darkenesse; In which
time he revealed himselfe, manifested his love,
stilled all those raging thoughts, gave returne
in great measure of them; so that though I
could not read the Scripture without blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
thoughts before, now I saw a
glory, a majesty, a mistery, a depth in it, which
fully perswaded, and which light (I desire to
speake it to the glory of his free grace, seeing
you call me to it) is not wholly put out, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
while I desire to walk closely with him,
unto this day. And thus the Lord opened mine
eyes, and cured me of this misery; and if any such
base thoughts come (like beggers to my doore)
to my minde, and put these scruples to me,
I use to send them away with this answer, Why
shall I question that Truth, which I have both
knowne and seen.</p>
            <p>But you say this remedy is good,<note place="margin">Object.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,
but that you cannot use it, especially because
you question the truth of God.</p>
            <p>Yet (deare Sir) give not over this Trade,<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
you will doubtlesse finde it gainefull, when it
may be God hath laden you more with these
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100598:27"/>
thoughts, and made you loath your selfe for
them. But the thing seemes strange to me, if
I mistake you not, <hi>viz.</hi> that your heart will
not be perswaded, but that you must resolve
your doubts concerning the perfection of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
not by seeking to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rmonise those passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
that seeme to crosse one another, but by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing
some humanity or error, (if I may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
you) to the pen-men, seeing St. <hi>Paul</hi>
saith, <hi>We prophesy but in part.</hi> and seeing one of
the Evangelists leaves out the doxology in the
Lords prayer.</p>
            <p>Sir, if you take these thoughts, arising from
these and the like grounds, as your burden, I do
not blame you, but pitty you in that respect;
but if your judgement indeed thinke so, I am
sorry you should harbonr such thoughts one
houre within doores: for you know that holy
men writ the Scriptures (but so far they might
erre, but it is added) as they were inspired,
or (as the Originall hath it) as they were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
or carried in the armes of the holy Ghost,
and so how could they erre? how could God
lie? It is true, <hi>Paul</hi> did prophesie but in part,
and is this an argument, because he did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
fully, therefore in some things he did
not prophesie truly; I am perswaded you will
say there are many things my poore thoughts
have suggested to you, as true; and yet I am
perswaded I doe in them prophesie (if I may
so say) but in part. The Spirit of God dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
the foure Evangelists to write, yet so, as
they did not all write what another writ, but in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100598:27"/>
great wisdome left some things doubtfull, and
short in one, which are more cleare and full in
another: and hence the Doxologie is fully set
downe in one, and not in another, and many
reasons I could set you downe why, but that
it is needlesse. I grant you ought not to put up
all with a charitable opinion of Scripture, but
if you can, by reason, reading, and comparing,
helpe your heart to a full perswasion, this is
Scripture: but many things you cannot get
satisfaction for, by that way and meanes, but
still your Spirit will be left darke and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
What course will you here take for resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is Scripture? The Papists say it is
so, because the Church hath christned it for
Scripture; you say you will see reason for it that
it is so, or else you cannot be satisfied, then I
feare you wil never be satisfied. (I thinke) In
this case therefore these two things you are to
do,</p>
            <p>1. To go to God by prayer, to give you a
resolution of all your doubts, and by some
meanes or other, some light to see whether
this is his word or not, Secondly, if this be his
word, that he would perswade your heart of it,
that it is so: For the least resolution which is
Scripture, and which is not, is made by the
same perswasion, and sole perswasion of the
same Spirit that writ the Scripture. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Angels that appeared to <hi>Mary.</hi> see
<hi>Gerard.</hi> and he briefly, (I thinke) will satisfie
you: In your answer to the particular scruples
about the Scripture sense, and the dissonancy
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100598:28"/>
of them. Onely this I will adde to the last
clause about these things, that if the Scripture
be inspired by the holy Ghost, and that not in
the sum and substance of it, but to every word
and sentence of it, which I thinke you will not
doubt of, when you have considered it, then I
thinke it will undeniably follow, that the same
Spirit of truth is also a Spirit of order, and hence
the method of various penning of it, is from
the Spirit too, which you say you sticke at.</p>
            <p>Againe to your third thing,<note place="margin">Answ. 2.</note> concerning your
spirit being burthened with involuntary infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as burdens, but not as sinnes. I say nothing
now, because I perceive by one part of your
reply that the Lord hath done you some good
by the first answer, onely it is your griefe you
cannot feare them, nor condemn your selfe for
them, as damning sinnes. For satisfaction of
which, I hope this reply to your second trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
will give you some satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Againe to your fourth question,<note place="margin">Quest. 4.</note> to know
whether these changes you have sometimes,
and these movings of the Spirit, are not of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
temper, or Gods Spirit. It seemes I
did a little mistake the meaning, because you
meant not the maine worke of grace, but oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional
stirrings and movings of heart, as by
reading some pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heticall Letter, your Spirit is
moved with joy or sorrow, which it may be
will not be stirred at some other time, as by
drinking a cup of wine, the spirit is made more
chearfull and lively, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I answer these three things.<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:100598:28"/>
1. First, That it is very usuall for naturall
affections to be raised by a naturall temper, as
by drinking, eating, noveltinesse of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<hi>Iohn</hi>'s candle flies were ravished with the
Gospel: People are naturally moved some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by a thundering Minister, yet never a
whit the more grace, &amp;c. and it is a good speech
of Doctor <hi>Ames:</hi> Arminian universall grace
(as they describe it) may be the effect of a good
dinner sometimes.</p>
            <p>2. That though the being of grace depends
not upon the temper of the body, yet the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of grace, and many gifts of grace, together
with the feeling of it doth. And hence a good
dinner, and sometimes wine to a sad melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
(if gracious) heart may remove <hi>rem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibentem</hi>
that may keepe grace, as joy and
thankefullnesse from working, and so take the
grace and draw it out, not create and diffuse
the grace: The Prophet called (you know)
for a Minstril, which some thinke, (and that
upon good grounds) was to raise up his heavy
heart, and make him chearfull and fit to speake,
the body is the instrument, which if it be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
the best grace will hardly sound, but if
whole, then they will.</p>
            <p>3. If you would know when these things
onely draw out grace, or make a thing like un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o
grace in the Soul, I answer, by these two things
chiefly.</p>
            <p>1. If it be true grace, it ever makes you
more humble and vile in your owne eyes, and
say, Lord, why dost thou give me any desire
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100598:29"/>
to thee, any cheerfulnesse in serving thee?
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. It makes you more thankefull, and to
blesse the Lord that he thus remembers you, for
this is a standing rule, what ever comes from
nature, and a mans selfe, it ever builds up it
selfe, and returnes to selfe againe; what ever
grace comes from Christ, it drives a man out
of himselfe, by making him humble, and draws
him unto Christ that sent him, by making him
thankfull; I thinke all grace, and stirrings, and
movings, that have not this double effect in
some measure, are to be suspected, and if they
have, it is dangerous to doubt whether they are
true or no.</p>
            <p>5. Again, Your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ifth thing about providence,
you say you cannot see a positive providence,
although you do see a negative providence in all
your occasions, and comforts, and crosses, you
meet withall, as namely, you can thanke God
for not taking away your life, &amp;c. but you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see God giving it.</p>
            <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> 1. Consider what I writ to you at
first about this question in generall.</p>
            <p>2. Ponder sadly whether any creature or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenance
to it, hath its being from it selfe, or
from the will and word of God, <hi>viz.</hi> I will
have such a man to be, and such a memory to
be, &amp;c. I thinke you will say nothing can
make it selfe, therefore here is a positive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
in having life, liberty, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. Consider whether the same will and word
that gives it a being, together with all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100598:29"/>
to it, doth not also give it act and
motion. That it is so, I thus demonstrate it.
1. Every creature is made for an end, for no
wise efficient, but workes for some wise end.
2. That no creature can lead it selfe to its end,
if sinnefull or irrationall. 3. God must and doth
lead it by its severall acts and movings to
that end. Hence 4. Every act is determined by
God.</p>
            <p>And although I grant some creatures move
freely, some necessarily, yet it is from a posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
will and providence that they move, act
and see. Therefore you see what cause there
is to see a positive providence in every thing.</p>
            <p>Concerning the rest of your letter, Oh that
I had time and heart to write more, yet I hope
I have writ enough for this time, and the Lord
knowes whether evermore or no. However
I thanke you heartily for improving me this
way of writing, who have my mouth slopt
from speaking. I wish I had more such friends
to deale thus with me, and my selfe more time,
and a more fruitfull head and heart to improve
my selfe, this, or any other like way for them:
For who knowes what breathings of Gods
Spirit are lost for want of writing, especially
when there is no season of speaking. Truly Sir,
I meet with few that are much troubled in that
manner as your selfe, but they goe on in an
easie, quiet, and very dangerous way: which
troubles (I perswade my selfe) keep you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waking,
when other virgins are slumbring, and
after which (I am perswaded) the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100598:30"/>
to use you for more then common service,
if you wade well through them; however as
I said before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be not discouraged, or too much
perplexed in sorrow for them. For surely, as
farre as I can guesse, the Lord is preparing you
for himselfe by them. I shall not forget you,
though I never saw you: and I beseech you
if you have any sparke of affection toward me,
kindled by these few lines, remember when
you are best able to pray for your selfe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
to looke after me and mine, and all
that go with me on the mighty waters, and
then to looke up and sigh to Heaven for me,
that the Lord would out of his free grace but
bring me to that good land, and those glorious
Ordinances, and that there I may but behold the
face of the Lord in his Temple, though hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
delight to use me there, though I and mine
should possibly beg there, and that if the Lord
should call me to my solemne worke and service
for the good of his Church and People, and
company that goe with me, or are gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me, that then the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ord Jesus would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale
his secrets to me, and enable me the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time I have to live, to bef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uitfull to him,
and to have a larger heart then ever for him.
As for your selfe, I shall desire the Lord to keep
you blamelesse and unspotted in an evill world,
and that as he hath begun, so he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and crowne his divine graces and worke
in you, and that you may be preserved from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
sins, which shortly bring National and
most heavy plagues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:100598:30"/>
And the presence of the Lord may abide
with you, and in you, untill the Lord call for
you. Remember my kinde love to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whose name I have forgot, and by whom
I could not send these lines, being then hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by businesse. Now the peace of Jesus
Christ be with you and keepe you upright and
blamelesse till death. And if I never see you
more till the last and great day, then Farewell,
Farewel.</p>
