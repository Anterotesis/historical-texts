            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Kingdome and City.</head>

            <p>
               <hi>MEMORANDVM,</hi> That upon the day above ſet, <hi>Iohn Dias</hi>
one of Colonell <hi>Whaleys</hi> Regiment, and Kinſman, did utter
theſe ſpeeches following:</p>
            <p>That the reſolution of the Army was to fight for themſelves, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all that ſhould oppoſe them; and that they reſolved not to bee
governed by a King, and that nothing vexed them more, then the
Parliaments recalling their Declarations of making no more addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to the King.</p>
            <p>And being asked why they did not declare; he anſwered,</p>
            <p>That yet it was no time, but that ſhortly, hee did not doubt, but
that all would be their owne, and then they would make their reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
knowne.</p>
            <p>It was replied, that if the Army ſhould thus declare, it was likely
the City and Kingdome would riſe. He anſwered,</p>
            <p>They regarded not the City, but could fire it at pleaſure.</p>
            <p>It was likewiſe inquired, How the Generall had performed his
word with the King and Kingdome, in re-eſtabliſhing the King, and
reſtoring the Kingdome to peace. He anſwered,</p>
            <p>The Generall never intended any ſuch thing; and that for the
perſonall Treaty the Army would not ſuffer it, becauſe the City
would thinke they gained the honour of it; and that the Parliament
did Vote the perſonall Treaty only to delude the people, and to keep
them in ſuſpence while they had done their buſineſſe abroad.</p>
            <p>Hee likewiſe ſayd, Hee ſhould (or hoped) to ſee the City on fire
ſhortly. He further ſayd, That if the Kings Revenew were tenne
times ſo much more, it were the better for them; for the Crowne
Land would make many of the ſoldiers Gentlemen: and if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
you, then you ſhalbe our ſlaves; and if you conquer us, wee
wilbe your ſlaves; and further he ſayd, that this was not onely his
ſence, but likewiſe the ſence of the whole Army.</p>
