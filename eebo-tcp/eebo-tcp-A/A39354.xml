            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving been lately informed, that a <hi>French</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster now in <hi>London,</hi> being found Guilty of Spreading the Doctrine of the SOCINIANS, is said to pretend to be a <hi>Quaker;</hi> and having a long time thought it my Duty to do what in me Lies, to take off that <hi>harmless</hi> sort of Men, that are call'd <hi>Quakers</hi> from that <hi>Popular Odium,</hi> which by some Persons they have been most <hi>Unjustly</hi> exposed unto, I make this <hi>Address</hi> to you, being known to have Writ against them, but a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109232:2"/>
Person of more Learning and Candor than any other that I have yet known to have Written against them; most earnestly Entreating you by the Love we owe to <hi>all Mankind,</hi> that you would be pleased to concur with me in my present Endeavours to vindicate these Men, from that unjust Imputation, <hi>viz. That they are SOCINIANS.</hi> You know <hi>R. Barkley,</hi> in his <hi>Apology, P.</hi> 84. says expresly. <q>If (the Doctrine Concerning the <hi>Light within</hi> contradicts, overturns, and enervates the false Doctrine of the <hi>Pelagians, Semi-pelagians, SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CINIANS</hi> and others, who exalt the Light of Nature, [and] the Liberty of Mans Will, in that it wholly excludes the Natural man from having any place, or portion in his own Salvation, by any Acting, Working, or moving of his own, untill he be first quickned, raised up, and acted by Gods Spirit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clement Lake</hi> (one of those they call <hi>Quakers)</hi> in one of his Letters (lately Publisht) to <hi>John Flavel</hi> an <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Preacher</hi> has these Words, in Answer to <hi>Flavels</hi> Charge, That the <hi>Quakers</hi> lead men to Obedience to the <hi>Light within for Salvation:</hi> 
               <q>We press Obedience to the <hi>Light within,</hi> we own who is <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> the <hi>Light of Israel</hi> the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> who is given to be a <hi>Covenant to the People,</hi> and a <hi>Light to the Gentiles, to open the blind eyes</hi> Esa 42. 6, 7. This was <hi>Davids</hi> Light to his Feet, and Lanthorn to his Paths, <hi>Ps.</hi> 119. 115. And this Word, or Light, or Jesus was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and <hi>in him was life, and the life was the Light of men,</hi> John 1. 8.</q> Can those Men be SOCINIANS, who acknowledge that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is the <hi>True Light</hi> In every Man, which he could not be, if he were not <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite?</hi> I must bear my Testimony to this <hi>Crooked and Perverse Generation,</hi> That <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> being the True,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109232:2"/>
and Eternal GOD is IN every Man, <hi>Converting</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing</hi> him in order to his <hi>Conversion,</hi> or (in proportion to the <hi>Repugnancy</hi> he makes against the <hi>Divine Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) Tormenting</hi> him: I say <hi>Tormenting</hi> him, not <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly</hi> but <hi>Consequentially,</hi> as the <hi>Torment</hi> or <hi>Vexation of a Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Rational Soul,</hi> is the <hi>Natural Result</hi> of all <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy</hi> to THE TRUE LIGHT, which is the INFI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITY of <hi>Goodness.</hi> I further Testify, and shall be ever ready, by the Grace of God to maintain the Assertion (which I hope by you will not be denied) that 'tis pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for any man (that has not made up the full Measure of Iniquity) at all times, and in all places, by a Sincere Dependance upon the Power and Virtue of the LIGHT WITHIN, MANIFESTING any Action to be <hi>Sinful,</hi> to conceive an <hi>Aversion</hi> to it. I desire your Candid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the Answer I shall here give to one Passage in your First Treatise Concerning the <hi>Divine Light,</hi> p. 65. <q>I had no Reason to confine it (as the <hi>Quakers</hi> do) to Divine and Spiritual Truths, but to extend it to all Truth without Exception, which I suppose to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceivable in this Divine Light, which as being the very Essence of God, must be equally exhibitive of all.</q> To this I answer, First that the <hi>Quakers</hi> speaks of the LIGHT with reference to his being INCARNATE, And so 'tis mani est, whatsoever Influence he has upon the Souls of Men, it is in Order to their <hi>Sanctification,</hi> it shews nothing else but <hi>Sanctifying Truth.</hi> Secondly, I assert, that all Truth is <hi>Divine, Sanctifying Truth,</hi> which being <hi>Rightly apprehended,</hi> will most certainly carry the Soul to GOD, the PRIME VERITY, the <hi>Fountain of all Being.</hi> You say, you suppose all Truth to be equally Perceivable in this Divine Light. We grant that all such Truth, the <hi>Consideration</hi> whereof is for the Pesent Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sane
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109232:3"/>
to our <hi>Sanctification,</hi> is Perceivable in this <hi>Divine Light.</hi> There are many things in your Publisht Writings that deserve the thanks of all Men, particularly your Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Mr. <hi>Locks</hi> Conceit that we have no <hi>Innate Idea of God;</hi> For whose sake I beseech you to own the <hi>Truth,</hi> wheresoever your find it, and I shall ever remain</p>
