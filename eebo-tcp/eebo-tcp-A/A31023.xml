            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Prince (being subject to that only disadvantage of honest hearts credulity) assures his Army of his quick return, and hasts (so bold is innocence) to attend his Father, from whom he is met by a Messenger, certifying him, that the King, being by reason of some indisposition of health, unfit for busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, willed him to repose where that servant should carry him, till himself came to welcome h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

him, which they threw incessantly towards his neck, so that he sent three of them to the Devil, the other four reinforced their violence, and at last fastned on him, who, quite spent with rage and opposals fell down, as dead. The Canibals pursue their cruel cowardize, and had surely finished their intent, had not the King (who was a private spectato<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>) toucht with some remorse, stepped forth, and commanded only that his tired Arms should be pinnion'd; and ere he had fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his senses, made an hot flaming steel be drawn before his eyes, which (though giving no great pain) yet took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his eye-sight, forever forbidding him any more s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus by the excessive impiety of an unnatu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al Father, has <hi>Asia</hi> lost her chiefest Jewel, <hi>Mars</hi> his Darling, and <hi>Persia</hi> her incomparable Treasure; at once undone, blind, imprisoned, and hopeless of any joy or honour ever after; the cruel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of which, soon drave the inraged Prince into madness, and thirst of revenge, all the effects whereof were frequent with him, till his afflicted friends and officers flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about him, and dictated patience, which they bettered by relating their own quondam greatness in blood and offices, till by the same dislike, and mutability of King <hi>Abbas</hi> his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours they were degraded, trod upon, mutilated, some their eyes put out, some their ears and noses cut off, others captivated, and near famished, so truly said it is
<q>Solamen miseris so cios habuisse doloris.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The grand enemy to the Prince, that infatuated King <hi>Abbas</hi> to this cruelty, was <hi>Mahomet-ally-beg</hi> his principall favourite, a person raised to that height from so obscure a descent, that he knew no further then his Father; yet (like most mean men hoisted to extraordinary preferment,) he grew so over ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, as to aim at the Crown; in order to which design, his first care was to remove the Prince, the Bulwark and <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladium</hi> of <hi>Persia,</hi> and his family; next, to disband the Kings Armies, what dishonourable condititions soever were granted to the <hi>Turk,</hi> that no ready forces should be left to oppose him when he should break out. One of his Instruments to besot the King to this, was one of his <hi>Concubines,</hi> whom he knew to be strong in his affections; <hi>so dangerous Serpents are they in the bosomes of Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Kings unfortunate credulity, gave <hi>Ally-beg</hi> a pretence
<pb facs="tcp:57524:8"/>
specious enough to take Arms, as but to obtain the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the young Prince <hi>Soffie,</hi> and to assure the people of his safety against the dangerous anger of his jealous Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father: <hi>So essential a beginning of all rebellions, is a smooth and fair pretence either of Reformation or safety.</hi> But here a while leave we <hi>Allybeg</hi> brooding over his design, co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>In these unpleasant times, the King, (moving like <hi>Saturn</hi> in the highest Orbe) stood free and firm against all storms, giving himself all the variety of pleasures; but none took him so much, as the beauty and pretty discourse he observed in <hi>Fatyma,</hi> daughter to his blinded and inraged Son; which little Lady he took into his Court for his pastime; and though not above seven years old, she so captivated his doating mind, with her blooming, yet commanding Graces, that nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished well without <hi>Fatyma,</hi> none gave him mirth save <hi>Fatyma,</hi> and if inrag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t to marry with an <hi>Arabian</hi> King.</p>
            <p>Nor had King <hi>Abbas</hi> alone, all the favour and benefit of this little Princess; for though she had all possible pleasure at the Court, yet neglected she no part of duty, but came very often into the Cittadel to joy her Parents, and relieve their wants; for none, save she, durst ask the King for their allowances, without apparent danger of displeasure, and life w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>thall; whereby the royal, but most miserable prisoners, were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times near famished, none daring to relieve them, lest the jealous King might have them in suspition.</p>
            <p>Thus by this child of virtue, and innocence, gained they what they pined for, food and comfort. But behold the effects of mad melancholy! it ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this Rage he spent two sad dayes, and in the third, with a Roman resolution, gave a period to his sufferings in this world, by quaffing off a cup of poyson, to the confusion of his unnatural Father.</p>
            <p>The sad Princess his Wife (like a true Turtle) surfeiting with sorrow, mew'd her self up, and since that time, has seldom been seen by any.</p>

                  <l>An't please your Royall Highness, the last sally</l>
                  <l>'Twas my fortune to make two young men Prisoners,</l>
                  <l>Whom by their civill fashion and demeanour,</l>
                  <l>I judg'd and found to be men of the Book,</l>

                  <l>Something of war, then any way expert</l>
                  <l>In these rough meetings: these I had into</l>
                  <l>My Tent, where being well warm'd with (4.) <hi>Shiras</hi> wine,</l>
                  <l>They fell into a freedom of discourse,</l>
                  <l>And, among other things, assured me,</l>
                  <l>They in the City had receiv'd a Promise</l>
                  <l>From <hi>OSMANHELI,</hi> their old Governour,</l>
                  <l>Of succours within four dayes, for which service</l>
                  <l>He was prepar'd, and stay'd but for some Gallies,</l>
                  <l>And Frigots to convoy him, and inable him</l>
                  <l>To passe through our Fleet, which Navy he had</l>
                  <l>A good assurance would attend him shortly.</l>
                  <l>And these are th'onely hopes hold up their hearts,</l>
                  <l>And keep their Gates shut 'gainst your Royal Highness.</l>

But because no absolute judgement can bee made of the power of any Province by the number of parishes, see the forces of <hi>Cambaia: Maffeus</hi> writes that <hi>Bandurius,</hi> who, about the year 1536, ruled in <hi>Cambaia,</hi> (by what right he d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Elephants; beasts which they yet find usefull in war, so that in the year 1571. <hi>Idalcano</hi> had 60000. of them at the Siege of <hi>Goa.</hi> Nor let any wonder that this Prince ingrosses not all the Orient, for he has as potent neighbours as himself; as the King of <hi>Barma,</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> and others: besides, he is so shut up with Rocks, as he has no good egresse for his Armies; nor have those vast multitudes of men so much true strength as they carry terror; they sink with their own weight, are long gathering together, but not long held together; the numberlesse Army <hi>Marhumedius</hi> led against <hi>Cambaia,</hi> did not onely wast the regions where through it passed, but by devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all things that the earth yeilded, bereaved its selfe of sustenance: against such mighty impressions the way is to draw the warre out in length, and onely to stand upon the defensive: for such armies will soon waver, either for want of provision, scarcity of coin, infection of the air, or infirmities of their own bodies; as the inundations of <hi>Attila</hi> into <hi>Italie,</hi> and of <hi>Tamberlain</hi> into <hi>Asia,</hi> were but as running marches in comparison of what the <hi>Romans, Grecians, Macedonians, Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians, English, Guales,</hi> and <hi>Portugals,</hi> have done with more nimble power<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These Turbants they keep on continually, it being a shame with them, to be seen bare-headed: (perhaps because generally they wear no haire on the head or chin, (but on the upper lippe they have very long whiskers, and turned down-ward) some onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a lock of haire upon the top of the head, as a certaine note that <hi>Mahomet</hi> at Doomes-day, will distinguish them from Christians, and by it lift them up to paradise) so that Mr

               </p>
               <p>The same I find in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who indeed makes <hi>Pompey (in vit.

also agrees with him, where hee makes <hi>Ganges</hi> the utmost bounds of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Conquests; no small fame to this hill and river to bound the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Macedonian</hi> Empires, to remember the Poets words is not superfluous, at least so much of them as concern <hi>Ganges</hi> the subject of the next note.</p>

wrested he every thing to a divine honour, even his naturall defects, calling those fits of the falling sicknesse wherewith he was troubled, holy trances; and that Pigeon which he had taught to feed out of his Ear on pease, the holy Ghost.

Another fable concerning Angels, is in the first Chaper, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. Sc. That God sent two Angels, called <hi>Harod</hi> and <hi>Marod,</hi> as Judges to do justice in the City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> where in a Cave, for soliciting a Ladies chastity, they hang by the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, and must so hang till the day of judgement, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

It's like <hi>Mahomet</hi> might have heard somewhat of the story of <hi>Susanna</hi> and the Elders, and so ignorantly shuffled it into this. But to follow his Text; I would ask a <hi>Moorish</hi> Astrologer, whether the morning star be not more ancient then the City of <hi>Babylon</hi>; how then could an inhabitant of that City be turned into that star? And I would know of their Divines, why, if the Angels have bodies, the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in many places (contradicting it selfe) calls them <hi>Roch,</hi> Spirits? if they be spirits, and uncorporeal, how were they capable of knowing women, or hanging by the eye-lids? If they be Corporeal, where abouts in <hi>Babylon</hi> may one see them hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? and why doth the <hi>Alcoran</hi> confesse them to be Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits?</p>
               <p>Another ridiculous assertion of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> concerning Angels, is s. 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. and <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1. &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> That God made man of all sorts and colours of earth, and being formed, for some thousand of years laid him a baking in the Sun, untill he was pleased to breath life into him.

How did the Angels fall for not reverencing of man, when they were fallen before man was made, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying his standing, tempted him to his fall? and how could man lay a baking some thousand of yeares in the Sun, when the Sun was made but two dayes before man? <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.

Horrid and ridiculous are the Blasphemies and fooleries hee recounts of that his voyage to Heaven; as that he approached to God within little lesse then two shots of a Crossebow; and that God gave him many Lawes and Priviledges; as that he should be the most excellent, and select Creature that ever hee created in Heaven or Earth; and that he should be the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Redeemer, so that he had the impudence to call himselfe <hi>Almebi. i. e.</hi> He that takes away sins.

Yet, as this divine Jugler confesses, could not all this convert his Uncle, nor doth he bring his Uncles testimony or any others for the truth of it. Some will have the <hi>Turkes</hi> give a Crescent from hence, in honour of their Prophet: many others of his lying wonders I might recite, as that of the Angels lancing of his brest, and pulling out of the black Coar out of his heart, That of the Trees bowing to him, and that of the other two Trees comming at his command to shade him, when in the fields, in a hot day, he had occasion to untruffe; and infinite other of his contradictions and repugnances I might remember, as that of King <hi>Alexanders</hi> Journey from the <hi>East</hi> to the <hi>West,</hi> where he daily saw the Sun set in a hot Fountain; which oppugneth Philosophy, as the journey doth History, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But with these I have tired my self, and I am sure the Reader much more.

               <p>The first siege was long before, when she sided with <hi>Pescennius Niger,</hi> against the Emperour <hi>Severus,</hi> and held out three yeares against him, and almost all the forces of the world, During this time, she endured such a famine, that men meeting in the streets, would (as it were) with joynt consent, draw &amp; fight, the victor stil eating the vanquished. For want of Artillery to discharge on the assailants, the Citizens flung at them whole statuas of brasse, and the like curious Imagery. Houses they plucked downe to get Timber for shipping, the women cut off their hair to inch out their tacklings; and having thus patched up a Navy of 500 sayle, they lost it all in one Tempest.
