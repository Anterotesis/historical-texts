            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101020:3"/>
than I have experience of by verbal Communication, that are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly minded and diſpoſed, in relation to the late Religious Differences that have paſſed betwixt ſome and me in <hi>America,</hi> and that have begun betwixt ſome and me here in <hi>England,</hi> and in the City of <hi>London,</hi> who retain a free and unbyaſſed Judgment in themſelves, and are reſolved to ſee with their <hi>Own Eyes, and hear with their Own Ears, and to judge with that enlightned Underſtanding and Judgment that God giveth them: And to ſuch</hi> I recommend my <hi>Anſwer</hi> to <hi>Thomas Elwood,</hi> called, <hi>A Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Information,</hi> &amp;c. earneſtly intreating them to excuſe this my Juſt and Neceſſary Defence, firſt of the Truth, and next of my <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, and Chriſtian Reputation and Teſtimony,</hi> which this prejudiced per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>T. E.</hi> doth labour to take from me, by a ſordid way of Sophiſtical Wrangling, Perverſion, Forgery, and falſe Accuſations, which he hath heaped up againſt me, ſo that one would almoſt wonder that ſo many falſe Accuſations, Perverſions and Forgeries, as amount to the Number 50 and upwards, ſhould be contained in ſo little bounds as leſs than 5 ſheets of Print; 50 of which I have particularly noted and anſwered; and I earneſtly requeſt all the moderate, as above-mentioned, not to be offended with me, nor to take it as any evidence of my want of true love to Truth, or faithful Friends, but on the contrary, as an Evidence of my true love both to Truth and to faithful Friends, that I am thus conſtrained to appear in the Neceſſary Defence of Truth, and <hi>my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Chriſtian Teſtimony,</hi> which this prejudiced Adverſary ſeeketh to deſtroy: but I hope God will blaſt his evil endeavours, and diſappoint him and all that are joined with him in this evil Work. But I wiſh no evil to him or them, my deſire being (if it be the Will of God) that they may repent of it, and all other their evil ways, and be aſhamed, that ſo they may obtain mercy and forgiveneſs of God. And I appeal to all ſuch moderate, judicious and impartial perſons, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> Whether <hi>T. E.</hi> hath not ſhewed himſelf as a man hurried and carried away as with a Tempeſt and impetuous Current of Prejudice againſt me, not only to heap ſo many Perverſions, Miſ-repreſentations, Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and falſe Accuſations againſt me. But when he cannot heap up ſo many as he would, he goeth about, by an Art of Wrangling and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry of Words, to prove me guilty, when his Evidence in matter of Fact doth utterly fail him, even as a man would go before an Aſſize to prove one guilty of Theft or Felony, by falſe Syllogiſms, when his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is ſhort in matter of fact, thus arguing againſt an innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Some man is a Thief, but</hi> A. B. <hi>is ſome man, therefore</hi> A. B <hi>is a Thief.</hi> I appeal to all that know the Truth, whether this ſort of ſophiſtical ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing doth agree to that ſimplicity of Truth and Plainneſs, both of

Doctrine and Practice, that we generally have profeſſed. Have we war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Friends ſo much to <hi>beware leſt any spoil them through Philoſophy and vain Deceit, and impoſe upon them by the wiſdom of words;</hi> and hath it come to this iſſue at laſt, That a Book ſhall come out authorized or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed either by the <hi>Second Days Meeting</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> or at leaſt by a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or prevailing <hi>party</hi> of them; and without all Goſpel-Order or Church-Diſcipline uſed towards me, or the leaſt intimation to me, from any Meeting, that I am diſowned as a Member of their Society, and alſo contrary to the mind and declared ſenſe of ſome of their chief Members, and divers of the Miniſtry in and about <hi>London,</hi> not owning it. Yea, <hi>George Whitehead</hi> hath declared himſelf to me, paſſive, neither approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor diſapproving, not knowing how things may be duly or unduly charged, in matters of Fact. And for Doctrine, <hi>G. W.</hi> ſeemeth to agree with me in divers of his late Teſtimonies, tho publickly contradicted by ſome, the which book is ſtuffed and filled with a ſort of <hi>ſo, hiſtical arguing and wrangling,</hi> and alſo with <hi>many Perverſions, divers Forgeries in matter of fact, and many falſe accuſations,</hi> as my <hi>Anſwer,</hi> when publiſhed, ſhall, I hope, ſufficiently diſcover to ſuch as are willing to read, conſider and judg impartially, and have not pluckt out their Eyes, and given them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to ſuch as would deceive them, as ſome have done. And muſt all this be fathered upon the Spirit of God? it being their conſtant pretenſion to have the Spirit of God directing and counſelling them in all their Chamber-Affairs and Meetings. May I not well cry out, as one did in another caſe, <hi>O Times! O Manners!</hi> Or rahter with the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Be aſtoniſhed, O ye Heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid; be ye very deſolate, ſaith the Lord.</hi> May not that complaint and lamentation be juſtly taken up againſt the Publiſhers and Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this ſcandalous book of <hi>T. E. The wiſdom of the Wiſe is periſhed,</hi> &amp;c. But that which moſt of all ſeemeth ſtrange to me, and I believe will to many, when duly conſidered, that <hi>T. E.</hi> ſaith, by way of Reply to my <hi>Defence,</hi> the printed paper called, <hi>The Cauſeleſs Ground,</hi> &amp;c. which was, <hi>That notwithſtanding the Objections, and ſevere Accuſations that ſome have made againſt my late Books, and a ſtrict Examination of them, by ſome that have ſo complained, there is not any Line, or Sentence, in any of them, that they have made to appear to contain any untruth or falſhood in their, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in matters of Doctrine or Faith.</hi> See his book, <hi>p.</hi> 49. <hi>This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath nothing of Note in it.</hi> Yea, he ſaith farther ſuppoſing it were true, in fact, <hi>That no untruth or falſhood had been diſcovered in my</hi> books, <hi>

                  </gap>et it hath</hi> Nothing of Note <hi>in it,</hi> viz to <hi>excuſe me;</hi> he ſaying, it was not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per buſineſs of the <hi>Yearly Meeting</hi> (which he alledgeth I ſtrike at here, as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) to judg of the matters of fact contained in <hi>my books,</hi> which were
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101020:4"/>
alledged to have been done in <hi>America,</hi> by Perſons not here to anſwer or give Account of them. Is it not ſtrange to blame a man for ſome things in his Books that are neither matter of Doctrine nor matter of Fact; for what elſe can be contained in <hi>any books,</hi> I know not. And it's ſtrange, that the <hi>Yearly Meeting</hi> ſhould take up <hi>ſix Days, and Two Meetings each Day,</hi> to hear and examine matter of Fact altogether (for in nothing they medled with my Doctrine), and yet be ſo judged here by <hi>T. E. That it was not their proper buſineſs to judg of the matters of fact:</hi> for by his Judgment againſt the <hi>Yearly Meeting,</hi> they both med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and judged in that which was not their proper buſineſs. But the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per laid to be given out by the Yearly Meeting, called, <hi>A true account of the proceedings,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith expreſly, <hi>And this Meeting agreed, that after all the other publick affairs ſhould be over, as many Members of the yearly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as could attend the Service, together with all publick faithful Friends, that are free ſhould remain and continue the yearly Meeting, to hear, judg and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin, and endeavour to quiet all the differences betwixt</hi> G. K. <hi>and others concerned therein.</hi> Where it is plain, that he calleth, the Yearly Meeting did judg it their proper buſineſs to judg of matters of Fact; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>T. E.</hi> hath given a contrary Judgment againſt them, tho deceitfully he ſeemeth a great Patron in the caſe, for which it may be ſuppoſed they will not give him thanks, for this his ſo boldly contradicting them. Now what the infallible conſequences of this his ſo large and liberal conceſſion, are, I leave to impartial and underſtanding perſons to judge. Nothing either in matter of Doctrine or Fact, being ſuppoſed (by his liberal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, as the thing is true in it ſelf) to be diſcovered in my books, of untruth or falſhood; it is contained in my books, in matter of Fact, 1. That ſome Preachers among the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> in <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> were charged by me to be guilty of vile Errors and Hereſies, repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the <hi>Chriſtian Faith.</hi> 2. That ſome others of them did cloak and excuſe them; and that no ſuch damnable Hereſies, and Doctrines of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, were tollerate in any Proteſtant Society, as theſe did among them in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> &amp;c. 3. That complaint being made to the <hi>Yearly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> no due <hi>Cenſure</hi> was paſt upon them that were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but they were excuſed, and <hi>defended</hi> by them. 4. That they of the other ſide began the Separation, and are guilty of it, and not we. 5. That our Apology is Juſt, in our publiſhing theſe printed books, and God was with us, and <hi>owned us in</hi> our ſo doing. Now all this was matter of Fact that I have ſo affirmed in my printed books; and <hi>T. Elwood</hi> hath been ſo liberal to me, to grant, by way of ſuppoſition, all this to be true, and my books <hi>to contain nothing (as yet diſcover'd) of untruth or falſhood;</hi> yet for all this, he thinks I am <hi>worthily blamed and judged,</hi> by them he

calls the <hi>Yearly Meeting;</hi> and yet again he affirmeth, it was not the proper buſineſs of the <hi>Yearly Meeting to judge of the matter of fact.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If all this be true in <hi>matter of fact,</hi> as he alloweth it to be, <hi>by ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> then I and my friends joined with me, ſhould not be blamed for charging ſome in <hi>Penſilvania</hi> with being guilty of groſs and vile errors, ſuch as <hi>no Proteſtant Society would tolerate, nor yet the Church of</hi> Rome. Therefore whoever has blamed us for our ſo doing, are not to be <hi>noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,</hi> the Charges being ſuppoſed by him to be true. 2. Nor ſhould he and others blame us for the printing; and by his liberal Conceſſion, what he calleth the <hi>Judgment of the Yearly Meeting</hi> at <hi>London, 3d m. laſt,</hi> 1694. is void, becauſe he granteth us by his Conceſſion, this matter of fact, <hi>That our Apology is Juſt, and we are approved of God in our publick Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, in way of printing;</hi> and therefore by his liberal Conceſſion, the Yearly Meeting is greatly to be blamed for finding fault with us for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which we had a <hi>juſt Apology for.</hi> And 3. He granting by his liberal Conceſſion, <hi>That what we have ſaid in defence of our not being guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſeparation, in matter of fact, is all true, and hath nothing of untruth or falſhood in it;</hi> that both he and all others, and what he calleth <hi>the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the yearly meeting,</hi> have unjuſtly blamed us, by laying the blame of the <hi>Separation at my (or our) door,</hi> ſeeing he is ſo liberal to us, by way of <hi>ſuppoſition, That they of the other ſide, and not we, are guilty of it.</hi> And ſurely 'tis a moſt <hi>aſtoniſhing thing</hi> for him, to allow by way of <hi>ſuppoſition, That all is true that we have printed in our printed books, relating to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars abovementioned,</hi> and yet ſo to blame us, as he doth: for if all be true in matter of fact, that we have printed in our books, it is true, that we are neither guilty of <hi>printing, nor of the ſeparation, nor of falſly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any:</hi> and therefore all ſuch who blame us, as guilty of theſe things, are reprovable in a high degree. But if he will reſtrict his words of ſo liberal conceſſion (that are delivered by him without the leaſt reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and may be juſtly taken univerſally, they being an univerſal aſſent by way of ſuppoſition to my univerſal propoſition, reſpecting matter of fact on both ſides, to matter of fact only with reſpect to the things or words done or ſaid by them of the other ſide, as reported by me in my printed books, yet his conceſſion, even in this reſtricted and narrowed ſenſe, will ſufficintly excuſe us in the Judgment of all ſincere Chriſtians; for by his conceſſion in this narrow ſenſe of matter of fact, as only reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting what is ſaid or reported in the books to be ſaid or done by them of the other ſide. If it be granted by his ſuppoſition, that they are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be guilty of ſaying ſuch words as contain in them more vile and groſs Hereſies and Errors, as no Chriſtian Society would tolerate, and that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101020:5"/>
complaint being made to the Yearly Meeting, and ſome other Meetings, they would not ſuffer due cenſure to paſs upon them, and that they chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Meeting from the <hi>Bank</hi> to the <hi>Center,</hi> on purpoſe to force me to meet with them againſt my <hi>conſcience,</hi> as <hi>Th. Wilſon</hi> did <hi>witneſs, That I ſaid, and ſo began the ſeparation;</hi> Then <hi>wherein can we be juſtly blamed?</hi> For <hi>the</hi> 3 <hi>things wherein we have been blamed, are taken off by</hi> T. E. <hi>his conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> in the Judgment of all ſincere Chriſtians, 1. <hi>That we have falſly charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with vile and groſs Errors.</hi> Now <hi>T. E.</hi> alloweth, by way of ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that all theſe charges are true, and not falſe; as <hi>W. St.</hi> his ſaying, <hi>To preach faith in Chriſt within us, and in Chriſt without us, is to preach</hi> 2 <hi>Chriſts. Th. Fitzwater</hi>'s ſaying in Prayer, <hi>O God that died in us,</hi> and <hi>Robert Yeoung</hi> his ſaying, <hi>He did not find Chriſt without in all the Scripture, and that Chriſt when he aſcended, was ſeparated from his Body,</hi> and <hi>Th. Lloid</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>Chriſt within did all;</hi> which was oppoſed by <hi>J. W.</hi> ſaying, <hi>that he did not believe, for Chriſt without did ſomethings when he died for us;</hi> and <hi>Th. Fitzwater</hi> his ſaying, <hi>he owned no Man Chriſt Jeſus in Heaven, without him, but the grace of God within him;</hi> and his ſaying, <hi>he had not learned that Leſſon, whether it was the Godhead, or ſomewhat elſe that Chriſt took of the</hi> Virgin, <hi>that was nailed to the Croſs;</hi> and ſome of them ſaying, <hi>God was not preſent in all his Creatures, as Herbs, Graſs:</hi> and the <hi>Monthly Meeting</hi> at <hi>Philadelphia excluding the Man Chriſt Jeſus, our bleſſed Mediator and Saviour, from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any part or concern in our ſalvation,</hi> and by condemning me for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>the Light within is not ſufficient to ſalvation, without ſomething elſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe are but a part of the vile and groſs Errors charged on them in matter of fact, which being ſuppoſed to be true, that they are truly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, by <hi>T. E.</hi> his conceſſion, and they of the other ſide refuſing, on due complaint, to paſs any due cenſure on the Perſons that were guilty. Who that hath a Chriſtian heart and ſpirit within them, but muſt needs judge and ſay, that to deny ſuch to be our Chriſtian Friends and Brethren, is no falſe charge nor reviling. <hi>2dly.</hi> To be ſeparate from ſuch, after due Goſpel-Order given them, (though, as is ſaid, we began not the ſeparation) was not blame-worthy in us, but our Chriſtian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for I judg no other Chriſtian Profeſſion in Chriſtendom, would own ſuch to be their Chriſtian Brethren. And <hi>3dly,</hi> That we could do no leſs in conſcience, but bear our Teſtimony againſt them, after the moſt publick manner, and that was by Printing, ſeeing the People cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quakers</hi> have printed againſt them that have been guilty of far leſs groſs and vile Errors. And to ſay, that ſuch groſs Errors, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons guilty of them, ſhould have been cloaked and covered by us, after due pains was taken to reclaim them, and rejected by them, is a great
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101020:5"/>
reflection on the Body of the People called <hi>Quakers:</hi> if ſo the Body of them did ſo cloak them, and would more <hi>tend to the Diſhonour of Truth, and Reproach of our Profeſſion in general,</hi> than any thing I know ever happened among us. But I cannot think <hi>the Body, or Generality of Friends,</hi> nay, <hi>nor the Plurality,</hi> will take this <hi>imputation upon them,</hi> though <hi>T. E.</hi> would fix it on them; for he affirmeth, <hi>I am Juſtly bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Judgment of that he calleth the</hi> Yearly Meeting <hi>at</hi> London, <hi>which he takes to be the Repreſentative of the Body, for my publick Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt theſe vile Errors, ſuppoſed by him to be truly and juſtly charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in matter of fact:</hi> and therefore by his ſenſe, the Yearly Meeting and Body of Friends, repreſented by them, Judg it a Vertue or Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to cover and cloak them, which is not only againſt the whole cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the Holy Scripture, and the Example of the Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the general Practice of all Chriſtian Societies at this day, that publickly condemn any that ſhould be found guilty of theſe or the like Errors; but is againſt the ſenſe of ſome <hi>Heathen</hi> Writers; one of them having ſaid, and who is worthily commended for ſo ſaying.<q>Alitur vitium, vivitque tegendo:</q>i. e. <q>Vice is nouriſhed, and gets Life by covering it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed this hath been the thing that many of all Profeſſions have charged upon the People called <hi>Quakers, That they cover and cloak vile Errors and Hereſies, as well as wicked practices among them.</hi> I am hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſorry that <hi>T. E.</hi> has given ſo great Occaſion, by this his ſcandalous book, to confirm them in their Opinion concerning them. But I bear my Teſtimony againſt it, and ſo I hope will thouſands more, <hi>that the Body of Friends is not guilty of the charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing more I would have you notice, <hi>That notwithſtanding</hi> T. E. <hi>his loud clamour againſt me, in his ſcandalous book, for my printing my late books, in which is diſcover'd (by his ſuppoſition) nothing of untruth or falſhood in matter of fact</hi> (and he chargeth nothing againſt me in matter of <hi>Doctrin)</hi> wherein <hi>I</hi> blame ſome Preachers in <hi>America, for their vile Errors, repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the true Chriſtian Faith,</hi> as above-mentioned, and by his liberal <hi>conceſſion, ſuppoſing it to be all true that I have charged them with,</hi> by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liberal <hi>conceſſion</hi> and <hi>aſſertion of his,</hi> near the end of his <hi>Book,</hi> p. 72. <hi>I am excuſable, and ought not to be blamed,</hi> his <hi>words</hi> being theſe, <hi>And this know for certain, Friends, that the way to recover the deceived, is to diſcover, lay open, and witneſs againſt the deceivers.</hi> And ſurely, by his liberal <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, ſuppoſing it to be true in matter of fact, that I have charged upon ſome Preachers in</hi> America, <hi>as above-mentioned, they are deceivers: for they who</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:101020:6"/>
               <hi>treach falſe Doctrine and vile Errors, ſuch as no Profeſſion in Chriſtendom would tolerate, are deceivers, and they have deceived ſome in theſe parts:</hi> Therefore <hi>out of his own mouth</hi> he hath cleared me, <hi>to diſcover, lay open, and witneſs against them.</hi> It's like the man was <hi>ſo intent in his thoughts,</hi> that he <hi>thought</hi> this ſaying <hi>would be a good Apology for his printing againſt me,</hi> taking it for granted, that he hath <hi>proved me to be a deceiver.</hi> But whether he hath not failed in his proof, I leave to all truly <hi>judicious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial to judg,</hi> after they have duly peruſed and weighed my Anſwer, which I hope e're long to make publick. He did not well conſider, <hi>that what did ſeem to make for him againſt me, would really make for me againſt him, and all Others that approve his ſcandalous book, and blame me for that which this his aſſertion clears me of,</hi> thus ſhewing himſelf <hi>to be no wiſe, nor well experienced Soldier, to put his own beſt Weapon into the hand of him he ſuppoſeth to be his Adverſary.</hi>

            <head>A Seaſonable Information and Caveat Againſt a Scandalous Book of Thomas Elwood, CALLED, <hi>An Epiſtle to Friends, &amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereas</hi> Th. Elwood <hi>hath Printed a Scandalous Book againſt me, called.</hi> An Epiſtle to Friends, <hi>&amp;c. in great diſunity, and againſt the Mind of many Friends; and contrary to the Goſpel Order Profeſſed by us, (although approved and promoted by a Party equally prejudiced againſt me, for my faithful Chriſtian Teſtimony to the Truth of</hi> Chriſt.) <hi>Upon a diligent Review and Examination of his ſcandalous Book, I find in it at leaſt fifty ſeveral Perverſions, and Miſrepreſentations, and divers of them down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Forgeries, and Fictions in matter of Fact, and falſe Accuſations; the which in Order follow, with their ſeveral reſpective Anſwers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. HE falſly accuſeth me (in his Title Page) of a Spirit of <hi>Contention</hi> and <hi>Diviſion,</hi> that (as he ſaith) hath lately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in me, and ſome few others that joyn with me; who have made a Breach and Separation from Friends in <hi>America.</hi> For ſeeing by a <hi>Spirit of Contention</hi> he meaneth it in the worſt Senſe, as <hi>Contending against faithful Friends,</hi> or Separating therefrom; This is a falſe <hi>Charge;</hi> we remain in Unity with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friends in <hi>America,</hi> and elſewere; and contend only againſt <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> and <hi>wicked Practiſes;</hi> and are only ſeparate from <hi>Unbelievers,</hi> and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101020:7"/>
ſuch as the <hi>Scriptures</hi> command us to be ſeparated from, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17. A Place of <hi>Scripture</hi> cited in his Title Page, which makes againſt him; for they in <hi>America</hi> whoſe unjuſt Cauſe he hath taken to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, hath cauſed <hi>Diviſions</hi> and <hi>Offences</hi> contrary to the Doctrine of Chriſt, and therefore we ought to avoid them; and there is a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Contention we ought to be found in, ſo as to contend for the Faith once delivered to the Saints, <hi>Jude</hi> 3.—And we are commanded to be <note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14, 15, 16, 17.</note> ſeparated from <hi>Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> ſuch as theſe are from whom we were ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in <hi>America,</hi> though they themſelves began the Separation, and not we. And theſe he calleth ſome few, are about Sixteen <hi>Meetings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>pag.</hi> 9. He falſly accuſeth me, that I blame Friends, <hi>That they were gone too much from the outward to the inward;</hi> this is a down right Forgery, I never blamed any for going too much to the <hi>inward;</hi> for it hath been my Perſwaſion, and that from a true Experience, that the more any Man doth come to the <hi>inward,</hi> even to the <hi>Grace and Gift of God in his Heart,</hi> the more he hath a due eſteem of <hi>Chriſts Death and Sufferings, and precious Blood that was ſhed for the Remiſſion of Sin;</hi> and the more his Faith is increaſed in Chriſt, as he dyed for us, and roſe again, and is our Mediator in Heaven. But becauſe I have blamed ſome Perſons for not rightly and fully Preaching Chriſt <hi>without,</hi> and Faith in him, as well as in Chriſt <hi>within,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath forged this Fiction againſt me, That I blame Friends, that they were gone too much from the <hi>outward</hi> to the <hi>inward;</hi> but from his manner of falſly charging me, it plainly appears, as well as from the words of ſome others, that it was their Senſe, to preach Chriſt <hi>without,</hi> and Faith in him, it draws from the <hi>inward,</hi> and from the <hi>Gift of God within;</hi> but this is both falſe and contrary to the <hi>Doctrine of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles,</hi> recorded in the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>pag.</hi> 15. He falſly and unjuſtly chargeth me with <hi>Robert Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy</hi>'s Book, as if it were mine, both for Matter and Stile, and that I caſt it upon him; For as I have divers times declared, as <hi>I</hi> had no hand in the Printing it, but was againſt it; ſo divers things in it, that ſeemed to ſome moſt offenſive, <hi>I</hi> was not concerned in; though, as <hi>I</hi> have alſo freely delared, and is well known to many, divers of the words contained in ſome of theſe <hi>Queries, I</hi> ſpoke them in the yearly Meeting, and ſo far <hi>I</hi> was concerned, but not in Printing them.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. He not only falſly accuſeth me, but is guilty of an abſolute Forgery and Fiction in matter of Fact, <hi>That I refuſed to go out at the</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:101020:7"/>
               <hi>yearly Meeting in</hi> Philadelphia, <hi>held in the 7th Month,</hi> 1691. and, <hi>that my refuſal to go out, was the occaſion of their delay to give Judgment againſt</hi> W. Stockdale; for which, as a proof, he cites my Book, called, <hi>Some Reaſons and Cauſes, &amp;c. pag.</hi> 14. But let the Reader that loveth to ſee with his own Eyes, read that Book, and he will find no ſuch thing either in that page, or any where elſe; for <hi>I</hi> went out at the yearly Meeting when <hi>I</hi> was deſired, as my Book expreſly teſtifieth, to which he appealeth; See <hi>page</hi> 18, at <hi>line</hi> 22, where it is expreſly ſaid, that at the yearly Meeting he did withdraw, <hi>viz. G. K.</hi> at the Meetings deſire, and yet they did nothing to bring <hi>W. S.</hi> to Conviction. But my Book, <hi>page</hi> 14, cited by him, ſheweth, that my refuſal to go out, was at the quarterly Meeting that was half a year thereafter, where <hi>I</hi> give my juſt reaſon why <hi>I</hi> refuſed to go out, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe my Accuſers refuſed to go out alſo. So that this is a groſs forgery in matter of Fact; and yet he makes it the Foundation of his <hi>Superſtructure,</hi> in excuſing them, why they delayed to give Judgment, <hi>page</hi> 19. So this is a double forgery, one built on another.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>V. pag.</hi> 22. He falſly alledgeth, that the yearly Meeting at <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia,</hi> was not at a ſtand to determine whether the <hi>Doctrine was true or falſe;</hi> but, if they were at a ſtand at all, <hi>it was</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to determine whether the Charge exhibited againſt</hi> W. S. <hi>by</hi> G. K. <hi>was true or falſe:</hi> But the contrary of this <hi>I</hi> have fully proved out of my Books to which he refers; for in the Judgment they gave the <hi>4th</hi> Month, 1692. which was both defective and out of Seaſon, like <hi>Muſtard after Meat;</hi> they grant, that Proof was made by two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that the Charge exhibited was true; and if they had been at a ſtand on that Point, it is not like that they would have given any Judgment againſt him at all; but ſuch as it was, they grant they did not publiſh it either then, or till nine Months after; and though they moſt deceitfully pretend, for an Excuſe, their being prevented by reaſon of my unruly Behaviour and extream Paſſion, as they are pleaſed to call it; yet this cover is too narrow; for what hindred them all that nine Months? and why did they contradict the ſound Judgment of a monthly meeting at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> paſſing due Cenſure upon <hi>W. S.</hi> ſix Months thereafter? it is ſufficiently appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from this, it was no cordial, nor ſincere Judgment; nor, did they, all that time intervening, bring <hi>W. S.</hi> to any Conviction, but mightily ſupported him as an innocent Perſon. But whereas <hi>T. F.</hi> alledges, <hi>page</hi> 20. a Determination then, it ſeems, was given by his own acknowledgment. But <hi>I</hi> anſwer, ſeeing it was not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101020:8"/>
ſincere, but hypocritical, as appears by their contradicting the Judgment of the Monthly Meeting that gave it ſincerely and duly; and alſo that it was not publiſhed, nor <hi>W. S.</hi> brought by them to any Conviction, but ſupported by them, it might well be ſaid to be as good as none at all, they making it void by themſelves; and when they publiſhed it, or another like it, (after nine Months, as an Abortive out of due time) they did not own the words ſpoke by <hi>W. S.</hi> to be any Offence againſt God, or Chriſt, but to ſound and tender Friends, as <hi>I</hi> have formerly ſhewed in my Book called, <hi>The Plea of the Innocent;</hi> and for which <hi>I</hi> juſtly call it, as every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtian will call it ſo, a bare Shadow or Formality.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>VI page</hi> 23. He falſly and moſt ficticiouſly alledgeth, that <hi>Th. Fitſwater</hi> ſufficiently proved his Charge againſt me, for which he refers to my own Books; but this is a great forgery, for his Charge was, <hi>That I denyed the ſufficiency of the Light,</hi> and this his four credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Witneſſes did not prove againſt me, but it was quite another thing that the Monthly Meeting of the other ſide, the <hi>26th</hi> of the <hi>3d</hi> Month, 1692. alledgeth; they proved againſt me, <hi>viz. That I did not believe the Light was ſufficient without ſomething elſe.</hi> Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>T. E.</hi> judgeth both theſe one and the ſame, he hath plainly excluded the <hi>Man Chriſt without us, from having any part or concern in our Salvation; for the Man Christ Jeſus without us, and his Death, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, Blood, &amp;c.</hi> are ſomething elſe than the <hi>Light within;</hi> and, thus by the Judgment of <hi>G. Whithead</hi> againſt <hi>Jeffrey Bullock,</hi> who fell into the ſame <hi>Antichriſtian Error,</hi> he is gone from the <hi>Light</hi> into <hi>Imaginations,</hi> and contradicteth his former <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> in his Book called, <hi>The Foundation of Tithes ſhaken, page,</hi> 238. where he ſaith, <hi>Nor do the Quakers aſcribe Salvation to the following the Light within,</hi> (he ſhould have added the word only) but they aſcribe <hi>Salvation to Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> to whom the <hi>Light within</hi> doth lead thoſe that truly follow it; and <hi>page</hi> 240, he ſaith, <hi>If any one expects Remiſſion of Sins by any other way, than the Death of Chriſt, he renders the Death of Chriſt uſeleſs.</hi>

He falſly alledgeth, that the Meeting adjourned, was ſurreptitiouſly obtained, which he grounds on a forgery or fiction of his own deviſing, as if twenty nine of them might be looſe or raw Perſons; I may much more juſtly ſay, his ſcandalous Book is ſurreptitiouſly come out in Print, being contrary to the Mind of many Friends, and to <hi>Goſpel Order,</hi> profeſſed by himſelf, and all profeſſed Friends, <hi>viz.

He moſt perverſly and ignorantly doth alledge, by a ſort of Argument that is ſo ſilly and weak, that ſcarce an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary School boy would uſe it; that if this Act of <hi>T. L</hi>'s, (viz. <hi>His withdrawing from the monthly Meeting adjourned where I begin it)</hi> was the cauſe of the Separation, then it could not be the Separation it ſelf, but the Separation muſt come after this, as the Effect follows the Cauſe; and of this Argument he is ſo conceited, (though ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculouſly

weak) that though I anſwered it in the yearly Meeting, to the Satisfaction of many; at which time I adviſed him to beware of falling into the Ditch of that called <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> yet he brings it up again, and is not aſhamed to Print his ignorance, and expoſe it; (not to ſay his folly) but the Anſwer I gave him then, I now again give him more largely; that though the efficient Cauſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Effect, yet the formal Cauſe is the Effect in part, as all <hi>Logicians</hi> or <hi>School men,</hi> that treat on the Nature of Cauſes and Effects, do teach; and the material Cauſe is alſo another part of it; and thus, the Soul and Body are the formal and material Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of a Man, and yet they are the Man. Wood and Stone, and Faſhion or Figure of the Houſe are the material and formal Cauſes of the Houſe, and yet they are the Houſe. So <hi>T.

And we would have been glad to have kept Meetings with many or moſt of the People of the Meeting of the other ſide, after the Separation was begun, believing and knowing that they were in great meaſure beguiled and led aſtray by their Leaders, that they were too much given up to follow, yet retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a meaſure of Simplicity; but we could not meet with them in Peace, after their Leaders on the other ſide had begun the Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not having freedom given us, or Permiſſion peaceably to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe our gift among them, but were always interrupted and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted, when we met together, and otherwiſe moſt unchriſtianly abuſed. And thus I hope I have ſufficiently ſhewed the good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency betwixt my ſaying, <hi>I and my Friends had Unity with the moſt there at that Meeting, conſidering the Circumſtances then of that Meeting, and yet did remain in a Separation both of Spirit, and outward Fellowſhip from many of that Meeting both then and ſince;</hi> and the ſame Anſwer here given may ſerve to anſwer the ſame Objection and Accuſation made againſt us very unduely, in the Book called, <hi>The Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Society of the People called Quakers,</hi> page 18. of the ſaid Book.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101020:13"/>
that Errors in Practiſe do commonly go along with Errors in Principle. But it ſeems ſtrange to many, as well as to me, that Errors in Principle, as Pride, vanity of Apparel, Covetouſneſs, Envy, Backbiting, may without offence be publickly reproved by word of Mouth, in Meetings, and alſo in Print; but Errors in Principle muſt not be reproved, and witneſſed againſt, either in publick Meetings, or in Printed Books. Do Errors in Practiſe, as Pride, vanity of Apparel, Covetouſneſs, Envy, and the like, when publickly witneſſed againſt in Print, or in Meetings, open the Mouths of Adverſaries, and grieve faithful Friends, leſs than Errors in Principles? unleſs it be ſaid, that reproving Errors in Principles reflect upon the Preachers; but reproving Errors in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, reflect only upon the People; but if any of the Preachers be guilty, why may they not, and ought they not to be as publickly reproved as the People, unleſs we reſpect Perſons, and that both for their Error in <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Practiſe?</hi> Is it not a juſt charge upon ſome called Preachers, which Chriſt charged upon the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees, They loved the Praiſe of Men, more than the Praiſe of God,</hi> and therefore cannot beat to be reproved; for it hath been the general default of Teachers and Leaders of the People in former times, to hide their own Faults, and expoſe the Faults of others, eſpecially of ſuch as did not flatter them, and gave them not honour enough before Men. And nothing can be ſaid againſt my Printed Books, in reference to my publick witneſſing again the Errors in Principles, whereof ſome are guilty in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> and elſewhere, but what may be as much ſaid againſt <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> his reproving theſe great Vices and Immoralities among many called <hi>Friends,</hi> having the Name and form of <hi>Truth.</hi> Have my Books tended to the diſhonor of <hi>God,</hi> diſſervice to <hi>Truth,</hi> reproach and grief of <hi>Friends,</hi> for my Printing againſt the vile Errors whereof ſome called <hi>Friends,</hi> are guilty? And hath not <hi>G. Whiteheads</hi> printed Epiſtle had as much that tendency, for his printing againſt the vile Practiſes of many more than ever I charged? But in reality, I judge, and many others do judge, that the faithful witneſſing againſt Mens groſs and vile Errors, either in Doctrine or Practiſe, is no proper and direct cauſe of ſuch Effects, as the diſhonour of <hi>God,</hi> the diſſervice of <hi>Truth,</hi> the reproach and grief of <hi>Friends;</hi> but on the contrary, the proper and direct cauſe of Gods being honoured, Truth cleared the Reproach removed, and faithful Friends comforted, with a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Teſtimony borne againſt ſuch publick Sins and Evils. And though I had a foreſight and ſenſe that Enemies of Truth would
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101020:14"/>
ſeek to take advantage from my printed Books, yet I had alſo a ſenſe and foreſight, as I have expreſſed in my Book, <hi>page</hi> 6. <hi>Some Reaſons, &amp;c.</hi> That in the concluſion, they would be diſappointed, and that after a little time their great glorying and ſeeming grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyings would be turned into diſcontent and trettings. For on the other hand, doth it not greatly ſtop the cry and reproach that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of Truth caſt upon <hi>Friends,</hi> when they find us cordially zealous in our Teſtimony againſt all things reproveable among us, whether in Doctrine or Practiſe; and will it not much more occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their outcry and reproach, to find us, if ſo any of us ſhould ſo do, covering and excuſing what is not excuſable. And whereas I ſaid in my ſaid Book, <hi>That the publiſhing ſuch account of things, might be occaſion of grief to many,</hi> which ſome ſeek to take advantage againſt me for. I did not think that the ſimple Relation or Account of theſe things, would or could be any proper cauſe of grief to faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Friends;</hi> but I did judge, and ſo I do ſtill judge, that the groſs Errors whereof I did give an Account, that too many in theſe <hi>American</hi> parts were guilty of, would be a juſt cauſe and occaſion of grief to faithful <hi>Friends,</hi> but neither the Relation in Print, nor I the Relator of it, ſhould be blame-worthy for the ſame, more then if a <hi>News-Letter</hi> ſhould come forth in Print, giving a Relation or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome great loſs and deſtruction of our Country-men, or near Kindred and Relations at Sea, when the things related do and ought to afflict us with grief; but who will ſay, we ſhould blame the Relation, or him that hath faithfully related it to us, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that we ſhould give him thanks, for his faithful Relation? And indeed, I judge farther, <hi>Friends</hi> ſhould have been juſtly grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, with theſe vile Errors, and wicked Practiſes, that too many profeſſing Truth, have been guilty of; and it had been more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming all profeſſing Truth among us, to have been deeply hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before the Lord, and to have lamented theſe things with <hi>Wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, Mourning,</hi> and <hi>Faſting,</hi> then to have found fault ſo unjuſtly with the zealous Teſtimony I have borne againſt theſe things, that they might have approved themſelves like theſe in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> 9. 4. <hi>That did ſigh and cry for all the Abominations that were done in the midſt of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>whom the Lord commanded to have a Mark put upon, that they might be ſpared, when the City ſhould be deſtroyed.</hi> And if my Books, or the things therein related, have been inſtrumental to move any unto ſuch godly grief, for the great ignorance, unbelief, Errors in Doctrine, that ſome are guilty of, repugnant to the Chriſtian Faith, ſo as to be humbled before the Lord, for theſe Evils, with Prayer

unto God, that he would cauſe his <hi>Light</hi> and his <hi>Truth</hi> to ſhine forth, to the diſpelling theſe Foggs and Clouds; that ſuch who are in ſuch Darkneſs, Ignorance, and Errors, may be recovered.

And <hi>page</hi> 50. He ſaith, <hi>Therefore let none think, that becauſe the yearly Meeting did not declare the matters of fact in his Books to be falſe, therefore they are all true.</hi> Here note, 1. He grants that the yearly Meeting did not declare the Matters of fact in my Books to be falſe, (and for matter of Doctrine, they do not blame me in the leaſt) and yet he holds that I am juſtly cenſured and blamed by the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meeting, which ſeemeth to me, an unparalleled inſtance of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice he caſts on the yearly Meeting, to blame me for things in my Books that are neither matter of Doctrine, nor matter of fact; for whatever can be ſaid or written in a Book, muſt needs be one of theſe two, either matter of Doctrine, or matter of Fact. I know not that ever I heard or read of the like inſtance, that a Book, or the Author of it was blamed, when nothing, either in Doctrine or Fact, was declared blame worthy. But it ſeems this Man thinks himſelf to be more ſharp ſighted than the yearly Meeting, that hath, as he thinks, diſcovered matter of fact to be falſe in my Books, and that is, <hi>That I caſt the Separation off from my ſelf, and lay it upon Friends;</hi> and that it was ſo, he alledgeth did appear in the opening and ſtating that matter in the yearly Meeting; but he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaith it, but doth not prove it. And if it did appear in the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meeting, how comes it that he ſaith, <hi>The yearly Meeting did not declare the matters of Fact in my Books to be falſe.</hi> Is not my clearing my ſelf of the blame of the Separation, a matter of Fact, in my Book? this he ſaith, <hi>the yearly Meeting hath not declared to be falſe in matter of Fact,</hi> therefore they have not declared it, that my clearing my ſelf of the Separation, is falſe; and conſequently, they have not declared the contrary, but that my clearing my ſelf of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is true, wherein he by his own Confeſſion, hath plainly contradicted the Judgment of that called, <hi>The yearly Meeting Paper,</hi> which layeth it at my door, <hi>viz.</hi> The Separation, ſo far as I have
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101020:15"/>
been concerned therein, and yet I judge, they lay it not ſo much at my door, as by their own words, they ſhould lay it at the door of them of the other ſide, for they plainly ſay, <hi>And as to the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration among Friends in</hi> America, <hi>ariſing from the unhappy Differences,</hi> &amp;c. So here, what can be more plain than that they make the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences betwixt us in <hi>America,</hi> to be the cauſe of the Separation, as the word <hi>ariſing</hi> doth plainly import; And ſeeing the original ground and Cauſe of the Differences, was the unſound and erronious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines held by them of the other ſide, which that Paper called, <hi>A true Account of the Proceedings,</hi> &amp;c. Doth own them to be guilty of, it plainly appears, they of the other ſide, were the culpable cauſe of the Separation, and it lyeth mainly at their door in that reſpect, and no otherwiſe doth it lye at my door, but as I oppoſed their erronious Doctrines; and if for this any will lay it at my door, as being the innocent cauſe of it, I need not much contend with them, though I ſtill ſay, I began not the Separation; even as the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in Doctrine betwixt <hi>Luther,</hi> and ſuch as joyned with him, on the one hand, and the Pope, and <hi>Church of Rome</hi> on the other hand, cauſed a Separation betwixt them, and the Separation did ariſe from the difference in Doctrine: And if any will charge <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> to be the cauſe of that Separation, who own the Truth of his Doctrine, and diſown <hi>Popery,</hi> they will ſay, he was the innocent cauſe of it, and the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Adherents, were the culpable cauſe of it, the Application is eaſie to the caſe in hand. But let none be offended, that I call that Paper, having this Title, <hi>A true Account of the Proceedings, &amp;c.</hi> That called the Judgment of the yearly Meeting, because indeed I never owned it to be the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the yearly Meeting, but of a party of Men in it, that were ſwayed by ſome, beyond what they ought to have been; for a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great part of the yearly Meeting was gone, before any Judgment was given; and I can ſufficiently prove, they that did remain, were not unanimous in that Judgment. And <hi>T E.</hi> doth but equivocate, when he ſaith, <hi>page</hi> 23. <hi>That I know, when the Senſe and Advice of the Meeting was in the Meeting openly read, and delivered in Writing to me, there was not any one Member of the Meeting, that objected againſt it, or expreſſed any diſſent from it;</hi> for though they did not expreſs their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in my hearing, yet, as ſome of themſelves tole me, they had expreſſed their diſſent formerly, before I was called; for divers in that Meeting did ſhew their diſſent, in charging the Separation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and I judge the words of the Paper it ſelf, as I have proved, layeth it more upon them of the other ſide; and there ſeemeth not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101020:15"/>
to be a good conſiſtency, but rather an interfering in the words of that Paper, of one part with another. Beſide, that divers there did judge the Judgment was too partial, and too favourable towards them of the other ſide, and eſpecially towards <hi>Sam. Jennings.</hi> Nor can it be ſaid, that that called <hi>the yearly Meeting,</hi> was a free Meeting, for it was too private, and limited to too ſmall a number, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them deeply prejudiced againſt me, and who had long before pre-judged the caſe, eſpecially many of them called <hi>publick Friends,</hi> both of the City and Country. And many Friends that had a deſire to be preſent, were hindered to come in, and the Door kept ſhut by ſome appointed ſo to do; and ſome that had got in, were turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out; and therefore it cannot be owned to be the yearly Meeting, nor any Meeting duely and regularly conſtitute, when any faithful Friend had not freedom to be preſent, and deliver his Senſe. And granting the Judgment given in that Paper, called, <hi>A true Account,</hi> was the Judgment of the Plurality then preſent, this proves it not to be a true Judgment; for <hi>R. B.</hi> in his <hi>Anarchy, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith, <hi>page</hi> 79. <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>allow that at times the plurality may be wrong, and the few may be right.</hi> Nor can it be ſaid, that the yearly Meeting, is the Repreſentive of the body of Friends, in caſes that pertain to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact and Conſcience; for though Men may chuſe Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives to ſit in a National Aſſembly, to judge of worldly Matters, and to make Laws for the outward Man, yet I deny that they can chooſe Repreſentatives to judge of Matters of <hi>Faith and Salvation,</hi> that bind the Conſcience ſingly as ſuch; for this were downright Popery, and is the Foundation of all that blind Obedience that the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Church of Rome</hi> impoſes upon the People, becauſe ſuch a general Counſel hath ſo decreed; but rarely hath any general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, ſince the Apoſtles days, done much good, but rather hurt, eſpecially ſince the Purity of <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> began to decay. And this may clear me of theſe unjuſt and groundleſs Occaſions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>T. E.</hi> doth load me, as being guity of <hi>Inſincerity, Hypocriſie, double Dealing,</hi> having not a Conſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For my ſaying in my Introduction, to my Treatiſe, <hi>The cauſeleſs Ground,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I tenderly intreat and deſire that none apply or conſtrue any words contained in theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Lines, as intended by me in way of Reflection, Blame, or Charge againſt either the body of Friends in general, or any particular Meeting, or Meeting of Friends in particular, or againſt any ſingular faithful Friend, or Friends whatſoever;</hi> For my Intention was ſingly to clear <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>faithful Friends</hi> in the firſt Place, and next my Innocency and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Teſtimony; and this I did ſtill judge, might well be done
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101020:16"/>
without Reflection or caſting blame upon any faithful Friends, or any Meeting of faithful Friends; if any blame occaſionally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly fall upon any, it was not my Intention, to blame the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and if the unfaithful be occaſionally blamed, let them ſee to it, to amend what is blame-worthy in them. But as for that, called, <hi>The yearly Meeting Judgment,</hi> I own it not to be ſuch, far leſs of the body of Friends, or their true Repreſentative, knowing that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of faithful Friends are otherwiſe minded. But my calling the monthly Meeting in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> that gave Judgment againſt <hi>W. S.</hi> and <hi>T.

publickly reprove the errors and vices or the ſins of the people that were then the Church of God, by viſible profeſſion. and did record them (tho not in Print; for it was not then in uſe) in books, that they were the proper and direct cauſe of hurt, and when <hi>John</hi> reproved the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and Chriſt reproved moſt ſharply <hi>Prieſts, Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,</hi> that they were proper cauſes of hurt, and eſpecially the record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them in books that have remained to poſterity, and which ſome have made an ill uſe of, and <hi>Paul</hi>'s withſtanding <hi>Peter</hi> to his Face, and committing it to writing, that he was to be blamed, was the proper cauſe of hurt, <hi>&amp;c</hi> by this unfair, and undue way of arguing.

But I am ſo far from pronouncing a Curſe upon them for their evil deviſings againſt me, that it is my ſincere deſire that God may bleſs them, with true Repentance, for that and all their other Sins. And as to the Exerciſe of my Miniſtry among Friends, hundreds bear Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that my Miniſtry is both refreſhing and Edifying to them, and is burdenſom to none, but to the ignorant and unfaithful, and ſuch as are prejudiced againſt me by falſe Reports. And as to that Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Diſturbance that happened at the firſt publick Meeting, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in at <hi>London,</hi> many can, and do bear me Witneſs, that I was not the Cauſe, nor beginning of it. And why ſhould <hi>T. E.</hi> or any other call it a Diſturbance in me to bear a publick Teſtimony againſt a Man, that ought not to be owned to be a Miniſter of Chriſt, <hi>viz. S. J.</hi> becauſe of his proud and perſecuting Spirit and Practiſes; nor ought it to be reckoned a diſturbance, when Error and falſe Doctrine is Preached in a Publick Aſſembly, in a zealous <hi>Chriſtian Spirit;</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, when things are come to that paſs eſpecially, that private Reprof is not regarded; for in my ſo doing, I have the Example of Friends. of good Note, that have done the like before me. And why doth not <hi>T. E.</hi> remember the diſturbance he himſelf made (which I heard ſome ſay, was greater than that other) at a publick Meeting at <hi>Grace-Church-ſtreet</hi> ſome time ago, (the moſt publick Meeting of Friends at <hi>London)</hi> that gave great Offence to hundreds, in his ſpeaking againſt a Perſon, whoſe Miniſtry was well owned by hundreds, ſome of which cryed out on him, at that time, <hi>ſhame, ſhame.</hi> And as to my general Department in Meetings, many can bear me Witneſs, it is peaceable, having no Inclination nor purpoſe to interrupt any, though divers have uncivily and unchriſtianly Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted me, and otherwiſe behaved moſt unfairly towards me. And to this bundle or ſumm of Faſhoods and Miſrepreſentations, in the laſt place, let it be added, his accuſing of my innocent true Words, <hi>as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring of a boaſting Spirit,</hi> becauſe I humbly and modeſtly did men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion my Thirty Years Labor <hi>in the Work of the Miniſtry, and God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bleſt my Labors with great Succeſs, in being an Inſtrument to the bringing many unto the bleſſed Unity and Fellowſhip with his Spirit, and one with another in the ſame.</hi> I appeal to all that have a true Savor, whether theſe Words ſavor of a <hi>boaſting Spirit,</hi> I only uſing them by way of Argument, to perſwade ſome that had a wrong jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of me, <hi>That I intend no breach among faithful Friends.</hi> But whether his words do not ſavor of deep Prejudice, and want of Charity, in ſaying, <hi>he cannot but expreſs his fear, that I have been inſtrumental to draw many more from the bleſſed Unity and fellowſhip of the Goſpel, than</hi>

If he and they blame hard and ſharp words univerſally, eſpecially given to them, not yet denied, to be of the ſame <hi>Society,</hi> then why doth he give them to me, if he alloweth they may be given in ſome Caſes; the merit of the Cauſe; and what caſe is proper is duely to be examined, and left to the Judgment of impartial Men, which I freely do, and chiefly and moſt principally to that moſt juſt and impartial Witneſs of God, in every Mans <hi>Conſcience,</hi> to which every Man muſt ſtand or fall.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101020:22"/>
his ſcandalous book, and to all my other books, relating to theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; and the rather, that it cometh from the mouth or pen of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed adverſary.</p>
            <p>But whereas he alledgeth, it is ſtrange <hi>I</hi> ſhould complain of the <hi>year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meeting,</hi> for not condemning the Friends there, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> without all hearing, conviction or tryal, which it muſt have done, had it condemned them who are abſent and diſtant ſeveral thouſand miles. <hi>I</hi> anſwer, <hi>I</hi> did not complain of the yearly Meeting, there being no word of the yearly meeting mentioned in all my printed paper; but whereas they who gave out, that Paper called, <hi>A true account of the Proceedings,</hi> &amp;c. adviſed me to call in my printed books, <hi>I</hi> put them in mind, that in order to a true reconciliation, they ſhould have adviſed them of the other ſide, to call in their falſe Judgments, and to give out a Teſtimony acknowledging their error, in ſeveral paſſages of injuſtice towards me, which they might have done by way of advice, tho without giving a formal Judgment againſt them, being abſent. But if they thought it not Juſt to give a Judgment againſt them of the other ſide, being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, what hindered them from giving a Judgment againſt <hi>S. Jennings,</hi> being preſent, and who had chiefly injured us, and me in particular; as alſo againſt <hi>Th. Ducket,</hi> who was preſent. And why have they given a Judgment againſt our Friends in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Jerſey,</hi> who were not preſent any more than they of the other ſide, by giving out a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory Judgment to what was given out by the Yearly Meeting at <hi>Burlington,</hi> ſigned by 70 perſons? And ſeeing it is an undeniable rule of Juſtice, not to Judge the perſon that is preſent in the abſence of his Accuſers; but that the accuſers and the accuſed be both preſent in perſon; why did they judge me in the abſence of my Accuſers, in <hi>Penſilvania?</hi> If it be ſaid, they had ſufficient evidence from my printed books, ſo had they as ſufficient evidence from their Manuſcripts and Letters ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their own hands, of the <hi>Other ſide;</hi> and therefore it was not according to the rule of true Juſtice, to have given any Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, tho preſent, in my accuſers, and oppoſite parties abſence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they had dealt impartially, with reſpect to both, and laid equal weight on the authentick evidences I produced againſt them, from their own Manuſcripts, ſigned with their own hands, and the true Copy of the Court-Seſſions, ſigned by the hand of the Clerk, as on my printed books. And both ſides being alike abſent, or preſent, two of their ſide (the third deceaſed) preſent, and three preſent on our ſide, it is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent quible and ſhift, to give it as a Reaſon why they of the Other ſide in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> had not Judgment paſſed againſt them, being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and yet to judg <hi>G. K.</hi> his Friends, who alſo were abſent, and to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101020:22"/>
Judg him in the abſence of his accuſers: and if they think it was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to have <hi>S. Jennings,</hi> and <hi>Th. Ducket</hi> preſent to be his accuſers, by the rule of Juſtice, it was ſufficient to have <hi>G. K.</hi> and <hi>Th. Budd</hi> to be preſent to be <hi>Sam. Jennings</hi> his accuſers; ſo the caſe is as broad and long the one way as the other, and either <hi>G. K.</hi> ſhould not have been Judged, or at leaſt <hi>Sam. Jennings</hi> ſhould not have been ſo connived and paſſed by: yea ſo publickly countenanced and owned and <hi>G. K.</hi> ſo publickly cenſured and hardly treated, as both then and ſince.</p>
            <p>HIS <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> I am little concerned to take notice of, being a pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to two things in the printed paper of <hi>R. H.</hi> which he and ſome others ſo highly aggravating, it was, and is ſtill expected by many, that <hi>T. E.</hi> would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in the ſeveral particulars of it wherein he is ſo highly guilty, the which he not having done, leaveth a ſuſpicion in the minds of ſome, that he had better to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, by a full and particular Anſwer to the whole, than to nibble only at theſe two, wherein he hath ſaid nothing to give juſt ſatisfaction; for as it may be granted, that in great Aſſemblies, where all are unanimous, as well as in leſſer Aſſemblies (as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at the adjourned Meeting in <hi>Philadelphia),</hi> the Judgment may be ſigned by one of the Members; ſo when the Judgment is not unanimous, as it was not in that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, one party ſhould not call that the Judgment of the whole, which was but the Judgment of a part, ſuppoſing them to be the majority, it not being the way of Friends in their Aſſemblies, to carry it by plurality of Voices; and had it come to a ſigning with the hands of particular perſons, as it happened in that paper ſigned by 66 con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>I. W.</hi> it is ſufficiently probable divers would have refuſed to ſign it, that ſaid little or nothing againſt it in the open Meeting, it being ſufficiently known, that many are ſilent to things which they do not always approve. To the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, he taketh it barely for granted, that the Yearly Meeting at <hi>Burlington,</hi> that gave forth that Judgment concerning <hi>G. K.</hi> and <hi>T. L.</hi> &amp;c. was a ſeparate Meeting, which being as readily denied by me, as affirmed by him, leaveth the matter undetermined to ſome, until it further appear which of the two ſides might be moſt juſtly called the ſeparate Meeting. But that which caſteth the Ballance is, when it is duly underſtood, that they whom he calleth the Separate Meeting, ſtood up for Truth againſt the vile Errors, that too many of the other ſide were guilty of, and which the reſt of them did cloak and cover; and it is left to the impartial Judgment of the Readers, whether it doth not appear that they of the other ſide were the Separatiſts, in the worſt ſenſe, after the due conſideration of what is ſaid <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>contra,</hi> in reading theſe my late books relating to theſe differences, and <hi>T. E.</hi> his late book in oppoſition, and this my Reply. But that the ſaid meeting was made up of ſome others that ſeldom or never went to Friends meetings at all, as he alledgeth, it can eaſily be proved, that where one ſuch can be mentioned, that made up that called by him, <hi>the ſeparate meeting,</hi> or were otherwiſe unqualified to give Judgment in ſuch a caſe, three can be mentioned of the other ſide, or rather more, and much more unqualified, that gave a contrary Judgment
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101020:23"/>
at the other meeting at that time, as can be ſufficiently proved, by comparing perſons with perſons, and names with names, and it is evidently apparent, that what they could not do with the weight of Truth and Juſtice, they laboured to do with number of Names, divers of whom were manifeſtly known to be of bad Fame and Reputation. But it is not what Number of Names maketh a Judgment authentick and weighty, but what Truth and Juſtice is in it.</p>

            <p>AT this time I would not have taken notice of <hi>T. Elwood,</hi> but to anſwer ſome who are troubled about his unchriſtian dealing by me, and are deſirous I ſhould ſay ſomething to <hi>T. E</hi>'s <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> as it is in his Pamphlet of three ſheets againſt my paper of Obſervations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which Poſtſcript <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> wordeth it after this manner; <hi>Since the former part was written, I hear</hi> J. Raunce <hi>hath hatched another falſe ſtory againſt me (which is,</hi> ſaith <hi>T. E.) that I did not allow my Father a Shrowd, but that he was wrapt in an old Moth-eaten Blanket,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Charge I deny, and ſay, I did not hatch that ſtory which <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi> chatgeth upon me; But this is the truth of the buſineſs, ſo far as I know; The man that helped to lay <hi>T. Ellwood</hi>'s Father into his Coffin, and ſaw him nailed up in the Coffin, that very man gave the following Relation, which he ſpake before many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and did affirm very confidently, That Old <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> had no other Shrowd but ſomewhat of an Old Moth-eaten Blanket; and it was ſo little and ſo ſhort, that it would ſcarce cover his body. He had no Cap on his Head, nor any Muffler for his Jaws: The Shrowd was ſo ſorry a thing, that he ſaid, he would not have given 6 <hi>d.</hi> for it. And ſurely <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> hath no cauſe to accuſe me, and do as he hath done in ſome of his Papers: and to tell ſo much of his Kindneſs and Dealings by his deceaſed Father; and how that he had given direction for his Interment, and that he went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to diſcharge the Charge of his Sickneſs and Funeral. Whereas he would not afford his own preſence to attend his Deceaſed Father's Body to a Burying Place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Friends, within one Mile where his Father dyed. But <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choſe to give Twelve Pence a peice to four Poor Men to carry his Father's Corps into the Pariſh ſteeple-yard, where they Laid him in ſuch place as was commonly made uſe off for Vagabonds and Beggars, to the ſhame of an Undutyful Son, as it is well known, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But I having more at Large in my other Papers mentioned the Truth of things, againſt which <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi> may Cavil, and uſe a multitude of Words, But he hath not yet proved one thing falſe that I have written.</p>
            <p>So I need ſay little now but to anſwer the Expectation of thoſe whoſe deſire it was to know whether I was the hatcher of that ſtory, which <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi> chargeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, in his <hi>Poſtcript,</hi> And I ſay I was not the Author of it, But it was the Relation of the man who helped to lay <hi>Thomas Ellwood's</hi> Father into his Coffin, as is above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
