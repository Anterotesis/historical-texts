            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>St. Matth. XVI. 6.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>Then Jeſus ſaid unto them, Take heed and beware of the Leaven of the Phariſees and of the Sadducees.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THere are two very common and very unhappy miſcarriages in the External management of Religion. Whilſt (on the one ſide) ſome Men think themſelves obliged ſeverely and rigorouſly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105404:4"/>
to Proſecute all that differ from them, although it be but in meer opinions, or the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Religion. And others on the other hand, ſeem ſo cold and unconcerned in this great affair as if all Religions were alike, and it were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly indifferent what Principles a Man enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, ſo he had but ſome kind of Devotion.</p>
            <p>The former of theſe Miſtakes takes its riſe from too confident a preſumption of our own Judgment, and a fond and groundleſs pretence to Infallibility, and therefore exacts of all other Men a Conformity to our Meaſures. The later proceeds from as unreaſonable a Diffidence and Diſtruſt of the grounds of Believing, as if there was really no <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or Standard of Truth, and Falſhood; and conſequently theſe laſt ſort of men are as void of Faith as the other were of Charity: To be ſure, both of them are very dangerous, foraſmuch as the one begining in Confidence, ends in Cruelty: The other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining in <hi>Scepticiſm,</hi> commonly ends in <hi>Atheiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, both theſe dangers may in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be avoided, and great Light gained to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the government of our ſelves in this weighty and difficult buſineſs, by attending to the Carriage of our Saviour towards the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105404:4"/>
ſeveral Sects of the <hi>Jews</hi> reſpectively. For where as it is well known, that there were three nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Parties amongſt them, commonly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the Names of the Eſſenes, the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees and the Sadducees; it is very remarkable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt of them, namely the Eſſenes: That though they were very numerous at the time of our Saviour; and withal, held ſeveral very odd and unjuſtifiable opinions; yet our Saviour is ſo far from all Bitterneſs and Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards them, that we do not find that he makes any kind of Reflection upon them. But for the other two, <hi>viz.</hi> The Phariſees and Sadducees, he upon all occaſions ſharply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs againſt them, and ſeverely expoſes them.</p>
            <p>Now the reaſon of this very different Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of our Saviour ſeems to be this: That the Eſſenes, tho' they were miſtaken in ſome Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet were ſincere in their minds, harmleſs in their Lives, quiet and peaceable in their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: They contented themſelves to enjoy their own Conſciences, and let other Men alone; they were not a Confident and Boyſterous ſort of Men, that muſt either have the ſole Government of the World, or elſe be always Plotting and Contriving of Miſchief; but humble and modeſt, and ſo capable of being
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105404:5"/>
recovered from their Errors: But the other two Sects, <hi>viz.</hi> The Phariſees and Sadducees, they were quite another ſort of Men, pretenders to Infallibility, and conſequently preſumptuous and over-bearing, perpetual Dictators in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, faſtuous and diſdainful towards all others, too wiſe in their own Eyes to learn of any one, and too ſanctimonious to be reproved by any Body; withal, they were a Crafty and Projecting ſort of Men that muſt either Rule or Confound the World. Our Saviour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (to Teach us to make a diſcrimination in the like Caſes) as I obſerved, gently paſſes by the Eſſenes, but always ſets himſelf moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely againſt the two other Sects, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly here in my Text, gives his Diſciples caution againſt them; <hi>Take heed and beware of the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the Phariſees and of the Sadducees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſpecial occaſion of theſe Words was this; If we look to the begining of this <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> we find theſe two buſie Sects (though at other times they had Hot Diſputes between themſelves, yet now) lay their Heads together and Conſpire againſt our Saviour: But (as the uſual guize of Hypocrites is) they come to him very demurely with theſe Words, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, we would ſee a Sign from thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:105404:5"/>
What! Had they had no Signs hitherto; had Jeſus wrought no Miracles amongſt them all this while, or were theſe Men only ſtrangers to all the great paſſages of that time?</p>
            <p>But, <hi>We would ſee a Sign from Heaven.</hi> And why a Sign from Heaven; would that be more unexceptionable than any he had hitherto given them; would this convince them? No, that was not their Errand, they came not to be Converted, but to be hardened; they had a mind not to believe, and ſeek only a colour for their unbelief; they ask him therefore for that which they verily thought he would not grant them, that they might have ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for their Infidelity.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, our Saviour having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their Deſign, and detected their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie in the 2, 3, and 4, <hi>Verſes</hi> in my Text, turns himſelf towards his Diſciples, and gives them this ſerious caution againſt them, and all ſuch kinds of Men <hi>Take heed and Beware,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For the full opening of which, I will briefly inquire into theſe Four things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, What is the Importance of this Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical expreſſion <hi>Leaven,</hi> and what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour means by the Leaven of Phariſees and Sadducees.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:105404:6"/>
Secondly, More particularly we will inquire what was the peculiar Leaven of theſe two Sects, ſo often mentioned in the <hi>New-Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, We will conſider what was the danger of that <hi>Leaven,</hi> and its contrariety to the Doctrine and Deſign of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and Laſtly, We will inquire what this Caution of our Saviour implies, and what he would have his Diſciples to do, when he bids them <hi>Take heed and beware,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And by that time I have given Account of theſe Four things, I ſhall not only have opened the full ſcope of the Text, but I hope every attentive Auditor will be ſatisfied of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of this ſubject for the preſent Time.</p>
            <p>I begin with the <hi>Firſt,</hi> viz. What our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour means by <hi>Leaven:</hi> In the Words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing my Text, <hi>Verſe</hi> 7. We find that the Diſciples took our Saviour Literally, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on themſelves for their Omiſſion, to provide Bread and neceſſaries for the Voyage which they were now entring upon, though he had obliquely reproved their careleſneſs in that particular, and that he had thence took occaſion to interdict them all Trade and Civil commerce with thoſe two Sects of Men. But
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105404:6"/>
by the 12. <hi>Verſe</hi> they underſtand their Maſter's mind better, and knew at Length <hi>That he ſpake not of the Leaven of Bread, but of the Doctrine of the Phariſees and Sadducees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed it is uſual with our Saviour, by that Metaphor, to repreſent Doctrine, whether good or bad, for <hi>Matth. chap.</hi> 13. 33. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares his own Inſtitution to it, ſaying the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>of Heaven is like Leaven, which a Woman took and hid in two Meaſures of Meal, till the whole was Leavened,</hi> &amp;c. And the reſemblance is very fit and Natural, for as it is the nature of Leaven, that it works inſenſibly, quickly inſinuates it ſelf, and Univerſally diffuſes its Efficacy over the whole Maſs into which it is put; ſo in like manner Doctrine works upon the minds of Men, and gives a Tincture of its own Nature and Temper to them: Inſomuch as that ſuch as a Mans perſuaſions and Principles are, ſuch ordinarily at leaſt will his Life and Practice be.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed, that ſometimes Mens Lives are better than their Principles, and ſometimes alſo worſe: For it may fall out that Men of very unhappy and miſchievous Opinions may yet live virtuouſly, when the Probity of their Temper is ſuch, as that it Antidotes them againſt the Malignity and Venome of their perſuaſions:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105404:7"/>
And on the other ſide, it is no infrequent (tho' an unhappy) ſpectacle, to behold others of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Noble and Generous principles, as to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, yet to live very Lewd and Profligate Lives, ſuch Men <hi>with-holding the Truth in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs,</hi> (as the Apoſtles Phraſe is) or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing the Light, and Debauching their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, in compliance with their Luſts and carnal or ſecular Intereſts.</p>
            <p>But, (as I ſaid) ordinarily it is otherwiſe, for ſuch a ſtate of contradiction to Principles muſt needs be violent and unnatural; and the lives and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Men do as reaſonably bear proportion to the Principles of their Minds and Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as it is Natural for the ſtream to riſe as high as its Source and Fountain, and no higher. Hence it is, that our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 33. ſaith, <hi>Either make the Tree good, and his Fruit good: or the Tree Corrupt, and the Fruit Corrupt:</hi> And again, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 23. He pronounces, <hi>If the Light that is in Thee be Darkneſs, that Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt be great and intolerable.</hi> To the truth of which Obſervation, the general experience of all the World, bares ample Teſtimony amongſt ſeveral inſtances of which, I cannot but remark a very pertinent paſſage of an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Hiſtorian in the Life of that wicked Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105404:7"/>
               <hi>Tiberius;</hi> his Words concerning him are theſe: <hi>Erat circa Deos negligentior, quippe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicae addictus, perſuaſioniſque plenus omnia ſato agi.</hi> Which I render thus, q. d. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> was a profane Prince, careleſs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and without any Devotion towards God; and no wonder, for he was an admirer of <hi>Aſtrology;</hi> and full of the Opinion, that the Starrs or Fate governed the World, and not God.</p>
            <p>And in ſhort, this is the true Reaſon of all Education, and of all the Care and Diligence that evil and good Men uſe in Propounding and Propagating good Doctrine, and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contrary; not that they think God is pleaſed with dry opinions and ſpeculations, but becauſe they are aware that Principles draw on Practices, and that evil opinions Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt good Manners. But ſomuch for that; I proceed,</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, to inquire what was the peculiar <hi>Leaven</hi> of theſe Phariſees and Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees which our Saviour thus cuations againſt. And for this, the Learned <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtorian, <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his <hi>13th.</hi> Book of Antiquities, and in his <hi>2d.</hi> Book of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Warrs, hath given us a very exact Account of all the Sects of Religion amongſt that People, and from him I ſhall preſent this Auditory, with the ſubſtance
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105404:8"/>
of what he delivers, touching the Phariſees and Sadducees wherein we are at preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
            <p>And firſt, it is notorious that the Sect of the Sadducees utterly denied the being of Angels and Spirits; or of all Spiritual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and acknowledged nothing but Matter or Body in the whole Univerſe; and conſequently hereof, they muſt alſo renounce the Immortality of the Soul, the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body, and Eternal Life in the World to come: Whereas on the contrary, the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees acknowledged all the aforeſaid great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, as we Learn, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 8. Only this is to be added withal, That theſe latter enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſo many Legendary Stories about theſe great Points, and had ſuch very craſie notions of them, that they thereby rendred the very Doctrines ridiculous and incredible.</p>
            <p>Again, the Sadducees were groſs Idolaters of the Letter, and as they received only the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (excluding the Prophets and all other ſacred Writings) ſo they underſtood the Books of the Law in the moſt craſs and litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe, and admitted not of any interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or conſequence from it, though never ſo clearly and naturally deduced; On the other ſide, the Phariſees not only received the whole Scripture of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105404:8"/>
were great <hi>Patrones</hi> of Oral Tradition, and allowed as great or greater authority to it than the written Word; and conſequently thought themſelves obliged under as great a neceſſity to the obſervance of thoſe things that came down to them by the Tradition of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as to thoſe they found written in the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets;</hi> from whence it came to paſs (as it muſt needs do) that their <hi>Creed</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Vaſt and Voluminous, and their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was Clogged with innumerable Rites and Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>The reſult of all which is this; that the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees had too much Faith (ſuch as it was) and the Sadducees (properly ſpeaking) none at all: The Sadducees could upon their Principles have no ground for any Religion or Piety; and the Phariſees, by their Prodigious additions to Gods Inſtitution, had quite corrupted and loſt the true Idea of Religion. In ſhort, whatever cold pretences a Sadducee could make to Civility or Morality; it is evident, he could have no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. On the contrary, the very Character of a Phariſee was a confident Devotioniſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Morality.</p>
            <p>Now, from what hath been delivered in this ſhort Account of theſe two Sects, it will be eaſie to diſcern the reaſon why our Saviour gives ſuch caution againſt their <hi>Leaven,</hi> and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105404:9"/>
what the miſchief and danger to his Doctrine and Deſign was from each of them ſingly, or both together. Which is the</p>
            <p n="3">3. Third Inquiry; but becauſe herein lies eſpecially the Emphaſis of the Text, I will give a more particular Account of this matter as followeth:</p>
            <p>And firſt as touching the Sadducees; it is manifeſt by what hath been ſaid, that their <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> was the ſame with that of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Philoſophers, and could by no means be a Principle of Conſcience or Religion, but a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine Calculated for this preſent Life; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving neither Angel nor Spirit, nor any thing to be in the World but meer Matter; it was impoſſible they ſhould have any concern for another World, and conſequently they could have no Religion, only as the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was <hi>lex Terrae</hi> the Law of the Land; ſo far it ſtood them in hand to obſerve it, or at leaſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend an external Conformity to it, for the ſake of their ſecular Intereſts and Advantages. To be ſure ſuch Principles could lay no obligation upon their Conſciences; and therefore they were the trueſt Race of <hi>Latitudinarians,</hi> and could comply with whatſoever was uppermoſt; and upon that ſcore, could not withſtand the Temptation of being of the Religion of the <hi>Prince,</hi> whatever it was.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:105404:9"/>
Accordingly, it is obſervable in a Parallel place to this of my Text; namely, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 15. For the <hi>Leaven</hi> of the Phariſees, we have <hi>the Leaven of</hi> Herod, as ſignifying the ſame thing, for theſe Men it ſeems conſiſtently enough with their Principles, could flatter that vile <hi>Prince,</hi> ſo far as to cry him up for the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was I ſay, a Sect or <hi>Leaven</hi> fit for Men of Covetous and Ambitious deſigns, and was ſucceſsful to thoſe purpoſes; for <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 17. We find the great Council or <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> chiefly conſiſted of thoſe of this <hi>Leaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Men were of the Spawn of the <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> and derived the ſanction of Religion from humane Legiſlation, and the commands of God obliged no further than they were inacted by the Civil Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, they had the right knack of Triming between all Religions; for whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was the inward opinion of their mind, they could conceal or deny, or mince the matter, ſo that their Perſuaſion ſhould never expoſe them to any damage, nor their Conſcience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with their Intereſts.</p>
            <p>Now, the Chriſtian Religion which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour came to introduce and to plant in the World, being not only a very ſtrict and Holy, but a moſt ſolemn and ſerious inſtitution: Nothing could be more contrary to it, than
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105404:10"/>
ſuch looſe Principles as theſe; His was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion fitted to pleaſe God, not to flatter and humour Men: It was a Religion deſigned for the ſaving of Mens Souls in another World, and to fit them for Eternal Life, and not to ſerve a turn, or to ſave a Stake in this World. Upon all which, there can be no wonder that he earneſtly Cautions againſt the <hi>Leaven</hi> of the Sadducees which undermined the Principles of all Religion.</p>
            <p>And then in the next place, for the Religion of the Phariſees, that (by what was ſaid in the deſcription of their <hi>Leaven)</hi> conſiſting of ſo many incredible Articles of Faith, grounded only upon Tradition and Legendary Stories, and of ſuch innumerable trifling and Arbitrary Rites and Ceremonies, and yet made eſſentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, was utterly contrary to the whole tenor and deſign of the Goſpel, as might be made appear in innumerable inſtances, of which I will here ſpecifie only theſe five parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars following.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, a principal Deſign of our <hi>Saviour</hi> in the Doctrine of the Goſpel, was to inſtruct Men with right notions of God, which is not only the firſt and moſt immediate honour to the Divine Majeſty, but the only ſolid Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all Vertue and Piety: The right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Gods Perfections and Attributes,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105404:10"/>
being the great obligation upon our minds, to reverence and obſerve him in general, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of great uſe alſo, to direct us in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inſtances of our Duty towards him. Now the Phariſees Superſtition was contrariwiſe very apt to breed in Men, very mean and unworthy notions of the Divine Majeſty; and ſo tended naturally both to confound the Meaſures, and to ſubvert the very ground and Reaſon of Piety and Vertue.</p>
            <p>Partly, as it mightily abated of his Grandure and Majeſty whilſt it repreſented him, as inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon ſo many little things as carried neither weight nor worth, nor intrinſick Reaſon in them. We always count it an Argument of a little mind to be wrought upon by meer Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to be pleaſed with Trifles, and to be offended with ſuch Ceremonious Omiſſions: And we cannot naturally eſteem him to be a Wiſe and great Man, whom we obſerve to be of that temper; much leſs can we imagine that he ſhould be an infinitely wiſe God, a full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ſelf-ſufficient being, that will indure to be flattered with Ceremonies, be forced with Gifts, be propitiated with formal Oblations, be complemented with external Addreſſes, impoſed upon by ſhows and ſhadows, or be offended for the want of any ſuch things. Now the Phariſees <hi>Leaven</hi> conſiſting wholly of theſe,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105404:11"/>
without regard to true Piety, and generous Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and conformity of Heart and Life to him, quite clouded and obſcured the glory of his Divinity, and rendred him more like a Man than a God, and indeed more like a little neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous narrow minded Man, than a wiſe and a great one.</p>
            <p>Partly, as it rendred him an unbenign and captious Deity, ſuch an one as inſiſted upon very <hi>Punctilio's,</hi> and was prone to take advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his Creatures upon the ſmalleſt omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the effects of which muſt needs be, that Men might be poſſibly Tempted to fear, and to ſtand under the ſlaviſh dread of ſuch a God, but it was plainly impoſſible they ſhould love him; without which there can be no Life nor Soul in Religion.</p>
            <p>Above all this, the Phariſaical <hi>Leaven</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Divine Majeſty as a Selfiſh and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Being, as if he looked only at his own ends, and had no regard to the good of his Creatures, and more aimed at the obtaining his own Will of them, than had any reſpect to the true uſe and reaſon of things, or deſign of the good and happineſs of Men: For how could it be otherwiſe; or how could Men think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of him, that inſiſted as much upon clean Hands as upon a pure Heart; that was as much offended with the Omiſſion of a Ritual, as of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105404:11"/>
a Moral precept, and that would take the Sacrifice of a Beaſt, in the exchange for obedience of a Man. Now the Doctrine of the Phariſees bringing in ſuch apprehenſions of Religion as theſe are, muſt needs there withal introduce very mean, low and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy notions of God, and thereby undermine true Piety, and eſpecially that of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Again, in the ſecond place, the deſign of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was to make Religion eaſie and delightful, and not only paſſible, but acceptable to all Men; that ſo his inſtitution might become the Religion of all the World, the truly <hi>Catholick Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpoſe, he was to lay open all Incloſures, to pare off all Superfluities, to retrench the redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of troubleſome and unneceſſary Ceremonies; ſo to bring Religion into as narrow a compaſs as was poſſible, that it might fall in the better with the occaſions of humane Life; and that the affairs of Heaven and Earth might not interfere, he was to make it fully reaſonable, and the reaſon of it ſo conſpicuous as that it might commend it ſelf to the minds of all Men; He was to accommodate it to humane Nature in general, ſo that no quality or condition of Life ſhould be incapable of it, that it ſhould be impoſſible to no conſtitution; excluded from no place, Climate or Country; that it ſhould be inconſiſtent with no form of Government, nor inconvenient for any Age or time of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:105404:12"/>
All this was aim'd at in the inſtitution of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion; and all this was Croſſed and Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the <hi>Leaven</hi> of the Phariſees, for that conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſo many Articles of Faith, as it was impoſſible to perſuade all Men of: It had ſo many Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, peculiar to one Country, or Climate, or Place, or Condition, or Conſtitution of Men; and others ſo numerous, as were very troubleſome to thoſe that were moſt Conſcientious of them, and moſt of them founded upon ſuch reaſons, as few Men could be ſatisfied with, and yet all of them made indiſpenſably neceſſary; that it became not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very uneaſie Religion, but impoſſible to a great part of Men, and unacceptable to all: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was ſo far unfit to become the <hi>Catholick</hi> or Univerſal Religion; that it could be only the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of a Sect and Party, and fitter to divide the World than to Unite it.</p>
            <p>It muſt needs have been very burthenſome to the Bodies of Men, to be bound to obſerve ſo many waſhings and inſtances of external Cleanneſs, as their Superſtition required: And it could not but be very troubleſome to the minds and Memories of Men, to retain ſo many little things as were ſtrictly to be obſerved, and yet could not take hold of a Mans mind, becauſe they had no Foundation in reaſon: And above all, it muſt needs be intolerable to the Conſciences of Men, and hold them in perpetual an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety and ſolicitude; when a Mans Duty was ſo large,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105404:12"/>
as that he could ſcarce ever tell when he had done, and yet every thing was alike neceſſary, and ſo the danger was Fatal, if he Omitted or failed in any part of it. Upon all theſe Accounts, Phariſaiſm contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted the deſign of our Saviour in the inſtitution of Chriſtianity; and therefore he cautions his Diſciples againſt it.</p>
            <p>Moreover Thirdly, ſuch a troubleſome and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial way of Religion as that of the Phariſees; under the form, ſupplants the very Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: Partly, as theſe nice and troubleſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances weary the minds of Men and exhauſt their beſt Spirits; and ſo that Zeal is ſpent upon Trifles which ſhould have been reſerved for more weighty occaſions: As we commonly obſerve of a bad Diet, that it not only corrupts the humours of the Body, filling it with ill Juices, but alſo clogs and ſatiares the Natural Appetite of the Stomach, and deads it to all thoſe things that might be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and beneficial; but principally, this Pompous Form undermines the power of Religion, as it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Men prone to hope to make amends for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the latter, by the redundance of the former; for it is too common and uſual for Men to think to expiate Immorality by Superſtition: And we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally obſerve, that thoſe who are over-preciſe in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle matters, are apt to indulge themſelves too much in great.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:105404:13"/>
Thus, our Saviour upbraids theſe very Men we ſpeak of, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 23. That under pretence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than exact <hi>in Tythings,</hi> Mint, Ann<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, <hi>and</hi> Commin, <hi>they neglected the weighty matters of the Law; Juſtice, Mercy, and Faith:</hi> And again, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 3. He tells them <hi>they notoriouſly made void the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God through their Traditions;</hi> for by their <hi>Corban,</hi> they Legitimated unnaturalneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Parents; by their long Prayers, they hoped to make amends for devouring Widows Houſes, and by outward waſhings, to expiate their inward Impurities: And for the ſake of theſe things, our Saviour (whoſe Deſign was to introduce true and unfeigned goodneſs, and ſincere and unaffected Piety) ſeverly interdicts this <hi>Leaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, in the Fourth place; as it is uſually obſerved, that light things are puffy and turgid, ſo it is certain that ſuch an empty and Pompous Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as that of the Phariſees, uſually ſwells and puffs Men up with Pride and conceit of themſelves, which temper is the furtheſt projection from that of the Goſpel: Such a Train of obſervances as they had, made a very Glorious and Sanctimonious ſhow, and raiſed the admiration of the World, and thereby deceived them into a great Opinion of themſelves: It was an eaſie and cheap way to Saintſhip, for the obſervation of Rites and Ceremonies coſt them lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſelf-denial and mortification; and yet it ſerved to make them to be thought the only People: Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105404:13"/>
they had a ſaying amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> in thoſe times; that, <hi>If there were but two Men to go to Heaven, the one would be a Scribe, and the other a Phariſee.</hi> Thus were theſe Aiery Bubbles blown up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, both in the conceit of the World, and in their own Opinion: So we obſerve in the Goſpel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 11. Whereas the poor <hi>Publican</hi> is dejected in the Preſence of God, in contemplation of his own miſcarriages; and therefore dares ſcarce look up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, but modeſtly ſmites upon his Breaſt, and Prays, <hi>God be Merciful to me a Sinner:</hi> The Phariſee tranſported with vulgar Applauſe and Self-admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, boldly out-faces God and Man, and cries out, <hi>God, I thank thee that I am not like other Men, for I Faſt twice a Week, and pay Tythes of all I Poſſeſs,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore challenges Heaven as due to his Merit.</p>
            <p>Not unlike Servants are the new invented Orders of Modern Phariſees, who upon the Account of their Obſervation of certain Rules of their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and of the Vows of Fantaſtick Poverty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commanded abſtinence from Fleſh or Marriage, &amp; blind Obedience to their Superiors, call themſelves the Religious; and all the World of good Chriſtians beſides, the Seculars or the Men of this World. Of ſuch a flatulent Nature is Superſtition: And thus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuoſe and ſupercilious doth it render all the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes to it; and therefore our Saviour, whoſe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105404:14"/>
was to bring Humility and Modeſty into Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, cautions earneſtly againſt this <hi>Leaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly, our Saviour by his Inſtitution, deſigned to bring in Gentleneſs and Kindneſs, Love and good will amongſt Men. But ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and ritual Religion as that of the Phariſees, naturally tends to make Men quarrelſome and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, Carnal and Sanguinary: For in the firſt place, the materials or inſtances of Superſtition are many and numerous, and ſo liable to be miſtaken; for in many things we offend all; or where our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation is very large, our Duty is very Nice and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult: Again, ſuch things being neither manifeſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by clear Reaſon, nor by evident Revelation, muſt needs be always uncertain, and ſo become matter of endleſs diſpute and contention; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if all things be alike neceſſary, and that Eternal Life depends upon every Punctilio: No wonder if Men be fierce and eager, for he that is mortally vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable in every part, muſt needs be very jealous and curious: To all which add; that the Man who hath his Religion at his Fingers ends, or <hi>in ritibus ad ſolos digitos pertinentibus,</hi> as <hi>Lactantius</hi> expreſſes it; this Man muſt need be very peremtory and dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, very decretory and deciſive; ſo that there can be no diſſenting from ſuch a Man without <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's;</hi> and his Superſtition by all theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will raiſe him to ſuch a Heat and Confidence,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105404:14"/>
that he will think he doth God good ſervice to kill thoſe that differ from him.</p>
            <p>Of this St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf was an Example; he was bred at the Feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> a Learned Traditiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Doctor, and after the ſtricteſt Sect of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, a Phariſee; and all this ſerved to inflame him againſt Chriſt and his Religion and Diſciples, to ſuch a degree, that he confeſſes he was mad againſt them, and thought he ought to do whatſoever he did or could do againſt that Name and Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>The ſame thing <hi>Tertullian</hi> 1400 Years ago ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of the <hi>Jews</hi> in general; his words are, <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogae Judaeorum fontes perſecutionum:</hi> The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Zelots were conſtantly the great inflamers of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution againſt Chriſtianity; and they when they could not do it themſelves, exaſperated the <hi>Pagans</hi> and put them upon it.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Spirit is everlaſtingly a perſecuting Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and of all mankind a Phariſee (whatever he may pretend) can never be in earneſt for Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: I would to God the Experience of all Ages had not born too undeniable a Teſtimony to the truth of this Obſervation, and that modern Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaiſm had in this reſpect amended the matter: But <hi>Leaven</hi> is <hi>Leaven,</hi> and will ever have the ſame Operation.</p>
            <p>The Man that conſiders his Religion, and weighs the reaſons of it before he imbraces it, will be Gentle and Charitable towards thoſe that differ
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105404:15"/>
from him, or are not of his Attainment; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the ſhortneſs of humane Underſtanding, that he may be deceived himſelf, and therefore pities thoſe that are ſo; he makes allowance for different Conſtitutions, ſeveral ways of Education, and the prejudices incident to Men in this World: but the blind <hi>Zelot</hi> that believes with his Will, not his Underſtanding, that ſees with other Mens Eyes, and inſlaves his mind to other Mens dictates; in a word, the Traditionary Phariſee, is bold and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, cruel and unmerciful.</p>
            <p>And the Man that is heartily and ſincerely vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, he is pitiful and compaſſionate to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of mankind; he conſiders humane frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Temptations we are beſet withal, how many times we do that which we cannot allow or juſtifie, and judges of other Men as he would be judged himſelf: But the ſupercilious Phariſee, makes no reflection upon himſelf; and therefore hath no Mercy nor Compaſſion towards others.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in anſwer to the <hi>Manichees,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to that Epiſtle of theirs, called, <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> hath this Noble and Chriſtian paſſage: <hi>Illi in vos ſaeviant, qui neſciunt quanto cum labore ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas inveniatur, &amp; quam difficulter errores caveantur;</hi> with many other excellent Words to that purpoſe. (Let thoſe ſaith he) <hi>Perſecute you, who neither knew the difficulty of diſcovering Truth, and of avoiding Error;</hi> but ſo will not I, who have Erred as you
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105404:15"/>
do, and hardly recovered the firm ground of Truth, that work is only fit for them that have their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by Rote, and their Devotion by inſtinct, that never ſtudied for Knowledge, nor laboured for Vertue; that are Infallible by an implicit Faith, and devout without Piety, that is, thoſe that are of the right <hi>Leaven</hi> of Phariſaiſm.</p>
            <p>Theſe in ſhort, are ſome of the Cauſes why our Saviour gave ſuch a ſtrict and Solemn charge againſt the <hi>Leaven</hi> of the Phariſees and of the Sadducees. And now, it is time to come to the Fourth and laſt Branch of my Text; namely, to ſhew what our Saviour means by this expreſſion, <hi>Take heed and beware,</hi> and what is the Duty of his Diſciples in this particular, and that I will now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour briefly to explain, and then conclude.</p>
            <p>In order to which, in the firſt place it is to be obſerved; that the Emphaſis lies in the word <hi>Leaven;</hi> for it is not ſo much the Men of the Sect of the Phariſees and Sadducees that are to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the <hi>Leaven</hi> of thoſe Sects, and that is ſo much the more to be taken care of; becauſe there may be the <hi>Leaven</hi> of thoſe Sects, though the Name be forgotten, and the Men ſo called, be gone off the Stage: And it is much to be doubted, or rather it is paſt doubt, that there is a <hi>Leaven</hi> of Phariſaiſm, and Sadduciſm amongſt Chriſtians as well as there was amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps amongſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as well as <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105404:16"/>
therefore, it will be our Duty to obſerve and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh it; As for Inſtance,</p>
            <p>Wherever we find a ſort of Pretenders to the <hi>Atomical</hi> or <hi>Epicurean</hi> Philoſophy, that aſſert there is nothing but Matter or Body in the Univerſe; theſe Men, let them be otherwiſe never ſo Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or let them cover and diſguiſe the buſineſs as well as they can, muſt neceſſarily upon their Principles, take away the being of Angels and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and all the concern of another World; and therefore, are of the <hi>Leaven</hi> of Sadduciſm.</p>
            <p>Or if there be in this Age thoſe that would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade themſelves and others, that it is a piece of Superſtition to be ſtrait-laced in Conſcience, or a kind of Fanaticiſm to be curious what Religion a Man is of, and that that whole affair is Matter of indifferency, ſince God is pleaſed with variety, or regards not what Principles Men are of, ſo they be Devout and Honeſt in their reſpective perſuaſions: This conceit wherever it is, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better than a piece of the Old <hi>Leaven</hi> of Sadduciſm.</p>
            <p>Or if there be thoſe that aſſert, that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Chriſt Jeſus, is only to be of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Prince and Country.</p>
            <p>Or that whatſoever a Man believes in his Heart, it is lawful for him to conceal and diſguiſe it, and to make profeſſion of that which comports beſt with his Safety and Intereſt; all this is Sadduciſm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:105404:16"/>
To give one inſtance more on this Head; Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they be that would perſuade us, we muſt needs underſtand thoſe Famous words, <hi>Hoc eſt Corpus meum,</hi> in the groſs literal ſence, againſt all the Reaſon of the world, and the very Teſtimony of our Saviour; this is neither better nor worſe, than a ſpice of old Sadduciſm.</p>
            <p>And then on the other ſide, (for the Phariſees) Wherever we obſerve Men building their Faith and Religion upon Oral and unwritten Tradition, and equalling that to the Holy Scripture and written Word of God, this is Phariſaiſm.</p>
            <p>Or wherever we find Men impoſing upon others, a vaſt and voluminous Creed, and enjoyning a World of Nice Obſervances, under the Peril of Eternal Damnation, (if they be not complied with) or the Yoke laid upon the Neck of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Lord, no whit Inferious to that of <hi>Judaiſm;</hi> in all this, there is the Spirit of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaiſm.</p>
            <p>Wherever we ſee Men lay mighty ſtreſs upon diſputable Opinions, or to Save or Damn Men accordingly as they are of ſuch or ſuch a Party, here is the plain Genius of Phariſaiſm.</p>
            <p>To name no more, Wherever we obſerve Men to be mighty pretenders to Devotion, but care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of Juſtice and Charity, or to ſtrain at a <hi>Gnat</hi> and ſwallow a <hi>Camel;</hi> all this is the <hi>Leaven</hi> of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaiſm, wherever it is found, and to be avoided accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:105404:17"/>
In the next place, let us conſider the Emphaſis of theſe Words of our Saviour, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Take heed and beware;</hi> it is an earneſt expreſſion that I do not remember to have obſerved above once more in the whole <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and (to be ſure) imports no leſs, than that great application of mind is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in this particular. Religion is certainly a buſineſs that deſerves to be well conſidered of, and to be carefully examined and well underſtood as well as Devoutly proſecuted; nor is there any thing in this World, for the ſake of which God gave us our Underſtanding, more than to inquire into this weighty affair: And the leaſt that can be made of the charge here in the Text, is, that we by no means allow our ſelves Supinely to ſwallow whatſoever is either firſt Suggeſted, or imperiouſly Dictated to us, ſince ſuch an Implicit Faith, is the very firſt working of the <hi>Leaven</hi> of the Phariſaiſm and Sadduciſm; and the vindicating our ſelves to our ſelves, and the aſſerting the Freedom of our own Thoughts and Liberty of judging for our ſelves is the firſt Step to true and generous Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and the way to be everlaſtingly ſecured from the aforeſaid <hi>Leaven;</hi> For example,</p>
            <p>If we freely conſult our own Reaſon, we ſhall never be able to think of God Almighty as of a partial Deity, or an accepter of Perſons, that will Save or Damn Men in groſs, accordingly as they ſhall be of ſuch a Sect or Party: We ſhall
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105404:17"/>
never be able to imagine, that a great and wiſe Majeſty, will have any great value for empty forms and meer Pageantry of Religion; as if we had a Fancy like that of the <hi>Pantomime</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> who having been admired by the Rabble, would needs have the fondneſs to go alſo into the Capitol, and play his Tricks over before the Gods, as if God muſt needs be pleaſed with what the ſilly multitude admired.</p>
            <p>It can never enter into a conſidering Mans thoughts, that the Divine Majeſty ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiated with Beads and Baubles, that Mony ſhould Purchaſe his Favour to the Wicked Man, that he ſhould be corrupted with Bribes, or impoſed upon, and won with Complements.</p>
            <p>In a word, no Man that hath, and makes uſe of the diſcretion of a reaſonable Creature, can think ſo unworthily of God, as that he ſhould be fatally offended with little miſtakes in Opinion; or that he will caſt away a very ſincere and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Man, meerly upon the Account of a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony under or over; and he that allows himſelf but this kind of modeſt Freedom of mind, hath made good Proviſion againſt the danger of the <hi>Leaven</hi> of Phariſaiſm and Sadduciſm.</p>
            <p>Again, in the Third place; the moſt effectual ſecurity againſt the aforeſaid <hi>Leaven,</hi> is to keep to the Holy Scripture, eſpecially of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> to ſtudy that, and take all the Meaſures of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105404:18"/>
our Religion thence: If we truſt to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and dictates of Men, or to the Cuſtoms and Faſhions of the World; they will betray us to thoſe <hi>Leavens;</hi> or if meerly upon unwritten Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that like a common Sewer brings down for the moſt part, the Traſh and Rubbiſh of former times; very often letting the moſt weighty things ſink and periſh in the paſſage: For proof of which, we need no other evidence, but the experience of the <hi>Jews,</hi> amongſt whom, one cannot but admire, what childiſh and ridiculous Stories, this way of Tradition hath filled them with; inſomuch, that this Oral part of their Religion, hath almoſt quite diſparaged that which was written and Divinely revealed, meerly by the Vicinage and Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with it.</p>
            <p>Whereas, if we attend, to and ſtudy the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture; that will not only preſerve us from ſuch mean and unworthy Notions of God and Religion; but will ingage us in ſuch a method as ſhall both make us better Men, and the World the better for us.</p>
            <p>If we govern our ſelves by Tradition and the Fancies of Men, then all our Care and Devotion will be laid out in Cultivating an Opinion in Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Addreſſes to the Deity, in Pompous Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, or in Scrupulous Obſervance; but if we conſult the Scripture, that will teach us, <hi>that God will have Mercy and not Sacrifice,</hi> and that a pure
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105404:18"/>
Mind and an Holy Life, are more acceptable to him than long Prayers, frequent Faſts, and the moſt coſtly Offerings: There we ſhall find, that the firſt and great Commandment of Gods Law is, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy Heart, and with all thy Mind, and with all thy Strength;</hi> and that whatever demonſtrates ſincere Love to him, be it little or much, is ſure to procure his Favour: Theſe we ſhall learn expreſly, that the Lord our God is not pleaſed with the Fat of Lambs, nor propitiated with Rivers of Oyl; neither doth he require the fruit of our Bodies, to expiate the Sin of our Souls; <hi>but that we do juſtly, and love Mercy, and walk humbly with our God:</hi> The due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of which paſſages of Scripture, will effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually Antidote us againſt the Infection of any of the aforeſaid <hi>Leavens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all which; I add in the laſt place, that if we do but mind the Nature and Notion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and conſider the Genius and Spirit of that Religion, we are ſafe; particularly, if we do but look upon it under the repreſentation which thoſe two Words or Phraſes give of it; whereby it is called, a <hi>reaſonable Service,</hi> and <hi>a Spiritual Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the former, no Man can be ſo abſurd, as to think that a reaſonable ſervice which is built upon an implicit Faith, and where a Man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands nothing of the Reaſon and Grounds of his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105404:19"/>
Religion, but in a Blind Obedience, ſervilely and brutiſhly gives himſelf up to the Conduct of others, or when he Worſhips God in a Language whereof he hath no knowledge or underſtanding.</p>
            <p>And as for the other Phraſe of a Spiritual Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; can any Man of common ſenſe take that to be a Spiritual Religion, which is made up of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Drudgeries; of meer Forms, and Rites, and Ceremonies? But to be a Chriſtian, is to have worthy Notions of God in our minds, and a flame of ſervent Piety and Devotion to him in our Hearts; to Love him, to Fear him, to Truſt in him, to be Holy, and Juſt and Sober in our Lives, and to be peaceable in our Spirits; ſuch a Religion as this is worthy of God, was fit for the Son of God to be the Author and Publiſher of; and the Conſciencious Obſervance of it will fit us for, and in due time bring us to the poſſeſſion of the Heavenly Manſions above, and the Eternal Society of glorious Saints and Angels in Heaven: <hi>Which God grant to us all, through the Merits and Mediation of the ſame Jeſus Chriſt Our Lord: To whom be Glory and Honour, and Adoration, for ever, and ever,</hi> Amen.</p>
