         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Publishers Preface.</head>
            <p>THat the Reader may have no scruple left upon him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the following Papers, I shall beg his leave to
remove two Objections, which it is not improbable may be
raised against them.</p>
            <p>The first relates to the subject of the Book it self, which perhaps
may suffer in some peoples esteem, because the Person whose Life
is described, attained to no higher a Post, than that of a Captain
in the Guards, and Commissary General of the <hi>Swisse</hi> Troops. This,
tho it may seem a reasonable disadvantage, yet, when well exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,
is what men should rather be asham'd to pretend: For the
bottom of it all is that vulgar Error, that Titles and Preferments
are the only marks of Merit; as if a mans Accomplishments and
his Valour, were not to be measured by any instances of Wisdom and
Gallantry in his actions; but by the Rewards and Advancements
he hath met with, in consideration of them. Which is in effect to
make unsuccessful Vertue none at all; and to set up Chance and
Partiality, a lucky Hit, or a powerful Interest, for the only
Standard to judge men by. Vpon these terms indeed, the Sieur
<hi>de Pontis</hi> is like to find but little respect; but if True Courage
and Conduct, inviolable Fidelity, and generous Friendship, be
still Characters of any figure in Story, these <hi>Memoirs</hi> may have
the advantage of many more pompous Writers. And it would be
a double hardship, that not only his Fortunes, while he was living,
but his Memory now too, should suffer for those disappointments,
which were chiefly owing to his Vertue and Constancy, and the
<pb facs="tcp:100923:4"/>
Spightful Resentments of an Arbitrary and Intriguing States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>I own that Persons of the first Quality are more entertaining
subjects, as their Vertues and their Vices commonly bear proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to their high station. They have it most in their power to be
eminently Good or Bad; and consequently such relations fill our
minds with greater and more surprizing Ideas. But since the
principal Benefit of History is to present us with Examples, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to be imitated, or to be declined, those of a middle size must
needs be exceeding useful, because they fall more within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of mankind. The actions of persons a great deal above us,
are matter of Contemplation rather than Practice; for when we
have done all we can, mens Virtues are suited and peculiar to
their Conditions in this World. We must be content with the
things in our own Sphere, and consequently are best instructed by
Examples that come within our Imitation. We may admire and
gaze at those that stand higher, and shall do well to make their
good Qualities our Patterns, because there is no such inequality
in Souls; but if we hope to exert them in the same manner, and
make their way of Living and Management a Rule for our own
behaviour, while we want their Fortunes and their Advantages,
we may as well pretend to fly without Wings. Our Ruine in this
case will be as certain, and our Folly as ridiculous, as the Frogs
in the Fable, which swell'd, and would fain have come up to the
bigness of the Ox, but burst in the vain attempt. There must
go something more than Nature to the making a very great man;
Just worth is therefore to be duly regarded where-ever we find it;
and a noble Soul is not the less, but really the more so, when it
shines by its own light, without any of that borrowed lustre, which
is so often owing to Greatness and Fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100923:4"/>
These, and possibly some other and better Considerations, might
incline some persons of Great Quality, and particularly One,
whose Judgment all the World knew, and whose Memory they will
ever honour, to propose the putting this Book into our own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:
and it were unreasonable to doubt the good acceptance of
a Work, recommended by so Judicious a person, and performed
by so known, and so faithful a hand.</p>
            <p>But because this performance too may be called in some question,
I will here give a very brief account of the Translation it self;
which is the other Objection I suppose these Papers liable too.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> began it some six Months before his Death, and at
his leisure hours had made so considerable a progress, that some
of the first Part was transcribed fair for the Press. The Papers,
left in the Hands of one of his Children, lay neglected for some
Years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till at last, a Relation happening to read some of them,
undertook to see them corrected, and perfected for the World, as
you now have them. Had the Author himself been living, they
had appeared long ago; or had Good Fortune directed to the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them sooner, there had been no place for an objection, of
coming out five Years after the Author's Decease. I know what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
Men receive sometimes from Posthumous Pieces, and were
not this genuine, the most part now by me, under his own hand,
and such as I know to have been certainly intended for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
I durst not have made bold with his Memory and his Name.
I would not have done it with any Man's, but especially not with
his; which hath suffered too much already, by the indirect Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of another Piece.</p>
            <p>The only thing I shall say, (though not the only one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
to be said) on this occasion, is, that if the Person, who
disposed of those Poems to the Booksellers, had consulted Mr. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s
Relations, as he ought to have done, both his Memory and
<pb facs="tcp:100923:5"/>
the World had been much more obliged to him. For by these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous
Proceedings, he hath obstructed the publishing of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
very different from that; and well chosen by the Author,
with a Preface, prepared by himself, and all copied out for the
Press. This digression I thought due to the Character of a Person,
whose other Performances have been so well received, who knew
how to distiuguish between writing for his own Diversion, and
the Entertainment of others, and had a better Judgment, than to
thrust any thing abroad, unworthy himself or his Readers. I only
beg pardon for being in one sense very unseasonable; for in truth,
the World ought to have been undeceived in this point a great deal
sooner, and by an Advertisement very different from this.</p>

stay'd some months with him; where, finding that he would only em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
me in the care of Husbandry, a thing that I found my self ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
averse to, and unfit for, I took up a resolution to go to <hi>Paris,</hi>
there my self to labour my own Advancement in the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well
as I could. I therefore entreated of my Brother so much as was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for me in order to this design: but his coldness compell'd me to
seek out to my other Relations, and particularly to address my self to
an Aunt I had, who had a great affection for me. From her I received
all I could desire for my Journey; and from an Unkle, who also lov'd
me very well, a little Horse; and with this younger Brothers equipage,
after having taken leave of my friends, I set forward for <hi>Paris.</hi> Going
by <hi>Grenoble,</hi> which is two days Journey from <hi>Pontis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> I thought
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100923:6"/>
my self oblig'd to go wait upon Monsieur <hi>de L'Ediguieres,</hi> to
whom I had the honour to be a-kin; I was by him receiv'd with
great demonstrations of bounty and favour; and he was pleas'd to
ask me what was my design in the Journey I had in hand; I made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That I had a desire to learn to become an honest man, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my self fit to make him a tender of my service. He was pleas'd with
my answer, and being willing to serve me in my design, gave me a
Letter of Recommendation to Monsieur <hi>de Crequy,</hi> his Son-in-law, who
was then in treaty about the Regiment of Guards, to receive me into
them, as a Kinsman of his, and a young Gentleman for whom he had a
particular esteem. But Monsieur <hi>de Crequy</hi> did not so soon conclude his
bargain, which hindred him from executing the order he had receiv'd.
In the mean time, the violent desire I had to enter into the Regiment
of Guards, as the best School wherein to learn the Trade I had so great
a passion for, pusht me on to go and present my self to Monsieur <hi>de Gril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
who was Camp-master of it; of him to entreat the favour, that I
might be there receiv'd. But Monsieur <hi>de Grillon,</hi> who would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that any one should enter so young, told me that he could not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me; he accompanied his denyal nevertheless with the greatest
testimony of friendship that it was possible for him ever to give; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
that he would entertain me a year in his own house, till I should
be strong enough to enter the body. And accordingly he fail'd not
some time after to receive me into it, with a particular affection, which
he also continued to me ever since, as in the progress of these Memoirs
I shall make appear.</p>
               <p>II. Seeing that Acts of Generosity ought to be recorded for example
to other, I think my self oblig'd in this place, to give an account of
one, which Monsieur <hi>de Vitry,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Guards du Corps,</hi> practic'd
in my favour, at the time when I was a Cadet in the Regiment of Guards
under <hi>King Henry</hi> IV. Being one day at <hi>Melun,</hi> I went a hunting, with
three of my Comrades in the Forrest of <hi>Fontain-bleau.</hi> At the entring
into the Forrest we were aware of a great Stag, that came running di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
towards us. The ardour of the Chase transported me so far on
the sudden, that without demur, or giving my self the leisure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
whether this Beast was priviledg'd or no, I presently discharg'd
my Fusee upon him, and laid him dead upon the place. I presently
charg'd again for fear of surprize, and immediately we heard the Hounds
that were in chase of him, and saw a Cavalier, who was Monsieur <hi>de
Vitry,</hi> galloping towards us, who began to cry out to us, So-ho, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dets,
down with your Arms: but seeing we were not dispos'd to obey
him, he drew his Pistol, and I presenting my Fusee against him at the
same time, call'd out to him to approach no nearer, and not to compel
me to fire upon him. It had been a great rashness in him to have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd, and he took the wisest course, which was to turn about, and
go make his complaint to the king. In the mean time, as it was not
safe for us to stay any longer there, we retired as privately as we could
to <hi>Melu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> and very well believing that this affair might have some ill
consequences, I askt leave of my Captain, Monsieur <hi>de Bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ac,</hi> to make
a little Journey to <hi>Paris,</hi> where I pretended to have some business. My
three other Comrades also found out one way or other to absent themselves
from the Company. So that the King having given order to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of the Regiment, to make a review in the presence of Monsieur de
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100923:6"/>
                  <hi>Vitry,</hi> that he might take notice of the Offenders, he could never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
any one of us. Yet was I, for all that, under some suspicion, by
reason that I was known to be a little eager of the Chace; but having
obtain'd my leave in due form, they could not well conclude me abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
guilty: and so at last this affair past over, without much more
talk of it.</p>
               <p>About three months after it fell out, that I being upon Duty before
the Gate of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Vitry</hi> passing by, knew me again,
and immediately applying himself to me, O ho! Cadet, said he, you
are my man! Do you remember the Stag at <hi>Fontain-bleau?</hi> In good
earnest I was very much surpriz'd at his Complement, especially in the
post I then was, which I was by no means to quit; so that having no
other way left me but that of entreaty and submission, I said to him,
in the most humble and moving Accent that I could form my voice to,
Ah Sir, would you ruine me? Have compassion upon a poor Cadet as
I am. He answer'd me after the most obliging manner in the world;
'Tis enough that I know you, said he, and I am so far from being the
cause of your ruine, that I resolve to serve you: Come see me, I give
you my word, upon the faith of a Gentleman, no harm shall befall you.
In the mean time, so soon as he was gone from me, I not yet having the
honour to know him, and the apprehension wherein I was, not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
me to repose too much confidence upon his word, I made my Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
believe that I had some inconvenience upon me, that would not
suffer me to continue any longer upon my Post; and withal intreated,
he would put some other in my place, which he did, without suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing, and I kept my self afterwards upon my guard. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
three or four days going to wait upon Monsieur <hi>de Vitry,</hi> fearing
always, and not being able, after the fault I had committed, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
my self before him; but at last I resolv'd to go one morning, and
took two or three of my Comrades along with me; we found him abed,
and being enter'd the Room, I made him my Compliment with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
excuses, for the misfortune that had befaln me; assuring him that
I was extreamly troubled, that I had carried my self so like a Beast,
towards a person of his quality, and one to whose generosity I stood
obliged for my life. He was pleased to receive me with great testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of affection, and embracing me, told me, with the greatest civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in the world, that he was extreamly glad to be acquainted with
me, and that he would make use of me upon occasions; and supposing
rightly, that I might stand in need of Money, he presented me with
some Pistols, and compell'd me to receive them, telling me that a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
ought to refuse nothing.</p>
               <p>III. About the same time, I had a Contest of an extraordinary kind,
with a friend of mine, and was very near bringing my self into a scurvy
circumstance, by insisting upon the punctilio's of gererosity and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
in his behalf. His name was <hi>Esperance,</hi> and he was the natural Son
of the famous Monsieur <hi>de Grillon.</hi> This Gentleman having fought a
Duel, after a very severe Edict of the King, that expressly Interdicted
all Duels, he was seiz'd, and condemn'd to be shot to death. He, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the custom, conjur'd me, being his intimate friend, to be his
Godfather, (as they call it) and to give him his first shot: but I, who
could not suffer my friendship to be govern'd by this cruel, and false
Custom, plainly told him, That for the very reason, that I was his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100923:7"/>
intimate Friend, I would not be his Executioner; and that absolutely I
could not kill the man I lov'd. He still urg'd me to do it with great
earnestness and importunity, and gave me several instances to induce
me to give him that last testimony of friendship; telling me, that it was
a Custom, and practic'd by the most faithful friends: I resolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
that I did not follow the fashion in my Friendship; and that it
was in vain to press me to do an act, I could not think on without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and that I would never do it. Our Lieutenant-Collonel, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Sainte Colombe,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Brisac,</hi> my Captain, did both
of them command me to do what my friend requir'd; but I roundly
answer'd them, That the friendship I had for him would not suffer me
to do it: They then proceeded to threats, telling me, That if I did
not obey Justice, I should be executed in the Criminals stead. I made
answer with the same constancy, That I could not obey in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and that I was ready to dye in my friends stead, rather than set
my hand to his death; and thereupon was presently committed to
Prison, and went without regret, for so good a cause. But they
were satisfied in the end, that my refusal in this affair, did not proceed
from humour, or obstinacy, but a true foundation of friendship, which
will not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> permit a generous man to take away the life of his friend, in
obedience to a false and ridiculous custom; so that I was soon set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
and tho the rules of military discipline oblig'd the Officers to
reprimand me for my disobedience, they made it notwithstanding ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that they had me not in less esteem upon this account, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
the resolution I had manifested in this affair.</p>
               <p>IV. I had after this an opportunity to be known of the King, and
some of the greatest men of the Court, by an accident, which though very
inconsiderable in it self, was not however disadvantageous to such a
younger Brother as I. King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. being at <hi>Fontain-bleau,</hi> had some
jealousie of one of the principal Lords of his Court, about a Lady then
in the Castle, and suspected that he went privately to her. But he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
those visits with so much circumspection that he could never be
discovered, after the King had contriv'd the means by which he might
be surprized, he concluded at last to choose out a person that was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
subtle, and bold, to execute his design, and to deliver him from
the disquiet he was in upon that subject. He gave order therefore to
Monsieur <hi>Belingan,</hi> one of the principal Gentlemen of his Bed-chamber,
and the great Confident of all his Intrigues, to find him out two such as he
design'd, to plant upon two Avenues, where they might stand as Spies
upon him, of whom his Majesty had the suspicion. Monsieur <hi>de Belin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>
having accordingly spoke to Monsieur <hi>de Sainte Colombe,</hi> Lieutenant
Collonel of the Regiment of Guards, he immediately commanded the
eldest Corporal of his own Company, to choose him out two Souldiers,
such as were capable of executing the Kings design. The lot fell upon
me, and the Corporal having chosen me for one that was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to his Majesty, he carried me to his Lieutenant Collonel, who
brought me to Monsieur <hi>Belingan,</hi> who told me, that an occasion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
it self very advantageous for me, such as was likely to make my
fortune, and bring me to the knowledge of the King, in doing him a
considerable service. 'Tis believ'd, said he to me, that you neither
want Courage nor Conduct to carry on this affair; and it very much
concerns you to make it appear that we are not deceived in our choice.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100923:7"/>
How well disposed a young man as I was must be, when I heard talk of
the Kings service, and my own fortune, I leave every one to judge.
I return'd Monsieur <hi>de Belingan</hi> my most humble thanks, assuring him,
that I should never forget the favour he did me in procuring me so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
an occasion of making my fortunes; assuring him in the
mean time, that I would faithfully acquit my self of the commands he
should please to give me. He thereupon acquainted me with the Kings
pleasure, which was, that I should at night post my self Centinel in
some part o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Gallery, where I could not be seen, and from whence
I might see him, who his Majesty suspected, about eleven of the Clock
would go into a certain Chamber of the Castle: That I should dog him
every where, till he came back to the Chamber where he lay, to the
end one might be certain who he was; and because he might open and
shut several Doors, to hinder me from following him, he deliver'd me
a key that would open them all; adding to his Instructions, That I
should satisfie my self with following him, without saying any thing to
him; but be sure never to lose sight of him, till he was return'd into
his own Chamber: I again assur'd Monsieur <hi>de Belingan,</hi> that he might
wholly rely upon me for this affair, and that I soon hop'd to give him
the satisfaction he desired.</p>
               <p>I went upon that instant to look out the post most proper for my design,
and having chosen it, return<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, expecting the hour that I was to go
thither, which was, when the King went into his Bed-chamber, where
I was told this Gentleman usually was. I return'd then about eleven of
the Clock into the Gallery, and posted my self in an obscure place,
where I could not be perceiv'd. About an hour after, I heard my Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
come, but being there was no light, one could not know him.
I gave him not time to enter into the Chamber, whither he was going,
because I follow'd him, and he hearing me, turn'd off into another Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
into which he slipt so softly, and so quick, that I had very near
lost him in the dark. This oblig'd me to mend my pace, that I might
follow him closer, and made him doubt that he was dogg'd; so that entring
into the Stagge Gallery, he shut the door after him, hoping there to
give me a stop. But he was very much astonisht to hear the door pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
open again behind him, and to see himself follow'd, as before.
To disengage himself then from him by whom he was so closely pursu'd,
he took a hundred turns in the Courts and base Courts, and at last whipt
on a sudden into the Garden; the door of which he clapt hard to, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by this means to escape from me, and to hide himself in some place
or other from my sight. His design succeeded well enough at first, for
having convey'd himself into a great and thick Pallisade that cast a great
shade, and conceald him from the light of the Moon, I saw no creature
when I came into the Garden. I began to fall into great fears, and ran
up and down the Garden like mad, without being able to discover any
thing at all: but when I was almost in despair, and enrag'd at my self,
that I should let him escape so, returning towards the Garden-door,
and prying into the thickest of the nearest Pallisadoes, I there espied
him; and resolv'd, that I might lose him no more, to follow him close
at the heels. He perceiving himself to be thus discover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, in a great
rage came out of his corner, making as though he would walk a great
pace, but on a sudden turn'd about, saying aloud; <hi>Ha! this is too much!</hi>
and at the same time made an offer to draw his Sword. I stopt, and
stood my ground without speaking a word, as I had been commanded.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100923:8"/>
And withal gave him to understand by my posture, that I was resolv'd
to defend my self, if urg'd to it. This Lord judging by my countenance,
that I was not of a humour to suffer my self to be ill us'd, took some
few turns more in the Garden, after which he came into the Gallery
again, and from thence retir'd into his Chamber; at the door of which
I remain'd, as if upon Duty. But I was not long alone in this place,
for about two hours after midnight, Monsieur <hi>de Belingan</hi> came to seek
me out, to know what discovery I had made: I began to give him a
relation of all that had past, when the King himself appeared at the end
of the Gallery, in his Night-gown, with a little Lanthorn in his hand.
We immediately advanc'd towards him, when, though I had never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had the honour to speak to the King, I endeavour'd to give him
the best account of my Commission I could, and related to him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any confusion, all the walks I had had, and all the turns and returns
that I had caus'd this Lord to make; and when I represented to him in
downright terms, the fury with which he sally'd out from the Pallisade,
and had made a shew of drawing his Sword, the King interrupting me
askt, But what wouldst thou have done, Cadet, if he had faln upon thee?
I should have defended my self, Sir, said I, for your Majesty had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me not to speak, 'tis true, but not that I should not defend my
self; at which his Majesty bursting out a laughing, said I believe thou
wouldst, by what I see in thee. After which he would have me more
particularly act before him both the posture and action of this Lord;
which I also attempted to do, after the most lively and pleasant manner
that I possibly could; and that I thought would best please him. Which
little Farce being ended, he told me that he was perfectly satisfied with
my service, and promis'd me that he would bear it in mind. From
thenceforward Monsieur <hi>de Belingan</hi> had a particular affection for me,
by reason of the manner after which I had receiv'd, and executed the
proposition he had made to me; and that he might have more room
to serve me with the King, he askt me if I had not had Relations, that
had done his Majesty some considerable service. To which I nam'd to
him, amongst others, an Unkle I had, call'd <hi>d'Estoublon,</hi> who had brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
signaliz'd himself in the Wars of <hi>Provence;</hi> from whence he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
took occasion to tell the King, speaking of me, that this Cadet
began to follow the steps of his Unkle, who had done his Majesty very
particular services, and whose name was <hi>d'Estoublon.</hi> The King said
he remembred him very well, adding, that he was a very brave man,
and had done him great services; and gaveMonsieur <hi>Belingan</hi> order at the
same time to give me a hundred Crowns. Monsieur <hi>de Belingan</hi> took the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to tell him that I deserved so much every year, upon the account
of the good services of my friends, and that which I had done his Majesty
in my own person; which the King with great bounty immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to: and thus was I on a sudden provided for by the State, having a
pension from the King. Going the next day to Monsieur <hi>de Belingan,</hi> I there
found the hundred Crowns ready told out; and he promis'd me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to sollicit the Patent for the pension, which also in few days he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.
I found my self so sensibly oblig'd by the generous fashion,
wherewith he serv'd me upon this occasion, that I have all my life since
sought opportunities of manifesting my acknowledgment, as well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his own person as his Sons. For, though what he had procur'd for
me was very inconsiderable in it self, I rather valued it from the heart,
wherewith he had done it, than from the value of the thing; and I can
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100923:8"/>
truly say, that I had even then a great aversion for interested friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
which are proportion'd according to the service a man hopes to
receive from his friends, and not by the mutual confidence and union
of hearts. I thought, having receiv'd this money I speak of, that I
could not better gratifie the choice my Corporal had made of me, than
by giving him a share with me. And being willing others should also
share in the Kings bounty, I lent some to some of my Comrades, who
stood in need enough.</p>
               <p>V. I continued yet some years in the Guards, till I was forc'd to leave
them by a wretched affair, which I should be ashamd to speak of in
this place, were it not to show, with how great wisdom the King hath
cast a scandal upon Duels, which past before for honourable, though so
contrary to all, both Divine and Humane Laws, and that they were
the ruine of the <hi>French</hi> Gentry.</p>
               <p>A young Cadet, like my self, call'd <hi>Vernetel,</hi> receiv'd a box of the
ear from another Gentlemen, whose name was <hi>Du Mas,</hi> who was of the
same Company, and who, having fell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d him with the blow, spurn'd him
under foot, and went over his belly. This outrage put him out of all
temper, and in the unhappy necessity, wherein he thought himself en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd,
by the false honour of the world, either to revenge himself or
to perish, being deaf to all proposals of accommodation upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
he addrest himself to me, who was his particular friend, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
me to assist him in the recovery of his honour. I, who at that
time was corrupted with the same Maximes, thought I could not deny
him that service, and consequently embrac'd the motion. I had much
ado to speak in private to <hi>Du Mas,</hi> by reason that his action having
made a great noise, he had many eyes upon him. But at last, about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
days after, all the Regiment being at <hi>Argenteuil,</hi> and the Officers
being all at a Council of War, to sentence a souldier who had robb'd,
I came up to him, and told him that <hi>Vernetel</hi> stay'd for him about the
thing he knew of: He made answer, that he had two friends, from
which he could not disengage himself; I thereupon entreated him to
content himself with only exposing one of them in his service, because
there was none but I with my friend. But, seeing I could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him, I went away, only telling him, that I would presently bring
him more news. A Cadet that overheard us, came and told me, that
he saw very well what we were about, and threatned withal to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
me, if he might not make one; so much the fury of these sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Duels past in these days for an Heroick action. I then did all that
in me lay to undeceive him from this suspicion: but not being able,
with all I could say to perswade him, I saw my self constrain'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to him the true state of the case: to which he coldly answer'd, The
cause is too good, a man cannot perish in it. The bargain being thus
agreed on both sides, we went over by Boat into an Island, which was
the appointed place, and bound the Water-man, that no body might
get over to us, as also that we might get back again after the Combat:
which was so bloody, that of six, five were very much wounded,
whereof one was left upon the place, and within four and twenty hours
died, and another about three weeks after.</p>
               <p>It happen'd that we were perceiv'd at last by the Officers of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment,
who were all along by the water side: These immediately took
Boats to come over to us; but we having had so much leisure as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100923:9"/>
our own, we got over to the shore before they could reach us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
from whence every one made the best that he could to save himself:
I for my part, being very much wounded, by him of whom I had had
the advantage, I was taken before I could get to the place where I hop'd
to secure my self, and carried to prison in the <hi>Fauxbourg St. Jacques,</hi> the
very same place where now stands the Abby-Royal of <hi>Val de Grace,</hi>
which was then the prison for the Souldiers of the Regiment. There
were also some others of us taken, but I was the only man committed
to prison, not having found so much favour as they. A few days after,
they prepared to bring me to my Tryal, of which the issue could not
doubtless have been advantageous to me: but upon <hi>Whitsunday,</hi> by all
good tokens, whilst the Jaylor and his Wife were at Church at their
devotions, some of my Comrades undertaking some means to save my
Life, as well of their own good will, as that of Monsieur <hi>de Grillon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
who had hinted to them, that he should be glad it could be done, found
means to let me down a Rope by a Chimney, by which I got up to the
top, and escap'd over the Tiles; I was discover'd and pursu'd, but I got
into a Cellar of the Castle of <hi>Bissetre,</hi> where I lay conceal'd. Thus was
God pleas'd doubly to save my life, as well from him against whom I
had fought, as from Justice, which I could not otherwise have escap'd.
I then made a very serious reflexion upon the action wherein I had been
so lately engag'd, and indeed it appear'd to me so bloody and inhumane,
that, tho I could not as yet absolutely wean my self from those they call the
Rules of Honour, I did nevertheless from that very instant make a firm reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
to try all arts imaginable never to be again engag'd in so unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
a necessity.</p>
               <p>Seeing my self then no more in a condition to appear, and enforc'd
to withdraw till this affair should be husht up; I resolv'd in the year
1602 to accompany several Gentlemen, who were going into <hi>Holland,</hi>
and there to pass away all the time of my disgrace. And accordingly
thither we went all together, and continued there some ten months.</p>
               <p>VI. At the expiration of these, we resolv'd to pass into <hi>Germany,</hi> and
thence into <hi>Muscovia;</hi> but our Journey was cut short, for about three
days Journey from the <hi>Hague,</hi> we were taken by some Light Horse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> who, looking upon us as Run-aways
from the Army, carried us to the next Town, where we were all clapt
up in prison. The Justice that usually passes upon Deserters being
very quick, they did not long deliberate upon our Sentence; but they
consider'd the number of us, and thereupon order'd that we should be
decimated, and that every tenth man, upon whom the lot fell, should
be hang'd. In the mean time, chance being uncertain, every one was
equally in fear for himself, and all of us interested our selves in a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
that nevertheless could only fall upon a part. A Priest came
to visit us in the prison to comfort us, and to prepare us for death, which
induc'd some of us to confess our selves to this good father: but I for
my part must acknowledge that I was in so great an astonishment, and so
affrighted at such a kind of death, that I could not take any care of my
Conscience.</p>
               <p>At last the immediate danger wherein we saw our selves involv'd,
open'd our understandings, so that we entreated one of our Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who had a great deal of art, and was a good Scholar, and that
above all was very perfect in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, to write a Letter to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100923:9"/>
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> by way of Apology, to try if that might not so move
him, that we might obtain our pardon. He did it with marvellous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility,
representing to his Highness, That we were several Gentlemen,
who after that our curiosity and ardour for War had made us leave our
own Country, to come and bear Arms in a foreign State, to learn the
military exercises there, by practice; we were in some measure excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable,
if the same curiosity had prompted us to go on further into other
Provinces, that we might the better know the different customes of
diverse Nations, and so of every one to cull out the best. That this
inclination was more natural to <hi>French-men</hi> than to all other people,
and if we had committed a fault upon this occasion, in not first obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
leave, we hop'd his Highness would have the goodness to pardon
us, and to excuse the hot humour of the <hi>French</hi> youth: that there had
been no malice in the proceeding, but only a little of the levity natural to
the Nation; that it was becoming his Grandeur to make a difference
betwixt offenders, and to distingnish the quality of offences, by the
natural disposition of those who did commit them. In fine, he couch'd
this short Apology in so elegant <hi>Latin,</hi> and did illustrate it with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Reasons, borrow'd from a Military Rhetorick, which the fear of
present death did very much animate, that it was impossible for the
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to resist so just, and so soft a violence; so that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
granted our pardon: but upon condition nevertheless, that
we should yet serve some time in his Army. And thus, contrary to all
expectation, we escap'd from so great a peril.</p>
               <p>VII. After we had stay'd some months longer with the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> according to the injunction he had laid upon us in granting our
pardon, we resolv'd to return into <hi>France;</hi> and accordingly came all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to a Kinsmans house of one of the company call'd <hi>L'Anglise,</hi> who
was of <hi>Picardy;</hi> where I was entertain'd by a pure effect of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity
of Monsieur, and Madame <hi>L'Anglise,</hi> as if I had been one of their
own Sons. After having staid a month there, I resolved to return to
the Guards, there being no Wars abroad at that time; and that Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being the ordinary School for young Gentlemen who follow'd the
exercise of Arms. But, being the occasion upon which I had gone out,
could not permit me to re-enter into it, and that nothing had been said
about that business all the time of my absence, it was necessary that I
should keep my self private for some days, during which Monsieur <hi>de
Grillon,</hi> who exprest the affection of a Father to me, obtain'd my Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
but upon condition notwithstanding, that I should give my self
up Prisoner for two or three hours only, in observation of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
forms. I did so, but being the Court of the <hi>Provoste de l'Hotell,</hi>
where I was to be quitted, could not sit that day, I was very much sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
to see my self shut up four and twenty hours without hearing a
word. I believ'd that they play'd foul play with me, and fearing scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
consequences of this delay, I began to fall into one of the greatest
anxieties I had ever been in the whole time of my life; looking upon
my self every moment as a man condemn'd to dye. I made thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
a firm resolution, never again so to commit my self to a voluntary
Prison, from whence a man cannot go out when he would; and where
a man is continually in fear of being taken out, to go whither he would
not. I was nevertheless soon after deliver'd from this fear, being the
next morning released out of Prison, and at the same time admitted
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100923:10"/>
into the Guards, according to my own desire. I here continued some
years, where beginning to be weary of doing nothing in <hi>France,</hi> by
reason there was no War there, I resolv'd to go into <hi>Savoy,</hi> with one of
my Comrades, an intimate friend of mine, whose name was <hi>St. Maury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIII. The War began in that Country about the year 1604, and I
understood that <hi>Rose,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Embassador, levied under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
some Souldiers at <hi>Paris:</hi> I went to wait upon him, and promis'd
him that my Comrade and I would raise him 40 men, provided he
would assure us of the Commands of Captain and Lieutenant, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
us with so much Money as was necessary for the raising, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting
them to the confines of <hi>Savoy.</hi> He granted what I desir'd, and
I was as good as my word. But, not daring to march our Souldiers
together, because the King would not allow that any one should make
levies of his Subjects to go serve another Prince, I sent them several
ways, being very well assur'd they would not fail me, because most of
them were Souldiers of the Regiment of Guards whom I knew, and in
whom I did absolutely confide. Some of which went by the way of
the <hi>Swisse</hi> Country, and others which way they could; as for me, and
my Lieutenant, who would needs serve in that condition, we took the
way of <hi>Lyons,</hi> where a Guard was kept to stop such kind of people,
that they might not pass. The Guard having stopt us at the Gate, I
told them that it was a Gentleman who was travelling that way; and
that I belong'd to him: for I being more known than <hi>Sainte Maury,</hi> I
rather chose to pass for his Servant, that I might be the less taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of. But for all that, we were carried before the Governour, which
was Monsieur <hi>d'Alincourt,</hi> that we might have his Pass; we there met
with several of the Court, one of which remembring my face, askt me
if he had not seen me in the Guards? whom I answered after such a
manner, that he thought himself mistaken. We were however a little
watcht; but they by whom I had been known, being busie about a
quarrel, thought no more of us, and so we got away, and went to meet
our Souldiers, who attended us at the Rendezvous. There we found
them increased in number, having pickt up some others by the way,
which made our Company fifty men; who were receiv'd by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary
of Monsieur <hi>d'Albigny,</hi> who was our Camp-master. They had
some Money distributed amongst them, and quarters assign'd to refresh
themselves in, till they should have Orders sent to march away to the
Army.</p>
               <p>But these Orders were so long in coming, that the Countrey where
we lay had time to be weary of us, and sent us word that we should
presently retire, or that otherwise they would fall upon us; so that we
saw our selves on a sudden oblig'd either to disband our Company, or
to stand our ground, and stiffly to defend our selves, by all the ways we
fairly could. We resolv'd upon the last as the most honourable, and
began to make War for our selves, till we should be call'd to do it for
his Highness of <hi>Savoy.</hi> In this design we judg'd it necessary to have some
Cavalry to sustain our Foot; and in order to it, accommodated our
selves with some Horses of a Town, the Inhabitants whereof made shew
to fall upon us. With this small number of Souldiers, consisting of forty
Musqueteers, and twenty Horse, or thereabout, we kept the field, and
found we were in a condition to defend our selves against all those that
intended to attack us. Of which Monsieur <hi>De Bois-pardaillan,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100923:10"/>
of <hi>Bourg</hi> in <hi>Bresse,</hi> upon the Confines of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> was the
first, who forc'd us to withdraw from his territories, to re-enter those
of <hi>Geneva;</hi> where we liv'd a good while, and got some booties, till the
news of us being carried to <hi>Geneva,</hi> the Republick sent so many Troops
against us, that we were compell'd to retire to the Confines of <hi>Bresse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Monsieur <hi>de Saint Chaumont,</hi> who was Governour of the Country,
having notice of our march, would keep the Pass against us; and to that
purpose drew together above five hundred Gentlemen, with whom he
set out to meet us. I had intelligence of it, and found my self in a great
perplexity, with so few people as I had, having not above fourscore at the
most, and of them the Cavalry very poorly mounted. Seeing my self
then in no condition to make head against so great a body, I conceiv'd
it requisite to think of retreating, and that with the soonest. There was no
Country for us so safe as <hi>Savoy,</hi> by reason that we march'd under his Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard.
But the difficulty was how to get thither: For we were to pass
the <hi>Rhone,</hi> which was two long leagues march from us, which appear'd
to be impossible, no Boats being there. So that, not daring to show
our selves, in the assurance we had of being charg'd, I bethought me of
concealing my men in a Wood, and in the mean time to send out to seek
a Boat upon the River, to be brought to the place where I design'd to
pass. But this requiring a great deal of time, I thought it requisite to
amuse Monsieur <hi>de Saint Chaumont,</hi> in laying him an Ambuscade with
our Horse only, to the end that we might in the interim file off our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry
towards the River, and have them all ready to pass; and the
more to fortifie this Ambuscade, I kept the Drums with the Trumpets
to make the greater noise. The knowledge I had of the Map of the
Country made me guess, that Monsieur <hi>de Saint Chaumont,</hi> who feard
nothing, would certainly pass through a little Wood, that lay betwixt
him and us; and accordingly posted my self there, with my Horse, my
two Trumpets, and my two Drums; I lay still till the Enemies Forlorn
should advance. About midnight they fail'd not to fall directly into
our Ambuscade, when we sallying out upon them, with a great rattling
of Drums and Trumpets, when they least expected any such thing, put
them into so great a fright, that they all run away, without firing so
much as one Pistol; and went to carry news to Monsieur <hi>de Saint Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
that the Enemy was in the Wood, and had so many Trumpets
and Drums, that they must of necessity be much stronger than had been
reported to him. This news did a little startle him, as well as the rest,
and put them upon a long deliberation of what course they should take:
where it was at last resolv'd, that they should stay till it was day, that
they might not rashly engage, without first discovering the Enemies
post and number.</p>
               <p>This was just as much as I expected, or desir'd; for by this means we
had time sufficient to recover the River, where we found the Boat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back from passing over our men, in which I shipt our Cavalry, that
were to pass over first, and stay'd my self the return of our Boat, into
which at last I went, with the rest of our people. We were scarce got
to the middle of the River, when we discover'd all Monsieur <hi>de Saint
Chaumont</hi>'s Cavalry, and himself at the head of them, marching a soft
trot, for fear of engaging himself too far: I leave every one to judge
of the satisfaction he had to see us in so little number, and himself not
able to get to us, especially after having been stopt by so ordinary a
stratagem, put upon him by such a company of young fellows as we
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100923:11"/>
were, and that he was asham'd he had not the judgment to discover.
So soon as we were landed, I saluted him at distance, and took my leave,
being careful to keep the Water-man on our side, lest he should carry
over his Boat; and went to post our selves upon the first little Eminence
of the State of the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From thence I sent to give an account of all these transactions to our
Camp-master, and to demand his Orders; which I expected with great
impatience, finding my self no longer in a condition of making War at
my own expence: But was very much astonisht at his answer, which
was, That the Peace being already concluded, he stood no longer in
need of our Troops. For having got all the advantage he pretended to,
which was, by his authority to render himself considerable with the
Duke, he easily consented to the order the Duke gave him to disband
his Regiment; and coming after to see me, to acknowledge the great
obligation he had to me, he told me, to give me a more particular testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his gratitude, that if I did not think of returning into <hi>France,</hi> I
should oblige him in staying with him, and depending upon the same
fortune with his own. I receiv'd his offer with the respect I ought to
do, assuring him that I was sorry no occasion had presented it self, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I might have made it appear, that I was not altogether unworthy of
the honour he had done me; and so took my leave. I gave the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
Money, that they might return to <hi>Paris,</hi> after the same manner
they had come from thence; and <hi>Sainte Maury</hi> and I took post to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
thither also. Our way was to go back again by <hi>Lyons,</hi> where we
had an affair of considerable importance; which was, there to receive
the remainder of our Pay, upon the account of our Company. But
though two Treasurers of the City had jointly engag'd to see us paid,
we had much ado to get the Money, being at the first demand roundly
answer'd, That we were come too late, and that they had order to pay
no more, because all the Troops were disbanded. Yet, when I gave
our Money for gone, I was happier than I thought; and by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of a Commissary, obtain'd that which I could not do by applying
my self to the Treasurers. We continued our Journey, and being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
at <hi>Paris,</hi> from a Captain as I was lately, I saw my self reduc'd once
more to the condition of a private Souldier.</p>
               <p>IX. I had a kinsman, Monsieur <hi>de Boulogne</hi> by name, who was of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi>
and that had the Government of <hi>Nogent</hi> in <hi>Bassigny,</hi> together
with a Company in the Regiment of <hi>Champagne.</hi> He had a great desire
to provide me some command in his Company, or in his Government;
but there being none at that time vacant in either, I could not prevail
with my self to stay and lye idle, but chose rather, as I said before, to
enter again for some months into the Guards, into which Monsieur <hi>de
Crequy,</hi> who was Collonel, receiv'd me with great kindness.</p>
               <p>I was scarce entred into them, when he employ'd me in a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
affair, and from which I had much ado to disengage my self.
Monsieur <hi>de Monravel</hi> had married a Sister of Monsieur <hi>de Crequy,</hi> who
for her fortune was to have an Estate call'd <hi>Savigny,</hi> near unto <hi>Juvisy,</hi>
which Monsieur <hi>de Crequy</hi> disputed with him, and whereof he was in
actual possession. Monsieur <hi>de Monravel</hi> attempted to surprize the House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper,
and did effectually, though with much ado, put him out of the
place. To keep this Castle, which he had thus got the possession of,
he made choice of three Souldiers, who had serv'd under his command;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100923:11"/>
giving them charge to keep this House, as a Fort of War, and not to
suffer any persons whatever to come in, without first very well knowing
who they were. Monsieur <hi>de Crequy</hi> being very much vexed at this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front,
resolv'd at any rate to recover the possession of his Castle. He
thought he might employ me in this enterprize, and accordingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
me to serve him in it, to the best of my power. He said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to me of the means of executing it, but wholly relied upon my
conduct; assuring me, that he would furnish me with all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
and which was of much greater importance, that he would pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
justifie and sustain me in all things, as he was oblig'd to do. I
told him, that he did me a great deal of honour in choosing me to do
him this service, but that the business appear'd to me something hard to
perform, seeing that, being very well acquainted with the situation of
the house, I knew it to be environ'd with a deep Moat, full of Water,
that could not be past but over a Draw-bridge, which could not be let
down, being guarded by Souldiers: but that however I would attempt
the enterprize; that being he would not have me lay a formal Siege to
it, I had no need of many people, but of two or three men only, which
I would choose out of the Regiment; and that I begg'd the favour of
him to bear me out in the consequence, as he had done me the honour
to promise he would. He again assur'd me that he would, and with
this assurance, taking three good Souldiers along with me, I went about
my business.</p>
               <p>Being come to <hi>Savigny,</hi> I made a shew of shooting with one of my
Comrades, and being acquainted with the chiefest of the three Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
that were in the Castle, I call'd to him from the end of the Bridge,
which was down. As he was coming to me, I told him that my sport
had brought me thither, and then speaking to him of a Mall, that was
hard by the house, askt him if he were not in the humour to play a
Game with us. He then askt me on the other side, if I would not come
in; and I answer'd him with such indifferency, as took from him all
cause of suspicion. One of his two Comrades was already out of the
Castle, and as he also was coming out, whilst he was yet upon the Plank<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which had no Rails, I took him by the hand, and pull'd him a little
roughly to me, which he resisting, his foot slipt, and he fell into the
Moat. I presently threw him a pole, to help him out of the Water, and
at the same instant, my two Souldiers, who had conceal'd themselves
at some distance, to see how matters would go, came running, and
with us made themselves Masters of the Bridge. We then pull'd up the
Bridge, and I bid him who had faln into the water, Go, and dry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and that as he had entred this place by surprize on the behalf of
Monsieur <hi>de Monravel,</hi> he ought not to take it ill that I should enter by
the same way for Monsieur <hi>de Cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uy,</hi> who was the true proprietor. The
third Souldier, who had remain'd in the Castle, seeing us four against
him alone, made no manner of resistance, but suffer'd himself to be turn'd
quietly out, as well as several women, who were in the place. I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
gave Monsieur <hi>de Cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uy</hi> an account of all that had past, and he
presently sent us two Horses laden with provision; writing to me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
That we should maintain what we had got against all the world;
assuring us anew, That he would uphold us to the last, and would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
rather engage his whole authority and estate, than that this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
should not end to his honour. I thought my self with this Letter
in an absolute assurance, but I did not yet know the ordinary course of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100923:12"/>
the affairs of the world, nor the ways of proceeding of great men, as
I have done since.</p>
               <p>X. A few days after, they came and told me, that there was at the
end of the Bridge an Usher of the Parliament, who commanded me, by
virtue of an Arrest, immediately to open the Gates, and restore the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
into the hands of Monsieur <hi>de Monravel;</hi> or otherwise there would
be a Decree against us, and the neighbouring Provosts and Commoners
would be order'd to bring us alive or dead. I confess I was surpriz'd
at such a Complement, not having dreamt that I should have the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to dispute against; I believ'd the solemn promise that Monsieur
<hi>de Crequy</hi> had made to uphold us against all pretenders, did absolutely se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
us. In the mean time I imagin'd that he might know nothing of
this proceeding, and that till he could be inform'd of it, I might return
the Usher this answer, That I knew him not, and that he must bring me
a Letter, under Monsieur <hi>de Crequy</hi>'s own hand, who had put me into
this Castle. The Usher return'd to carry back my answer to Madam
<hi>de Monravel,</hi> who had sent him, and who sollicited this affair with the
Parliament, with so much heat, that immediately she went to demand
of them, that since the Garrison had not thought fit to obey their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
they would please to send a Councellour, for whom doubtless we
should have more respect. Her request was granted, and the Court
appointed a Commissary to come presently to us.</p>
               <p>Now I having taken a resolution to stay for Monsieur <hi>de Crequy</hi>'s order
before I would deliver up the Castle, return'd the same answer to the
Councellor that I had done to the Usher; telling him withal, That I
was infinitely sorry I could not obey him, in the extreme necessity
wherein I found my self of executing my Collonels commands. The
Councellour was offended to the last degree, to see that we should thus
refuse to obey him, and in that heat presently commanded a Boat to be
brought from <hi>Juvisy</hi> to set over men to scale the Walls. This Order
was immediately executed, by reason that Madam <hi>de Monravel,</hi> who
had provided for all things, had made ready for it before-hand. The
first Provost who came to the place, commanded one of his Archers to
mount the Ladder; but this Archer having made a little too much haste,
had no sooner clapt his hand upon the top of the Wall, but that he
was made to quit his hold, and tumble headlong into the Water. This
accident put all the party into a very great fury, and another, who
would be braver than the rest, having said, that give him but a Pistol,
and he would take order that they should not serve him so, mounted
resolutely, with his Pistol in his hand; but when he thought himself al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
Maste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the Castle, one of my Comrades and I, who lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceald
behind the Wall, so soon as ever he put up his head, caught him
by the collar of his doublet, strongly pull'd him in to us, and having
held him down below, bound him and clapt him in prison.</p>
               <p>After this second adventure, none of the Assailants had the courage
to mount the Wall, so that Madam <hi>de Monravel,</hi> conceiving it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to have more company, call'd in yet another Provost, with all
the Rabble of four or five neighbouring Villages; and of all these people
gather'd together, made several <hi>Corps de Guard,</hi> which blockt up the
Castle. She caus'd the Draw-bridge to be under-propt, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
might not let it down and escape, when they found themselves
too nearly prest; and sent to <hi>Paris</hi> for Cannon to force us, resolv'd to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100923:12"/>
take us alive or dead: For she was perswaded that we were above fifty,
by reason that every night we set out above fifty light Matches upon
forkt sticks, that held ten or twelve apiece, every one plac'd at the
due distance of Musketeers. We moreover plac'd others at the corners
of the house, and mov'd them from time to time, to make them believe
that we reliev'd the Centinels. In the mean time, seeing our selves thus
destitute, and hearing no news of Monsieur <hi>de Cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uy,</hi> we found means
to let him know the condition we were in, and the night following he
commanded two hundred men of the Regiment of Guards, under the
command of some Serjeants, to go betimes in the morning to <hi>Savigny,</hi>
to charge all the besiegers, and afterwards to enter into the Castle. But
this Order could not be so private, but that Madam <hi>de Monravel,</hi> who
was return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> had notice of it, which made her come away in
an instant; and she made so great haste, that she kill'd two of her Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horses.
She came but just before the relief, and having plac'd her Coach
just before the Bridge, she being on foot, told the Serjeants of the
Guards, who commanded the two hundred men, that they should not
pass but over her; and therefore they were to consider whether they
would destroy her or no, for she was resolv'd not to stir from the place.
This discourse did so confound the Commanders, that they alter'd their
design, having respect to a Lady of her quality, and the Sister of him
for whom they had undertaken the Journey. So that they only try'd
to put some men into the Castle by a little Bridge on the backside of the
House; but it was so rotten that it broke under ten or twelve that were
upon it, and there were but two that could recover the door; of
which one was the <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> of Monsieur <hi>de Crequy.</hi> All this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
ended there, and the rest retir'd, without having done any other
thing, than to give us at least some little comfort in the reiterated word
of Monsieur <hi>de Crequy,</hi> who assur'd us afresh, that he would bring us off
with honour whatever came on't.</p>
               <p>XI. But a whole day being past, and we seeing all the Machines ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ready, and every one preparing himself to come on to the Assault<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
we began: with good reason to apprehend, that in longer expecting the
effect of our Collonels promises, we should be forc'd, and reduc'd to
the necessity, either of dying with our Swords in our hands, or to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
the severity of an offended Parliament. Yet before we would
resolve in this strange extremity wherein we saw our selves, I plac'd a
Centinel, to look if he could not discover any Troops coming to our
relief: but instead of Troops, he saw only one man appear on the top
of a little eminence close by, who making a sign to him with his hand,
threw him a stone wrapt about with paper, wherein I read these words:</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <p>I am at my wits end: Save your selves as well as you can; for it is not
in my power without perishing my self to disengage you; but if you can get out,
come forthwith to <hi>Juvisy,</hi> where you will find in the Inn Horses ready, and
all things necessary.</p>
                     <closer>
                        <signed>De Crequy.</signed>

                  </body>
               </floatingText>
               <p>This Ticket put us into no less despair than our Collonel, to see our
selves so far engag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d upon his word, so oft reiterated, and yet that he
would not keep it with us. Nevertheless we were to think of getting
out one way or another; and seeing we must of necessity perish if we
should suffer our selves to be forc'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we resolv'd to prevent an Assault,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100923:13"/>
not despairing but that we should be able to open our selves some way
to escape. I contriv'd then the night following to cause a great noise
to be made behind the Castle, to draw the besiegers to that part, and
I was busie in the mean time, as softly as I could, in unnailing the plank
of the Draw-bridge, to make us way. Having at last drawn it to me,
I let down from the top of the Wall a Ladder by a Rope, and made
the lower end rest upon the frame of the Bridge: I stay'd that end from
slipping back, and with a Rope that was fastened to the upper end of
the Ladder, I let it fall gently upon the other end that supported the
Draw-bridge, when it was let down. This Ladder thus resting the two
ends upon the two firm parts of the Bridge, that we might walk upon
it, I laid over the plank I had taken out of the Bridge, and having thus
made a Bridge of the Ladder, we all fix sally'd out with our Swords in
our hands, and immediately fell upon the first <hi>Corps de Guard,</hi> where,
by making a mighty noise, and crying out Kill, Kill, we put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such a fright, that they gave way and let us pass, as if we had been
a great number.</p>
               <p>But all was not yet done, and we were to make wonderful great haste
to gain the River, before the Archers of this Guard had recover'd their
wits, and could mount to Horse, to come and fall upon us. Also having reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
<hi>Juvisy,</hi> where I knew that Horses were ready for us at the Inn, I would
not enter into it, for fear left staying to go take these Horses, we should
be all on a sudden surpriz'd; but we ran to get into a Boat, where we
got over the River. We immediately perceiv'd on the other side of
the River that we had quitted, the Archers that pursu'd us, and who
attempted not to pass, by reason that the Forest of <hi>Senac</hi> came down to
the River on our side. We entred into it to repose our selves, and
there remain'd all day, having sent a Country fellow for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>omething to
eat, as if we had been Hunters.</p>
               <p>XII. The night following we went on our Journey, and came to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Crequy</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> who receiv'd us as persons whom it went to his
Soul to have engag'd, and that he saw had escap'd beyond all manner
of hope. But though his house was our refuge for the space of six weeks,
that we lay conceal'd there, because they had decreed against us; yet
was it no great satisfaction to see our selves depriv'd of our Liberty, and
that he upon whose account we had lost it, was not able to restore us
to it. I then found that I was to work for my self in an affair that so
nearly concern'd me, and to disengage my self from the hands of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
after having escap'd from those of the Besiegers. Which also I
effected happily enough, in making use of a little foresight I had had,
at my first entring into the Castle. I had taken an Inventory of all I
found there, being unwilling any one should accuse me of failing in the
least punctilio of my duty. The chiefest member of this concern was a
Chamber, in which there was a great quantity of Plate, I had taken care
to lock the Chamber up, after having brought into it whatever was most
considerable from the other rooms of the Castle, and had taken the Key,
so that not a Soul entred into it of all the time that I was there, neither
could any the least thing be imbezled. I took occasion from this exact
care of mine to preserve what appertain'd to Madam <hi>de Monravel,</hi> to
make my peace with her; and I thought it best to address my self im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to her, without employing any Mediator, hoping that out of
generosity she would be just to herself, in pardoning a man, whose
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100923:13"/>
good conduct would make it appear to her, that the sole command of
his Collonel had forc'd him to maintain the Castle against her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ventur'd therefore to write to her with all possible civility and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi>
That I was extremely concern'd it had so faln out, that the duty of
my place had compell'd me to appear against her: But I assur'd her Ladyship
withal, that if I had been faithful to her Brother, I had also been so in her
concerns, in preserving with a particular care all I had found in the House,
of which I had taken an exact Inventory, which I took the boldness to send
her. I humbly besought her to consider that the sole duty of obedience having
made me undertake this action, and not the prospect of any interest, which I
was infinitely far from, it would redound to her own honour, to pardon a fault
she herself would have justified in another, that had committed it on her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half:
that had I had the honour to have belonged to her, as I did to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Crequy</hi> her Brother, I should have serv'd her with the same zeal,
and by a like service should have thought to have merited her esteem; which
gave me reason to hope, knowing her generosity, that she would less consider
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> self upon this occasion, than the obligation of my Duty: and in this assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
I durst make her Ladyship, who was my Party, my Judge, and commit
my Cause absolutely into her hands, thence to expect the Grace which she only
had the power to grant.</p>
               <p>This Letter, together with the truth of the fact, prevail'd so far with
Madam <hi>de Monravel,</hi> that instead of prosecuting any further against
me, she spoke in my favour; and having first pacified her Husband, who
was irritated to the last degree, and after that, having easily obtain'd
the Abolition that I desir'd. Thus she, who had depriv'd me of my
Liberty, restor'd it to me again; and that which had so cruelly incens'd
her against me at first, became a favourable occasion to me in the Issue
of receiving from her all the testimonies of a most sincere Friendship.</p>

Command; not reckoning the short employment I had had in <hi>Savoy,</hi> for
any thing at all: But in the time that I serv'd in this Commission, there
hapned to me a rencounter, which well delerves to be mention'd in
this place.</p>
               <p>About the Year 1611, our Regiment, which was that of <hi>Champaigne,</hi>
finding it self very much streightned in <hi>Verdun,</hi> where we lay in Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
entreated leave of the King that they might quarter in <hi>Mont-Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>con</hi>
too, which is a very pretty Town, some Leagues distant from <hi>Verdun.</hi>
Monsieur <hi>de Ville,</hi> at that time. Governour of <hi>Verdun,</hi> writ about it to
Court, and obtained of the Queen Regent the favour we desired, so
that his Majesty writ to Monsieur <hi>de Nevers,</hi> who was Governour of the
Province, that it was his pleasure it should be so; and so soon as the
Letter was writ, I was chosen out to carry it to <hi>Cassine,</hi> the ordinary
place of Monsieur <hi>de Nevers</hi> his residence, and so to bring back his
Orders for the Quarters. I accordingly went, and finding that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nevers</hi> was gone to <hi>Montaigu</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> I went after him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and had from him all the satisfaction I could desire. But I was not
so happy in my return.</p>
               <p>II. When I was some ten leagues off <hi>Verdun,</hi> at a Bourg called <hi>Rau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi>
about three or four in the afternoon, and I was preparing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
my Journey through a Forrest, which I must of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ecessity go over,
I had warning given me at the Inn, that they would by no means ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
me to travel alone through this Forrest, because there were a great
many High-way men there, and that it was better for me to stay till
the morning, that they might provide a good Guide, and that there
might peradventure be some body in Town with whom I might pass
with more safety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I thought it convenient ot take this Counsel, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100923:14"/>
not to stand upon the punctilio of Bravery, and so rashly to expose my
self, where there was no Duty to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngage me. I sent therefore to the
Inns to enquire whither there was any body that was to go over the
Forrest. It hapned luckily that a Canon who was, returning to <hi>Verdun,</hi>
being in the same concern that I was, sent at the same time to my
Lodgings to make the same enquiry. About eight a clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we set out with a Guide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of whom they gave us a very good cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.
Being advanc'd into the Forrest we met a man a foot in red
Breeches, and a blew Doublet, with a Fusee upon his Shoulder; I askt
the Guide the meaning of that odd kind of habit, who made answer,
that it was a Countryman that was shooting. The way we rid was very
troublesom, by reason the branches of the Trees hung down so low, as
forc'd us continually to stoop which made me tell the Canon, that we
were better to alight, and lead our Horses in our hands; and this
little foresight serv'd not only to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ase us, but moreover to save ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
lives, seeing that we could very hardly have escap'd in the rencounter
that presently after befel us, had we not been alighted from our
Horses. Being then a little further advanc'd in the Forrest, we met
with three men laid down by the road side, with Fusees lying by them.
As we past by they rose up and complimenting us, God protect you
Gentlemen, said they, whether are you travelling after that manner?
and we had need indeed that God should protect us from the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of such a Compliment. We replied that we were going to
<hi>Verdun.</hi> We will bear you company, said they, very civilly, if you
please, for we are going thither too. I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who thought it not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to tye our selves to such Company, and that absolutely concluded
them to be Rogues, made answer, though civilly enough too, That it
appear'd a little hard we should travel far together, and that they could
not well keep pace a foot with us who had Horses. They, who desir'd
nothing more but to begin a quarrel, presently made what I had said
an affront of honour, and brutishly replying, What! Gentlemen, said
they, because we are a foot, are we less men of honour, and less honest
men? I reply'd again very civilly to this huffing return, That I was very
far from undervaluing them, and that it was not my humour so to do.
Upon this, instead of taking notice of what I said, they grew hotter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and proceeded to rage, when three or four more at the instant rusht
out of the Wood, asking their Comrades what was the matter? and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
before they could give them an answer, were all upon us with fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
crying out, Kill, Kill. I had no more time at the instant, but to
seize on our Guides Quarter-staff, who ran away in a moment, with all
the good testimony had been given us of him; we let go our Horses,
and clapping my self back to back to the Canon, who I spoke to not to
forsake me, but to defend himself on his side as well as he could, I began
to lay about me with my Quarter-staff with all my force and art, and I
stood in need of it all in this rencounter. The great blows and thrusts
I made at them kept them at a distance, and hindred them from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
too near: They presently made some shots at us, with which
the Canon was only wounded in the Thigh; but the heat of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
made him that he did not feel it: for he defended himself on his
side with incredible ardour, having about him a girdle of 300 Pistols,
which made him fight like a Tyger.</p>
               <p>After this manner we defended our selves above a quarter of an hour
without intermission, against all these fellows, arm'd with a Halbert,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100923:15"/>
Fire-arms, and Swords. They made but little use of their Fusees, he
that had the Halbert made mighty attempts to get in to us; but being
I had a continual eye upon him, and that the furious blows I every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
dealt amongst them with my Staff kept them in awe, they could do
us no harm, and durst not venture too far. The bravest, or the most
furious amongst them, was a young red-headed Rogue, who prest very
hard upon me, and that I found always upon the attack. But begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to feel my self weary with so long and so rough a Combat, I made
a final effort, and having as it were muster'd all my forces together,
and made a kind of a <hi>falsifie,</hi> I reacht this young Rogue such a rap, as
made him immediately retire forty paces, and sit down upon the ground.
Never were people so astonisht, to see us so obstinate, not to yield our
selves to so many as they were; and I assure my self that could they
have foreseen such a consequence of their first Compliment, they would
have fav'd both themselves and us so much fruitless labour. In the end,
seeing the stoutest of their company hurt, they began by little and little
to slacken their ardour, and to talk amongst themselves: which made
us judge that it was time to think of a retreat, and accordingly we threw
our selves back together into the Wood, and get away in the strangest
equipage that ever eye beheld, having neither Cloak, nor Hat, nor my
Sword, which was also lost from my side: and being out of breath, and
almost quite spent, we rested our selves a little in the Bushes. Our
Horses, which at the first firing of a Fusee had ran away, stay'd for us
about a league off, as much out of breath as we; we found them too
in so ill equipage, that their Bridles and Girts were broken, and the
Pistols batter'd; but however we made shift after the best manner we
could to get to a Bourg call'd <hi>Beaumont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The noise of our adventure being spread abroad, the Judges of the
place came to seek us out, and compell'd us against our wills, to stay a
day or two, by reason that they had orders the next day to raise the
Country, and search in the Forrest, to see if they could find out these
Robbers, of whom so many persons made every day publick complaints;
and they hop'd that peradventure we might know some of them. It
hapned indeed the next day that the young Rogue that I had hurt was
taken, not being able to get away: I knew him as soon as ever I saw
him, and he was himself constrain'd to confess the truth. In the mean
time we took our leaves, and departed, leaving the miserable wretch
upon the point to be hang'd, and came to <hi>Verdun,</hi> with the Orders from
Monsieur <hi>de Nevers</hi> for the Quarters at <hi>Mont-Faucon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. The Lieutenant of our Company having been kill'd, I some time
after had his command, and return'd the Colours into the hands of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Boulogne.</hi> I remain'd in Garrison in <hi>Nogent</hi> upon <hi>Marne</hi> at the
time when the Princes rebell'd against King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII, and began to
raise Forces, having many of the Gentry of <hi>Bassigny</hi> on their side, which
was the reason that <hi>Nogent</hi> was beset round with enemies. Monsieur <hi>de
Boulogne,</hi> who at that time had business at <hi>Paris,</hi> entrusted the place to
me, with the quality of the Kings Lieutenant, which he procured
for me.</p>
               <p>IV. Some time before this War, a Gentleman within two leagues of
<hi>Nogent,</hi> call'd <hi>Guyonnel,</hi> was so out of order in his affairs, that there
was a Decree granted for the sale of his House of <hi>Bonnecourt;</hi> which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100923:15"/>
Monsieur <hi>de Boulogne</hi> having bought, this man was so enrag'd to see
himself turn'd out of his House, that he lookt upon this War as a happy
opportunity to revenge himself, and by siding with the Princes, by
force to get into possession again; but Monsieur <hi>de Boulogne</hi> having as
it were foreseen his ill design, had plac'd some good men for the guard
of the Castle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guyonnel</hi> had also a kinsman call'd <hi>Aurillot,</hi> who was in the Princes
party, and had rais'd a Troop of Light Horse, with which he resolv'd
to force and pillage <hi>Bonnecourt.</hi> He came therefore demanding to Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
there, and seeing himself deny'd, fell to plundring the Village, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he would presently do as much by the Castle. He accordingly
advanc'd towards the Castle, as if to enter by force, but the Souldiers
that kept it, shewing a resolution still to defend it, and beginning to
fire upon him, he was fain to retire. The spite of this disappointment
made him set fire to the <hi>Basse-Court,</hi> and animated him to such an excess
of barbarity, as there to burn the Farmer, his Wife, and Children;
whom he cruelly repulst when they attempted to save themselves through
the flames. <hi>Bonnecourt</hi> being near to <hi>Nogent,</hi> the news of this was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
brought thither to us; for besides, that we had heard shooting, and
seen the flame, some of the Inhabitants came crying out that they put
all to Fire and Sword. I was surpriz'd and afflicted to the last degree
at hearing the least violences; but I found my in a sad perplexity, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
but a very few men in the Garrison, and fearing to expose the
place, should I go out with my Souldiers.</p>
               <p>I contriv'd notwithstanding to cause the young people of the Town
to mount to Horse, and with them to command fifty Musqueteers of
the Garrison. Having drawn them together ready to march, I aloud
laid before them the cruelty that had been exercis'd upon the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of <hi>Bonnecourt,</hi> and gave them to understand that they were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
it; assuring them upon my word, that I would post them so, as
that they might charge the enemy without danger: whereupon they all
promis'd me to do wonders, and they kept their words as I did mine.
I plac'd them in an Ambuscade, where they had all manner of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
without peril; for having caus'd a false Alarm to be given at one
end of the Village, which made the Country go out at the other, they
there met with our young people, who had march'd all night without
their knowledge; and who on a sudden gave them so brisk, and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
a Charge, that they all fled without any manner of resistance,
leaving their prey behind, with some of their won men, who were all
either kill'd or taken. I restor'd to every one of the Inhabitants what
was properly his own, caus'd the fire to be put out, and put courage
and life into these poor people again.</p>
               <p>After this I return'd to <hi>Nogent,</hi> to put the Inhabitants of the Town
out of the pain they were in about their Sons, whom they thought dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously
engag'd with the Enemy. The joy they were in to see them
all safe return'd, with the glory of having so bravely reliev'd their
Neighbours, made them forget the fear they had been in of losing them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and as oftentimes there needs but a very light occasion to acquire either
the affection, or the hatred of a people; this little Action procur'd
me so absolute a credit with the whole Town, that I needed but to
say the least word to be obeyed in a moment, and they call'd me the
Conservator of their Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:100923:16"/>
V. <hi>Aurillot,</hi> vext to the soul to see himself thus baffled and put to
flight, resolv'd to be reveng'd at any rate, and having several Persons
of Quality of his Kindred, as the Marquess <hi>de Creance, de Clermont,</hi> and
others, who were of the Princes Party, as well as himself; he assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
them all together, to acquaint them of the affront he had receiv'd
from me, and the resolution he had taken to recover his reputation;
entreating them to joyn with him to this end, and all together to swear
a mortal War against the <hi>Gascon,</hi> for so it was that in contempt they
were pleas'd to call me. These Gentlemen made no great difficulty of
consenting to his request, and consequently openly declar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d a War
against the King's Lieutenant of <hi>Nogent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having intelligence of this practice I gather'd together some Horse,
and put my self into a condition, not only of defending my self, but of
attacking them upon several occasions, wherein my chiefest aim was to
take <hi>Aurillot</hi> Prisoner, to make him repair the horrible crime he had
committed in <hi>Bonnecourt,</hi> not being able to forget so great a barbarity.
To this end I sent out several Spies on all sides, to bring me certain
intelligence of the several places to which he went, and where he stayed,
that of them I might make choice of that which was most proper for the
executing my design. One of these Spies one day brought me word,
that <hi>Aurillot</hi> was that night to lye within three Leagues of <hi>Nogent,</hi> at a
Castle call'd <hi>Perse,</hi> or else in another call'd <hi>Persigny,</hi> which was but half
a League from the first, in order to a design he had to go out with a
party the next morning towards <hi>Langues,</hi> which held out for the King.
Upon this intelligence I immediately sent in all post haste to tell Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Franciere,</hi> who was Governor of <hi>Langues;</hi> to Monsieur <hi>de Rhes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi>
Governor of <hi>Chaumont;</hi> and to Monsieur <hi>de Saint Aubin,</hi> Governor
of <hi>Montigny;</hi> which were three places united to <hi>Nogent,</hi> and which had
all promised mutual assistance against these Invaders, that if they would
send me some Troops, I did assure them the next morning to take <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillot</hi>
Prisoner; that it was of moment to the publick quiet, since it was
he almost that disturbed the whole Country.</p>
               <p>Monsieur <hi>de Rhesnel,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de St. Aubin,</hi> sent me forthwith
some Horse, and Monsieur <hi>de Franciere</hi> would come himself in person;
but he came a little too late: for the very moment that the men from
the two others arriv'd, having no time to lose, I made those men I had,
which were about 60 Horse, and as many Foot, ready to march; and
with them set out about midnight, and came to invest the Village of
<hi>Persigny,</hi> into which <hi>Aurillot</hi> was retir'd. I plac'd <hi>Corps de Guard</hi> on all
the Avenues, and with the rest of my men without any noise went to
storm the House; yet could I not do it so softly, but that those within
heard us, and did what they could to oppose us: but we made our selves
Masters of it, and having forc'd the doors, we struck so great a terror
into all those within, that they made little or no resistance. <hi>Aurillot,</hi>
seeing no possible way to escape, barricado<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d himself in a Chamber,
and having a Pistol in his hand, cry'd out, that he would kill the first
man that advanc'd, and that he would dye before he would surrender
himself to me, being conscious without doubt that he was guilty enough,
to know that he was not to have any very good composition from me.
He enquir'd at the same time, whither there was no other Commander;
to which he was answer'd, that Monsieur <hi>de Franciere</hi> was just arriv'd,
and that if he had a desire to surrender himself into his hands, I was
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100923:16"/>
willing to consent to it. <hi>Aurillot</hi> took the course, and so became a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner;
as also were all the rest of his men, some few excepted, who by
the favour of the night escap'd into the neighb'ring Houses, and there
conceal'd themselves.</p>
               <p>VI. Monsieur <hi>de Franciere</hi> and I, were of opinion, that we ought to
carry our Prisoners to <hi>Langues:</hi> and being accordingly about to enter
the Town, we were very much surpriz'd to see all the Citizens come out
of the Gates to meet us. The joy wherein they were, to hear that we
were bringing in <hi>Aurillot</hi> Prisoner, would not give them leave to stay
till he came within the Walls of their City; and one of them, more
foreseeing and zealous than the rest, fearing lest he should compound
for his Ransome, as he might have done, had he not committed that
barbarity at <hi>Bonnecourt,</hi> thought it best, in good time to prevent it, and
fir'd a Musquet at him; but was so ill a Marks-man, that instead of his
Head, he hit mine, the ball cutting my Hat-band in two, and graz'd
upon my Hat, yet without any other harm to me at all. This heat did
a little surprize us, and made me tell Monsieur <hi>de Franciere,</hi> that there
was no safety there for <hi>Aurillot,</hi> and that it was better to carry him to
<hi>Nogent;</hi> but he made answer, that he would go and speak to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and going immediately up to them, he there gave them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that if they would permit Justice to have its course against this
publick Enemy, they should have all satisfaction; but if they would
make use of violence, he should be constrain'd to convey him to some
other place. This remonstrance stopt their fury, and they past their
words, that they would do him no harm, wishing much rather to see
him dye upon a Scaffold; and so they brought him into the Town,
and clapt him up in Prison.</p>
               <p>VII. This news of taking <hi>Aurillot</hi> made a mighty noise in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
all the Gentry mounted to Horse, and sent to Monsieur <hi>de Franci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere</hi>
that he might be ransom'd, as being a Prisoner of War. Monsieur
<hi>de Franciere</hi> return'd them answer, that it was I who had taken him,
and that he being my right, they were to apply themselves to me;
but that if he was absolutely at his disposal, he could not treat him as
a Prisoner of War, having been taken not only as an Enemy to the King,
but as a Destroyer of the Country, and a publick Incendiary; who had
burnt Men and Villages, and committed Outrages that were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ordinary Rules of War. To which the Nobless return'd
answer again, that all this could be no other but an occasion of inhanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his ransom, that due satisfaction might be made; and therefore did
humbly beseech him to set his rate, and to consent, that every Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
amongst them might have a particular obligation to him for the
favour. Monsieur <hi>de Franciere</hi> found himself in a very great straight,
being unwilling to fall out with all the Gentlemen of the Country, and
very well foreseeing all the consequences of this affair, told me, that
he thought he should not be able to detain this Prisoner any longer;
and that therefore I was to consider whither or no I would take him
into my own Custody, for that otherwise he should be compell'd to
deliver him upon Ransom. I for my part, who thought I ought not to
prefer any consideration to my duty, made answer, that I would take
the charge of him upon me, and would keep him safe enough; and
accordingly two hours before day in the morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I took him, and with
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100923:17"/>
my Horse convey'd him to <hi>Chaumont,</hi> where I secur'd him in a good
strong Prison.</p>
               <p>Monsieur <hi>de Franciere</hi> at the same time sent to acquaint the Nobless, that
he had him no longer in his power, not having been able to deny him
to him by whom he had been taken, and to whom he did of right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain.
This news troubled them very much, not doubting but that
I was resolv'd to proceed to the last, as I had begun. The only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
comfort they had, was that being condemned at <hi>Chaumont,</hi>
he might appeal to <hi>Paris,</hi> and that in so long a way, they might find
some means or other to rescue him. They sent nevertheless to demand
him of me, and upon my refusal said, that I should make haste then to
bring him to his Trial, hoping for the forementioned reason, to procure
his deliverance so much the sooner. They had the satisfaction they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd;
for in a few days he was condemned to have his Head cut off;
and to make restitution to all those he had undone.</p>
               <p>He appeal'd from this Sentence to <hi>Paris,</hi> demanding to be carried
thither, and withal gave notice to all his Friends, that if they would
rescue him now was the time to do it: His Relations hereupon drew
all their Friends together, and mounting to Horse, came to place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in Ambuscade upon the way by which they thought he was to pass:
but I easily put the change upon them, for having sent to take up an
Inn at <hi>Bar-sur-Aube,</hi> which was the great road to <hi>Paris,</hi> for the next
night; all these Gentlemen who had had intelligence of it, made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
sure upon the orders I had given, and not doubting of any thing
else, posted themselves in the place I named before. In the mean time I sent
<hi>Aurillot</hi> away the same day by eight of the clock in the morning, in
the sight of the whole Town; having put him into a close Waggon, and
order'd Thirty good Souldiers for his Guard, of which Twenty four,
after having conveyed him three Leagues return'd; and the six others
under the command of a Serjeant carried him, not by the way of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur-Aube,</hi>
which I had commanded them to quit, but by another which
was all wood, and the concealing them there kept them in absolute
safety. And thus all this rout of Gentlemen were deceiv'd; not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
that any one would have taken a way that was 30 Leagues about;
and after having continued four days on Horseback retir'd, and gave over
their design. The Convoy convey'd their Prisoner to <hi>Paris,</hi> where
Monsieur <hi>de Boulogne</hi> expected him with great anxiety and impatience,
knowing that so many Gentlemen had taken the Field to rescue him.
He caus'd him to be put into Prison, and pursu'd his process with might
and main.</p>
               <p>In the interim the Peace of <hi>Lodun</hi> was concluded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and an Act of
Oblivion was past without exceptions; which Monsieur <hi>de Boulogne</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
notice of, he presently took Post and went to Court, where he
mov'd, that Incendiaries at least might not be comprehended in the
Pardon, as having committed actions too black, and too cruel to be
forgiven. His request was granted; and there was a particular Article
inserted in the Treaty to that effect.</p>
               <p>VIII. Whilst Monsieur <hi>de Boulogne</hi> was busie at <hi>Paris</hi> in pursuit of his
Process, I had no less to do at <hi>Nogent,</hi> to maintain my self against all
this Nobless, who were furiously enrag'd against me for the affront
they conceiv'd I had put upon them. Of which some proceeded so far
as out of bravado to send me word, that if I durst come out of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100923:17"/>
Gates, they might see what I was in the Field, where a better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
might be made than within the Walls of a Town. Thus it fell
out, that in doing my best for the King's interest and the publick peace,
I brought a hundred inconveniencies upon my selt, from which I should
have had very much ado to disengage my self, had I inconsiderately
abandon'd my self to the heat of youth: But as I conceiv'd, that I ought
not to recede in affairs that prest upon me, so I thought it indiscreet to
make too precipitous advances: and also having created my self so many
enemies all at once, I must either have been forced to engage all my
friends in the quarrel, which I have ever evaded as much as possibly I
could, or I must have render'd my self ridiculous, as the common mark
of all the Bravo's in the Country. I therefore upon necessity chose that
way of proceeding which appeared to me the wisest and most safe,
which was as much as I could do to joyn prudence with constancy in
the whole management of this affair, and I succeeded so well in it, that
I put an end to seventeen quarrels I had upon my hands at once, without
being oblig'd to draw my Sword: which I purposely set down, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
that true honour does not consist in a blind and brutish courage,
and that all my life have been of opinion, that nothing was more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
a truly generous man, than to constrain himself to gain his enemies
by civil ways, and to overcome them by his moderation and wisdom.
Every one may make of it what judgment he pleases; but I can boldly
say, that even they, of those Gentlemen of whom I speak, who thought
themselves the most offended by me, have since confest that they esteem'd
me the more for that manner of proceeding with them, and for having
as it were compell'd them to be my friends; and it will not peradventure
be unseasonable to give here one example, that what I say may be better
understood.</p>
               <p>IX. The King had order'd Monsieur <hi>de Boulogne</hi> to bring fifty Villages
about <hi>Nogent</hi> under contribution for the subsistence of the Garrison;
which was no very new thing, but had been a great while in practice.
I who acted for him in his absence, sent to these Villages to signifie to
them the Kings order; but was a little surpriz'd when I was told that
several of these Parishes belonging to one Lord, which was the Baron of
<hi>Clermont,</hi> had made answer that they would pay nothing, and that their
Lord had commanded them the contrary. I had moreover word brought
me, that this Lord himself had said, that if <hi>de Pontis</hi> found fault, and
was not satisfied, it would be easie to satisfie him after another manner.
To which I made no other answer, excepting, that I should see that.</p>
               <p>But though I felt my self very sensibly toucht with such a complement,
I consider'd nevertheless that I ought not to mix my particular interests
with those of the King; and that I was oblig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d first to try all civil ways
to acquit my self of my Commission, and to make the fault lye at this
Lord's door, that nothing might be laid to my charge. Some days after
therefore I went to his House, and sent him word, that I was come to
have the honour to see him; he was surpriz'd at the news, not expecting
to see me there, and came to receive me; I told him at the first meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that I was come to pay him my respects, and after some discourse
of indifferent things, it being dinner time, he invited me after so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
a fashion, that I could not refuse to stay, and there was no body
at Table but us two, and Madam <hi>de Clermont.</hi> Being risen from dinner,
I told him, that besides the honour I was ambitious of, of kissing his
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100923:18"/>
hands, I was come to speak with him about the Order I had received
from the King, to put fifty Villages under contributions, of which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
belonged to him, and that I did beseech him, he would please to
command them to obey this Order, which withal I presented to him.
He return'd me answer, that this affair being of Monsieur <hi>de Boulogne</hi>'s
business, and not mine, and he being upon no good terms with him,
he could not consent to it, but that had it been my own particular
concern, he would have granted it with all his Heart. I reply'd, that
having the Honour to be the King's Lieutenant in the Government of
Monsieur <hi>de Boulogne,</hi> his interest was mine, and that I hop'd he would
not separate them; that on the other side it was the King's business, and
not Monsieur <hi>de Boulogne</hi>'s; and that in short, if he would not make his
Villages contribute, I entreated he would sign his refusal under the King's
Order, that it might serve me for a discharge. Being much surpriz'd at
this, he answer'd me with heat, that he would not do it; neither would
he make his Parishes pay contribution; and fairly added, turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Page, give me my Sword; and to me, Sir, we had better go
walk in the Garden. I understood his meaning well enough: but I
fear'd nothing in performing my duty, and obeying the orders of the
King.</p>
               <p>He led me quite round the Garden, all the while discoursing of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
things, and after carried me into a great Park that was much more
remote, and walk'd me quite round about it, all the while looking me
in the face, and observing my countenance, which was still that of a man
that fear'd nothing in maintaining the interest of the King, and my own
duty. At last, seeing that I was always equally firm and civil, he final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told me, that he had so much esteem for me, that for my sake, seeing
I desir'd to have it so, he would make his Tenants pay, but that it was
not out of any respect to Monsieur <hi>de Boulogne.</hi> I replied, that I stood
oblig'd to him for his civility, and that, provided he caused his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Order to be obey'd, it was all one to me in favour of whom it was
granted: but that nevertheless I was oblig'd to tell him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he ought
to remember who Monsieur <hi>de Boulogne</hi> was, and not to forget the
Friendship that had ever been betwixt their two Families; which also
he ought not to break, when there was as much reason as ever to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it, and that the advantageous qualities they were both Masters of,
seem'd to be a kind of new tye to unite them faster: That as to the rest,
I did once more beseech him to beleive, that Monsieur <hi>de Boulogne</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
interest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s were mine, and ought not to be separated: I further intreated
him to give me the order he was pleas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to send to his Villages in writing,
that they might not doubt of what I should tell them, nor have any
excuse if I compell'd them to obey. He granted every thing I desir'd,
setting down in the writing that he commanded all his Villages to pay
contribution, and entreated Monsieur <hi>de Pontis</hi> to compel them to it, in
case they should refuse; and so at last we took leave of one another with
mutual assurances of a true and sincere Friendship, such as in effect it
has been ever since. And this example, that may peradventure be of
some use to others, to retain them within the bounds of a temperate
conduct and a regular courage, was also very serviceable even to me
my self, to put an end to a great number of other disputes. For the
issue of this affair made so great a noise in the Country, that all who
were upon ill terms with me, began to consider me after another kind
of manner than they had done before; and even seeking means of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100923:18"/>
with me, became most of them my Friends; prudently
judging, that it was no dishonour to live in amity with a person who
had thus engag'd one of the chiefest amongst them, from an enemy that
he had been before, to become his Friend. I can also say, that this
civil way of proceeding, which I practised as much as possibly I could
upon all occasions, did not only acquire me the Friendship of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bless,
who at first were so violent against me, but moreover the affection
of all the Inhabitants of <hi>Nogent,</hi> who in acknowledgment of the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
I manifested to them in all the Wars, ever after maintain'd the
custom of presenting me with Wine, when ever I past through the
Town, as if I had been still the King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Lieutenant there; which I say,
not out of any vanity to myself, but only to let such as are in employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
see, how much moderation in all sorts of Government is prefera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to insolence, especially when supported by steadiness and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.</p>
               <p>To conclude this affair, which has put me upon saying all that I have
said, and the cause of most of the quarrels of which I have spoken;
Monsieur <hi>de Boulogne</hi> so vigorously pursu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d his prosecution against <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillot,</hi>
that he soon caus'd the Sentence of <hi>Chaumont</hi> to be confirm'd by
an Arrest, that condemn'd him to have his Head cut off in the open
Market-place, and to carry a Writing upon his back, that set out the
cause of his condemnation in these terms; <hi>For burning Houses:</hi> which
gave great satisfaction to all the Country, where he was lookt upon as a
common enemy.</p>
               <p>X. Two Years after the first War of the Princes they began a second;
when Monsieur <hi>de Boulogne,</hi> having sent to me to come to him with a
recruit of 200 men, that I had raised about <hi>Nogent;</hi> I prepar'd my self
to march them up to the Army, commanded by the Mareschal <hi>de Bassom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierre,</hi>
where our Regiment of <hi>Champagne</hi> was already arriv d, and set
out with my Recruit, having only a young Ensign with me called <hi>Saint
Aubin.</hi> After two days march we had intelligence, that the Cardinal
of <hi>Guise</hi> was at hand with 600 Horse, that he had rais'd about <hi>Metz,</hi>
which he brought up to join with the Army of the Princes towards <hi>Pont
de Sè.</hi> The Match being unequal, I thought presently to recover <hi>Sezan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi>
a little Town that held out for the King; but being I was to pass a
great Plain, I fear'd a surprizal there, and would have been very glad to
have found some means to shelter my self.</p>
               <p>It fell out by good luck, that I met a great many Waggons of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur-Aube</hi>
laden with Wine, which I thought very proper to serve me
for a retrenchment in case I should be surpriz'd upon the Plain. I
therefore told these Carters, that they must help to cover us if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
that we should defend them, promising them that they should
run no other hazard but what we would first be expos'd to our selves.
The danger wherein they saw themselves engag'd, together with the
necessity of obeying me, prevail'd with them immediately to unlade
their Wine, because I would have them in a condition to make more
haste; and so of all these Waggons link'd to one another I made two
Files, which I caus'd to march on the right and left of my Souldiers, of
whom I form'd a Battalion, and gave order to those at the Head and the
Rear of these two Files, to draw up near one another so soon as they
should see the Enemy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that so they might wholly shut up the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:100923:19"/>
XI. We had not march'd far in this order, but that being yet a
League from <hi>Sezanne,</hi> in the open Field, we saw the Avant-Couriers of
the Enemy appear upon the top of a little Hill that bounded one side
of the Plain, and presently after discovered the whole body, which
consisted of six Squadrons, making full drive toward us. I caus'd my
men to halt, who were at the same instant enclos'd by the Waggons,
according to the order I had given; I there endeavoured to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
them to the fight, assuring them, that if they would faithfully obey
my orders, I would disengage them from the danger wherein they were,
but that if they would not do it their ruine was inevitable. I also
gave them my word, that if it should so fall out, as I despair'd not but
it would, that they should get any prize by the spoils of such as they should
kill, it should be entirely their own; and that I would pretend to no other
share, but only that of procuring them the Glory of the Victory, and
in saving their lives, to enrich them at the Enemies expence. The pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
danger in which they were, and the hopes that I gave them made
them presently obedient, and they all assur'd me that they would faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
acquit themselves of their duty. Having, as I said before, form'd
one sole Battalion of all my men, I made them make a Front every way,
to the end that on which side soever the Enemy should fall they might
be in a posture to receive him. I only drew out twenty, which I plac'd
some six paces without the Waggons in two ranks, consisting each of
ten, that they might fire at greater liberty than if enclos'd; giving
them order to kneel on one knee that they might be more sure of their
execution, and not to do it till they came very near, and when I should
give the word.</p>
               <p>XII. The Cardinal of <hi>Guise,</hi> who was himself in person at the Head of
these six Squadrons of Horse, sent a Trumpet to bid us throw down our
Arms, being of so unequal force as not to be able to resist him; assuring us
at the same time of fair Quarter if we did so: but that if we refused to
yeild, he would kill us every man, and cut us all to pieces. I made
answer to the Trumpet, that I return'd the Cardinal of <hi>Guise</hi> thanks
for the favour he offer'd us; but that we demanded no other Quarter,
than what we could procure our selves by a good defence, for which we
were all very well prepar'd; and that he should return no more on the
same errand, because we should no longer consider him as any thing
but an Enemy. So resolute an answer made the Cardinal a while de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
what he should do, where he resolv'd to send the Trumpet a
second time to try if he could fright us by new threats, but I made my
men cry out that they would fire upon him if he approacht any nearer;
and the betrer to shew him his danger, order'd them to present their
Muskets against him. So resolute a proceeding made him think better
on't, and the Cardinal seeing we were resolv'd to stand upon our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
detach'd fifty Light Horse with a command to discover our posture.
These Cavaliers rid round about us at so great a distance, that I did not
think fit to fire upon them, and returning to make their report, were
immediately order'd to come and charge the Head of our Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the Cardinal assuring them, that so soon as they had routed the
first, he would come and fall on with all the rest. They came up ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
at a good round trot, and being come on within twice Pistol
shot, spur'd on to a Gallop, as if with design to break into our twenty
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100923:19"/>
Musqueteers. I let them approach till they were advanc'd within Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol
shot, and then commanded those of the first rank to give fire;
which they did so resolutely and discreetly, that laid several of
them dead upon the place, and the rest wheel'd off, not daring to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
by reason that the other ten Musqueteers having immediately
taken the place of the first ten that had given fire, were ready to have
done as much. Being thus return'd fewer than they came to their main
body, I sent in the mean time to rifle their dead, about whom they
found near a Hundred Pistols, which I put into a Hat shaking them,
and saying, Here my Boys, these are all your own, I pretend to no
other share but only to divide them amongst you; this happy begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
presages Victory; Courage! let us stand firm, and expect till they
bring us as many more.</p>
               <p>These words, together with the sight of the first advantage they had
had, encouraged them to that degree, that they wish'd with impatience
the Enemy would attack them again, in hopes of a greater booty. And
they were not long before they had that satisfaction; for we presently
saw one of the six Squadrons advance a trot, till they came within Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
shot, and there on a sudden they separated themselves into two
bodies, to fall upon both sides of our Battalion; but the first rank
making a front every way, they gave them from behind the Waggons
so brisk a Volley at the Muzzel of the Musquet, that several Men and
Horses lay dead upon the place, and some that were dismounted were
forc'd to get up behind the others to get off. After this they retreated
towards their main body, and went to see if they should receive a new
order to come back to be knock d o'th' head. I made these dead be
rifled too, about whom we found some twenty Pistols more, which
encourag'd our Souldiers anew.</p>
               <p>XIII. In the mean time the Cardinal of <hi>Guise,</hi> seeing the night draw
on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and very well judging that he should lose a great many men, should
he attack two hundred desperate men that were retrench'd, resolv'd to
encamp in a little Wood that was near at hand, and so to keep us as it
were besieged, till he could send for some more assistance. And, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he stood in need of Foot, without which he believ'd he should not
be able to force us, he sent to some neighbouring Garrisons to supply
him. But so soon as I had intelligence of his design, I thought it not
good for me to stay till the morning, and that it would be necessary to
attempt to escape away by the favour of the night. But the business
was, how to decamp that the Enemy's Sentinels and Guards should not
perceive it; and to this end I thought fit to make a shew of encamping
as well as they, and that I had no design of drawing off no more than
they. I therefore caus'd a great fire to be made in our Camp, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
the Souldiers to make a great noise, as if they were merry and
diverting themselves; but gave them notice withal, that when they
should see another fire kindled at midnight, that should be their signal
to decamp, and they were then every man to follow his Leader in File
without speaking a word. I commanded the Waggons also not to stir
from the place till we had recover'd the Wood, fearing the noise of
the Horses and the Wheels; and being assur'd by the knowledge I had
of the Map of the Country, that we should find a little Wood, in which
we might march all the way under cover till we came to <hi>Sezanne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:100923:20"/>
This resolution taken, the orders given, and midnight come, I caus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
the Fire to be lighted which was the signal, which every one was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to obey, and in a very little time we recover'd the Wood I spoke
of, without any sign that the Enemy had in the least discover'd our
march, and at break of day found our selves under the Walls of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanne;</hi>
where we were in absolute safety. I then kept my word with
the Souldiers, and divided amongst them the Spoil of the Enemy, by
which means the joy of seeing themselves escap'd contrary to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
was encreasd by the sight of the booty they had got, but
much more, when within a few hours after we had intelligence that the
Enemy had pursu'd us as far as to the Wood, but no further; being
told that we were already arrived at <hi>Sezanne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This action mightily pleas'd the Cardinal of <hi>Guise,</hi> who openly
commended the valour of those who had so dar'd to resist him, and
particularly enquir'd who was the Commander. It made also a great
noise in the Country, in the Army, and as far as the Court, by reason
of the great number of those who had attacked us, and of the quality
of him that was Chief. For the first rumour went, that two hundred
Foot having been met with in the open Field by six Hundred Horse,
under the command of the Cardinal of <hi>Guise,</hi> had been all cut to pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ces:
but the truth was soon known, and they heard the whole thing as it
past, with great joy.</p>
               <p>XIV. Sometime after that we had join'd wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Peace was concluded; where the King having a mind to take a

and so Regiment by Regiment to march off before him. Here it was
that the Cardinal of <hi>Guise</hi> manifested an extraordinary bounty and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the King, and at that time about his Person, he desired Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Villedonné,</hi> a Captain of the Regiment of <hi>Champagne,</hi> to show
him when the Regiment past by, an Officer called <hi>de Pontis,</hi> who was

                  </gap>s, and that Monsieur <hi>de Villedonné</hi>
had shew'd me to him, he came to me, and in the presence of the King
himself embrac'd me, and said to me these very words, <hi>That he would
have me to be his Friend, having known me by that which past near</hi> Sezan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne;
<hi>that he thought himself oblig'd to love me af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er so particular a proof of
my conduct, that he assur'd me no occasion should offer it self wherein he
might do me service, but that he would do it with all heart, and that
he conjur'd me to employ him in whatever should lye in his power, whether in
himself, or towards the King, to serve me.</hi> The extraordinary astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and surprize, wherein I was at so great a generosity, did not
hinder me from making answer with all acknowledgement and due sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission;
and from telling him that he highly reveng'd himself on me,
in putting me into so great a confusion before the King and the whole Army.</p>
               <p>The King in the mean time was in pain to know the subject of this
conference, and Monsieur <hi>de Villedonné</hi> having told him his thought,
which was, that the Cardinal was doubtless talking to me, about what
bad past betwixt us near <hi>Sezanne;</hi> his Majesty exprest a desire to see
that Officer, to hear a particular account out of the Cardinal's own
mouth, after what manner I had escap'd from his hands. The relation
he then made gave me occasion of being known to the King, and was,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100923:20"/>
as it were, the foundation and beginning of the great favour and
bounty his Majesty has manifested towards me ever since; as shall be
made appear in the progress of these <hi>Memoirs.</hi> He very much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
the generosity of Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> his proceeding with me in
this affair, as indeed it was highly commendable, especially in a person
of his great quality and merit: and this Cardinal was always mindful
of the promise he had done me the honour to make me, having exprest
so much kindness to me even to the end of his Life; as in the sickness
whereof he died at <hi>Xaintes,</hi> to send for me, and tell me with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
favour and goodness, that I ought to regret his death, since I in
him lost one of the best Friends I had in the world, of which he would
have given me proof, had he lived longer.</p>
               <p>XV. The Army was after this sent away to several Quarters upon
the confines of the Kingdom; and we of the Regiment of <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi>
had the little Town of <hi>Oleron</hi> in <hi>Bearn</hi> assign'd for ours. Our Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and another was lodg'd in a Suburb call'd <hi>Mercadet:</hi> and the two
Captains being retir'd to their own Houses, had left their Companies
to their Lieutenants, of which I was the eldest, and consequently
commanded the Quarters. About a Year after the <hi>Hugonots</hi> began the
War again, and to rise in Arms. The Marquess <hi>de la Force</hi> was Governour
of the Country, but being one of the greatest zealots of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party,
he abandon'd the King's service, and laboured to raise all the men he could.
Having one day sent a Trumpet into the Suburb of <hi>Mercadet,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
that all the Captains of the Religion were suddenly to repair to
<hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

receive his orders: I was surpriz'd at the noise, and stept to the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
to demand of him what it was that he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oclaim'd, and why he was so
bold as to dare to sound in my Quarter without my leave, seeing he knew,
what was but too well known throughout the Country, that his Master
had already manifested himself to be less affected to the King's service,
than that of his Enemies; and therewithal commanded him immediately
to be gone, threatning him if he did not do it, to make him know,
that I very well understood how to maintain his Majesty's interests<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Upon this he left the place where he had begun to sound; but being
got a little further off, fell to sounding again. This so manifest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the interdiction I had given him, in order to the maintaining
the King's right, so far incens'd me, that coming up to him, and seeing
that, relying upon the authority of his Master, he, to this first contempt
of my orders added an insolent reply; I snatcht his Trumpet from him,
broke it over his shoulders, and beat him out of my Quarters; assuring
my self, that the King would not disapprove my defending thus his
interests against an Enemy of his Crown.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless I went immediately to wait upon Monsieur <hi>de Poyenne</hi>
the King's Lieutenant in <hi>Bearn,</hi> who was very affectionate to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
service, and consequently little belov'd by the Governour, and
gave him an account of what I had done; who told me I had done
well, and no more than my duty: But foreseeing the consequence of
this affair, being well assur'd that Monsieur <hi>de. la Force</hi> would never par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
this affront; and being moreover afraid, that should the King
come to hear of it before he was inform'd of the truth, his Majesty
might perhaps accuse my zeal of some excess; I entreated Monsieur <hi>de
Poyenne</hi> that when he writ to Court, as he frequently did, he would
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100923:21"/>
put in a word in my behalf, to prevent all the ill reports by which
my enemies might have decry'd my conduct. He did accordingly, and
so effectually withal, that the King to assure me he was satisfied with my
service, gave me the Government of the Tower of <hi>Oleron,</hi> a little For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress
that commanded the Town; which, though a little thing in it self,
and that no great revenue belong'd to it, yet was it of consequence
that this Tower should be in the hands of a faithful person to keep the
Town in its duty; and it was no less advantag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ous to me after the Act
I had committed, that had made a great noise in the Country, that the
King should publickly manifest his being satisfied with it, in giving me
this Government; whilst Monsieur <hi>de la Force</hi> was making my process at
<hi>Pau.</hi> For though it was not hard for him to cause me to be condemn'd
there, to have my Head cut off, he did not find it so easie to execute
the Sentence, seeing I was of his Majesty's Party, and under his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
               <p>XVI. The War breaking out still more fiercely, our Regiment of
<hi>Champagne</hi> was commanded to the Rendezvous of the Army, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
me to think of divesting my self of my Government, being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be stinted to so small a preferment; I thought fit therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
it into the hands of Monsieur <hi>de Poyenne,</hi> who had procur'd it for
me: who, after having been very importunate with me to stay there,
and giving me many assurances to procure for me something mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
for the future; seeing me absolutely resolv'd to leave it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
me however, whether I would or no, to name another in my
stead. I therefore presented him a Gentleman call'd <hi>Domvidaut,</hi> who
was indeed a <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gonot,</hi> but who had always manifested so great a zeal for
the Kings service, that I thought it impossible for him ever to fail in his
duty. And because I would tye him yet faster to Monsieur <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Poyenne,</hi>
I gave him to understand, that he was oblig'd to him only for this
Government. He on his part thought he could not better express his
acknowledgment, than by entrusting me with his Son, whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
me to receive in the quality of Cadet, into the Company of
which I was Lieutenant.</p>
               <p>XVII. We went presently after to the Siege of <hi>Saint John d' Angely,</hi>
which the king in person came to besiege, in the year 1620, of which
Siege I shall only make report of one action, wherein I with several
others underwent a very great peril, from which it appears we were
only deliver'd by a kind of miracle.</p>
               <p>Being upon the point to spring a Mine, I was commanded with 40
Men to charge into the breach so soon as ever it should be open, by that
means to deprive the Enemy of the means to repair it. We were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of necessity to approach very near, and to have something to cover
us, in case we should be forc'd to retrench our selves. I therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
Baskets instead of Sacks, which were commonly made use of upon
such occasions, arguing that it would be much more easie to fill them
that stood open, and stiff of themselves, than Sacks that did not so;
and accordingly we had forty deliver'd to us, which serv'd us very much,
but after another manner than we propos'd to our selves. We then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
as near as we could to the Mine, which in playing had an effect
quite contrary to what was expected: for instead of throwing the Earth
into the Town, it threw it back upon us, the soil being lighter on our
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100923:21"/>
side, and buried us under its ruines. But by the greatest good fortune
imaginable, having made all our Souldiers by my example carry all their
Baskets upon their heads, that our hands might be at liberty to handle
all our arms, they not only broke part of the force of the Earth, and
Stones, and preserv'd us from having our brains beaten out, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
serv'd to give us a little breath, in leaving us a little vacuity, that
preserv'd us from being stifled before we could be reliev'd. Monsieur
<hi>de Cominges,</hi> who was at the end of the Trench, having seen some Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
hurt with the Stones that the Mine had blown about, and judging
in what extremity we were likely to be, came running to assist us, and
disengag'd us from under the Rubbish, whilst the Enemy were busie in
repairing the breach, without thinking of us.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, that which by accident sav'd our lives on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
was afterwards put into practice in other Sieges; and they have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ince
often made use of these Baskets, as very proper to make quick lodgments,
and speedily to cover themselves; which also made the King himself to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that I had herein done him a very considerable service, which was
almost all the recompence I had for having ran so great a hazard. My
inclination for War, and the aversion I have ever had for all remedies, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
me from causing my self to be let blood, as I had been advis'd:
but I found my self so ill by having been so bruis'd and overwhelm'd
by these ruines, and by having been more led by my own inconsiderate
heat than the counsel of my Friends, that I had the Jaundice for a
month together, to that degree that I was hardly to be known. But
my better parts being still in their vigour, and my heart always whole
and good, I never excus'd my self from my ordinary duty upon the
Guard, in one of which I receiv'd a Carabine shot in the body, which
entring but a little way, kept me but a very short time in bed.</p>

               <p>I. THE City of <hi>St. John d' Angely</hi> having surrendred it self to the
King, his Majesty went before <hi>Montaubon</hi> with an army of
four and twenty Thousand men, or thereabouts, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Monsieur <hi>le Connestable de Luines:</hi> and invested it the 17th of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,</hi>
in the year 1621. The Constable had for Lieutenant Generals,
his Brothers, Messieurs <hi>du Maine, de Chevreuse,</hi> and <hi>de Lesdiguieres:</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Schomberg</hi> was grand Master of the Artillery, and Surintendant
<hi>de Finances,</hi> and executed also in part the command of a Lieutenant
General. Of these Forces, and of these Chiefs, the King made three
Attacks, of which the first was his own, wherein the Constable and his Brothers commanded; the second was commanded by Monsieur <hi>du Maine;</hi>
and the third by Messieurs <hi>de Chevreuse,</hi> and <hi>de Lesdiguieres.</hi> Monsieur
<hi>du Maine</hi> attackt the <hi>Fauxbourg de Ville-bourbon,</hi> which was very strongly
fortified, and very commodious to the Enemy, both for the passage
of Victuals into the Town, and a Commerce with their Neighbours; by
which means this attack, though the most important, was of the greatest
difficulty and danger. That of Monsieur <hi>de Chevreuse</hi> was call'd that of
<hi>Dumontier,</hi> and was weaker than the other, which made Monsieur <hi>de
Schomberg,</hi> Grand-master of the Artillery, plant his principal Batteries there,
compos'd of four and twenty pieces of Cannon, and the best serv'd that
ever any were, by reason that he himself was Overseer of the Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
The Regiments of <hi>Picardy</hi> and <hi>Champagne,</hi> of which he had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
esteem were encampt at this attack. He having a design to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
fourteen pieces of Cannon much nearer than they had been planted
when we first fate down before the place, had a mind first to know
what this <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> of <hi>Dumontier</hi> was, which at distance appear'd ruinous
and uninhabited, but he fear'd they might have posted some Ambuscade
there, that might sally out and nail his Cannon, should he approach so
near. He propos'd this doubt to the Generals, who presently gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that two Officers should be commanded to discover these places:
and Monsieur <hi>de Cominges</hi> and I, were appointed for this service.
The order being given us, I leap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d up behind Monsieur <hi>de Cominge,</hi> my own
Horse not being there, and we went in open day to ford a current of
water call'd the <hi>Tescon.</hi> So soon as we were over I alighted, and entred
not only into the <hi>Fauxbourg,</hi> but into the ruinous houses that remain'd
standing, and search'd them one after another. Monsieur <hi>de Cominge</hi> on
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100923:22"/>
his side did the same, and when we thought we had seen all, we bethought
us to examine some by-corners, where we conceiv'd we might make
some new discovery, and found that in truth it was one of the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
places, and that men cannot be too exact upon such occasions.
We return'd to make our report to the Generals, amongst whom Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Lesdiguieres</hi> was he who judg'd the best of our exactness, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that he had particular knowledge of this place.</p>
               <p>The Enemy having had notice, that some had been sent to discover
this Suburb, fear'd we would post ourselves there to straighten them the
more; which prompted them to defend it by a lodgment, that they
made in a little Island, which was at the head of this Suburb, and that
was encompassed with the <hi>Tescon,</hi> a Rivulet that was but narrow, but
very deep. There was no Bridge over this Current, and to pass over it
they had laid a Tree across, over which it was not easy to pass upright
on ones feet, but only by getting astride, and shifting forward by the
help of ones arms, which made the Enemy not fear to be that way sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
by the Foot: As to the Horse they could pass no way but over the
same Ford where we had past in going to this <hi>Fauxbourg;</hi> and which
being very open, was moreover so straight that they could march but
very few in a front. All these advantages prevail'd with them to place
two Out-Guards at the end of this Island, one of fifty men nearest to the
Town, and the other of ten, which was almost half way betwixt the
advanc'd Battery and the Town.</p>
               <p>II. The Generals, and particularly Monsieur <hi>de Schomberg,</hi> were a little
perplext, fearing very much for the Cannon, which might easily be all
nail'd in a night; it was therefore resolv'd in the Councel of War to
fall upon the first <hi>Corps de Guard,</hi> though it was very dangerous thing
to attempt, by reason the passage was so straight and difficult, by which
they were to go and come: but the great importance of driving off that
<hi>Corps de Guard</hi> so much advanc'd, made the Generals resolve to hazard
some men. For this service the Officer of <hi>Champagne</hi> was nam'd, for so
it was, that the King and Lieutenant Generals were pleas'd to call me,
knowing me much better by that name than that of <hi>de Pontis;</hi> and I had
orders to take with me fifty men to charge this <hi>Corps de Guard.</hi> Being
that I came off the Guard that very day, and that according to rule I
ought not to be commanded, Monsieur <hi>de Schomberg</hi> thought fit to make
me some excuses, and to them added, that this attack being of the last
importance to him, he entreated me for his sake to do as if it had been
my turn. These occasions being as every one knows honourable, I told
him that I found my self very sensibly oblig'd in the choice he made of my
person to perform this service for him, assuring him withal, that if the
thing was to be done, it should not stick at us to procure him all manner
of satisfaction. I chose out fifty brave Souldiers, who all followed me
with great joy, knowing me for a man who would not expose their lives,
but when I expos'd my own, who always gave them their due praises up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all occasions, and was ever as sparing of them as possibly I could. With
these men I came to the little Bridge of which I spoke before, which took us
up some time to pass over, by reason of the difficulty already observ'd, and
afterwards falling all together upon the first <hi>Corps de Guard,</hi> without giving
them so much leisure as to observe how many we were, we gave them so
brisk a charge, as forc'd them to retire with fewer of their number to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Corps de Guard,</hi> which fallied not out of its post, for fear of laying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100923:23"/>
open, thinking that we had been more than we were. Their
retrenchments were of Trees laid upon one another, and we were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
our selves to assault them, when on a sudden we heard a great
noise of confus'd voices from the King's Army, who cry'd out to us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire:
but the distance hindring us from hearing distinctly what they said,
we were as much induced to believe that they encourag'd us to charge the
Enemy, ad that they admonish'd us to retire.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Monsieur <hi>du Maine,</hi> who had planted himself upon
a little eminence to see the success of our enterprize, discover'd, when
he least dreamt of any such thing, a great number of the Enemy, who
being sallied out of the Town, behind the <hi>Fauxbourg,</hi> march'd along
by the <hi>Tescon,</hi> and were coming to enclose us. He presently caus'd two
little Field-pieces to be drawn by strength of hand down to the Banks
of the River, and to be levell'd to fire upon them, which succeeded so
well, that their Battallion was shot through and through, and a great
many of their men were laid dead upon the place. The rest frighted
at this execution, stood some time still without advancing, or retreating,
by which means, before they could come to themselves, and take new
measures, we had time, after having seen from whence these Cannon shot
came, and perceiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d the inevitable danger we were in, speedily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and to recover the Bridge, as by those great outcries our own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
had given us warning to do. The Enemy had no stomach to pursue
us, but return<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d the same way they came, very much displeas'd that they
had fail'd of their design. I lost in this action but two men, and had but
three wounded. For my own part I had no hurt at all, and had only
my Hat struck off by a Musquet shot. Monsieur <hi>de Schomberg</hi> who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
generous, thinking himself very much oblig'd by this service I
had done him, made me a very particular acknowledgment, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
to serve me to the King. He effectually did so, and spoke so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageously
of me, that I was in the extreamest confusion at the praises
he gave me for only acquitting my self of my duty.</p>
               <p>III. In the mean time I can say this, that by this publick testimony of
his esteem, he procur'd me the greatest treasure that I could ever have
had; which was the Friendship of the worthiest, most vertuous, and most
generous man, that in my life I ever knew, I mean Monsieur <hi>de Zamet,</hi>
at that time Camp-master to the Regiment of <hi>Picardy,</hi> who was present
when Monsieur <hi>de Schomberg</hi> spoke publickly in my favour before the
whole Army. What he heard him then say, join'd with what he already
knew of me on several occasions, made him resolve to chuse me for his
Friend, and from that instant he wish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, as he told me afterwards, to
have me for his Lieutenant. He began to express a very particular affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for me, and entreated me to come often to see him. It was by this
then that the strict Friendship which was contracted between us began,
of which I can say the foundation was on one part built upon the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
I had of the merit and wisdom of this great man, and the other
on his own bounty to look upon me, as a man whom he thought not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unworthy of his Friendship.</p>
               <p>The very particular obligation that I had to Monsieur <hi>du Maine,</hi> for
having so seasonably reliev'd me in so perilous an occasion, prompted me
for the future to seek out all ways whereby I might manifest my acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment.
For though he in this only follow'd the ordinary Rules of
War, which oblige every one to succour the King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Forces, when they see
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100923:23"/>
them expos'd as we were, nevertheless the manner after which he did it,
gave me sufficiently to understand, that it had been a particular effect of
his own bounty. And I confess I was a little mortified, when thinking I
had found a favourable occasion wherein to return part of what I ought
him, I was hindred from doing it, by him from whom I was to receive
my Orders. Monsieur <hi>du maine</hi> having a design to carry the <hi>Fauxbourg de
Villebourbon</hi> by assault, commanded almost all his Foot to fall on, who
push'd the Guards with so great fury and vigour, that three hundred men
were already mounted upon the Wall, and held themselves assur'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
Masters of it. The Enemy seeing themselves so forc'd, call'd in above
two Thousand Men to their releif, who being behind good retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
beat our men off, and made them descend much faster than they
had mounted, but in less number, by reason of those who were left upon
the place. Being this fight could not be made, but that it must be heard
to the other Quarters, where we had sufficient notice both by the firing,
and the noise that was made both on the one side and the other, I thought
that Monsieur <hi>du Maine</hi> might very well be in a condition to admit of some
relief, and therefore at the instant went to ask leave of our Lieutenant
Collonel call'd <hi>Pyolet,</hi> that he would permit me to go manifest to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>du Maine,</hi> to whom I was so much oblig'd a part of my acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment,
in offering my service to him, with fifty or threescore men
of our body. Monsieur <hi>de Pyolet</hi> commended my design, but told me
withal, that being but Lieutenant Collonel, he could not suffer what
the King had forbid, which was, that no one should go from one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to another. Thus was I afflicted to the laft degree to lose this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and might say methinks, that had I had but a part of that gratitude for
the infinite favours I have receiv'd from Almighty God, that I had for
Men; I had been as good a Christian, as I was then remote from God,
and all true Piety.</p>
               <p>Monsieur <hi>de Pyolet</hi> having afterwards spoke to the Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
about this affair, had permission upon the like occasion to grant
what I had desir'd of him, provided the detachment should consist but
of fifty or threescore men at most. Wherefore seeing one day a great fire at
Monsieur <hi>du Maine</hi>'s Quarter, I ran thither with threescore men, in
hopes that I might do him some service, but I found it was only
fire that had caught in the Huts. He, very much surpriz'd to see me
there with my men, askt me the reason of it, which I told him; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
withal, that I thought my self extreamly unhappy in that I
could not meet with an occasion wherein to acknowledge the favour,
for which I should be eternally oblig'd to him. He thereupon took me
in his arms, telling me publickly, that he was so much the more oblig'd
to me, in that having done nothing for me but what was his duty, I
did that for him which I was no way oblig'd to do; that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
forget it, and that he entreated me to come often to see him, and
to employ him as one of the best friends I had. But the protection of
this Prince, that in all appearance might have been so advantageous,
continued not long; for a few days after, Monsieur <hi>du Maine</hi> was kill'd
with a Musquet shot, which passing betwixt two Barrels, went first through
Monsieur <hi>de Schomberg</hi>'s Hat, and thence into the Eye of Monsieur <hi>du
Maine,</hi> by which he was laid dead upon the place. This considerable
loss made me remember the other I had suffer'd in the person of the
Cardinal of <hi>Guise:</hi> but all this could not work so upon me, to think of any
thing more serious and solid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:100923:24"/>
IV. To continue what befell me during this Siege; being upon the
Guard at the Trenches, I was one day commanded by Monsieur <hi>de Pyolet</hi>
to sustain the Miner, who was at work under the Wall; and being of a
little unquiet nature, I fancied, I know not for what reason, that the
Enemy might very well countermine against our Work. I said as much
to some of our Officers, and to the Miner, who all laught at me; but
judging nevertheless that the Enemy might very well do, what I should
have done had I been in their place, I thought to assure my self further
of the truth of the thing: I therefore call'd for a Drum into the Mine,
of which I set one end upon the ground, and laid a Musquet bullet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the other, that at every blow the Counterminers gave, it might
sound upon the Drum, by the means of the Ball. This design took ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and made us hear what I desir'd. The Miner, a little astonisht,
laugh'd no more as before, but told us that we must immediately retire;
whereupon I presently made ready our men, and sent to acquaint them
at the tail of the Trench, with what we had discover'd. The Miner
having afterwards examin'd the business a little nearer, assur'd me that
there was but little Earth betwixt us and the Enemy; and that they would
presently strike through into his Mine, and accordingly we presently
saw light, by which hole they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ir'd upon us some Pistol-shot, to which
I made answer with one I had in my hand; commanding my Souldiers
to beat back these Counterminers with their Halberts; which doubtless
had been no hard matter to do, but that at the same time a great
many men being sallied by another way came directly towards the
Trench, with a design to cut it off; and oblig'd me to retire fighting,
and making good our Retreat, till the rest of our Regiment should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to our relief. I found my self much more perplext, when I saw
at least thirty Granadoes fly in the air, which the Enemy threw into the
Trench. There were a great many Souldiers hurt, and all so daunted,
that I was forc'd to withdraw, to make way for the whole Regiment,
who came in fresh, and repell'd the Enemy. I was wounded in the
Thigh with a splinter of one of these Granadoes, of which I was never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
presently cur'd.</p>
               <p>V. The second time I mounted the Guard after this, my post was
again to sustain the Miner, upon whom, as he was at work at the Basti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they continually from above threw down Stones, and a thousand
other things to brain him; which made us contrive to cover this place
with Beams, that he might work in safety. Dinner time being come,
we withdrew from the Trench, and plac'd our selves in the mouth of the
Mine, to be yet in greater security. This foresight sav'd all our Lives;
for immediately after the Enemy threw down from above Pipes filled
with the dross of Iron that comes from the Forges, and which is so pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
a thing, that these Hogsheads falling upon the forementioned
Beams, broke them all, and so fill'd the Trench, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o body could
pass, so that had they made use of their advantage, they had certainly
had a good bargain of us: but not knowing what had hapned, they
gave us time to disengage our selves, though with much ado. We did
not get off so well afterwards, for as I was engag'd in several dangerous
occasions, and that my too much forwardness was the cause that I too
frankly expos'd my life, one day as I was again set to guard the same
Miner, the Enemy made a Sally upon the head of the Trench, which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100923:24"/>
we at first sustained vigorously enough, but by reason that, to make a
better resistance, and to stand more firm, we had drawn our selves up
close together, the Enemy, who came on another open side on the top
of the Trench, having thrown down on a sudden twenty great pots of
boyling Pitch, put us in the most miserable condition that ever poor men
were in, being reduc'd almost to be burnt alive in our cloaths. Many
of us died, and others escap'd by tearing off their cloaths; I for my part
having rowl'd my self to no purpose upon the earth to cool me, and
finding my self still extreamly afflicted with the pain, I could think of
no better remedy than to throw my self into the River, where I began
a little to breathe; and from whence nevertheless I came not out quite
cur'd, for I had my Shoulders sufficiently broil'd, as well as several others,
which gave the Enemy occasion to jeer us, in crying, <hi>To the Grill, To
the Grill;</hi> and to ask us if we had not been pepper'd and salted enough.
Adding, That they would take care we should be better handled the
next time.</p>
               <p>VI. Monsieur <hi>de Schomberg,</hi> who has ever done me the honour to love
me, and to make it appear he had some confidence in me in these affairs,
sent for me a few days after, and told me that he had a great mind to
force a Half-Moon, that had kept it self but too long; that he believ'd
with Fire-works it might be brought to pass; and that he remembred he
had seen certain Fire-pots that plaid with great effect, but that he did
not know any one in the Army, that either knew how to make them,
or to make use of them. It hapned by good luck that I not only knew
this sort of Pots, but also how to make and use them; which made me
tell Monsieur <hi>de Schomberg</hi> that I would be responsible to him for these
Fire-works, and that he might rely upon me for the provision. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there was great danger in the throwing them, he would not suffer
me to throw them my self; but only told me, that after I had made
them ready, I should make choice of some good Souldier, whom I should
instruct after what manner they were to be thrown. I prepared then
these Pots, which were of Clay, and fill'd them as they should be with
Gunpowder, covering them very well, and tying them with good Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thread,
about which were several ends of lighted Matches; to the end
that the Pots being thrown, and breaking with the fall, some one of
the bits of Match should fall into the Powder, and fire it, which would
break the Pot into a thousand pieces, and make a terrible havock by
reason of the broken pieces that flew on every side, and which in
wounding and killing several people would strike a terrour into the rest,
who were not accustom'd to that sort of fire.</p>
               <p>I then began to consider of choosing a person capable of throwing these
Pots, and of doing it so dexterously, as to be serviceable to us; and at
last bethought me of a Souldier that was very brave, and very handy,
call'd <hi>Montably,</hi> who had long importun'd me to put him upon some ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
wherein he might signalize himself, and who every time he met me
urged me to that effect; which made me think of proposing this to him,
that he might make himself be taken notice of by Monsieur <hi>de Schomberg.</hi>
Having therefore sent for him, I open'd to him my whole design,
and made him withal sensible of the danger, that I might not deceive
him: Which having done, I demanded his resolution. He immediately
with great joy embraced an occasion he had so long wisht for, telling
me withal, that it would be the means either to push his fortune, or to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100923:25"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:100923:25"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:100923:26"/>
put him out of need on't. I then instructed him more than he desir'd,
in all things, designing at once to make our enterprize succeed, and
to precaution him against the danger, and for my last order commanded
him positively after he had thrown these Pots to retire, and let them
fall on who were commanded to give the Assault. Had he taken my
advice, I had been entirely satisfied in this affair; but this young man
more generous than obedient, after the happy execution of what had
been commanded him, could not forbear proceeding to what he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid,
and to go with his Sword in his hand upon the Enemy, where he
received a Musquet shot that laid him dead upon the place; which gave
me a sensible displeasure in the midst of the joy we had to see our Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
perfectly succeed. For the Pots I have spoken of, wrought so great
an effect, and the Besiegers push'd the Enemy with so great vigour,
that without any considerable loss, saving that of this brave young man,
the Half-moon was forc'd and won.</p>
               <p>VII. Some days after, as I was mounting the Guard, the Enemy made a
great Sally, and they had already begun to nail two pieces of Cannon,
when I was commanded to repel them with a body that I had rally'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
in which there was a very brave <hi>Swiss.</hi> The Enemy having at
this time also thrown some Granadoes which made a sufficient havock
amongst us, one that fell into a Barrel of Powder gave fire to't, and cut
off both the poor <hi>Swisse</hi>'s Legs, blew the Heads of one of the barrels against
my stomach with much force, that I thought my self cut in two, and was
ready to swoon; it put me to the greatest pain that ever I had felt in all
my life, but being come to my self, and having examined my body all
over, feeling no blood, and discovering no wound, I confess I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
glad, because I thought my self a dead man; and though I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
my life as freely as another, I had no mind at all to dye. That
which sav'd me was a Cuirasse I had put on that day, which resisted the
blow, and which by the reverberation caus'd my pain.</p>
               <p>VIII. Eight or ten days after this, mounting the Guard in a Trench,
whilst Monsieur <hi>de Zamet</hi> mounted another on the right hand which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
to his Regiment, as the first of <hi>France,</hi> it hapned, that as he was
advancing his work very far, the Enemy sallied in so great number, and
with so much resolution, that they overturn'd the head of the Trench
upon the tail, which also gave way. Monsieur <hi>Zamet</hi> having rallied
some Souldiers stood firm for some time, and made good his ground with
his own person, till being wounded in the Arm with a Musquet shot, and
out of condition of fighting, he was taken Prisoner, and led into a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
at distance, with several others of his Officers, where he was under
Guard, whilst the Enemy still pusht the rest of his Regiment.</p>
               <p>In the mean time that of <hi>Champagne</hi> not being commanded, we had our
own Trench to guard, and I seeing that of <hi>Picardy</hi> so handled and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and perceiving the gross of the Enemy at distance drawn up in the
corner, who there kept these Prisoners, without thinking that Monsieur
<hi>de Zamet</hi> was of the number; I ask'd leave of Monsieur <hi>de Pyolet,</hi> to go
and relieve our Companions, before they were carried away, assuring
him that I would have but fifty chosen men to deliver them, and to drive
away the Guard that kept them. He granted my request, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
chose out fifty men, that I knew to be very brave; but above
twenty Serjeants out of generosity took the places of so many Souldiers, I
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100923:26"/>
sent them back, and all the Regiment (the occasion appear'd so honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able)
would have been of the Party. I made them all take no other
Arms but Halberts only, and took one my self, being I had ever found
it the best Weapon when men come to blows. After having concluded
how we should attack the Enemy, we march'd through a little cover'd
way that wholly conceal'd us, till we were just upon them; and charging
all together into the middle of this body that kept our people enclos'd,
we so astonish'd them with this surprize, and unexpected attack, that
thinking they had all the Army upon them, they made very little resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
but ran away, leaving some of their men behind them.</p>
               <p>IX. But I was very much astonish'd to see Monsieur <hi>Zamet</hi> amongst these
Prisoners, which also made my joy the greater, though it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some mixture of fear, when I saw him cover'd all over with blood. I
ask'd him where he was hurt, and he gave me comfort, by telling me it
was only in his Arm. I conducted him back to his Regiment, where he
embrac'd me several times, telling me, he would never forget this service
I had done him, of which, that he might give me further assurance, he
entreated me to come see him the next day, so soon as I should be reliev'd
from the Guard, and I fail'd not to come according to his desire. As
soon as he saw me, he made me lean down upon his Bed, that he might
embrace me, and told me with infinite kindness, that he would not only
love me so long as he liv'd, but would publickly acknowledge that he
stood indebted to me for his life and liberty; that he could not better
manifest his gratitude, than by assuring me that I should be Master both
of the one and the other, as things that belonged to me, and to which I
had acquir'd an absolute right in preserving them; that he would for
the future divide with me both his goods and fortune; that he would
have me from this time forward, look upon him as my Brother; and
that being he could not confer upon me any command that could tye me
nearer to him, than that of his own Lieutenant, he entreated I would
accept the offer he made me, that I might begin to enter upon my share
of whatever belonged to him, that he might hereafter advance me, and
change my Command according as he should rise himself, and advance
his own fortune. To conclude, he said all this to me after so tender and
affectionate a manner, adding withal that he promis'd in the presence of
God to make all this good to me, that I cannot express the disposition I
found my self in, after such an obliging discourse.</p>
               <p>I told him, to do Monsieur <hi>de Pyolet</hi> a good Office, who had entreated me
to lay part of this obligation upon him, that I had not only done what I
was commanded, and that it was in executing the commands of another,
I had been so happy as to do him this service; but that I stuck not from
that moment to a man so worthy to be belov'd, to engage both my person
and my life; so that from that very day there was so strict an Union con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
betwixt us, as death it self could not dissolve, being I still find it
so firmly engraven in my heart, four and thirty years after the loss of this
Friend, that I cannot think or speak of it without being mov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to a
degree that I cannot express.</p>
               <p>I began then from this moment to live with this incomparable Friend,
not only as with a Brother, but as with my own Father, having for him
the same respect, and paying him with all possible assiduity the same du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the same deference, as if I had really been his Son. For all my
Duties upon the Guard, and the occasions upon which I was commanded
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100923:27"/>
excepted, I was continually by his Bed side; lying with my hand in the
stateliest Union that can possibly be imagin'd; which also was much aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
upon a new accident, which I think my self oblig'd to relate.</p>
               <p>X. The Enemy having made another furious Sally, came and set fire
to our Powder, lam'd the Carriages of two pieces of Cannon, to which
they set fire also, and were endeavouring to nail the rest, when I was
commanded out with a body of threescore men to repel them; where I
once more thought I should have been scorch'd to death by a Barrel of
Powder they gave fire to in their retreat. After having beaten them
from this Battery, I retir'd with the rest of our Regiment, which with
great vigour beat the Enemy back even into their own Fort, though it
could not be done without great loss on our part. Amongst the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
that were kill'd in this action, there was one very brave man call'd
Captain <hi>Robert;</hi> of whose death the King being inform'd, he presently
thought of the Officer of <hi>Champagne,</hi> to confer the command upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for,
besides other occasions wherein I had been particularly taken notice of by
his Majesty, he had heard of the service I had done Monsieur <hi>Zamet,</hi> and
the other Prisoners, in rescuing them out of the Enemies hands. Calling
therefore for Monsieur <hi>de Puisyeux,</hi> he told him that he gave me the
Company of Captain <hi>Robert,</hi> commanding him to dispatch my Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and to send it to me before I knew any thing of it. Monsieur <hi>de
Puisyeux,</hi> who thought himself highly oblig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to me, for having without
speaking to him, or his having entreated me, preserv'd a Country House
of his, that was near the Army, from being plundred by the Souldiers,
by putting into it a Gurrd of six Musqueteers, was exceeding glad of this
opportunity of serving me to the King; and therefore taking the liberty
to tell him his opinion concerning the choice his Majesty had made, he
spoke of me to him the most advantageously that he possibly could, so
much as, unknown to me, to acknowledge the little service I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to do him. The Commission therefore was dispatch'd that
night, and being deliver'd to me in the morning, without my having had
the least intimation of it, I confess I more valued the King's remembring
me of his own accord, than I did my preferment to the Command; tho
I did pretty much covet that too, not believing that the Lieutenancy of
Monsieur <hi>Zamet</hi> could be conferr'd upon me so soon.</p>
               <p>I went forth with to carry my Commission to Monsieur <hi>Zamet,</hi> who
look'd a little coldly upon it, and ask'd me if I had rather have the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
than to be his Lieutenant; adding withal, that he very well knew,
that in order and pay, a Company was worth more, but that he believ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
it was much more advantageous to me to be Lieutenant to a person who
was so absolutely my own, as he was, who assur'd me no less than his
goods and fort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne, and therefore entreated me to think on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t before I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
the Command. To this I made answer, that he very well knew,
that I had already assur'd him, that I was entirely his, and that accordingly he
should be the absolute Master in this affair; that as I had hitherto no hand at
all in it, being meerly oblig'd to the King's bounty, who had thought of me
of himself; and to the kind remembrance of Monsieur <hi>de Puisyeux</hi> who had
dispatch'd the Commission before I had heard a syllable of it, I could not
better let him see how much I was at his disposal, than by bringing him the
Commission to do with it as he himself thought fit. He then told me, that he
had a great mind to inform the King of the particulars that past in that Sally
of the Enemy I have mention'd before, where I restor'd him his liberty, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100923:27"/>
that being there was no one who had had so great a share in it as my
self, I was able to give a better account than any one of that action, and
therefore he should be glad I would go wait upon his Majesty in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon,
and present him a Letter that he would write. I did so, where
after I had presented Monsieur <hi>Zamet</hi>'s Letter, and given an account
of his health, which his Majesty enquir'd after, he immediately fell to
speaking of the occasion, wherein I had rescu'd him out of the Enemies
hands, commanding me to tell him the whole story, which I accordingly
did as well as I could: I then took my opportunity to return my most
humble thanks for the honour his Majesty had done me, in remembring
me after a manner so much to my advantage, and of which I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a profound acknowledgment all the days of my life. But the King
seeing I took no notice of Monsieur <hi>Zamet</hi>'s design, said to me, But you
have not told me all this while that <hi>Zamet</hi> would have you for his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant?
to which I made answer, That I was in the first place bound to let
his Majesty know my sence of this very particular favour he had been
pleas'd to shew me, when I least thought of any such thing; and as to
the other, which Monsieur <hi>Zamet</hi> sollicited in my behalf, it was not for
me to mention it to his Majesty, and that I should seem not to value the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
he had conferr'd upon me as I ought, should I at the same time I
came to return my thanks for the one, make suit for another: But since your
Majesty, said I, obliges me to answer to that affair, I can assure you, that
I am ready with great chearfulness to do whatever your Majesty shall please
to command, whether in accepting, or surrendring the Company in the
Regiment of <hi>Champagne,</hi> for the Lieutenancy of Monsieur <hi>Zamet;</hi> which
I confess to be to me much more considerable and desireable than many
Companies, by reason of the tender Friendship I am happy in from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his merit, which is to your Majesty sufficiently known. Being
then, Sir, to receive the one or the other from your Majesties hand, I
with all my heart resign the Commission your Majesty did me the honour
to send me, with an humble request, that your Majesty would be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
pleas'd to make for me a choice, that I protest, I know not how to
make for my self. At the same time I presented my Commission to the
King, who very much surpriz'd at my complement, and the free manner
wherewith I had referr'd my self into his hands for the choice of one of
these two Commands, left me on a sudden to go to the other end of the
room, where the Constable <hi>de Luines</hi> was, to whom he told all that I had
said to him, and shew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d him the Commission I had return'd into his hands.</p>
               <p>The Constable had not been very well satisfied with me in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the War, by reason of a little occasion wherein I had not manifested
so great a complacency as is expected by great men, but notwithstanding
he had alter'd his opinion of me upon further knowledge; so that what
the King had then told him, having given him yet a better character of
my conduct, he answer'd his Majesty, that it was not just to leave so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
an act without recompence; to which he added, Your Majesty
expresses an intention to grant Monsieur <hi>Zamet</hi> the favour he desires of
you, in giving him Monsieur <hi>de Pontis</hi> for his Lieutenant; but this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
being less advantageous both in respect of pay, and of the honour
of Captain, which you have already conferr'd upon him; your Majesty
may find a way if you please, to recompence both the one and the other,
in ordering him Captains pay, and in adding to the Command of Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
to the Camp-master of the Regiment of <hi>Picardy,</hi> which is the
first Regiment of <hi>France,</hi> the new Title of Honour of eldest Lieutenant
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100923:28"/>
in your Majesty's Army. Nothing could have been more obliging, than
what the Constable spoke to the King in my favour, and he needed to say
no more to prevail with him to consent to all things; for immediately
Monsieur <hi>de Puisyeux</hi> had order to deliver me the dispatches, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
were brought me the same day.</p>
               <p>After having return'd my most humble thanks to the King and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable,
I went back to Monsieur <hi>Zamet,</hi> to whom I deliver'd a Letter
from the King, wherein he left it to the bearer to give him an account how
he had order'd his affairs; adding only, that he gave him to understand
before hand, that the Officer of <hi>Champagne</hi> was now that of <hi>Picardy,</hi> as he had
so much wish'd to be; and that he had been easily perswaded to make
him so, having found in him a perfect submission, and all possible esteem
and friendship for him. Monsieur <hi>Zamet</hi> having read this Letter embrac'd
me with all his soul, telling me that it was only to manifest to me, the
strict union he was resolv'd henceforward to have with me; after which
with a particular tenderness, he repeated to me what he had already
protested; namely, that he desired I should now begin to share with him
both estate and fortune, as his Brother. I reply'd with the best expressions I
could give him of my perfect acknowledgment, and of the passion I had
to let him see by my future actions, that I was not altogether unworthy
of the choice he had made of me.</p>
               <p>XI. The next day having sent for all the Captains of the Regiment,
he told them, that he would acquaint them with a piece of news, that
he knew would please them very well, which was that the King had given
him for his Lieutenant, a man to whom he had before granted a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in the Regiment of <hi>Champagne,</hi> and who had been so generous, and
had so great an esteem for the Regiment of <hi>Picardy,</hi> as to surrender it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Majesty's hands, that he might be his Lieutenant; that they all
knew him particularly well, having often been with him in action, and
that they could not choose but remember him, when they saw their
Collonel wounded and abed, seeing that without the assistance of the
person of whom he was speaking, he had not now been with them; but in
the hands of the Enemy: that therefore he assur'd himself they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
me into their body with great joy, which had the rather mov'd him
to ask me of the King; that he conjur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d them to unite in the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the honour I did the Regiment, in preferring a Lieutenancy there,
before a Company in that of <hi>Champagne,</hi> my ordinary Regiment. To
which all the Officers gave a very obliging answer in my favour.</p>
               <p>I presently after came into the Chamber, not having been by when he
had thus spoken to them, where, after having receiv'd extraordinary
civility on their parts, I told them that I thought my self very happy,
that the King had receiv'd my resignation of the Company he had given
me, to honour me with that of the Lieutenancy of their Regiment. That
though men did not usually love to change a Company for the place of a
Lieutenant; yet a man might do it with reason, when it was to enter
into a body wherein were so many brave Officer; that I entreated them
all to consider me as a person absolutely devoted to them, seeing that
for the honour of serving in their Regiment, I quitted another with all its
advantages. Monsieur <hi>Zamet</hi> had the satisfaction of seeing, that the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy
which ordinarily mixes in such occasions, had nothing to do here;
for the Captains made me a thousand kind expressions in his presence, with
several protestations of the joy they were in to see me united to their body.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100923:28"/>
And the next day the Regiment being drawn up, I took possession of my
Command of Captain Lieutenant to the Collonel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Company. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
two days after there hapned an occasion of honour, which had like
to have set me at odds with the whole Regiment.</p>
               <p>XII. One of the Lieutenants disposing himself to command in turn, I
told him that as Lieutenant to the Collonel, I ought to pass for youngest
Captain; that in this quality I had right to choose occasions of honour at
my own pleasure, and that I made choice of this. This Lieutenant took
what I had said to him very ill, and told all the other Lieutenants of the
Regiment, who all together came to me, telling me that I had but my
turn, no more than they, and that I should not be Master of theirs.</p>
               <p>To this replying a little roughly, that I very well understood my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
that it gave me the same right it did the Collonel Lieutenants of
all the old Bodies, and that I could not endure it should be diminisht in
my hands; they answer'd me very briskly, that they were not afraid of
my words, by reason there were a great many brave men in the Body;
had I not believ'd so, Gentlemen, said I, I had not enter'd into it, and tis
that it may not be said there are any Cowards, that I will maintain my
right; seeing I should be look'd upon as such a one, should I fail therein.
This smart reply, no less civil than resolute, made these Gentlemen at
last to seek out some way of accommodation, which made them propose
to me this condition; that since I would have the choice of all occasions
of honour, they askt, that they might rely upon me when they could not
go to some Guards, where the fatigue was too great. The easiness with
which I consented to their demand, saying aloud, that I promis'd it
them with all my heart, by reason of the experience I had, that there
is often more honour to be acquir'd in these perillous occasions, put them
into a new confusion: but they could not go back, having engag'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into it of their own accord.</p>
               <p>XIII. To return to what concerns the Siege of <hi>Montaubon,</hi> the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
being admirably well serv'd by the care of the Grand Maistre, who
also was superintendant of the Treasury, the Battery of Messieurs <hi>de Chev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuse,</hi>
and <hi>de Lesdiguieres,</hi> which a man might also call that of Monsieur
<hi>de Schomberg,</hi> he being almost continually there, wrought a great effect
upon the Bastion of <hi>Dumontier,</hi> so that the breach was thought reasonable
for an assault. But being they would first be very sure of the true condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the place, an Officer was appointed to go and discover. He did
so, but with very little exactness, having seen almost nothing, either
peradventure because he was afraid, or that he did not advance so far as
was necessary to make a full discovery. The distrust they had of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
made them send another, who at his return gave no better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
than the first. The King then resolv'd upon an Assault: he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that the Army should be drawn up in Battaile, and should go on
to the attack, when upon the Hill of <hi>Pillis,</hi> which was his Majesty's Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
they should see him wave a Handkerchief upon the end of his Cane,
which was to be the Signal.</p>
               <p>All things wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ready, and they only staid expecting the Sign; when
Monsieur <hi>de Schomberg,</hi> prompted by I know not what instinct, and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
every thing, told the King, that he did not know, whether it
would not be proper upon this occasion, where his Majesty's honour and
the safety of his Army were in question, to send a third time to discover
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100923:29"/>
the Bastion by some exact person, and of whose report they could have
no reason to doubt, at the same time naming me; thinking he did me a
great deal of honour in exposing me to the utmost peril: The King ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
of the motion, being of opinion, that in such occasions, a great
many people see things but by halves, by reason of the extream danger,
and of the little time they have to look about them. I was call'd for instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and Monsieur <hi>de Schomberg</hi> having acquainted me with the anxiety the
King was in, and the little certainty they had of the true estate of the
place, told me withal, that he had thought fit to name me to his Majesty, and
to propose that I might be sent to discover again, by reason they could
not think themselves sure, till I had made my report. Nevertheless hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a particular affection for me, and knowing very well, that to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
this with the exactness requir'd, I could not choose but expose my
self to very great danger, he thought fit to tell me farther, that though
this affair was of the last importance to the whole Army, he did not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
pretend to engage me in it contrary to my own liking. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
him the same answer that any other man would have done upon
the same occasion, which was, That he did me wrong to doubt of the
joy I was full of upon such occasions, to see my self honour'd with his
esteem, and the good opinion he had of me; that I would go prepare
my self, and that I hop'd to return, and to bring so good an account,
that nothing should be found in my report that was not exactly true.</p>
               <p>Having then put on a Cuirass, and a Cask, with a Pistol hanging at
my girdle, I eat a bit or two, and then set out in the sight of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
and the whole Army, who had their eyes attentively fixt upon
me. Being come to the foot of the breach, I there kneel'd down, and
pray'd behind some Stones that were tumbled down, and afterwards
began to mount, creeping as well as I could upon my belly. Being got
to the top, I had a mind to discover the place in the same posture I had
got up, that is to say lying upon my belly, that I might not be too open,
nor too much expos'd to the Musquet shot, that whisk'd round about me
on every side: but this posture affording me but little advantage of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what might be beyond the Bastion, I started up on a sudden, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
my self to a danger, from which God alone was able to protect
me, I ran to the very brink of it, from whence I discover'd the bottom,
which was a dreadful retrenchment, and in it a Battalion that seem'd to
be of above two thousand men, of which the first ranks were all Pikes,
and the rest Musqueteers. At the very instant that I discover'd my self,
and lookt down, they made so furious a discharge upon me, that I have
ever since lookt upon it as a Miracle that I could escape; and yet of all
these great number of shots, I only reciev'd two upon my arms, which
made but slight impressions, and of which I was not so much as sensible
at that time.</p>
               <p>Assuring my self then that I had seen all, I return'd with all the haste
I could make, only observing an eminence near the Kings Quarter, from
whence I thought I might possibly shew his Majesty himself the retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Enemy. After which I let my self fall, on purpose that I
might rowl down to the bottom, and be more out of danger of the shot:
which made all the Army believe I was kill'd; and Monsieur <hi>de Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>
turn'd his back, that he might not see a thing which gave him a great
and real affliction, accusing himself of being the cause of my death. But
I came off at the expence of a great giddiness only, out of which being
presently recover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, I gave God thanks upon my knees for having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100923:29"/>
me from so great a danger. After which I presently call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to mind
what I had seen, and writ it down in my Table book, being secure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the same Stones I mention'd before, and presently appear'd again,
when every one thought I was dead.</p>
               <p>There may be peradventure some Bravo's, and especially young men,
who will look upon it as a weakness, that in so perilous an occasion I should
rather have recourse to God, than to give my self up to a foolish confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that makes a man run brutishly, and as it were blindfold every
where, where death is most terrible: but in my opinion in occasions of
this kind, where a man hardly discovers any possible means to save both
his honour and his life at once, though he should forget that he was a
Christian; to be a man only is sufficient to make him think of him, who
can take away not only his Life, but even Courage too, from the man
that fancies he has the most. And having been for fifty years together
in as many hazardous occasions as any man perhaps of my time, I can
witness this, that I have seen very many who have made a vanity of no
Religion, as if their impiety ought to pass for a mark of their Valour,
whom I have often found to be rather great Braggadochio's than really
brave, and that if the danger was on the right hand, would turn to the
left; and that would make use of dexterity, where they ought to have
staked down their persons, and by their actions to have made good their
vaunting words.</p>
               <p>XIV. After having in this manner escap'd so great a danger, Monsieur
<hi>de Schomberg,</hi> as much surpriz'd as overjoy'd to see me, made me drink
a glass of Wine, by reason I was almost quite spent, having taken extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
pains; I then made my report to him, which put him into a
very great astonishment; and when he askt me over again, if I was very
sure of what I had told him; I made answer, that I would undertake to
shew it him, and to assure both the King and himself by his own sight,
having taken notice of an eminence from whence one might discover what
I had seen nearer at hand. The King being very impatient to know what
I had discover'd, I got on Horseback, and went with Monsieur <hi>de Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>
to wait upon him at <hi>Piccis.</hi> Being there, and they having much
ado to beleive me, the King would be satisfied by his own eyes, which
made me guide him to the same place I had observ'd, and from thence
with the help of a Perspective, his Majesty plainly discover'd the Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and behind it the Battalion of which I had given him account. He
was very much surpriz'd at it, and could not forbear declaring aloud the
extream peril to which his Souldiers had been expos'd, without this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
of Monsieur <hi>de Schomberg,</hi> which had sav'd the lives of a great many
men. After which his Majesty had the goodness to tell me, that I had
that day done him a very great service, and that he would remember it
upon occasion; I did not nevertheless percieve at that time that I was
much remembred, and was accustomed to serve without any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
than that of honour, which also sometimes cost me very dear.</p>
               <p>I then return<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to find out Monsieur <hi>Zamet,</hi> who having believ'd me
to be dead, cry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d out so soon as he saw me, I protest you shall go no
more upon such designs, and I will take very good order for the future,
that you shall receive no more Commissions of this kind. For in truth,
the thing which nettled him the most, and made him speak after that
manner was, that whether I was upon the Guard or no, they thus us'd to
make me as it were the publick Victim in all perilour occasions. He ask'd
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100923:30"/>
me whether I was not hurt, and I assur'd him I was not, but only that
Monsieur <hi>de Schomberg</hi> had shew'd me two shots upon my Arms.</p>
               <p>XV. The Army upon this was drawn off, and they thought no more
of an assault. Some days after, Monsieur <hi>de Roban</hi> who kept the Field
with a little body of an Army for the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> was resolv'd to come and
relieve <hi>Montaubon.</hi> In order to this design, he gave fifteen hundred
men to a very brave Gentleman call'd <hi>de Beaufort,</hi> to try if he could
put part of them into the place. Upon the intelligence his Majesty had
of their March, he caus'd the Guards to be doubled, and reinforc'd in
his Camp, which notwithstanding could not hinder <hi>Beaufort,</hi> being come
up to his Quarter, from forcing the Guard, and getting into the Town
with eight hundred men, the rest having been either kill'd or fled:
Upon the arrival of these succours they two days after made such furious
Sallies, as very much discourag'd our men, and gave his Majesty occasion
to consider, that Winter drawing on, it was better to retire and preserve
his Army for the next Campaign, by reason he would have lost too many
men after this relief. Thus at the expiration of fifteen days, namely
the first of <hi>November,</hi> 1621, we raised the Siege; order having been
given throughout the Quarters, that upon hearing the first Cannon shot
that should be fir'd that night, every one should be ready with his Arms
to march where their Officers should lead them; and before they went,
to make extraordinary Fires throughout the Camp. This order thus
executed, made the Enemy expect some new thing, and rather a general
assault than the raising of the Siege. Wherefore contenting themselves
with causing their Posts to be well guarded, they never thought of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
out any Troops to fall upon the Rear of our Army, that began
to file off, about the dawning of the day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monsieur</hi> Zamet <hi>who had been cur'd a few days before, was order'd to
make good the retreat, wherein he was not a little astonish'd to see the
precipitation, not to say the flight, wherewith our Troops march'd away.
I being with him, he made me observe this hasty retreat, that savour'd
indeed of a pannick fear, for they made off as if they had seen the Enemy
at their heels. And being so good a Christian, and a man of so much
judgment as he was, he began to speak to me a language I had never heard
before.</hi> I assure you <hi>(said he)</hi> that reflecting upon the Order of Providence
in the management of affairs here below, I manifestly discern, that the God of
Justice is the God of Battels; that he gives the Victory to whom he pleases,
and oftentimes to those that are against him, by reason that they who defend his
cause do it so very ill, and so justly draw upon themselves his indignation by
their own Crimes; that he punishes them by casting the disadvantage on their
side, and filling their Armies with unreasonable terrors. Thus much is plain
upon the present occasion, where our Forces run away without knowing any reason
why. 'Tis visibly a stroke from the hand of our good God, that contrary to all
humane appearances, we have not been able to take this place, which according to the
ordinary course of Arms must have fallen into the King's Possession. His
judgments are very different from those of men which stop at the outside of
events, without penetrating into the secret springs of them. Our Enemies
no doubt will be as much deceived as we; for they will magnify themselves for
this advantage, without ever considering, that the Victory that God gives them
will at length but render them the more unhappy, by a false assurance, that it is
a mark of the Justice of their Cause; and he will at one time or other find
means to make them sensible what loss they sustain, while they flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100923:30"/>
with a thought of winning all. Let us admire then and adore the
Chastisements he inflicts after so different a way, both upon the one and the
other.</p>
               <p>I confess I was marvellously surprized at this discourse, having never,
as I said, been used to hear the like, and acknowledged the obligations I
had to him, for the insight he gave me into so great a truth. And I must
also say, that I did not reckon this favour among the least I received from
him, and have since been sensible, that it was one of the first, God was
pleased to confer upon me, in order to the giving me some sense of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
The virtue and pious conduct that I observed in this great man,
did in some sort contribute to laying the first seeds in the bottom of my
heart, and 'tis that which hath infinitely increased my acknowledgments
to him, and value of his memory; especially, since after abundance of
mistakes and wandrings I had the Grace to know how little to value
the world, and absolutely to renounce it.</p>

               <p>I. THe Siege of <hi>Montauban</hi> being rais'd, the King return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi>
and dismist all his forces into their winter quarters. The Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Picardy</hi> had a little Town of <hi>Guyenne</hi> assign'd for
theirs, call'd <hi>Moutesche,</hi> some seven or eight leagues from <hi>Montauban.</hi>
Monsieur <hi>Le Mareschal de Saint Geran,</hi> who stay'd to give the Orders, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that all the Captains of <hi>Picardy</hi> were gone home to their own houses,
gave me the Regiment in charge, and the government of the place, as
the order was; telling me, that being so near to the Enemy, I ought
to keep good guard, and that he rely'd upon my care. I told him he
might do so, and that I would be responsible to him. Five or six hours
after that the Mareschal <hi>de Saint Geran</hi> had left us, he met a man upon
the Road, who was coming to give him notice, that the Enemy were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
themselves to attack our Town the night following, intending
to take it by assault; and that it was the Garrison of <hi>Montauban</hi> that
was to execute the design. Upon this intelligence, Monsieur <hi>de Saint
Geran</hi> writ me immediately a Ticket, in which he gave me notice of
what he had heard, and advis'd me to take very great care that I might
not be surpriz'd. I hereupon presently assembled all the Officers of the
Garrison, whom I acquainted with the news Monsieur <hi>de Saint Geran</hi> had
sent me, and the Orders he had given; entreating them that we might
all together see which way we should best prepare our selves to receive
the Enemy; telling them withal, that for my part I thought it best
that we should presently take a review of all our Men, of all the Arms,
and of all the Ammunition, of the Gates of the Town, of all without,
and to consider of the means to fortifie the weakest places. They all
approv'd my advice, and we went presently about it.</p>
               <p>II. Towards the evening one of them call'd <hi>Bastillat,</hi> who was an
<hi>Aide Major,</hi> thought fit to come and tell me that I very well knew he
was my Servant and my Friend, and that therefore he was sorry
he was oblig'd to declare that he could not stay with me upon
this occasion, seeing that being <hi>Aide Major,</hi> he was an Officer of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>d' Espernon,</hi> who was Collonel of the Infantry, and that therefore
in this quality he could not obey me, being that I was but Lieutenant
to the <hi>Maistre de Camp,</hi> of whom Monsieur <hi>d' Espernon</hi> would not in the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100923:31"/>
person of his Officers receive Orders. Adding withal, that he was sorry
to find himself constrain'd to leave me in so brave an occasion; but that
rather chusing to retire betimes, than to occasion any trouble, by reason
he could not obey me, he came to take his leave of me, and to bid me
good night. I return'd him answer, That as his Servant and his Friend,
I was also oblig'd to tell him that he was not now at liberty to retire;
neither was it in my power to let him go, after he had receiv'd orders
from Monsieur <hi>de Saint Geran,</hi> as well as the rest; and that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to it as well as they in not going out then: That it was not to
decide the pre-eminence betwixt the Collonels Officers and those of the
<hi>Maistre de Camp,</hi> to obey me upon this occasion, seeing that in this there
was no other thing in question, but to follow the Orders of our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
the Mareschal <hi>de Saint Geran,</hi> who had at his going away committed
to me the care of the Regiment, and the defence of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he place, and yet
more particularly by the Letter he had sent me; and that I had shew'd
him: And that therefore I entreated him to consider that this was not
a time for punctilio's of Honour between Officers, but that here the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
was purely the interest and service of the King, to whom alone
the Town did appertain; and who would be the only loser if we did
not unite in its defence, and make it appear to the whole Kingdom that
we were not unworthy of the commands his Majesty had been pleas'd to
honour us with. This remonstrance, tho very civil and very rational
too, did not however satisfie this Officer, who could not prevail with
himself to hearken to what he was resolv'd he would not do; so that
seeing the stiffness wherewith I oppos'd my self to his design, he again
urg'd the same thing in an accent civil enough; but perceiving me still
to persist in my opposition with the same obstinacy, he resolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to go, and told me with some vehemence flatly, that he would do
it; which oblig'd me to answer him with some heat too, that he should
not do it; and that he ought to believe that I knew very well how to
make my self obey'd, where I was my self to obey the orders of the
King and the General: To which he reply'd in a great fury, that he
could have wisht I had spoke to him after that manner in a place where
I had not been the Master; to which I made answer, that the business
now in question was to look to the defence of the place, and that it
was not fit to mix personal interest with those of the King; and it was
my part in this occasion to command him, and his to obey me. Upon
which he turn'd very angrily from me, and went to his Quarters to
make ready his equipage to be gone.</p>
               <p>In the me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n time I went to find out the Officers who commanded the
guards of the Gates, and gave them express order not to suffer any one
to go out, though it were an Officer; adding, that it was just that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one should partake both the danger and the honour of the service
the King expected from us on so important an occasion. The two Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
who were two Lieutenants, answer'd me after such a manner as as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
me I might rely upon them, and I return'd home. A little after,
<hi>Bastillat,</hi> follow'd by his man, rode to the Gate of the Town, where
being stopt by the Centinel, he call'd the Lieutenant Captain of the
Guard, who told him that he had receiv'd Orders to let no one pass.
What do you not know me? reply'd <hi>Bastillat.</hi> Yes Sir, said he, but my
Orders extend to Officers as well as others, and therefore I beseech you
urge me no more to a thing I cannot grant you. <hi>Bastillat</hi> nettled to
the quick at this repulse, rode back to his Quarters, and from thence
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100923:32"/>
came to speak to me again; but I prevented him, by saying aloud at
the head of the Regiment, Sir, 'tis a thing concluded for this time, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time we will talk of it if you please, but for the present 'tis the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you must obey. Seeing then himself in an inevitable necessity that
he must submit, he told me, that I had a whole Garrison on my side,
and so was the Master, and therefore he would obey me; but that he
would find another time when I should not be so well accompanied. To
which I gave him only this answer, that in the first place we were to
serve the King.</p>
               <p>III. At the same time I commanded him to draw up the Regiment in
Battaile to see if the Companies were compleat; to visit all the Army,
to give out Ammunition to those that wanted, and to acquit himself of
all other duties of his command of Major, and he punctually obey'd.
I then came to view all these things in general, and taking all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Officers along with me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which he also was one, we went all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to visit the advantageous posts we were to defend, and to give
out the necessary Orders, that there might be no confusion nor trouble
in the night. I divided the Regiment into three Bodies, the first and
greatest to be upon the Parade, and thence to send out relief to those
who should stand in need; the second, which was less, was commanded
to guard the Gate of the Town, which I thought was likely to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tackt;
and I again divided that into three, one of thirty men, which I
posted upon a little Van-guard, some fifty paces without the Town;
the second, consisting of a hundred men, were posted in the Town-ditch,
to sustain the first; and the third, which consisted of about as
many, were planted upon the Walls, to defend the second <hi>Corps de
Guard:</hi> The third body, which was the least, was appointed for the
guard of the other Gate, which was not easie to be attackt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did not require so great a defence. After I had plac'd all these
Guards my self, I sent some hours after to have them again visited by
<hi>Bastillat,</hi> who obey'd without any manner of reply, taking great pains,
and shewing himself very zealous in the execution of all the Orders he
receiv'd.</p>
               <p>Night being come, I gave the Word and the Orders to <hi>Bastillat,</hi> to
carry to the Serjeant upon the Parade, telling him that at ten a clock I
would give another, and that therefore he must come to receive it.
Whereupon he told me that it was not an ordinary thing, and that this
gave him occasion to believe that it was peradventure to justle aud pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
him to the utmost, that I proceeded after this manner. I made
answer, that I was not capable of doing so ill a thing: that it was only
for the greater security, and that men could not take too much care
when they expected an Assault; that I was so far from any thought or
intention of disobliging him, that on the contrary I entreated he would
come and sup with me; adding that we must make provision of strength
and vigour for the labour of the night. He thankt me, and said he
would return at ten a clock to receive new Orders. He accordingly
came at the hour, and being very weary with the great pains he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
I desir'd him to lye down and repose himself a little till further
news. For my own part, I went a third time to visit all things, not
thinking it seasonable to sleep, and be at rest, when I had so muth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to expect an Enemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:100923:32"/>
IV. I had caused a Horse to be held ready, that I might ride up and
down to every place at the first Alarm, which was not long before it
came; for about two of the Clock after midnight, the advanc'd Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
at the Gate which I had foreseen would be attackt, heard a noise,
and gave fire. I had notice of it instantly, and having rous'd <hi>Bastillat,</hi>
we went together to the Gate where the Alarm was. I found at my
arrival that the first <hi>Corps de Guard</hi> had made their discharge, and that
they were vigorously attackt by the Enemy. I enter'd into the second,
to which the thirty men of which the first was compos'd came to retire,
fighting all the way they retreated, with very great bravery. I then
caus'd a discharge to be made by thirty Musquets of that <hi>Corps de Guard</hi>
where I was, which a little astonisht the Enemy, who did not expect to
meet any other but the first; yet did they for all that continue to charge
the second <hi>Corps de Guard,</hi> when I commanded thirty more Musqueteers
of the same body to give them another Volley. I sent <hi>Bastillat</hi> at the
same time to the other Gate of the Town, for fear the Enemy should
attack them both at once; and put a Lieutenant in his place, to carry
the Orders, and to bring relief when there should be need.</p>
               <p>This choice that I made of <hi>Bastillat,</hi> in giving him a place of honour
which did not belong to his command, and supplying his by another,
pleas'd him very much, and inspir'd him with other sentiments than he
had entertain'd before of my disposition towards him.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Enemy still continu'd their attack, which was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sustained by our men; but they were soon out of heart, when I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
all the Musqueteers upon the Walls to fire continually; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very well inform'd by this that we were too well prepar'd to receive
them, and knowing that it would be something hard to force men well
resolv'd to defend themselves, they took the wisest course to retire with
the loss of some of their men. The attack being over, I encourag'd,
and highly prais'd the valour of all our men, who had shew'd themselves
equally zealous and obedient in this occasion of honour, wherein they
had fought so generously for the service of their Prince.</p>
               <p>V. The next day <hi>Bastillat</hi> came to tell me, that he hop'd I would not
deny him the liberty of going out of the Town, now that he had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
all I could demand of him. I made answer, that I consented to
it with all my heart, and that I would bear him testimony, as I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
made it appear, in placing him in the honourable post he knew I
had done; that he had behav'd himself with all the vigour and resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a man of honour; and that so I left it to his own disposal to go
out when he pleas'd, after he had done the King the service, from which
he could not honourably have excused himself. After this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> manner he
took his leave, without the least sign of discontent; but going immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
thence to <hi>Cadillac,</hi> to make his complaint to the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi>
where he told him that I had usurpt upon his command, having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
him by force, as Governour and Master of a Town, to obey me,
though he had declar'd to me that he could not do it, having the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to be one of the Collonels Officers, who were not to receive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
from the Officers of the <hi>Maistre de Camp;</hi> and that I had detain'd
him by force in the place, which was to be attackt the next day; that
being he could not help obeying me in this occasion, where his Majesties
service was in question, and where he had not the liberty to do as he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100923:33"/>
would otherwise have done, he was come so soon as he could get out,
to acquit himself of his duty in making his complaint to him, whose ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
alone was therein engag'd, by reason of the priviledges of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
Monsieur <hi>d' Espernon</hi> having only made answer that he would
talk with me about it, sent an express messenger to me to come to him
to <hi>Cadillac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Really I was very much perplext and surpriz'd at this order, suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what the occasion was, and knowing the severity with which Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>d' Espernon</hi> maintain'd the honourable priviledges of his command.
I thought it would be convenient that I should first see Monsieur <hi>le Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal
de Saint Geran,</hi> by whose order I had acted, to have his advice
what I ought to do; and therefore went to wait upon him at <hi>Castel-Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasin</hi>
where he then was, and told him the occasion of my coming. In
good earnest, said he, this is a very scurvy business for you; for though
your action was perfectly right and good, and though therein you have
exactly observ'd the rules of military discipline, yet you will have much
ado to defend your self, being to give an account to Monsieur <hi>d' Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
who is not easie to be satisfy'd in things that respect the least pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilio
of his command. He said moreover, that he apprehended they
would put upon me some affront, and therefore doubted whether or
no I ought to go to <hi>Cadillac.</hi> But Sir, said I, if I do not go, can I se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
my self from his authority? Can I find any way to excuse my self
from giving him an account of what I have done? for if that may be, I
do not stick at not going thither, but being oblig'd in spite of my teeth
to submit to his order; and that he can, by vertue of the authority his
command gives him, cause me to be laid by the heels; I think I should
make my cause worse, or rather of a good cause I should make a very
ill one, should I fail to obey him: for doubtless he would never pardon
me a thing, that he would have some reason to look upon as a great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
done to him by such a simple Officer as I. But if he will hear my
reasons, and when he sees the Order I receiv'd from you, Sir, as my
General, I hope he may be satisfy'd, if any thing can satisfie him. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>le Mareschal de Saint Geran</hi> having heard me speak after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
seem'd to approve of my opinion, and offer'd me to write to the
Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> to assure him that he himself had given me the Order
to command in the Town; but I would not engage him in an affair,
that I was much more willing to end alone; and therefore returning my
thanks after the most civil manner I could, I told him that I had kept
his Letter, which being the Order I had receiv'd from my General, would
amply justifie me in what I had done.</p>
               <p>I took my leave, and went to <hi>Cadillac</hi> about the time that the Duke
of <hi>Espernon</hi> was going to dinner; when having sent him word, that I
desir'd to kiss his hands, he gave order to have me brought into the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
where he was with above thirty Gentlemen with him. So soon as
he saw me make him a profound reverence, he presently turn'd his back
towards me, and talking to a Gentleman, left me, without giving me
one word. He askt all the rest that were present to wash, and sit down
to Table with him; but as for me, he was not pleas'd to shew me the
least civility, and us'd me no otherwise than he would have done a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-man.
'Tis true, I found my self wounded to the last degree with
this affront, which I receiv'd so publickly, for having serv'd the King,
and perform'd the duty of my command; but I saw no remedy, having
to do with a man that has been known throughout the Kingdom for the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100923:33"/>
most imperious that ever came into the world; and knowing of old,
that it had been his custom to use all Officers at this rate, by whom he
conceived he had been any ways injur'd. Wherefore thinking of nothing
at that time but how I might justifie my self, which was the only end of
my Journey, and not seeing how I could do it without speaking to him,
I addrest my self to one of my friends, who had great access to him,
which was <hi>le Commandeur de la Hiliere,</hi> and having acquainted him with
the occasion of my coming, entreated him to assist me to get out of this
scurvy affair, in obtaining me the audience that was necessary for my ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification:
And thus matters stood for that day.</p>
               <p>VI. In the mean time the Commander spoke to the Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
as he had promis'd me he would, and did it with so much zea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and
friendship, that he obtain'd his request. So that the next day Monsieur
<hi>d' Espernon</hi> bid him go fetch his friend, telling him that he would hear
what I had to say. So soon as I was enter'd the room, and had saluted
him, I told him that I was come in obedience to his command; that I
very well perceiv'd Monsieur <hi>de Bastillat</hi> had done me an ill office
to him, and that I could not doubt but he had sent for me upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
that this Officer might have made of me, about something had past
at <hi>Moutesche;</hi> but that I hop'd, that after his Lordship had done me the
favour to hear me, and that I had given him a true and sincere account
of the affair, he would not condemn me; that I assur'd him at least be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand,
that I was come resolv'd to submit to whatever it should please
him as my Judge to impose upon me, if I did not make my innocence
appear. I then gave him an account of the command the <hi>Mareschal de
Saint Geran</hi> had given me by word of mouth, to give all the Orders in
the place, and in the Regiment. I shew'd him the Order in writing he had
afterwards sent me, wherein he gave me warning to prepare my self well to
defend the Town against the Enemy, who were resolv'd to attack it. He
took and read it, and seeming satisfy'd, gave me very well to understand
that he had already chang'd his humour as concerning me. I continu'd my
justification in telling him, that I had read the order to all the Officers,
that Monsieur <hi>de Bastillat</hi> had heard it, and submitted to it, as well as
the rest, without any manner of opposition; that it was true he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
came to me in the evening, and made some difficulty, telling me
that he was afraid of doing a prejudice to the authority of the Collonel,
should he obey an Officer of the <hi>Maistre de Camp;</hi> but that I had made
him answer, that I did not pretend to violate it in any sort, seeing it
was not in the quality of an Officer to the <hi>Maistre de Camp,</hi> that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to command an Officer of the Collonel; but in the quality of
Governour, and as appointed by the General to command in that place;
and that I had declar'd to him at the head of the Regiment, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did I pretend that this occasion should be drawn into a precedent
upon the account of this dispute, nor that I ought to draw from thence
any particular advantage to my self. That having thus secur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Colonel, I thought my self oblig'd at the same time to look
after the Kings Interest, in making those obey me receiv'd his Pay, in an
occasion where the defence of one of his Majesties Forts was in question:
that I had given a very ill example to all the Garrison, in suffering an
Officer to go out, who askt leave to do it, upon a false pretence, in a
time when it could not be; that it manifested that I understood
little of my business, had render'd me unworthy of my command, to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100923:34"/>
have suffer'd my self to have been surpriz'd by so poor an argument:
that therefore, seeing the Kings service and my own duty only concern'd
in the thing, without the Collonels honour being any way engaged in it,
I believ'd that I could not do less: That his Lordship himself would
without doubt have been the first to have blam'd me if I had done it;
and therefore I was bold to beg of him the justice that was my due, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting
my innocence against so ill grounded an accusation; and that I
consented with all my heart, to call all the Officers of the Regiment, and
even Monsieur <hi>de Bastillat</hi> himself, to witness the truth of what I said;
who knew very well, that after the provoking language he had given
me, I forbore not for all that to give him a post of honour which was not
his due, in intrusting him with the guard of one of the Gates of the City. The
Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> very much surpriz'd at this discourse, made answer
that things had been much otherwise represented to him; that having
carry'd my self after this manner, instead of blaming, he very much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
me, for having acquitted my self of my duty: that he saw by
that, I understood my command much better than <hi>Bastillat</hi> did his: That
it was want of understanding to bring the honour and authority of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
in question, in a thing where they were no way concern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d; and
that he would rattle him, to teach him to instruct himself better in the
right of his command, and not to fall any more into such mistakes.</p>
               <p>This answer, so differing from the ordinary language of the Duke of
<hi>Espernon,</hi> was follow'd by the effect; for having bid me go and take
a turn in the Garden, he sent for Monsieur <hi>Bastillat,</hi> with whom he
talkt so much more roughly about this affair, as he was sensibly nettled,
to see himself by his fault thus to blame to a simple Officer. And after
having been assur'd from his own mouth of the truth of all things, which
he durst not deny, and having reproacht him, that he by his ill conduct
had been the cause that his Collonel had receiv'd an affront upon account
of the first Regiment of <hi>France.</hi> He would not let him stay dinner,
whereas he made me sit down with great kindness, using me with as
great civility then, as he had roughly repulst me the day before. So soon
as we were risen from Table, he sent for him up, where he told him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the company, that he ought to have taken the action which he
would have made a crime, after another manner than he had done; that
the knowledge I had of the rights of the Collonel, and of my own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
had taught me to distinguish the truth from appearance, and how
to maintain my own right, without intrenching upon that of others;
that the very obliging manner which he himself confest I had proceeded
in respect to him, ought to have made him judge more favourably of
my intentions; that he could not possibly take any thing ill at my hands,
and that he charg'd him to be my friend as before, entreating us to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace,
which we immediately did. This being done, having begg'd
Monsieur <hi>d' Espernon</hi>'s order to return to the Regiment, that I had much
ado to leave, being intrusted with the care of it as I was, I took my
leave, after having receiv'd particular marks of his being very well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
with me, as he himself openly declar'd.</p>
               <p>VII. The year following, which was the year 1622, the King did not
go into <hi>Guyenne,</hi> and only sent thither Messieurs <hi>d' Elbeuf</hi> and <hi>de The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>
to command the Army, which consisted of about twelve thousand
men; the Prince who commanded the rest of the forces, staying about
the person of the King. The Rendezvous for the Army was the Plain
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100923:34"/>
of <hi>Marmande,</hi> from whence we went to sit down before <hi>Tonins,</hi> which
was a little, but strong place, held by the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and of which Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Monpouillan,</hi> Son to the Marquis <hi>de la Force,</hi> and a very gallant
man, was Governour. The Generals order'd three Attacks, of which
each of them commanded one, and the third, which was on that side by
the River, was commanded by Monsieur <hi>de Pontague,</hi> who was <hi>Maistre
de Camp.</hi> The Regiment of <hi>Picardy</hi> was of the Attack of Monsieur <hi>le Duc
d' Elbeuf,</hi> who had the brave <hi>Vignoles</hi> for his <hi>Mareschal de Camp.</hi> The
Trench being open'd, the Enemy began every day to make great Sallies,
particularly on that side where they had a Half-Moon of great advantage
to them, by reason that it very much favour'd their retreat; and these
frequent Sallies thus made with so much advantage, extreamly incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Besiegers, and made us lose a great many men. The Generals
therefore resolv'd to attack this Half-Moon at any rate, tho they knew
it could not be done but with great loss: and only stay'd till the next
day, when the Regiments of <hi>Picardy</hi> and <hi>Navarre,</hi> that always marcht
together, were to mount the Guard.</p>
               <p>Monsieur <hi>de Vignoles,</hi> to whom I had the honour to be particularly
known, had a design to make use of me in this occasion; and not having
found me where he came to give order about this attack, he came to
seek me in my Tent, where I had stay'd behind sick. He askt me what
was the matter with me? when having told him my indisposition, he
knew so well how to excite me in point of honour, and engag'd me after
so obliging a manner to share in the glory of the attack they were resolv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
to make upon this Half-moon the night following, that I could not handsomly
excuse my self. For he assur'd me that the Duke <hi>d' Elbeuf</hi> had made
choice of me to lead on the men to this assault, and absolutely rely'd
upon me; to which he added, that this enterprize being of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
importance, he hop'd I would do all I possibly could to be there;
and that in the mean time he would send me a Quilt into the Trench,
whereon to take some repose till the hour of execution. I made answer
that I was very ill of an Ague, but that since Monsieur <hi>d' Elbeuf</hi> and he
commanded me, I would do the utmost I was able to come. Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come, Orders were given for the attack, which was to begin on
both sides at once. The first, which was on the right hand, fell to my
share; and the other, which was on the left, to an Officer of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Navarre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Half-moon being not fortify'd as such places us'd to be, and the
Parapet which was wont to be made with Earth, being only of Cask,
which the Cannon had several times beaten down, but that had been
still repair'd, I saw very well that we could not gain it, but by entring
by force of arms. Wherefore, having taken my measures about this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
after that I had lined the Trench with good Musqueteers, that fir'd
very thick, I went with fifty Halberdeers to hook the Casks towards us, and
pull them down. The Enemy at the same instant making use of the
same artifice, hookt them also on their side with other Halberts, by
which means each side pulling thus towards them, we could not pull
them down; when I bethought me, seeing the Enemy pull with all their
force, to hinder us from overturning these Barrels; to make use of them
themselves, and of their own resistance, to make them do that which
they did by no means intend. I therefore made all our Halberdeers on
a sudden leave pulling against them, and instead of drawing the Casks
towards us as before, they on the contrary pusht them the other way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:100923:35"/>
and did it with so much violence, that they were immediately over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
upon the Enemy, of which some were overwhelm'd with them.
So soon as we had by this means made a breach, we mounted, and by
dint of Halberts, made our selves Masters of the Half-moon, and also of
the person of Monsieur <hi>de Monpouillan,</hi> who being come into this place,
without knowing any thing of the attack, found himself engag'd in the
Fight; and trapt under one of the Barrels that fell upon him, and from
which he cou'd not disengage himself, till I got to him, and took him
Prisoner.</p>
               <p>But our first good fortune was soon follow'd by a misfortune, and a strange
reverse; for as we all held our selves very well as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ur'd of the success of
our Enterprize, above six hundred men being sally'd out of the Town, came
all on a sudden to fall upon us, and gave us so brisk a charge, that we were
constrained to abandon what we had already taken, and to retreat with
all the speed we could, without being able so much as to take our Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
along with us: for the Officer of <hi>Navarre</hi> who commanded the other
attack, having fail'd to enter on his side, as we had done on ours, we
found our selves too few to withstand so great a number of men. And
yet the advantage we had got so far astonish'd the Enemy, that after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
seen themselves thus forc'd, fearing they might be so again, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
overthrew all that remained of the Half-moon, that might have
done them a great deal of mischief if taken from them; and absolutely
quitted that Post.</p>
               <p>VIII. I was commanded a few days after, to go discover a kind of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
Bastion, and separate from the Town, that had been very much
batter'd by our Cannon, and that did us a great deal of mischief. No
body at that time appear'd in it, and we thought we might have possest it
with great ease, which made me go to it, as to a post that was as good
as quitted: but so soon as ever I was got up, and that I went to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the place, I felt my self struck with a great blow of a Scyth that was
laid upon me, and that gave me a cut on the left shoulder of half a foot
long. I was as much surpriz'd as stun'd with so unexpected a blow: but
by good luck having a very good Buff-Coat, the Coat was only cut,
and having born all the force of the blow it sav'd my life, and my shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from being cut off, since so much force had not been requir'd to
the cutting off that, as to the cutting of the Buff; and this blow I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciev'd
from a little <hi>Corps de Guard</hi> of Eighteen or Twenty men, that were
cover'd and retrench'd in this post. Upon the report I made to the
Generals, they concluded to force the Bastion, but the frequent Sallies
the Enemy made almost every night, gave them not leisure to do it; and
they reciev'd in the mean time a dispatch from Court, wherein they had
word sent, that the King was very impatient of the length of the Siege,
of which he laid the whole fault upon them; and that he would send the
Prince to command there. This news nettled them all to the quick, so
that from that time forward they resolv'd no more to observe any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
nor to make the best of any thing; but either to perish, together
with the whole Army, or to carry the place before the Prince should come
up to them. They accordingly assaulted the Bastion, which they took;
but when they thought to lodge themselves in the ditch, they had word
brought, that the Enemy had that very night shipt six hundred men in
Boats, which were slipt down the River without being perceiv'd by the
<hi>Corps de Guard,</hi> which had been posted to stop their way. Thus were
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100923:35"/>
they forc'd to content themselves, with keeping what they had already
got, till the succours that Monsieur <hi>de Parabelle,</hi> Governour of <hi>Poitou,</hi>
had promis'd, upon the news of the Enemies approach, who were march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the conduct of Monsieur <hi>de la Force,</hi> should come up to them.</p>
               <p>IX. The Generals having had notice, that the besieged were preparing
to make a great Sally, and to make use of the advantage they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved,
by the relief of six hundred men that were got into the Town;
redoubled their Guards, and made ready to receive them; I crawl'd as
well as I was able to my post, though some days before I had received a
Musket-shot in my Thigh, and was not yet cur'd; for it was not fit, when
every body else prepar'd to fight, to lye at ease at home, and a man
easily forgets his infirmities in these occasions, wherein one finds one's self,
as it were, animated with a new vigour. Being then advanc'd towards a quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Half-moon, that look'd into the Town, I got up to it, and there saw
by the light of the Moon, a great many men hurrying up and down in
great haste, by which I was assur'd that they were preparing far a Sally:
Some Officers of my Companions, who had follow'd me saw the same,
which made us return in all diligence to give notice of it to the Generals,
and to all the <hi>Corps de Guard.</hi> About two hours after midnight they gave
a Faulcon shot from the Town, for the signal; and the Enemy at the
instant sallied out of the Town in so great numbers, that instead of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking
the head of the Trench, as men commonly do; they assaulted
it by the Flanks and the Tail, and struck so great a terror into all the
Guards, though prepar'd, that they overturn'd all our people one upon
another. The Regiment of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> which lay a little on one side
behind us, having given way, was beaten back upon my <hi>Corps de Guard;</hi>
and forc'd me to retire after the best manner I could with part of my
men, not being able no more than others, to stand firm against so many
victorious People. I had a mind to have rallied with a Captain of our
Regiment, a very brave man, called <hi>Bonneuil,</hi> whose lodgment was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
even to the Graffe of the Town, and that had made a little pair of
steps of Wood, by which he might easily recover the top; but being he
had neglected to take the advice I had given him, to keep a Centinel
always there, to watch the Souldiers from stealing away the steps to burn,
I found him dead, together with most of his men; that having befallen
him which I had foretold, he not having been able to retire when he
wou'd, by those steps which he found pull'd to pieces, by reason that the
Souldiers had carried away most of the Wood to make fires; which by
the way may make it appear, that though it be commonly said, that some
men are more fortunate than others; it may nevertheless often be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the little foresight of the unfortunate sort, that sometimes neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
means as easie as important to their preservation.</p>
               <p>The Enemy after having thus clear'd the Trench with all the lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
there posted themselves, with a design to ruin it; at which the
Duke <hi>d' Elbeuf</hi> being enraged, resolv'd to perish or to drive them thence,
and indeavouring to inspire the Regiments with the same resolution, who
had thus lost their Posts, What Gentleman, said he, has the Enemy thus
beaten us from our Posts, and taken from us in one night what we have
been so long in gaining; and cannot we do in open day, as much as they
have done by night? For my own part I am resolv'd to drive them out, as
quickly as they have driven us, or to lose my life; and will take no longer
time than 'tis to noon to do it in; and I doubt not but every one will
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100923:36"/>
follow me, since every one is engaged in honor as well as I, and ought
to be asham'd to outlive such an affront. Therefore Gentlemen, I have
no other Order to give but this, that noon being come every one make
to his Post, either to regain it or there to die. This short Speech did so
rouze their Spirits, and animated every one to that degree, that seeing
themselves inevitably dishonour'd if they did not follow their General,
and bravely second his design; they effectually did it with so extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
vigour and resolution; that in spite of the Enemies resistance which
was very great, they recover'd all their Posts, and before night restor'd the
Trenches and Works into the same condition that they were before.</p>
               <p>X. During these vigorous attacks and defences, Mousieur <hi>de Parabelle</hi>
with six hundred Gentlemen arriv'd in the Camp, and Monsieur <hi>de la
Force</hi> approach'd also within two or three Leagues of the Town with four
thousand men. A Souldier returning late from forrage, discover'd the
Enemy within half a league of the Camp. He gave notice of it, and
immediately the body of the Army was commanded to that side; part
of the Guard of the Trench was drawn off, and there was only left the old
Regiments in which most confidence was repos'd. The Enemy, either
advertiz'd of the thing, or having foreseen it, took this time to attack
the guard of the Trench, with so much more advantage as it was so
much weaker, and withal made the most furious Sally, that ever had
been made till then. I was attackt at the post where I was, by an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
who commanded about fifty men, all arm'd from head to foot; he
came directly up to me with a Tuck he had in his hand, with which he gave
me a thrust, that he run me through and through; and did it at the same mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that I fir'd a Pistol, which taking the default of his Arms, broke his
Thigh, and made him fall backwards, without leaving his Sword never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
which he drew out of my body. The Souldiers that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
this Officer were so frighted to see him fall, that, victorious as they
were, they retir'd above fifty paces; which gave me leisure, not falling
with the thrust, as great as it was, to crawl along as well as I could, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by a brave Souldier call'd <hi>Mutonis,</hi> to try to get to the bank of
the River, which being of difficult access, by reason of a very steep de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent,
that I must go down to arrive at, as it might secure me and save me
from being taken; creeping thus and leaning upon my poor Souldier,
a new misfortune befel us, that had like to have put us both into despair;
which was a Musket shot, that <hi>Mutonis</hi> receiv'd in his arm. He had then
almost as much need of help as I, and really it was a very sad sight, to see
two men so cover'd over with their own blood, and both maim'd to
have no other help, but that of one another. For my own part, sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my self with one hand upon that arm of this Souldier, that was not
broken, I with the other stopt the fore part of my wound, from whence
issued a great deal of blood.</p>
               <p>It will doubtless appear incredible, how, in the condition we then were,
we could attempt to recover the bank of the River, to which I have
described the access to be so difficult, even to sound and vigorous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
But what will not the love of liberty and life make men do? And
why should it be a wonder, that God, who determin'd to do us both,
without comparison, much greater graces, should bring us off from this,
as well as several other dangers, to guide us to the place he had prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin'd,
after long wandrings and very crooked ways; For he at last with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
this poor Fellow, as well as my self from the Army, and inspir'd
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100923:36"/>
him to embrace a private and altogether christian life, where he medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
nothing but his Salvation; in the prospect whereof he desired to
become a <hi>Chartreux,</hi> tho they would not admit him by reason of his arm,
that he remain'd lame of his Musquet shot.</p>
               <p>Being then reduc'd to the inevitable necessity, either to be knockt
o'th' head by the Enemy, or beaten to pieces by the fall we were to
have in rowling from the top of the hill to the bottom, because we
could not go down upright in the condition we were, after having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
which of the two we should choose, we resolv'd at last rather to
give our selves up into the hands of God, than to fall into those of men.
Thus having recommended our selves to his holy protection, we let our
selves tumble from the top of this Hill to the bottom (and (God visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly assisting us)
the thing being humanely impossible, we got up, and by
the help of one another march'd as before to recover our Quarters. In
the way, which was all along by the River side, we found an Officer
of our Regiment very much wounded, called <hi>L' Anglade;</hi> and presently
another called <hi>Miranne</hi> of the same Regiment, who seeing me cry'd out,
Monsieur <hi>de Pontis</hi> I am dying, have pity on me. To whom I made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
I am dying my self too, my poor Friend, and stand in as much
need of help as any one; but where are you hurt? To which having
reply'd, that he knew not where, but that he was about to expire; I
thought that being arm'd it might peradventure be his arms, that stifled
him; so taking his Sword from his side, as well as I cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, I cut the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of his arms, and let them fall off him, which I had no sooner done,
but that he began to breathe at liberty, and to come to himself; for he
was so squeez'd in these arms, being fall'n upon them in coming down the
Hill, that they stifled him; and thus God gave me yet strength enough
to save this Officers life, when I was in as much danger of losing my own.</p>
               <p>Being at last arrived at the Camp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we were carried to <hi>Marmande,</hi>
where some of the Enemies Souldiers that had been taken Prisoners, and
who belike had been present at the occasion where I had been wounded,
told me that the Officer with whom I had had to do, was at least as ill as I,
having his Thigh-bone broke, and that his name was <hi>Feron.</hi> This news
did surprize and afflict me at once, because he was my intimate Friend,
and that we had formerly been Comrades together in the Guards. I had
not known him in the fight, but immediately sent a Drum to inquire how
he did, and to let him know how sorry I was to have encounter'd him.
<hi>Feron</hi> was no less surpriz'd than I, to understand that I was the man to
whom he had given so desperate a thrust; and having return'd an answer
with the same sentiments of civility and grief, concerning what had befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
me, he sent the next day also to enquire how I did; and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
the same kindness on both sides, so long as we were near another,
which linck'd us faster than before, and encreas'd our old Friendships,
which we have preserv'd to this day. From <hi>Marmande</hi> I was afterwards
remov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to <hi>Toulouse,</hi> where I verily thought I should dye, as well of my
Wound, as of a burning Feaver that was added to it. I requested and
received all the Sacraments, and being willing to reward two Servants
that I had, I bid them divide my Cabinets betwixt them so soon as I was
dead. These Fellows were both of them so good natur'd, and had so
great an affection for me, that the prospect of so considerable a gain,
could not comfort them for the much greater loss they conceiv'd they
shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d undergo in losing me. And indeed they were overjoy'd, when
the fourth day of my Feaver I had a Crisis, that seem'd at first to threaten
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100923:37"/>
my death, but that turn'd to my cure; for in few days I was cur'd of
my Feaver, but not of my Wound, which was above six months in
closing, so as that I could march, and that was not wholly heal'd till some
years after.</p>
               <p>XI. Being come to <hi>Rabastins,</hi> which was the winter quarters, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a Letter from Monsieur <hi>Zamet,</hi> wherein he sent me word, that
being it was the Kings pleasure to have him nearer his person, he was
oblig'd to put off his Regiment, and was now in treaty with Monsieur
<hi>de Liancour</hi> about it; that this news, which peradventure might surprize
me, ought not nevertheless to afflict me, seeing that changing his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
he did not alter his disposition towards me; and that he should
be in a better condition to serve me, being nearer the King, from whom
I was to expect the reward of my services.</p>
               <p>I must confess, that this Letter was to me a more violent and more
sensible blow, than that of which I was so lately cur'd. The excess of
grief I felt put me in as great danger of death; and I could not see,
without being afflicted beyond measure, that the person to whom I had
so particularly united my self, and for whom I voluntarily quitted a
Company in the Regiment of <hi>Champagne,</hi> and was moreover ready to
abandon all I had in the world, should divest himself of the Regiment
that united us, and kept us together, during the whole Campaign; for
I very well foresaw, that I remaining in this body, and Monsieur <hi>Zamet</hi>
being with the King, I could no more have the happiness of possessing
him as before. And he also very well foreseeing how averse I would be
to this business, would not write me word of it, till first the business
was concluded with Monsieur <hi>de Liancour,</hi> into whom he endeavour'd to
inspire the same sentiments of esteem and friendship for me, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had. The answer I return'd him in the height of my grief was, that
seeing he quitted the Regiment, I entreated that he would give me leave
to quit it too, to follow him in all places wherever he went, having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
to him both my person and my life. But he writ back presently
again, with great earnestness to entreat me to continue in my Command,
protesting that I should oblige him more, and should manifest my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to him better if I stay'd in the Regiment, than if I should come to
him. Adding withal, that it was not yet time, but when that time
should come, he would not fail to advertize me, that this outward sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
would not hinder us from being as much united as before; and
that he hop'd it would not be long before he should see me again.</p>
               <p>This Letter gave me some comfort, tho I was extremely afflicted, when
I consider'd that I was no more Lieutenant to him, for whom I had quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all. In the bargain that Monsieur <hi>Zamet</hi> made with Monsieur <hi>de
Liancour,</hi> he made me share, without my dreaming of any such thing;
in the quitting of his Command having told him, that he did not part
with his Regiment to him for two and twenty thousand Crowns, but
upon condition that he should over and above give a thousand more to
his Lieutenant. And accordingly I receiv'd the said summ of Monsieur
<hi>de Liancour;</hi> who being come to <hi>Rabastins</hi> to take possession of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment,
gave me great testimonies of kindness, nay more, of friendship
and confidence; assuring me, that if I did not find in him all the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Monsieur <hi>Zamet,</hi> I might at least expect a true and perfect friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
entreating me to proceed with him upon this promise; and added,
that being he could not at present give a more manifest proof of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100923:37"/>
trust he reposed in me, he desir'd I would assist him in his initiations;
where he confest he had need by the experience of others to supply the
defect of his own. He could not possibly have proceeded after a more
civil and obliging fashion, and I reply'd with all the submission
and acknowledgment that was due to so obliging a complement.</p>
               <p>The first Siege of this Campaign was a little Town call'd <hi>Sainte Foy,</hi>
which was carried by assault; and where Monsieur <hi>de Liancour</hi> did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in his own person, having first leapt a great Ditch, where many
others were left behind, who could not leap it as he did. This young
Lord was extreamly brave, and manifested an extraordinary Courage,
but being he had never before commanded at the head of a Regiment,
and that I saw him advance too far, I did what I could to restrain him;
but his Courage would carry it against me, and forc'd him on.</p>
               <p>After the taking of <hi>Sainte Foy,</hi> the Army marcht directly to <hi>Saint An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonin,</hi>
where the King would himself be in person. This Town was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tackt
without Trenches, and we presently came to handy blows, which
occasion'd a furious fight, for the Besieged defended themselves with great
vigour. Our Regiment was not commanded on upon the attack, being
reserved to attend the Enemies relief, which was said to be near at
hand, but that however never appear'd, so the Town was taken: There
it was that Monsieur <hi>de Saint Preuil</hi> was receiv'd Collonel Ensign of the
Regiment of <hi>Picardy;</hi> he, whom his fortune and misfortune have since
rendred famous enough. I contracted so great a Friendship with him,
that we did always eat together, and had but one Bed, and I can ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
say,
that I at that time stood him in the stead of a Brother, and a
true Friend.</p>
               <p>XII. The King came afterward with all his Army before <hi>Negrepelice,</hi>
having longingly desired for above a year, to see himself once in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to punish, as he did, the barbarous and inhumane treachery, that
this Town had exercised upon four hundred men of the Regiment of
<hi>Vaillac,</hi> that had been there plac'd in Garrison the Winter before; all
whose Throats the Inhabitants had cut in one night. This Prince, from the
first moment that he receiv'd the news, had openly declar'd, that he would
chastise them all after the same manner, and would not pardon any one
of them whatever. So that the year following, after he had taken the
two or three fore-nam'd little places, he came before this. He had, for
Lieutenant Generals of his Army, Monsieur <hi>le Prince,</hi> Monsieur <hi>d' An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goulesme,</hi>
and Messieurs <hi>de Themines</hi> and <hi>de Saint Geran.</hi> The King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in person order'd all the Quarters, and the Attacks, which he caus'd
to be given to the two extremities of the Town; it not being his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
that they should lose time in discovering it, nor in opening Trenches,
but that they should go on directly to the Assault, without giving them
leisure to look about them; both because the Town was not so strong
that Trenches were absolutely necessary, and that, on the other side,
the impatience he was in to punish them according to their desert, did
not permit him to go a longer, tho a safer way to work.</p>
               <p>The Army, drawn up in Battaile, was put into two divisions, for the
two Attacks; and all things being in a readiness, the Generals sent me
to the King about noon to receive the last Orders, which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
should be taken from his own mouth before the Assault. I found
him in a paltry thatcht Cottage, where a man was almost choakt in the
smoak, and where he was constrain'd to shut himself up, because he found
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100923:38"/>
himself indispos'd: Having told him, that the Lieutenant Generals had
sent me to assure his Majesty that all things were in order, as he had
commanded, and that they waited for his last order; This is it, said he,
that they attack the Town, as I said, at both ends of it; and that you
are all of you to have some white thing ty'd in your Hatbands, lest meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Town you should kill one another: For I charge you that
you give no quarter to any one whatever, because they have provok'd
me to the last degree, and deserve to be us'd as they have handled others.
I return'd to carry back this Order, and every one having ty'd a Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief
in his Hat, the assault was given; which continued some hours,
in disputing the Out-works, and the entrance into the Gate, which they
defended very bravely, fighting with extraordinary valour. But at last
they were forc'd on both sides, and retir'd fighting into a corner of the
City, where they call'd out for Quarter, which being deny'd them, they
cry'd out, Well, we must dye, but we will dye like men of honour, and sell our
lives very dear. In effect, they maintain'd the fight with so much obstinacy,
that they kill'd a great many of our men, and defended themselves to the
last man, not parting with their Arms, till they parted with their Lives. And
this example ought methinks to moderate a little the just indignation of
Princes upon these occasions, where tho they might reasonably incline
to punish many guilty persons, yet they might at least pardon some few,
if but to spare many faithful Souldiers, who are thus knockt o'th' head
by Rebels.</p>
               <p>At the end of this slaughter, the Souldiers sell to plundering, and to
catching up all the women they could meet; when I, being at the head
of the Regiment, saw a most beautiful Virgin, of about seventeen or
eighteen years of age, come running in great haste out of a house that
had not yet been enter'd, and throwing her self at my feet, entreated
that I would save her honour and her life: I gave her my word so to do,
assuring her, that I would sooner lose my own life, than to suffer that
either the one or the other should be taken from her. To this end I
would have had her guarded by me by four or five Souldiers, but she
thought she was not fafe unless she held me by the skirt of the Doublet.
In this posture I walkt her through the Town, where she was seen by
part of the Officers of the Army, of which some were so insolent as to
dare to demand her; others importun'd me to deliver her into
their hands, which inforc'd me to come to high words with them; chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
rather to have them for my enemies, than to betray my word, and
the justice I conceiv'd was due to a v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rtuous Maid, who had importun'd
my protection. I conducted her after this manner to my Hutt. Her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
were of the best of the Town, whereof her Father was Minister;
and it fell out, by the greatest good fortune in the world for them, that
they were that day at a house they had in the Country, having left their
Daughter in the Town to look to the house. Seeing my self importun'd
afresh by the sollicitations of several persons, some whereof boasted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be the principal men of the Army, I consider'd of all possible
means to conceal her, till I could restore her into her Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
hands, that both they and I might be deliver'd from the fear of
the continual danger to which she was expos'd. But seeing this could
not easily be done in a Camp, where there was nothing but Hutts, and
where I knew there was so little fidelity, I bethought me at last of as odd
a way as can possibly be imagin'd, and that may seem incredible to many.
The best places to hide ones self in being sometimes not the most private
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100923:38"/>
corners, but those which are least suspected by being most in sight; I
conceiv'd that a great Heifer, which I had caus'd to be kill'd the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and which was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et hanging entire from the top to the bottom of
my Hutt, might very well serve my purpose. I therefore turn'd the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
side towards the wall, and put my Prisoner into the body of the
Beast, to try if she might there stand unseen. The thing succeeded mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellously
well, for the fear of so imminent a danger assisting to make her
fit herself to that little room, which was the only place where she could
be safe; did there so lessen and contract her self, that she was not to be
seen at all. I therefore told this young maid, that so oft as she heard any
one knock at the door, she should run and hide her self there, that she
might not be too m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch incommodated by being always there. And it
happen'd, almost as soon as I had tryed this invention, that some General
Officers, under colour of visiting the Camp, came to knock at my Hutt.
So soon as they were come in, they acquainted me with the true reason
of their coming, and importun'd me to let them see her, who fell into
my hands; but I answer'd them with so great freedom, having given
them leave to look round my Hutt, where they saw nothing but the Heifer
hanging up by the heels; that they went away very well satisfied that
she was no longer in my custody. It would be to no purpose to speak of
all the rest, who as confidently swallow'd the banter, and who after having
been there, return'd seeing nothing but the Heifer hanging in the roof.</p>
               <p>But the affair went further, and being come to the King's ear, he sent
for me to him. Being assur'd of my Servants, whose affection and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
were sufficiently known to me, I entrusted them with the Guard of
my Prisoner, giving them charge to be always without the door of my
Hutt, to tell every body, that I was gone abroad, and to hinder any one
whoever from entering in. So soon as I came into the King's presence,
he askt me if what he had heard, that I had a very beautiful Maid in my
custody was true. Whereupon I who had never conceal'd any thing
from my Prince, gave him a true account of the whole business, as all
things had past, to the very moment that I came from my Hutt. At
which the King looking me full in the face, said to me; And hast thou
honestly kept thy word? I then swore to him in the presence of God, and
his Majesty, that I had: Upon which the King said to me again; I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
pleas'd with thee for it, and esteem thee a hundred times the
more; finish what thou hast so well begun, for it is one of the worthiest
actions thou canst ever do whil'st thou liv'st, and that I shall look upon
as one of the best services thou hast ever done me. If any one shall by
chance discover her, and sollicit thee to have her, tell him the Order thou
hast receiv'd from me to preserve her, and that 'tis I my self who have
given thee charge of her. I then entreated his Majesty, that he would
per mit me to send a Drum to her Father, who liv'd four or five Leagues
from the Camp, that I might restore her to him so soon as I could. This
Request, which justified the sincerity wherewith I acted, mightily pleas'd
the King, who told me, that he gave me leave so to do with all his heart;
and that I could not do better.</p>
               <p>I took my leave of his Majesty, and making haste to return to my Hutt,
where I found all things well, I advis'd the Maid to write a Letter to her
Father, therein to send him word, that he should come fetch her at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
place I nam'd to her, and to assure him, that the Drum, who brought
him the Letter, should safely conduct him to the place, where she and I
would not fail to be. She accordingly writ the Letter, which contain'd
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100923:39"/>
in few words, what I had dictated to her, leaving it to her at their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to tell him by word of mouth the whole Story of the state wherein
she had been, and from which I had redeem'd her. The Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
receiv'd this news with such joy, as one may better conceive than
express; and were soon at the appointed place, where I exactly met them
with their Daughter; and where, delivering her into their hands, I
protested to them that I had preserv'd her at the peril of my own life,
as if she had been my own Child; assuring them withal, that I thought
my self very happy, that God had given me the opportunity of rescuing
a young Virgin from so inevitable a danger. They would acknowledge
this favour, and made me an offer of all that ever they had in recompence
of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> precious present I made them, in restoring their Daughter, whom
they gave for lost. But I contented my self with their friendship, telling
them that I thought my self over rewarded in having sav'd their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
honour. But I was not yet got back to my Hutt, when I saw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
two Horses that came after me laden with Fowl and other sorts of
provision. The man that brought them told me that his Master sent them
to me, conjuring me at least to accept of that small present, which he
was almost asham'd to offer me. I could not civilly refuse this present,
for fear of putting him too much out of countenance that sent it, and
only told the Servant that brought it, that I desir'd him to let his Master
know that I had accepted it, that I might not disoblige him, and that I
return'd him my thanks. They have ever since been mindful of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation;
and travelling five or six months after through the Village
where the Father of the Maid liv'd, and going to give him a visit, the
poor Girl was so transported with joy to see me, that she clung about
my knees, and would not leave me; being then so much the more sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the obligation she had to me, as she was now more her self, than
in the other occasion; and saying in the presence of her Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that she lookt upon me as another Father and Mother, seeing I had
preserv'd both her life and her honour.</p>
               <p>But as I did after this manner save this Maids honour, whose beauty
expos'd her to so great peril; so I ought not to conceal an heroick action
done by one, whose name was <hi>Roger,</hi> first Gentleman of the Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to the King in this occasion of the sack of <hi>Negrepelice.</hi> This man,
who was very generous and very honest, seeing the Souldiers carrying
away a great many Women and Virgins, presently ran up to them with
a purse full of Pistoles, and cheapning one for one Pistole, another for
two, and another for three, and going after this manner through all the
streets of the Town, he bought to the number of forty, which he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
to the Kings Quarters, where he plac'd them in safety, and from
thence sent them home to their own habitations, so soon as the Army
was withdrawn.</p>
               <p>XIII. The King being return'd to <hi>Paris</hi> after the ruin of <hi>Negrepelice,</hi>
the Army blockt up a little Town call'd <hi>Sonniere,</hi> which we resolv'd to
carry by Assault. We therefore attackt the <hi>Fauxbourg,</hi> wherein was the
principal defence; and Monsieur <hi>de Liancour</hi> being at the head of his
Regiment, pusht the first of the Enemy with so much vigour and fury,
as compell'd them to give way, to abandon the defence of the Gate,
aud to retire into the corners of the streets, and into the houses. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they were there under covert, and that firing thence continually
upon us, they kill'd a great many men, where we were in the open street,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100923:39"/>
I bethought my self of an invention that depriv'd them of part of their
advantage, in causing the Souldiers to carry many Counterpains and Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
hung upon the ends of two Poles, behind which those that march'd
were conceal'd from the sight of the Enemy, so that having no aim at us,
they hardly shot but at random and in vain. Yet could not this so hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
nevertheless, but that one of my intimate Friends called <hi>Roquelaure,</hi> a
very good Souldier, and a very brave man, who had been a General in the
<hi>Venetians</hi> Army, was killed, in a place where a man would have thought
he had been absolutely secure. He served at this time in the King's Army,
in the quality of Mareschal <hi>de Camp,</hi> and commanded the attack, when
the Regiment of <hi>Picardy</hi> went on to the assault, having always Monsieur
<hi>de Liancour</hi> and me by his side. Being now Masters of the Town, and
there only remaining some Runaways that yet made some shots in the Air,
he told me he was so thirsty, that he was able to do no more, and that he
should certainly dye, unless he had something to drink. I ran presently
to fetch a Flagon, that I commonly made a Souldier carry by his side for
such extremities; and <hi>Roquelaure</hi> taking the Flagon, enter'd into a house
to be more out of danger. But it was there that Fate expected him, and
it very well appear'd, that all the foresight of man is vain, against the
stroaks of Providence; for when I was in this House close by him, stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
till he had drank, that I might drink too; as he had the Flaggon at
his mouth there came a Musquet Bullet, which hitting upon the Mullion of
the Window, and being resisted by the Stone, by a strange glance struck
full into the head of <hi>Roquelaure,</hi> who fell stone dead at my feet, and made
me almost fall upon him by endeavouring to hold him up. This accident
so little foreseen did doubtless much more sensibly strike me, than if I had
seen him fall in the Fight; where a man expects to be kill'd himself, or
see those fall whom he most loves. I did intirely love this man, and I
can say, that he had an equal love for me, having said to me at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Campaign, that if he should chance to be kill'd, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
I would accept of his equipage, to put me sometimes in mind of
my Friend. I doubtless stood in no need of that to remember him, lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all my Friends from the bottom of my heart, and having not been
accustomed to borrow from these exterior testimonies the remembrance
I have of their Friendship. I could not nevertheless avoid this present he
had made me, being unwilling to disoblige his Kindred, who would by
all means perform the Will of the dead, and compell'd me to accept it.</p>
               <p>XIV. <hi>Lunet,</hi> which is but a little pitiful weak place, having surrendred
upon composition, after the taking of <hi>Sonniere</hi> the Army marcht, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ones knowing whither it was design'd to go, and past by a little
Bourg, wherein there was a kind of Fort into which a great many <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots</hi>
had withdrawn themselves, very well resolv'd to defend the place:
Monsieur <hi>d' Angoulesme</hi> did not think it worth his while to stay there,
despising the place as too inconsiderable, and so continued the march of
the Army. The honest men within thought they might make their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of our passing thus by without attacking them, and hoping to
get some booty, and elevated with their good fortune, resolv'd to sally,
and to fall upon the Rear of the Army. I was at that time in the Van,
and being aware of them, and having shew'd them to Monsieur <hi>de Cerillac,</hi>
our Lieutenant Collonel, I told him, that if he would give me leave, I
thought I could cut off their retreat, and with threescore men make my
self Master of their Gate before they could return. The proposal pleas'd him
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100923:40"/>
very well, and he gave me leave to do what I would; which he had no
sooner done, but that with threescore chosen men I slipt along through a
Ditch, that conceal'd us from the Skirmishers, when they thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Rear of the Army, and not of the Head, which they
knew to be far enough off; and so finding themselves on a sudden sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd,
and their Retreat intercepted, from that part whence they least
suspected any such thing, they began to run full drive toward their Gate;
but they could not get thither before me, so that we enter'd pell-mell
with them, and my Souldiers being better acquainted with this kind of
work, than this sort of Rabble, we had no great ado to force them to
give way, and to make our selves absolute Masters of the Gate. I there
left ten Souldiers to guard that, and went with the other fifty to charge
the rest of the Bourg, who were so frighted with this surprize, that they
made no manner of resistance.</p>
               <p>After having disarm'd and turn'd out all the men that were to be
fear'd, and let the rest alone without giving my self any trouble with them.
I sent to acquaint Monsieur <hi>de Cerillac</hi> with the success of my enterprize,
and to entreat him to give Monsieur <hi>d' Angoulesme</hi> an account of the same,
that I might know what Order he would please to give about this Bourg.
Monsieur <hi>d' Angoulesme</hi> sent a Gentleman to command me from him, to
raze the place to the ground before I left <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t. I receiv'd this Order
with all due submission; but fearing lest this affair might one day be laid in
my Dish, I entreated the Gentleman not to take it ill, if I desir'd him to tell
Monsieur <hi>d' Angoulesme,</hi> that I durst not well raze the place, without
first having his Order in Writing. This Gentleman forsooth, standing
upon the punctilio of honour, briskly reply'd, that the word he bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ght
me from Monsieur <hi>d' Angoulesme,</hi> was doubtless as good as a Letter. 'Tis
true, Sir, said I, in things where the question only is, whither they are true
or false, but not in an affair like this, where for my own indemnity it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
the word should remain, and subsist, which it cannot do but in
writing; and therefore do not take it ill I beseech you; if I entreat you
to let Monsieur <hi>d' Angoulesme</hi> know, that I never dismantle nor burn any
place, without having first a written Order to do it. I thought I had suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
explain'd my self, to give this Gentleman to understand, that I did
not doubt of the truth of his report, but that I look'd after my own secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for the future; but he took the highest offence imaginable, and would
make it a particular quarrel: whereupon I told him, that nothing was
farther from my thoughts, than to offend him in the least; but that also
he ought not to engage me in an ill business, in making a point of honor
of a thing that was nothing so, and that I was very well assur'd if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was in my place, he was a man of too much understanding, not to
take the same measures and precautions that I did. Being then satisfied
with my answer, he went back to Monsieur <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

After having receiv'd this Order, I commanded the Inhabitants to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
away what they would, and sent to proclaim in the neighbouring
Villages, that it was free for every one to come and take what they thought
fit, upon condition that they should raze the Fortifications, or burn what
could not be pull'd down. This work lasted two whole days, at the
end of which I came back to the Army.</p>
               <p>XV. This pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>caution, which I thought fit to make use of, before I
pull'd down this Castle, was of great use to me in the consequence; and
it well appear'd, that it is good to think of the future in the present
time, and to foresee, during the time of War, what may happen in the
times of Peace. For some years after, a Receiver General of <hi>Guyenne,</hi>
who had a part of his estate in <hi>Cabos,</hi> and to whom the houses appertain'd,
that I had demolisht and burnt, came and made his complaint to the
Chamber of accounts, that he could not produce his Acquittances and
Accounts, being that all his Papers had been burnt by one called <hi>de Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
that during the War had plundred and burnt the Town; and who
was at present a Lieutenant in the Guards; requiring that he might be
permitted to prosecute him, to compel him to restore all things to the
estate they were in before: The affair was carry'd to the Parliament,
where I was inform'd against, and where a Decree past against me. But
I not appearing, I was summon'd at the sound of Trumpet, and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
issu'd out against me for Contempt. In this extremity, to which I
was on a sudden reduc'd, for serving the King, I went to his Majesty,
and having acquainted him with my business, told him, that I was very
well assured Monsieur <hi>d' Angoulesme</hi> had given me his Order in writing,
and that I had stiffly insisted to have it, but that I could not call to mind
where I had laid that Paper. The King then bid me go to Monsieur
<hi>d' Angoulesme,</hi> and to entreat from him a note of his hand, that should
signifie that it was he who had commanded me to demolish the Castle.
But Monsieur <hi>d' Angoulesme</hi> making it a matter of mirth, and turning it
into raillery, told me he remember'd nothing of it, and that he would
not give me a note of his hand.</p>
               <p>With this answer I came back to the King, who seem'd to be very
much surpriz'd at Monsieur <hi>d' Angoulesme</hi>'s answer, and told me, that he
would order me to have an act of oblivion. I must confess that word struck
to my heart, not being able to endure that they should treat what I had
done by the express Order of the General, like a crime that deserv'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.
I most humbly thankt his Majesty, telling him, that I would
not make use of what he was pleas'd to offer me, but in the last necessity,
and that I would once more search my Papers. But I know not how, it
always fell out, that in the precipitation wherein I then was, this Paper
being lapt in another, fell divers times into my hands, and never was
discover'd by me. Seeing my self then reduc'd to such a condition, that
I no more dar'd to shew my head, and being forc'd to walk the streets
by night only, I went again to the King, who said that since Monsieur
<hi>d' Angoulesme</hi> deny'd me the justice I demanded of him, he would have
me take Letters of Abolition. But it is most true, that I could not hear the
word Abolition without being quite besides my self; and I confess I had
a secret spite in the bottom of my heart, believing that this Prince, who
was satisfy'd of my innocency, ought to have done something more for
me upon this occasion. I could not therefore yet prevail upon my self
to have recourse to these Letters, which in absolving at the same time
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100923:41"/>
made me appear guilty. I therefore again fell to ransacking all my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and at last had the good fortune to find that, which my haste before
had till then made me overlook. And thus, by the Kings order, carry'd
to the Parliament that which serv'd for my justification. I made my
innocency appear, and was at the same time discharg'd from all farther
prosecution. Monsieur <hi>d' Angoulesme</hi> hearing of it, did nothing but
laugh, saying only that I had been once frighted in my life; such is the
conduct, and such are the railleries of great persons, who value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon looking unconcern'd upon the misfortunes, into which they
not only see the meaner men fall, but into which they make them fall,
as if they thought it below them to share therein. And this example
makes it appear, that a man cannot fail in always dealing cautiously
with them, seeing they easily engage men in danger, and as easily leave
them in it when they are engaged.</p>

               <p>I. TO proceed in the course of our History, (which I have digrest
from, in the account I have given of the unjust prosecution,
that the demolishing the Castle of <hi>Cabos</hi> brought upon me.)
The Kings Army, having taken a great many other little places, towards
the middle of Summer drew near to <hi>Montpellier,</hi> and sate down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, which Army at that time consisted of twenty thousand men. The
King was there in person, and had for his Lieutenant Generals, Monsieur
<hi>le Prince,</hi> and Messieurs <hi>de Montmorency</hi> and <hi>de Schomberg.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de
Chevreuse</hi> was there also, but he was not much employ'd, and Monsieur
<hi>de Lesdiguieres</hi> came thither towards the end. They made three Attacks,
the first whereof was that of the King, commanded by the Prince; the
second, that of Monsieur <hi>de Montmorency;</hi> and the third, that of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Schomberg.</hi> The Regiment of <hi>Picardy</hi> was in this last, Monsieur
<hi>de Schomberg</hi> always making suit to have it, both because of Monsieur
<hi>de Liancour</hi> his Son-in-law, as also out of the esteem he had for that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment.
Monsieur <hi>de Rohan</hi> was shut up in the place, with a little body
of an Army, that was instead of a Garrison. The first Sally they made
was on the side of a Half-Moon, that was over against Monsieur <hi>de Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>'s
Attack, and that was very well cover'd with their Out-works, because
they had cover'd the Bulwarks very close, and that the Mounts of Earth
which they had rais'd were such, as the Fortification was not to be seen.
The Duke of <hi>Fronsac,</hi> who served there in the quality of a Volunteer,
was kill'd in this Sally.</p>
               <p>II. Monsieur <hi>de Schomberg,</hi> judging that it was of the last importance
to force this Half-Moon, propos'd the enterprize to the King, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
call'd a Council, wherein it was resolv'd to cause it to be discover'd.
They accordingly sent thither several Officers one after another, who
brought word that there was only a Ditch full of Water, and a Pallisado
of plain'd Timber beyond the Ditch. Monsieur <hi>de Schomberg</hi> desiring
to be yet better satisfy'd, and remembring the service I had done him
before <hi>Montauban</hi> in the like occasion, put me upon the employment of
going again to discover this Half-Moon; adding to this Order of his, a
thousand civilities and complements, to encourage me to go to have my
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100923:42"/>
Brains beaten out. I told him, that not to omit the least thing, or at
least that what I had seen might not be useless to him, in case I shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
be kill'd, I would carry my Tablets along with me, wherein I would
write every thing as I advanc'd, and that he should only take care to have
them brought off to him.</p>
               <p>I arm'd my self as at <hi>Montauban,</hi> with a Cuirass and a Cask; and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
over the Trench about noon, I gave notice to the Guard, which was
of the Regiment of <hi>Navarre,</hi> that I had order to go to discover the place,
and that therefore they should have a care not to mistake me. After this, I
crawl'd up a great Mount the Enemy had cast up, to retrench themselves
with; and having seen what the other Officers had discover'd before,
namely, the Ditch full of Water, and the Pallisado beyond the Ditch,
I would try if I could not discover something more: Wherefore expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
my self to extream peril, I advanc'd and mounted higher, from
whence with great astonishment I saw another Pallisado like the first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Ditch and me, and which appear'd almost incredible to me my
self, a second Half-moon enclos'd within the great one, as strong, and of
the same form as that which enclos'd it. I look't upon it over and over
again, not being able almost to believe my own Eyes, and set every
thing exactly down in my Tablets. But when I was got down again to
return, I had not gone a hundred paces before I began to consider, that
possibly they might laugh at my report; and fearing, as indeed it fell out,
that I should be look'd upon as a Visionary, whom fear had made to see
what was not, I resolv'd to go back again, yet nearer hand to assure my
self of the truth of things, and to see if I could not observe some place,
from whence, as at <hi>Montauban,</hi> I might make the King's own Eyes wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es
of what I should tell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> him. I return'd then with this design, and
went straight to the very top of the retrenchment, where I could not
long stay, by reason of a Centinel of the Enemy, who was not above
thirty paces distant from me on the other side; and who having let fly at
me, gave a great Alarm to the <hi>Corps de Guards,</hi> who immediately stood
to their arms, and all fir'd upon me. But the same instant that I was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
of what I desir'd, I threw my self from the top to the bottom, and
came to Monsieur <hi>de Schomberg</hi>'s Quarter, who had already given all the
necessary orders for the Attack.</p>
               <p>Monsieur <hi>de Schomberg</hi> took me immediately aside into a corner of his
Tent, where I made him my report; and seeing him seem hard to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
himself to believe me, concerning the second Half-moon of which
I have spoke before, after all the assurances I could give him, we went
together to the King; who presently began to smile, and fall to rallying
me, as I had very well foreseen. <hi>Did ever any one hear of such a thing,
and is there any likelihood in it?</hi> I then entreated his Majesty, that he would
please to believe his own eyes, assuring him, that I would make him see
the truth of what I had said, from a place that was not far off: I carried
him to the place, from which both himself, and Monsieur <hi>de Schomberg,</hi>
were satisfied of the truth of my report. But what shall we do? said the
King then; All the orders are already given, do you believe, said he,
that we cannot force the Enemy from their Post? I believe not, Sir, said
I, both by reason of these Pallisado's, these Ditches, and the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men by which they are guarded; and that it would certanily be too
much to attempt to take them all at once, but that it would be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to take them one after another.</p>
               <p>Upon this one of the Generals, came and whisper'd to the King, do
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100923:42"/>
you think, Sir, this Officer has not a mind to save his own Regiment,
which has the head of the Attack? you must keep him back, and employ
others, for when a leading Officer goes on without hoping well, it never
succeeds. I heard every word he said, being near enough; and heard
the King make answer, that he knew very well it was not that, which
made me to speak after that manner, adding withal, that nevertheless he
might do as he said. But the deference the King had for this General's
advice cost his Army very dear. Being then sensibly wounded to see my
self look'd upon as a Visionary, and a Coward, I entreated his Majesty
with great instances, not to let the all Regiment have this affront put upon
them, to be deprived of the honour they were wont to have, of going
on first upon the Enemy; adding with some heat, that if I had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a fault, it was not just that the whole body should be punish'd for it
by the loss of so honourable a priviledge, and that I alone ought to be
chastiz'd, and answer it with my head. The King, who very well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
my emotion, made me this answer; I do not pretend, said he, to
wrong the Regiment, for on the contrary, I will keep it for a reserve,
neither have I any intention to punish you, seeing that I rather ought to
reward you for the service you have done me: and therefore speak after
another manner, and entertain other sentiments of my justice.</p>
               <p>I then retir'd to carry news to my Lieutenant Collonel of the Orders
the King had given, and the reason that had mov'd him to do after that
manner, insisting much, that having done all in me lay to hinder it, it was
now his part to plead our cause anew: Monsie ur <hi>de Cerillac</hi> made answer,
without being mov'd, that if the King and his Generals would have it so,
we must resolve to acquiesce, and peradventure they will do us a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesy;
for they will doubtless save our lives by taking our places; and yet
I make a very great question, whither they will be able to carry the
place or no: but they will stand in need of us, and we, tho the last, may
possibly have the honour of the fight. He spoke after this manner,
making a virtue of necessity, and conceiving that it was more discretion
to keep there; but added, that nevertheless for decency's sake, we should
do well to present our selves, lest we should give the world an occasion
to censure and suspect us. Accordingly we went, but were presently
told, that we had not the Attack, and that we should stay till we were
commanded; whereupon without being very importunate, we return'd
to our Quarters, there to expect a new order.</p>
               <p>Monsieur <hi>de Chevreuse</hi> who did not command the Attack, having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
me to carry him to some eminence from whence he might easily
see the fight, I carried him to an old kind of Battery, where the Cannon
had been plac'd when they first invested the place; and from whence he
might see all without any manner of danger. The Attack was presently
begun, and succeeded so ill, that <hi>Navarre</hi> and <hi>Piedmont,</hi> who had the
head, with other Regiments that sustain'd them, were almost all cut to
pieces; and it fell out according to what Monsieur <hi>de Cerillac</hi> had said,
that they would at last have recourse to us, for we were commanded
with all the Regiment to repel the Enemy, who were not content to
have made so brave a resistance, but moreover had sallied out, and thrown
themselves into our Trenches; and finding them tir'd with so long a fight,
we beat them back with ease enough, and recover'd what we had lost
of our Trenches and Lodgment, but not our dead men, which were
not to be restor'd to life; and thus the ill grounded conjecture of the
General succeeded. 'Tis strange, that an engagement of honour should

sometimes seduce the greatest men to act contrary to their own reason,
and to precipitate themselves and whole Armies into inevitable danger. Tho
they had slighted my report as incredible, yet at last satisfied with their
own eyes, and things being known for such as I had represented them, it
was to attempt an impossibility to engage in this Attack: In the mean
time the Orders were already given, an Officer is suspected for a Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
and upon this without any other assurance they go on headlong to
the Assault; so true it is, that mens Judgments, by an effect of divine
Justice, sometimes fail them in the most important occasions.</p>
               <p>III. This bloody experience made the Generals alter their resolution;
they gave over the Attack of the Half-Moon to fall upon the great Basti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and this change was of so great importance, that a man may say it
was the cause of taking the place: for from that day forward the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
despair'd of being able to keep it, as much as they were confident of
doing it before, as they themselves have since confest. The new Attack
being begun, the Enemy made a great Sally upon our Regiment, which
had the Guard; they immediately charg'd the flanks of the Trench, and
did it with so great fury, that one part of it gave way, and was totally
routed, and the other came to rally themselves to a Lieutenant call'd <hi>La</hi> ...
and to me, who yet kept our post. The Enemy, who still
prest on, and that thought of no less than gaining all that was left, were
a little astonisht, when they saw us come on all in a body directly upon
them, and charge them so home, that from Assailants as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they saw it concern'd them to look to their defence. This altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
put them to their shifts: they disunited, and the one half retiring
into the City, left the other to be shut up in a corner, from whence it
was impossible for them to get away. But just as they were going to
call out for Quarter, a Souldier came crying out, all in a fright, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Zamet</hi> is kill'd, Monsieur <hi>Zamet</hi> is kill'd! I askt him, How dost thou
know it? Because I saw it, said he; at which being desperate, and quite
out of my wits, I miserably gave my self up to the fury that transported
me, in the thought wherewith I was then possest, that I had lost all in
losing this intimate friend, without making any manner of use of my
Reason, or other reflection, and threw my self with the utmost fury up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these poor people, whom I sacrific'd to my revenge, in causing them
to be all cut to pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IV. After this bloody execution, to which I had suffer'd my self to be
carried away, I ran, being yet quite out of my sences, to see if I could
find Monsieur</hi> Zamet <hi>dead, as I had been told: I was a little comforted
when I was told, that they were gone to put him to bed; but when I
saw, coming into the room, that his Thigh was taken off with a Faucon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot,
that he had receiv'd, in going from place to place as</hi> Mareschal de Camp,
<hi>I lookt upon him as a dead man. I stood by his Bed-side without being
able to speak one word, my heart was so opprest; when he himself began to
speak to me after so Christian a manner, that I remain'd in the greatest
confusion, comparing what he said to me to the condition wherein I
found my self.</hi> Must Christians <hi>(said he to me)</hi> as we are, desire any thing
contrary to the will of God? If it be by his appointment that all things happen
in the world, and if we cannot doubt that this is a stroke of his providence,
why should we oppose what he has ordain'd? Is not he master both of Life and
Death? And it would be mockery towards Almighty God, to whom we pray
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100923:44"/>
every day that his will may be done, not to submit to his good pleasure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when
he thus shews his own immediate arm. 'Tis proper in these great occasions, that
a man can throughly prove himself, and sound the bottom of his heart, to
know whether he be truly his or no. The little ones are more apt to deceive
us: but in this Hypocrisie has no place. How happy are we to leave this
world, that is only full of sins and miseries, to go unto God! I have, 'tis true,
great reason to apprehend his Justice, but he commands us to hope in his Mercy,
and it were to offend him to lose this hope. He will have compassion of us,
and tho his Judgments are terrible, yet he will shew Mercy. Even this is a
great favour, to dye in his quarrel, in defending the true Religion against those
that would subvert it. <hi>And then looking upon me with eyes full of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
and there fixing them for some time, as if to make me more
sensible of the reproach he intended me concerning the action he knew
I had so lately committed;</hi> But you, said he, who love me as your friend,
must that love of yours render you so cruel, that to revenge the death of a man
whom Providence will have dye, you should destroy so many others without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and without justice! Where was your generosity and natural humanity, to have
deny'd Quarter to these poor men, and to damn them most miserably for my sake, as if
my death could be reveng'd by theirs, or that I could approve this transport of so
irregular a friendship? Have you been able to restore me to life, in taking it
so cruelly away from these wretches? And was it not rather to pull down the
anger of God both upon your self <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd me, to pretend to revenge my death, which
he has appointed, by the death you have so unjustly given to so many persons
contrary to his order, and contrary to his will? I beseech you repent of this
fault, as one of the greatest that peradventure you have ever committed in your
whole life. The remedy which you have thought to apply to my misfortune,
has been much more painful to me than the mischance it self; and I think my
self oblig'd to conjure you from the bottom of my heart, that you never for the
death of any friend whatever, or your own being mortally wounded, fall again
into the same transport of fury.</p>
               <p>We were alone when he spoke to me after this manner; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d I confess,
that as I then wanted words to make answer to such a moving discourse,
so I want them now to represent the condition wherein I found my self;
being compell'd both by Monsieur <hi>Zamet</hi>'s reasons, and my own nature,
to pronounce a terrible sentence upon my self for this excess, of which
I was so mexcusably guilty. Words then being wanting to me, I made
him understand my repentance by the abundance of my tears, which I
could not refrain. And I must also confess, that this so Christian discourse
of his, together with the condition of him who made it to me, imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so lively a sense in the bottom of my heart, that I have ever since
retain'd a continual sorrow for that barbarous action. I stay'd with him
that night, and all the next day, being I could not find in my heart to
leave him; and went not out of the Room, but to perform my duty
upon the Guard.</p>
               <p>V. But it was not long before I was chastis'd for the criminal fury
wherewith I had suffer'd my self to be transported. I was commanded
to go attack the Enemy with a hundred men, in a little Half-moon,
that they were resolv'd to carry, and from whence they fir'd mightily
upon us: where tho they made a brave defence, were yet more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
attackt; and we were now upon entring, having nothing but a
little Ditch to leap, to make our selves masters of the place; but at the
same moment I felt my self wounded with two Musquet shots at once,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100923:45"/>
one in the body which entred not very far, and only past betwixt the
flesh and the skin, the other in the ankle, the bone of which it broke
into several splinters, making me fall at the same time into the Ditch,
from whence attempting to rise, I fell down again. I was therefore fain
to satisfie my self with encouraging my Souldiers only, bidding them not
to concern themselves about me, but perfect what they had so success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
begun; and that it would by no means be honourable for them,
by reason of my being wounded, to lose a Half-moon, which it had cost
them so much to gain. The men being all very brave, the sight of the
condition I was in, serv'd only the more to excite their Courage, so that
before I could be carry'd off, I had the satisfaction to see them lodg'd
in the place.</p>
               <p>I then entreated a Gentleman, a kinsman of Monsieur <hi>de Valencay,</hi> my
intimate friend, that serv'd with us upon this occasion in the quality of a
Volunteer, that he would help to conduct, or rather to carry me back
to the Camp, which he did with a very particular affection; and so soon as I
was arriv'd at my Tent, I sent to acquaint Monsieur <hi>Zamet</hi> with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
I was reduc'd to; and to let him know that my greatest grief was
that I could not pay him my duty in his sickness, and do him those ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
that I could heartily have wisht, and to be thus depriv'd of the
only con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>olation of being near his person. He was sensible of my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
as of a new wound he had receiv'd, believing me to be worse
hurt than I was, and nearer death than he. He sent to me immediately
to let me know his sence of my condition; which it was no hard matter
for me to understand, by reason of the union, and perfect openness of
our hearts. We sent afterwards daily every hour reciprocally to know
how one another did, having this only way left of conversing in some
sort with one another, and of giving one another a mutual consolation.</p>
               <p>VI. Finding my self in very great danger, and that the Kings chief
Physician, and the Chyrurgions assur'd me, that there was no other way
left to save my life, but by cutting off my Leg, which began to gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green,
I had a mind to acknowledge the obligation I had to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
my friend, of whom I spoke before, who brought me back to my
Tent: I therefore told him, that God being pleas'd otherwise to dispose
of me, I entreated him to permit me to surrender my Command into his
hands; and that he would go in my name to request it of the King, and
to tell his Majesty, that I did humbly beseech him, in consideration of
my services, to give it him. This Gentleman with great generosity deny'd
me, telling me flatly, that he would not do it. But after this first denial
I renew'd my importunity, and importun'd him with so great instance,
assuring him that he could not disoblige me more than by such a refusal,
that he saw himself compell'd, as it were, to gratifie my desire. He
went then, tho very unwillingly, to attend the King, and acquainted
him with the humble request I had oblig'd him to deliver in my name.
The King a little surpriz'd, ask'd him, what is he dead then? to which
the Gentleman made answer, that I was not; but that I would not be
satisfied except he would come to his Majesty, to acquaint him, that his
first Physician Monsieur <hi>Erouard,</hi> who had apply'd, and taken off the
first dressing, had found my Leg in such a condition, the Gangreen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
got into it, that he saw no hopes of saving my life, but by cutting it
off: that I could not consent to it, being not well assur'd to out-live so
violent a remedy, and choosing almost as soon to dye, as to see my self
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100923:45"/>
miserable all the remainder of my life, and out of condition of serving
his Majesty, having thus lost one of my Legs. Tell him, answer'd the
King, that I will have him do whatever the Physicians and Chyrurgions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point,
that he must not suffer himself to be thus transported by despair;
and that I will not forsake him: that, as to what concerns his Command,
I will not dispose of it, till he shall be totally incapable of ever exercizing
it again, and that I am very sorry to see him reduc'd to such a condition,
as to make me such a request. The Gentleman came back to me, and
brought me the King's answer, at which I was really very much afflicted,
having a great mind to procure this favour for my Friend, and seeing
almost no hopes of my self, after all that the Chyrurgions had told me of
my condition.</p>
               <p>In the mean time I could by no means resolve to have my Leg cut off,
and I had almost as willingly have died; when being thus agitated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
fear and desire, and the prospect of a present and inevitable death
pressing hard upon me, I on a sudden remembred, I had heard a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruryion,
who had cur'd me of some wound or other, boast, that he had
an infallible remedy to stop a Gangreen, and one who liv'd not above
fifteen Leagues off at a Town call'd <hi>Tournon.</hi> The affair being pressing,
I sent my man in post haste to tell him what condition I was in, and to
conjure him to come with all speed to save my life, by reason that I was
resolv'd rather to dye, than to have my Leg cut off. This Chyrurgion,
who remembred that I had paid him very well the first time he had had
me in his hands, mounted to Horse in a trice, and made all the haste he
could to come to me. In the mean time the King's Chyrurgions, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that a Country Chyrurgion could know any particular secret that
they were ignorant of, and looking upon this hope of mine as a pure allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that might occasion my death, resolv'd to use violence, to do me, as
they thought, a very great piece of service, and to save my life by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off my Leg, whether I would or no. So that after they had laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me the inevitable necessity of doing it, and that all my Friends had
jointly pray'd, and conjur'd me to suffer it; seeing me still remain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible,
and obstinate not to suffer it to be done; they plainly told me,
that seeing I would be the cause of my own death, they should peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be forc'd to proceed after another manner with me. Accordingly
they came the next day into my Tent with all their preparations of
Lints, Salves, Ligatures, and Instruments to make their operation. I
perceiv'd them through the Curtains of my Bed, and was in so great a
fright, that my Hair stood on end, choosing infinitely rather to lose both
Arms and Legs in an assault, or a battel, than to see any of them cut off
in cold blood in my Bed, especially whilst I was in hopes to preserve them
by another way.</p>
               <p>Two <hi>Franciscan</hi> Fryers presented themselves at the same time, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
me by a very Christian discourse to suffer this operation with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
giving me to understand that for an hour or two of pain, I should
preserve my self many years; and that though I did not care for this life,
yet that I ought to do it in consideration of the other, seeing that God
did as much forbid us to be Murtherers of our selves, as of others, and
that here this perishable life was not only concerned, but life eternal, to
which I was going, and where I should soon be obliged to render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of my life; and should be guilty of casting it away, if I refus'd the
methods proper for preserving it. I answered, that it was not certain
the cutting off my Leg would save my life, and that I had much greater
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100923:46"/>
hopes from an able Chyrurgion, who had a particular secret to stop a
Gangreen, and would be with me presently. The two Fathers regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more what the Chyrurgions pretended, that such a Medicine was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
than any thing I could say, concluded out of an honest but indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
zeal, that force must be used, and I must be held during the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
so that both falling upon me on the sudden, they told me, they
saw they must save my life by violence. This proceeding I confess strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disordered me, so that in rage and transport of passion, I cry'd out,
What! will you rob me, both of this and the next life too? Are you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to damn me? Let me go, except you resolve to throw me into a
condition more dreadful, than the loss of ten thousand lives. These
amazing expressions so startled and confounded them, that they straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
let me go, and were much concern'd to find their zeal so unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
employ'd. They chang'd their note, and spoke afterwards to me
with great charity and tenderness; letting all expressions alone, that
might any way discompose me, and appeasing my mind by all the soft
ways they could. This return quite won my heart, and convinc'd me,
that what they had done imprudently proceeded from friendship and
kindness; and I exprest as much gratitude for this last, as I had done
aversion for their former behaviour to me; entreating them, that they
would visit me often in my illness, which they readily engag'd to do; and
then we contracted such a Friendship, as continu'd between us ever after;
and they have come to see me in the place where I now dwell retir'd, a
great many years after this accident.</p>
               <p>At last the man I expected with so much impatience, and upon whom
I depended for my Cure arrived, and extraordinary haste he made. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soon
as ever I saw him enter the room, I cry'd out, Oh! how much am
I oblig'd to you for coming so quickly, and answering all the confidence
I reposed in you! I have told every hour, and every minute, and am
sensible you could not possibly have come sooner to my relief. You see
here one, who is a lost man in the opinion of all the world, unless you
relieve him. The Chyrurgion reply'd, that he hoped he should be able
to stop the Gangreen, provided it were not gone too far, and that my
case were not absolutely desperate; and that his remedy did not use to
fail. I sent away to beg Monsieur <hi>Ero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ard,</hi> and the other Chyrurgions
to come, and take off their applications, it not being allowable that it
should be taken off without them. Assoon as the dressing was remov'd,
the Chyrurgion was a little surpriz'd to see the Gangreen got so high,
and said it was gone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o far, that he durst give me no assurance till after
once or twice dressing: The others said, he spoke very reasonably; and
it would be very happy if there were any hopes then. He apply'd his
remedy, and next day they met again at the same hour to see the effect.
The thing appear'd still doubtful, and he would warrant nothing yet;
tho this first application had prevented the Gangreen from rising any
higher. So he reserv'd the giving any positive Judgment till the next
time; and then at taking off the second dressing, and duly examining the
wound, he declar'd boldly, that now he would be answerable for my
Cure, and that his remedy had been successful. Monsieur <hi>Erouard</hi> and
the rest looking upon it, were a little astonish'd, and confest this was a
secret they did not understand. It is easie to judge whether I repented
of my obstinacy, in not submitting either to the pleasure of the King,
the ignorance of my Chyrurgions, and the zeal of my Ghostly Fathers;
and whether I did not think my want of Courage upon this occasion a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100923:46"/>
happiness, which would not let me throw away a Leg to no purpose,
that hath serv'd me so long, and so well since that time.</p>
               <p>A few days after, Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> sent to see me by his Steward,
who found me better of my wounds, but ill enough of my purse, my
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y not being sufficient for so great an expence, as the condition I was
then in expos'd me to, above the ordinary charge of the Army: Which
Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> having intimation of from the person he had sent to
me, procured me some money of the King. Part of this I employ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d in
rewarding <hi>Mutonis,</hi> the Souldier that helpt me to escape into our Camp,
and whom I kept in my own Tent as my Brother, ever after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
that Musquet-shot in his Arm; till at last I got him a place in an
Hospital, where he subsisted very comfortably without my help. But
the summ Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> procur'd for me being not very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
by reason that a greater would have made it necessary to get a
Ratification from the Chamber of Accounts, he was so generous to send
me some of his own; and did it after so pressing and so obliging a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that I thought my self bound to accept, what a better man than I
would have made no scruple to receive from a Superintendant; and
what indeed I could not have told how to refuse, from a person that hath all
along done me the honour to love me so tenderly; for to have declin'd
it must needs have given him great offence.</p>
               <p>VII. In the mean while Monsieur <hi>Zamet</hi> was dead of his wound, but
they conceal'd his death from me, and durst not be too hasty in letting
me know what were enough to have kill'd me, in that condition. The
City of <hi>Montpellier</hi> being at last surrendred upon terms, and the general
Peace concluded with the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> the Regiment of <hi>Picardy</hi> was plac'd
there in Garrison, where I was lodg'd rarely well; and my Chyrurgion
in six weeks had put me in a way of doing without him, and letting my
self be drest by one in the Town, till my Cure was perfected. I return'd
him the best acknowledgment I could, and gave him a reward, which
tho but inconsiderable if compar'd with the service he had done me,
yet proportionable to my present ability. What was wanting that way
I endeavour'd to make up by the tenderest testimonies of friendship,
and of the gratitude I should ever retain while that life lasted, which
he had preserv'd, when every body else thought me sure to lose it.</p>
               <p>The death of Monsieur <hi>Zamet</hi> was kept from me, as I said, for some
time, but the great impatience I was in to know how he did, would not
suffer it to be long conceal'd, for I was every hour enquiring after him
with extraordinary concern. So that after they had prepar'd me by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
for the afflicting news, I receiv'd it at last with a grief not possible
to be exprest; and except people knew both our hearts, and the strict
union of them, they can never judge what disorder I was in upon the
thought of our being separated for ever, and that I should no more
enjoy the blessing of his Conversation, whose friendship I valu'd above
all things in the world. But this first grief was follow'd by another; for
having made me his Executor, and deliver'd his Will into my hands the
day after he was hurt, I could not but be sensibly afflicted to see that
some of his Relations should quarrel with me, in opposing the intention
of the Dead, and the care I took to have his Will perform'd. Yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they all acquiesc'd but one, who still retain'd a coldness toward
me upon this account; as if the last Will of the Dead ought not to be
respected by the Living; or that he whom they make choice of to see
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100923:47"/>
it executed, could be to blame for acquitting himself faithfully of this
duty.</p>
               <p>VIII. After lying seven or eight months under Cure, when I began to
walk a little, and get on Horseback, Monsieur <hi>Valencay,</hi> Governour of
<hi>Montpellier,</hi> gave me a Commission to go see what the Inhabitants of
<hi>Sevennes</hi> were doing. These were little Bourgs and Villages scituated in
the Mountains, and possest by the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> They were all gallant Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
having past most part of their youth in the <hi>Low-Country</hi> Wars, from
whence they return'd expert and brave, which gave some occasion to
suspect them, and oblig'd Monsieur <hi>Valencay</hi> to order this enquiry, that
he might be secure they were not contriving some new disturbances. I
found them all very quiet as oft as I came among them: and this visit
that I made into their Country was not unprofitable to me, because by
this means I was capable of informing the King, who afterwards examin'd
me about it, as shall be told in due place.</p>
               <p>IX. I had not been at <hi>Paris</hi> of a long time, and indeed had some bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
there. The Regiment deputed me to go sollicit for payment of
their Musters that were in arrear. Monsieur <hi>Valencay</hi> contributed to this
Deputation too, and I almost fancy'd he was not sorry of so fair an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to put me at some distance from him, knowing the particular
friendship Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> honour'd me with; who being now in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
he might fear my raising a faction in the place, for a person to
whose Interests I had ever shewn my self so much devoted. But in this
he betray'd his ignorance of me, if he thought me capable of a thing so
contrary to my temper: For I ever knew very well how to distinguish
between the duty of acknowledgment to private persons, and that of
fidelity to my Prince. I took post with one single Servant, and just af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I had past <hi>Nevers,</hi> fell into a good pleasant adventure. I met very
late in the Evening with a Courier, who past me, and went up to my
man; he being very weary, and not turning his Horse out of the way,
the Courier justled him so roughly, that both of them were dismounted,
and came down together. A quarrel ensu'd, and to cuffs they fell, and
when they had box'd one another pretty tightly, and saw no body
come to part them, they began to cool themselves, and fell to parleying.
The Courier askt my man whom he belong'd to? and who that was that
rode before? and hearing my name, How! said he, that is the very
person whom I am sent to: How lucky an accident is this that hath
brought me to the man I look for. Come on, let us mount presently,
and spur on till we overtake him. Thus they gallop'd away together,
shouting after me at a great distance; at last I heard them, and stopt;
but not knowing the meaning of this, nor who I had to deal with, I
drew a Pistol. The Courier coming up, told me of the good fortune he
had in meeting my man, and how he came to discover that I was the
person, upon whose account purely it was that he was going to <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier;</hi>
at the same time drawing out of his pocket an Order from the
King, which contain'd these words: <hi>Vpon receipt of this Order, you are
without fail to repair to My Person, with all speed.</hi> This put me into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
betwixt hope and fear, not being able to guess upon what account
I should be sent for; though I could not find any great reason to fear,
as not being conscious of any fault I had been guilty of: So I told the
Courier he might go on his journey about his other dispatches. But he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100923:47"/>
reply'd, that he had none of importance, or that requir'd haste but mine,
and therefore as to the rest he would put them into the common Post.
I urg'd him again, and would fain have got rid of him, telling him he
might pay him for his whole Journey, and I would satisfie him for his
pains; but he answered it would be so much Money thrown away, and
besides he must go back with me. Thus we rode Post day and night,
and repos'd our selves for two or three hours only at <hi>Essone;</hi> from whence
setting out three hours before day, we came betimes in the morning to
<hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>X. Monsieur <hi>Valencay</hi>'s dispatches, of which I was the Bearer, were
for the King, and Monsieur <hi>Puisyeux;</hi> but I thought it my best way to
light at Monsieur <hi>P.</hi>'s Gates, hoping he might give me some light into the
occasion of my being sent for by the King. He was not a little surpriz'd
to see me, believing I had left the Army by the King's Order; but when
he had open'd his Letters, and seen the purport of them, he told me, I
must needs go carry the King that directed to him, and present his too
seal'd up again, because his Majesty would be the better pleas'd: I very
well perceiv'd by the manner of Monsieur <hi>Puisyeux</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s speaking to me, that
the business upon which the King had sent for me, had no harm in it;
and in that thought went straight to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> in the habit of a man that
rides Post in the Winter, that is, all dirt from head to foot. Being come
to Court, I spoke to the Usher of the Chamber, who very roughly told
me, I must wait, for the King was not drest yet, and that I was not in so
great haste. As we were talking, Count <hi>Nogent</hi> came out of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and I knowing his obliging temper, went to salute him; telling him,
upon a supposal that he might not know me, That not having the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to be known to him, I begg'd leave to beseech him, that he would
please to order that the King might be told, that the Officer of <hi>Picardy,</hi>
for whom his Majesty had sent, was there to attend his pleasure. And
thereupon, as I was about to tell him my name, he interrupted me, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Are not you Monsieur <hi>de Pontis?</hi> Come, come, the King will be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
to see you, for he did not expect you so soon. Then he took me
in, and immediately shewing me to the King said, Look you, Sir, is not
this the most diligent man, and one of the best dispatch in your whole
Kingdom? And can any but he, come from <hi>Montpellier</hi> in so short a time,
as that since he was sent for? To which the King made answer, it was
incredible I should come so soon. I let the King alone in his wonder for
a while, which seem'd to divert, and at last clear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d up the matter, and
deliver'd the Dispatches from Monsieur <hi>Valencay.</hi> After he had read it,
he commanded me to carry it to Monsieur <hi>Puisyeux,</hi> telling me, I had
done well, in bringing it to him first. Monsieur <hi>Valencay</hi> (said the King)
sends me word that you are the person he sent to visit the <hi>Savennes;</hi> you
shall give me an account of that matter by and by, for I will call my Council,
and then send for you in; be ready at the time, and in the mean while
go, and refresh your self.</p>
               <p>I came accordingly when the Council was set, and was call'd in before
a great many of the Court, who were then in the Antichamber, and who
begun to look upon me after another manner than they had done before.
For in this world those are respected who are look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d upon by the Prince,
and People have a regard for them in proportion to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>are they have in
their Soveraigns favour. The King then commanded me to make a report to
the Council, of what I knew concerning the state of the Country I had
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100923:48"/>
seen, and from whence I came, and particularly of the <hi>Savennes.</hi> In
order whereunto I began first to speak of the City of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> of
which I gave an account, that the Inhabitants were very well satisfied
with Monsieur <hi>Valencay,</hi> and seem'd pleased with his Government; from
thence I proceeded to the concern of the whole Country, and assured
his Majesty of the good disposition the People were in, which gave
very good reason to judge, that they had no aversion to living under his
Government, and the direction of those he appointed to command there.
At last I came to the <hi>Savennes,</hi> telling him, that after having visited all
those Mountains in order, I could discover nothing but an absolute sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
in all the Inhabitants, and as great a zeal to his Majesty's service
now, as there had been want of it before; that I had gone thither several
times, and found it always the same; and therefore as far as I was able to
judge, durst be responsible to his Majesty, that there was not any reason
to suspect their fidelity, which was all I had to say, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
condition I left them in. To which the King made answer, that it
was enough, and as much as he desir'd, bidding me stay without, and
attend him at Dinner.</p>
               <p>XI. I took care to be there accordingly, but there was so much Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the King could not speak to me, and therefore deferr'd it till Supper;
where there happening to be but a few, I had a convenient Audience.
After Supper the King took me into his Closet, and Marquis <hi>Grimant</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
being by, said thus to me; I have sent for you, to let you see I am mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of you, and willing to acknowledge the services you have done me;
and therefore I give you your choice, either of a Company in the old
Body, or a Lieutenancy in my Guards; choose which you had rather have,
I leave you at full liberty. I confess this proposal a little surpriz'd me,
for to speak truth I expected something more, and was of opinion, that
the services I had done, after having refused a Company in the Regiment
of <hi>Champagne,</hi> deserved a higher recompence, than that of a Command
no better, than what I had formerly refused. However I was forc'd to
set a good face upon the matter, and acknowledge it a great thing, that
his Majesty had done me the honour to think of me. Wherefore I made
answer with all imaginable humility, that since his Majesty was pleased to
do so much in my favour, I humbly begg'd he would make it compleat by
pointing out to me himself the choice I ought to make; protesting at
the same time, that what pleas'd his Majesty would by most acceptable to
me, so great was the passion I had to serve him in any Post, he thought
fit to assign me. I thought (said the King) how I should find you affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and had a mind to try, which of the two Commands you had a
greater inclination to. Whereupon Monsieur <hi>Grima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t,</hi> who pretty
well knew the King's intention, took the liberty to say to him, methinks,
Sir, you had better give him a Lieutenancy in the Guards, for by that
means, you will be sure to have him constantly near your person. That
is what I desire, reply'd the King, and do you do so too? (said he) speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to me. I have already told your Majesty (said I) that I have no other
choice to make, than what your Majesty directs me to; and I am fixt in
that resolution as I ought to be. But I know your Majesty's goodness is
so great, that you will not be displeas'd, if I put you in mind, that you
did me the favo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r to promise me a Company. This was modestly to ask
a Company in the Guards; and the King, who understood my meaning
well enough, presently interrupted me, and said, True; but it was in an
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100923:48"/>
old Body, and I am now ready to do it; though I give you my word,
that if the Company of which I now make you Lieutenant, comes to be
vacant, either by the death of the Captain, or any other accident, you
shall have it. I am willing too to acquaint you at first, that I am desirous to
restore one thing in my Guards, and to begin to do it by you; which is
that you neither practise, nor give any Orders in the Company, but
what come first from me: In extraordinary cases I mean, and not in
things of course and common use; and that you never go off your
Guard, nor out of your Quarters, when 'tis your turn to command. This
I resolve to have done, that I may restore discipline in the body, which
at present is quite lost among them; and also with a design to have you
always near my Person. I answer'd, That as he was my Master and my
Prince, and had done me the particular favour to command me nearer
to him, I hop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d by my conduct to let his Majesty see, that my greatest
desire was to obey and serve him all my life. Then he ordered Monsieur
<hi>Grimant</hi> to see my Commission dispatch'd presently, by which I was to
be made Lieutenant to Count <hi>Saligny</hi>'s Company.</p>
               <p>XII. But though I set a good face upon the matter, as I thought my
self oblig'd to do; yet I return'd very little satisfy'd with my fortune,
and thinking very seriously of the conditions propos'd to me, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
very burdensom and difficult; I look'd upon my self from this
time forward, as entring into a dreadful slavery; so that I confess I could
have wish'd, had I dar'd to deny the King, that I had not been so unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
complemental, and had made choice rather of a Company in an
old Body. But I was now engag'd over head and ears, and had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
left, nor any remedy, but to see my mistake, and make it an useful
example to other people.</p>
               <p>Monsieur <hi>Saligny</hi>'s Company was one of the first in the Regiment, and
his younger Brother was Ensign of it, which I knew nothing of before.

                  </gap>d to require, that he should succeed as Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
especially in his own Brother's Company. I found my self a little
perplex'd so soon as I was inform'd of this: But still that inconvenience
must be encounter'd too, and so I resolv'd to pay all imaginable civility
to Monsienr <hi>Saligny;</hi> and going to wait upon him, I said, That had I
understood sooner, that his Brother was Ensign in that Company, I should
have begg'd the King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s excuse for accepting the Lieutenancy, and being
plac'd between two Brothers, who by Order of War, as well as Birth,
ought not to have been separated upon this occasion. But that I but just
then had come to the knowledge of it, and all left in my power to do,
having already accepted the Commission, was to express my concern.
This complement succeeded very well, and I can say, that the two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
did me the honour to testify so particular a Friendship for me, that
as oft as any little coldness happened beween them, I was always the
Mediator, and chosen for the Umpire of their differences.</p>
               <p>After having been received at the head of the Regiment, it being
necessary to have my self admitted by the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> too,
who was Collonel of the Infantry, I resolv'd to incline his favour to me
by a complement that I knew would please him very well, and gratify the
ambition so natural to all great men. The day that I was to mount the
Guard, I marched at the head of the Company without a Corslet direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his House, where causing my men to halt in a corner, some twenty
paces from it, so that they kept out of sight, and going by my self, I desir'd
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100923:49"/>
to speak with him. As soon as I came into his presence, after the first
salutes, I told him, that the King having honoured me with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Lieutenant to Monsieur <hi>Saligny,</hi> and sealed my Commission, I
had been the day before receiv'd at the head of the Company, drawn
up in Battalia, by which I was obliged this day to mount the Guard; but
that I would not take upon me the last mark of that Authority his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
had given me, till I had first received it from his hand, and presenting
him the Corslet at the same time; I added, that I tendered that to him,
to whom it belonged to give it me; and that having brought the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
near his house, I would not march it by the Gate, till his Lordship
had first given me right to walk at the head of it in the quality of the
Kings Lieutenant.</p>
               <p>Monsieur <hi>Espernon,</hi> a little surpriz'd, but much pleas'd, made so obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
an answer, as plainly shewed he had lik'd the surprize. He assur'd
me of his service upon all occasions, and putting on my Corslet very
gracefully, would in some sort hint to me, that he still remembred what
past between Monsieur <hi>Bastillat</hi> and me, about the attack of <hi>Moutesche;</hi>
telling me, there were but few persons that so well deserv'd, or that
could acquit themselves better in this Command. I then askt him, if he
would please to see my Company, and he accordingly going presently
down stairs, I went to put my self at the head of them, and marcht by,
saluting him with my Pike after the most graceful manner that I could.
I marcht them on to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> where Monsieur <hi>Saligny</hi> took the head of
them. The King, as a particular mark of favour, and in pursuance of
his design to use me in restoring discipline among his Guards, would
needs see me this first time in my new Post, and to that purpose made
us pass and repass before him. Our Arms being set down in the Guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room,
Monsieur <hi>Saligny</hi> told me, he would carry me to wait on the
King in the quality of his Lieutenant: I followed him. But though I had
the satisfaction to see, that this Command gave me easie access to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
person, yet I had as much trouble to find my self made a better sort
of Slave, by the burdensom engagement I was entring into, and which
the King spoke to me of now again, repeating what he had said before,
That I was not to stir from my Quarters, nor give any new Orders in the
Company, without first consulting him.</p>
               <p>His Majesty being pleas'd to give the Orders, Monsieur <hi>Saligny</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
to receive them; but I being then near the King, and standing
still as he advanc'd, his Majesty stept in between us, leaning upon me, as
if he would give the Orders to us both. This immediately gave great
jealousy to Monsieur <hi>Saligny,</hi> and had doubtless created an unlucky mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanding
betwixt us, had not I at the same time prevented the ill
consequence. My experience in the profession had taught me, that a
Lieutenant never takes Orders from a General, when his Captain is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and that he ought to receive them from his own Captain. So that
turning aside my head, and seeming not to hear what the King said, as
soon as ever his Majesty had done speaking; and was retir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d a little from
us, I stept to Monsieur <hi>Saligny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and entreated his Orders, as if I knew
nothing. He was so surpriz'd at this, by reason of the ill impression he had
taken before, that he presently thought with himself after this trial, he
should never have the least occasion to be offended with my conduct;
since contrary to all appearance, I had kept my self so strictly to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest
Rules, even then when it seem'd that the King himself had given me
an occasion to lay it aside. His Majesty taking notice of this passage, as I
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100923:49"/>
had a mind he should, had the goodness in some measure to condemn
himself, by approving and commending what I had done.</p>
               <p>XIII. Some time after the King requiring of me an account of the state of
the Company, which was then wholly under my care, the Captain and Ensign
being both absent, I thought good to take this opportunity of informing
my self more particularly, what his Majesty expected from me; and would
at the same time, for my own security, beg a Copy of the Orders I was
to observe in writing. Having entreated his leave to speak freely, I
told him, I was very much afraid, I should not be able to give his Majesty
all the satisfaction he expected, and lest the too favourable opinion he
might have of my conduct might turn to my prejudice at last, when I
was found less capable than he took me to be; therefore I thought my
self oblig'd honestly to acquaint his Majesty, that I was by no means a
man of that active and sprightly parts, that was requisite in one, who was
to give an account of so many things, and to execute so many orders;
but a heavy and slow Fellow, and of a very treacherous memory: And
therefore not being able sometimes to do things by my self as others do,
I stood in need of assistance. But as I had reason to fear I might not
always have those helps ready at hand, I very much apprehended I should
not please; and therefore had I dared to take the liberty of begging a
favour, I should most humbly have besought him, that for the relief of
my memory and understanding, his Majesty would please to give me the
Order I was to ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cute in writing; that by this means I might the better
discharge my duty. I perceive plainly, reply'd the King, you would
have me think you a Blockhead, but it concerns my honour not to have
been mistaken in the choice I have made of you. I have not given you
this command, without a perfect knowledge of you; nevertheless I will
grant you your request, as well because you desire it, as because it will
be an ease to me too. And accordingly his Majesty caus'd instructions to
be drawn up for me in writing, upon which I afterwards gave him an
account upon all occasions.</p>
               <p>XIV. The Souldiers were at this time very great Libertines, and little
or no discipline was observ'd among them: They did not so much as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to their Colours to march in order, when they went to mount the
Guard at <hi>St. Germains,</hi> where the King was: some came before, and
others straggling behind, or on one side, so that oftentimes there were
not so much as a dozen together with the Officers that led them. My
humour would not endure such disorder, which vexed me, since it was
sure to draw the hatred of all the Souldiers upon me, besides the slavery
I found my self reduc'd too; and I was perfectly weary of my life, and
lamented the loss of my Lieutenancy in the Regiment of <hi>Picardy,</hi> which
I had quitted for this. Another greater vexation still was, that I had
not one acquaintance in the Regiment, into which I was now taken,
and so had no body to open my griefs to. When I began to consider
how to disengage my self from all this perplexity, and get out of this
condition which I saw was sure to be attended with so many uneasinesses,
I saw very well, there was no possible way of doing it, without abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
renouncing my fortune, and losing my self for ever with the King.
At last therefore I took up my resolution, conceiving it much better to
make a virtue of necessity, and place all my delight in doing what the
King required of me, and trying at the same time to gain the good will
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100923:50"/>
of the Officers, who were then in a manner all Strangers to me; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
authority with the Souldiers, among whom I was a new man,
and not yet very much regarded by them. And after having thus set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
my de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ign to execute the King's commands cheerfully, I found by
experience, that the will overcomes the greatest difficulties, and felt a
great deal more ease in the performance of my duty, than I could have
imagin'd, or had ever propos'd to my self.</p>
               <p>In order to contract an acquaintance with the Officers at first, I invited
all the principal of them to a Dinner, which was reasonably splendid,
there I began my Friendship with some of them, which afterwards I took
great care to improve. This entertainment pass'd off with so many testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of affection and esteem on both sides, that it look'd like an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
of twenty years standing. I intermixt a small piece of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
with the Feast, which contributed much to the diversion of the
Company; for Monsieur <hi>Bouteville,</hi> with ten or a dozen more Captains
of Horse being at the same Eating-house, in another Room, I sent for
all the Drums of the Regiment, and with them we went all together to
drink those Gentlemens Healths, saluting them the mean while with a
Point of War upon all our Drums. They thought they could not return
our Civility better, than by sending for their Trumpets unknown to us,
and taking their turn of drinking our Healths too, sounding all the while.
Thus from a trifle, I produced something considerable for my self. For
this Dinner made a great noise, and acquired me the esteem of several
that did not know me before.</p>

               <p>I. IT was doubtless of no small consequence for such an Officer as my
self, at my entring into the Regiment of Guards, and designing,
as I did, to cause Martial Discipline to be exactly observed by the
Souldiers, in obedience to the King's pleasure, to gain at first the good
will of the Officers, that I might be upheld by them in the execution of
his Majesty's Orders. But that which was to be done afterwards, as it
was of much greater importance, so was it beyond all comparison the
more difficult undertaking. For the business was to attempt the re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
of good Discipline among the Souldiers, who had in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
shaken off the Yoke; and to reduce a great many wild young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
to the duty they owed their Officers. I conceived therefore,
that in the first place I was obliged to acquaint them, what the King ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
both from them and me; that they might not be surpriz'd when
I should compel them to it. So I ordered the Company to be drawn up,
and at the head of it told them; That the King having commanded me to
make it my business, to restore that Discipline which was entirely lost among
them, I thought it my duty to let them know it, before I took the thing
in hand; to the intent that such as were not disposed to obey what should
be commanded, in conformity to his Majesty's pleasure, might have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to withdraw; which I entreated them to do betimes, since after I
had advertiz'd them of their duty, as I was about to do, they could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
have no pretence to exempt them from an absolute obedience:
That I requir'd nothing of them but the ordinary duties of a Souldier;
which were, to be discreet; to have a care of their Arms; not to depart
from their Quarters; to repair punctually to their Colours when they
were to mount the Guard; to march thither in order with their Arms
shoulder'd, every one in File following his Leader; and not to quit the
Company without leave of their Officer; not to go off the Guard; to
perform the Centinels duty exactly; not to quarrel; to obey even the
meanest Officers; not to wrong, or purloin from any one; and lastly, not
to swear. To which I added, that if I found any reluctancy in observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all these things (though it was with great concern, that I found my
self obliged to represent to them, what it was fit they all should know) I
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100923:51"/>
should have the first trouble, being constrain'd by the King's order, both
to see them observed by others, and to practice them my self, in giving the
first example: That I advis'd every one to consider how far his fortunes
were concern'd in this case, since the pleasing or displeasing the King
was the consequence of it: That being bound to give his Majesty an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of such as should not discharge their duty, I was my self oblig'd to
do it too, of those who should faithfully perform it; which would be a
certain means for them, either to obtain some command in the Army, or
to exclude themselves for ever; and that I did now promise all them
that behave themselves honourably, to set a just value upon their services,
and to sollicit the King that they might be well rewarded.</p>
               <p>To this remonstrance they reply'd, that they were all as willing and
ready to obey as I could desire. But the licentious part of them did not
speak their hearts: For, as shame would not suffer them to quit the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
so the glory they affected, to continue independent, made them
resolve to shake off a yoke, which they thought below them to submit
to. They intended to live on, as they had us'd to do; that is, without
being subject to any command: These for the most part were such as
serv'd in the quality of Cadets, who look'd upon themselves as privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
by their birth to be above these Rules, which they fancy'd were
not made for them; as they show'd by all their Extravagances, and
particularly the expence in their Cloaths, which were very near as rich
as their Officers.</p>
               <p>II. The first time it came to our turn to mount the Guard, being all
repair'd to their Colours, I acquainted them with the Order they were
to observe in their March; which was, to go four and four abreast
through the City; and that when we went to <hi>St. Germains,</hi> such as had
Horses were not to mount them, till we were out of <hi>Paris;</hi> adding,
that they ought not to scruple the doing what I would do first my self
to give them an example, and that they were free to quit their Arms, and
take their Horses, when I should given them away my Pike, and mount
mine. After having given this order, I made them take their ranks
four abreast, and marched my self at the head of them on foot, with my
Pike in my hand: They observ'd this order a pretty while. But these
young Gentlemen, I spoke of before, thinking their honour concern'd to
distinguish themselves from common Souldiers, began to take greater li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
to give their Arms to their men to carry, and march out of their
Ranks: I made them return to their Arms, and their Ranks again, by
touching them in point of honour, upon the word they had pass'd punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to obey me. But three or four of them, thinking this a fit occasion
to make themselves taken notice of by all the Company, neglected these
orders as before; I then proceeded to menaces, declaring aloud, that I
would have them punished, upon which they return'd to their duty.</p>
               <p>One of these young Cadets named <hi>du Buisson,</hi> a man of birth and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
but withal a little proud too, having again laid aside his Musquet, I
commanded the Serjeant to correct him, but he not daring to do it, and
the Cadet taking his Arms again, and putting himself into his Rank, laid
them aside a fourth time. I went, and took the Serjeant's Halbert, who
had not dared to do as I commanded him, and with it gave this Cadet
four or five good bangs; who told me, that he was a Gentleman: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
not very well considering what I did, I drew my Sword, and gave
him some blows with the flat of it; which the Gentleman took very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100923:51"/>
without daring to give a word more; and from this time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
not a man ever offer'd to go out of his Rank, and every one obey'd
me with a perfect submission. Insomuch that the King himself soon took
notice of a great alteration in the Company, and took himself so parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
a care of it, that I having told him there was amongst our men one
Cadet of ill example, and he having thereupon commanded me to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shier
him, when I made some difficulty of it, and told him that he was
related to some of our Officers, said, he would cashier him himself then,
and would tell his friends of it.</p>
               <p>In the mean while every body was buzzing me in the Ear, that <hi>Buisson</hi>
was likely to resent so publick a correction; and yet I had no reason to
believe it, for he made no outward shew of any such thing; and from
a very disorderly man, was grown the soberest and most regular of the
whole Company: nay, he gave me a visit about three weeks after, to
ask my pardon; and acknowledge the favour I had done him in that
chastisement; telling me withal, that if ever he made a good man, he
should think himself oblig'd to me for his reformation. These words
surpriz'd me, and gave me great hopes of him; and indeed his whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
was agreeable to them: which made me tell him, how glad I
was to find him of so generous a temper; and I assur'd him, that he should
find an equal change in my respect for him, as he was changed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to his duty; promising withal, to do him the best service I could
to the King. He repeated the same thing to me two months after, and
for eight months that he continu'd in the Regiment, behav'd himself af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the same manner. Which gave me all the reason in the world to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that all resentments of what had past between us were quite laid
aside. So well had he studied to dissemble his design, by an evenness of
humour, and fair comportment; such as might seem incredible in a <hi>French</hi>
Gentleman, which Nation rae usually of a temper more open, and less
capable of disguise. But at length, he came to me with a Letter from
his Father, who had sent for him, and entreated his dismission, which I
easily granted; and thereupon he again made a publick acknowledgment
of the favours he had receiv'd from me; as I on my side assur'd him I
would neglect no opportunity of doing him service: And then he told
me he was to take Post next morning for <hi>Touraine,</hi> which was his native
Country.</p>
               <p>III. About two days after, some that had been present at this parting,
came to tell me, that they feared <hi>Buisson</hi> had mischief in his heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was not yet gone out of Town, as he said he would. I then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to suspect as well as they, but since I could do nothing to prevent
him, and considering how distant from any kind of resentment his whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
had appear'd, made as though I did not believe it, and carry'd my
self so that no body could suppose I did. In the mean while, he k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>owing I was
to be upon the Guard at <hi>St. Germains,</hi> took the time when I was to return,
which that he might be more certainly informed of, he went to enquire for
me at my Lodging, upon pretence of making me a parting visit: And there
being told, that I was to come back at night, he went to wait for me upon
the Road betwixt <hi>Montmartre,</hi> and <hi>le Roullo.</hi> Seeing me at some distance
coming alone, he put on to a gentle trot, and made directly up to me.
Assoon as ever I perceiv'd him, I said within my self; Is it possible, that
Dissimulation should be so discreetly carry'd, and that so violent a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
as Revenge, can lye thus long smother'd in a <hi>French-mans</hi> bosom?
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100923:52"/>
Coming up near to one another, I gave him the time of the day, and
askt him whither he was going? He boggled a little in his answer, and
told me he was taking the air; at the same time turning his Horse, as if
he would go back with me, and rode at least a hundred paces without
speaking one word of his design. At last out it came: and then he told
me, he was very sorry to find himself oblig'd to demand a thing of me,
which seem'd so contrary to his duty; but that the extremity to which
he was reduc'd, and the necessity that lay upon him of passing otherwise
for a man utterly dishonour'd, forc'd him to it. That the affair which
had been betwixt us about eight months ago was so publick, as not to
be repair'd except by another as publick, which was the satisfaction he
requir'd for that affront. That it was with great reluctancy he made
me this request, knowing with how little rancour I had acted; but since
my intention could no way secure his honour, he knew I was too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to refuse him so just a demand.</p>
               <p>I reply'd, That his Complement surpriz'd me much after what he had
so often said; and the obligations he had formerly profest that he
had, and should as long as he liv'd, have to me, for having both done
my own duty, and reduc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d him to a regular way of living, and such as
was becoming an honest man, and a Gentleman; and askt him, whether
he could have forgot all these things, or whether they had really never
been his real sense? He made answer, that at the time when he said
them they were; and would be so still, did he not see himself absolutely
dishonour'd, and under a necessity of demanding this satisfaction. I told
him, that according to Rule I ow'd him none, having done nothing but
what was my duty to do; and that it was not customary for Officers to
give this sort of satisfaction to their private Souldiers. But I saw he was
resolv'd to have what he ask'd, and was constrain'd in spight of my heart
to do a thing that was against all order and discipline. He oblig'd me
then to alight, as he did; and it was my good fortune to have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
of which nevertheless, tho I was wounded, I made no other
use, than to preserve that to him, which he had so brutishly resolv'd to
take from me, contrary to all Justice in the world. I then told him,
that a great many other men would not have done as I did, after so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
testimonies of acknowledgment formerly made me; all which he had
now given the lye to, after a manner most unbecoming a Gentleman of his
quality. He confest what I said to be true, which made me assoon as he
got up, offer him his Sword; but for all the rage he was in, he direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told me, that having already been so great a Beast as to use it against
me, he could not promise but he might be brutish enough still to turn
upon me a second time, and therefore entreated I would keep it, and
carry it away with me.</p>
               <p>Monsieur <hi>Rambures,</hi> who at that time was hunting about <hi>Montmartre,</hi>
having seen naked Swords at some distance, and guessing easily what the
matter was, came riding full speed up to us, and found us in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I have related, both of us wounded, and one with two Swords.
He exprest a great concern, that he could not come sooner to prevent
this misfortune; but would however needs do that now, that he could
have wisht done before, which was, to make us embrace, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
upon us to forget all that had past. I then begg'd him to give Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Buisson</hi> his Sword again, which he did, and went along with us
both to <hi>Paris,</hi> where each of us having caus'd our selves to drest, were
soon cur'd, for neither was much hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:100923:52"/>
IV. But this unlucky business, which I could have wish'd might have
been kept secret, was shortly after made publick. For some people, who
envied my fortune, made use of this occasion to represent me ill to the
King; who was strangely surpriz'd to hear such news, and extremely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
at me upon it. Monsieur <hi>Saligny,</hi> who was acquainted with the
whole truth of the Story, endeavoured to excuse me, by telling the
King, that I could not possibly have done otherwise, and that I was to
defend my own life. Monsieur <hi>Rambures</hi> too, who had been an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witness
of the action, spoke to his Majesty, and told the thing as much
in my favour as he could. But all this would not satisfy the King, who
still shewed himself very angry, by reason of the ill impressions some
back-friends of mine had made upon him. In the mean while, though I
had intimation given me, that ill offices had been done me to the King,
yet I kept on mounting the Guard, as I us'd to do, being resolv'd to lay
the naked truth before his Majesty, if he should think fit to speak to me
about it. And having one day presented my self before him, he gave
me a look full of indignation, and when the rest of the company went
out of the room, he commanded me to stay. Then he ask'd me, how I
had the considence to appear in his presence, after the fault I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and if this was the order I intended to restore in the Regiment
by my example; that the least Cadet might challenge an Officer, and
that a man should be thought wanting to his own honour, if he refuse
to answer him? Whether I had not foreseen all the consequences of this
action, which being of so pernicious example to all the Officers and Soldiers,
particularly offended him in his own person, and made it plain to all
the world, that he was mistaken in the judgment he had made of me; for
whereas he took me for a sober discreet person, I had now forfeited all
that good opinion, by so irregular, so unworthy a management of my self.
To this he added threats too, telling me, he was very near letting all
the world know, in my person, that no Officer can never be allow'd to
fight a private Souldier; but if, as a mark of particular favour, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
to punish me as I deserv'd, yet I was unworthy to approach his
person any more; and as for <hi>Buisson,</hi> he would make him a publick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
for he should be shot to death.</p>
               <p>The King had no sooner ended these words but he turn'd about, and
was leaving me; but feeling my self cut to the very heart, I threw my self
at his feet, humbly begging his pardon, and telling him how infinitely I was
afflicted, that I had incurr'd his displeasure: I told him I acknowledg'd
his Justice, and the truth of every thing he had said to me; but if his
Majesty would grant me this further favour to hear me, I hop'd, that
tho the action I had done was criminal in it self, yet the particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of it might make me appear less guilty; but nevertheless, that
I durst not attempt to justifie my self, unless his Majesty would first as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
me, that he would have the goodness to hear me. The King, mov'd
with the passion I was in, answer'd in a milder tone, that he gave me
leave to speak. I began then to do it, in the manner I thought most
proper to qualifie his opinion of that which he thought most criminal
in the action, and so as might tend to justifie both of us, rather than to
vindicate my self singly, to the prejudice of <hi>Buisson.</hi> Your Majesty may
please to remember (said I) what condition I found the Company in,
when you did me the honour to give me the Lieutenancy of it, and the
strict Orders I receiv'd to restore the ancient discipline there. Having
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100923:53"/>
a young Gentleman to deal with, whom the general disorder had made
ungovernable, and who by a false punctilio of honour, valued himself
upon being independent on the Officers, I proceeded against him with all
the severity, that to me seem'd necessary, for the reducing him to his duty,
and restraining the rest by his example. 'Tis true, the method I took was a
little violent, and if I may presume to say so, a little inconsistent with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of a young Gentleman, who had lived at large, and who thought it his
glory to be under no Government. But yet, as hot and wilful as he was,
he came to himself, acknowledged the justice of his correction, and the
good I had done in chastizing him after that manner, he became a patern
of submission and discretion to the whole Company; so that every body
return<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to their former order, and your Majesty was very well satisfied
with the regulation. But, Sir, there are a sort of men, who because they
can do no good themselves, are impatient that any body else should;
and some of these afterwards perverted this young Gentleman, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him, that his honour was lost, and he had no courage, if he did not
require satisfaction for this affront; and that a Gentleman of his birth and
quality ought to esteem his honour dearer than his life. These strange
impressions, Sir, and ill counsels of rash people, that are falsly jealous of
anothers honor, was the thing that push'd on Monsieur <hi>Buisson</hi> to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity;
who, knowing well enough, that I was a man strict in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
of my duty, and one that would never consent to an action so
contrary to the Rules of military discipline; because he would unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
engage me, to give him, what he was put upon requiring of me, laid
wait for my coming back from <hi>St. Germains,</hi> watch'd me upon the Road,
and after he had put himself out of my Company, and received his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
from me, compell'd me to that satisfaction, which he never
would have dared to demand in any other place, where I could have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
him. In this circumstance, Sir, said I, there was no course could
be taken, but either to run away, or to do as I did: So that having up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this occasion only obey'd the indispensable Laws of Nature, which
command us to defend our selves when we are assaulted; I dare promise
my self thus much from your Majesty's Justice, that you will pronounce
me as innocent, as I had been criminal, and worthy of death, had what
has been represented to your Majesty been true, that I had voluntarily
fought with a Cadet of my own Company. I do therefore, Sir, most
humbly beseech your Majesty to give judgment upon the case, and rather
to believe what I say, and swear in the presence of God, than what may
have been told you, by such as are not so well inform'd of the truth of
the business; or that perhaps have proceeded upon some private spleen
against us both.</p>
               <p>This discourse of mine so wrought upon the King, that he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
perfectly overcome by it, so that his Majesty reply'd, That indeed
he did not understand the business before, to be as I had now related it
to him; nor had he heard any thing of this last circumstance, which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much alter'd the quality of the action: but though he might see some
reason to excuse me, and pardon this fault, which he look'd upon as
done against my will, yet <hi>Buisson</hi> was absolutely inexcusable; since having
at first been so discreet as to receive his chastisement as became him, he
was but the more guilty in hearkning to the counsels of rash, giddy
young Fellows, and by so ill an action giving the lye to all the good
conduct he had shew'd before: That to way-lay his Lieutenant upon a
common road, to assault him, and drive him to a necessity of defending
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100923:53"/>
himself, was a crime not only against him who was attackt, but all the
Officers of the Regiment were concern'd, and all injur'd in this action;
which being an example of so pernicious consequence, he would have it
punish'd accordingly, and that Justice should be done upon him.</p>
               <p>V. Finding the King's countenance change, and clearing up towards me,
I thought I might take the liberty to move him still farther in favour of
him, whom he had condemn'd to dye; and from a suppliant in my own
case, to become intercessor for another: And I had that hope in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
goodness, to belive that he would rather incline to my humble
request, in regard I interested my self for the person that had injur'd me.
I then humbly besought him not to be angry, if after the pardon he had been
graciously pleased to grant me for my self, I had the boldness to presume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
begging this young Gentlemans, upon whom his Justice intended the
whole weight of the punishment should fall. I told him, that his action,
though criminal, yet seeming rather to have been the effect of ill counsel,
than ill nature, it might deserve some allowance to be made for it; that
if he should receive his life, after having so well deserv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to lose it, he
must needs think himself oblig'd ever after to devote it to his Prince's
service; that it would be the greatest affliction in the world to me, to
have been the occasion of the dishonour of a whole Family: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I was bold to conjure his Majesty, that he would extend his clemency
to two Criminals, who were in effect but one, seeing I should think my
self punish'd in the person of him, for whom I presum'd to speak, and that
I could not rise from his Majesty's Feet, till he had granted my request.</p>
               <p>The King, though inwardly touch'd with what I had said to him, made
answer, What! You are not content with your own pardon then, and
take upon you to move me for another! Are not you afraid of making
your self more guilty, and by that in some sort to betray, that you have
the greatest share in the fault of him, for whom you intercede, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
you ought to be the first man that should desire to have it punish'd! But
nevertheless, I know your temper, and forgive the excess of your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
I give him the life you beg of me, and I give it as the greatest
testimony of my acknowledging your services. But for examples sake,
and the publick satisfaction, I will have him brought to Tryal, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
entred against him: that in the mean time he may retire into <hi>Holland,</hi>
and not return, till there be no more talk of this business, and I have
granted him a formal Pardon.</p>
               <p>It is impossible for me to express the joy and grateful acknowledgments,
that these words raised in my breast, I embrac'd the King's knees, and
having return'd my thanks more by sighs and tears, than words, I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
out of the Chamber.</p>
               <p>When the Lords of the Court were come into the room, the King told
them all, after what manner he had humbled me, and how he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
he ought to chastise me for the fault I had committed, declaring
at the same time, that, though he had forborn to punish me with greater
severity, in regard of the services I had done him, he would yet make
<hi>Buisson</hi> and example, and have him condemn'd in a Council of War to be
shot to death; which made the whole Court believe, that he really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have him executed, not any one knowing the extraordinary
grace his Majesty had promis'd me in his favour.</p>
               <p>In the mean time I went to look out Monsieur <hi>Buisson,</hi> and told him all
that had past, and gave him assurance, that during his absence in <hi>Holland,</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:100923:54"/>
I would omit no occasion of using my utmost endeavour for his return,
and putting him into a condition to expose that life for the King's Service,
which he now ow'd to his Mercy. The poor young man was so astonish'd
to see the strange way I had taken to revenge my self upon him, that
he was able to say no more than this, that he was extremely confounded,
and that now I had repaid his brutal passion with the greatest generosity I
could possibly express, he had nothing more to offer in return, but his
life, which should ever be as much mine as his own; that he should from
thence forward look upon me as a second Father, and was resolv'd ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
to depend upon me, and my conduct. Whereupon we embrac'd,
and he went to make himself ready for his Journey into <hi>Holland.</hi> His
affair was shortly after debated in a Council of War, where he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,
but being got out of the way, they lookt no farther after him.</p>
               <p>VI. The King for a good while after put on some coldness to me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
company, tho in private he was as kind to me as ever. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the meaning of it well enough, and behav'd my self the best I could
to second his Majesty's design. But I was still wanting for some occasion
to procure Monsieur <hi>Buisson</hi>'s return, and a whole year escap'd me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever discovering any hopes of it. At last I resolv'd to be bold once
again, and observe measures less than ever, in an affair where I thought
my intercession not unlikely to prevail. A Lieutenant of the Regiment
of <hi>Normandy</hi> was at that time very sick at <hi>Paris,</hi> the moment I heard
of his death, I conceiv'd I ought to take this opportunity to serve the
man; whose being at a distance was a great affliction to me; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
I went forthwith to the King. I told him at first, without laying
open my design, that I was come humbly to entreat a favour of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
which was the Command of such a Lieutenant just now dead. The
King, as far as I could guess, presently suspected for whom I made this
suit, but not willing to let me know that he penetrated into my thoughts,
he satisfy'd himself with telling me, that he must first know what I would
do with it, and whom I intended it for. I answer'd, that it was for a
friend of mine, whom I would take the liberty to name, as soon as his
Majesty should have done me the honour to assure me of the place. Is
it not for <hi>Buisson?</hi> (reply'd the King) for I know your temper, and do
almost read it in your heart. Ah! Sir, (said I) thus to penetrate into
ones thoughts is to be truly a Prophet; and doubtless I ought to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to have none but good ones, since your Majesty hath such piercing eyes.
'Tis true, Sir, I am heartily sorry to see this young Gentleman, who is capable
of doing your Majesty good service, so long out of a condition to shew it;
and I take the confidence to hope your Majesty will compleat the favour
you have so generously begun, in giving him, who holds his life from your
goodness, an opportunity of employing it all in your service. The King,
mov'd with this pressing importunity in behalf of one who had so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disoblig'd me, was most graciously pleas'd to say, that it was not in his
power to deny me any thing, and that the generosity of this request en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
him to grant that, which regularly ought not to be granted.</p>
               <p>With this promise of the King, which filled me with great joy, I went
home, and immediately dispatch'd away an express Messenger into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to Monsieur <hi>Buisson,</hi> to bid him presently come away to me, about
some business of very great consequence. Accordingly he was soon at
<hi>Paris,</hi> where having told me, that he very well understood he was afresh
oblig'd to me for the favour of his liberty, seeing that I brought him to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100923:54"/>
a place, from which his ill behaviour had constrain'd him to fly: I made
answer, that it was the King to whom he was oblig'd for all; and now
especially for a favour he did not expect, which was a Lieutenant's place
in the Regiment of <hi>Normandy,</hi> for that his Majesty had conferr'd upon
him, and upon this account it was that I sent for him: To which I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that I would carry him to kiss the King's hand, that he might in
person pay his acknowledgments for so very exceeding a favour, which
engag'd him to lay out the rest of his life upon his Majesty's service, and
that therefore he should be in a readiness to go along with me that Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Louvre.</hi> This poor Gentleman, very well understanding from
what hand his Lieutenancy came, was so confounded, that he had not
one word at command to return me thanks in, and therefore did it only
in dumb shew. I carried him at night to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and having first askt
his Majesty's leave to present him, I brought him in. As soon as he came
into his presence, he threw himself at the King's feet, without speaking
otherwise than by his posture, and profound humiliation. The King
then told him, he was happy in having such a man as I to deal with, who
after such an injury, had made it my business to obtain the pardon of
him who wrong'd me to that degree; a thing that he could not have
granted to any other, and that very few besides me would have dar'd to
ask it: That therefore he would let him know, that he was oblig'd to
me both for his Life and his Command, which he gave him upon my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
that all these things laid together oblig'd him to look upon me
for the future as his Benefactor, and to repair the wrong, and the fault
he had been guilty of against the whole body of the Army, by a life and
behaviour proportionable to the sense he ought to have of so extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
a favour. Respect, Joy, and Grief all at once made so strong an
impression upon the mind of Monsieur <hi>Buisson,</hi> that he could not return
one syllable of answer to the King; but as he came into the room with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
daring to speak, so he went out again without being able to do it.
Which also pleas'd his Majesty more, than if he had made a long Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
for he judged better of the sentiments of his heart, by this
respectful silence, than he could have done by any studied harrangue.</p>
               <p>I afterwards sued out his Pardon, and procured the Commission for
his Command, and got him admitted into the Regiment; where I am
able to say, that he acquir'd a great deal of esteem, having perfectly
made good what was expected from him, and passing for one of he
bravest men in the Army. He also very faithfully obey'd the command
his Majesty laid on him, always to consider me as his faithful friend. For
both from an effect of his natural inclination, and the deep sense he had of
the service I had done him, he ever after lived with me, as with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by which name also he us'd to call me. And I shall take notice in
the following part of these Memoirs, that having heard I was embroil'd
in a business of such consequence that my head was in danger, he came post
from a very remote place to <hi>Rochel,</hi> where I then was, to make me a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his life and fortune.</p>
               <p>VII. The course I took with another Cadet, was yet more severe than
this with Monsieur <hi>Buisson,</hi> and had an effect no less successful, to the
making him a good man, and winning his heart absolutely. Having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
into my Company a young Gentleman, a Relation of our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's,
the Count <hi>de Saligny,</hi> that so I might train him up, as I did several
others, in the Art of War; I told him at first, that as he had the honour
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100923:55"/>
to be Monsieur <hi>Saligny</hi>'s Kinsman, so it would be necessary that he should
become an example to the whole Company. I then commanded a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant
to lodge him with another Cadet; but this young man was so ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned,
and so perverse, that he with whom I had quarter'd him, soon
begg'd of me to part them, for he could not live any longer with such a
Mad-man. I had also complaints from all hands of his violences and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies;
nay he was of so devilish a disposition, and so unbecoming
his quality, to go at nights and stand in corners of streets to watch for
peoples passing, taking singular pleasure to give them private thrusts
with his Sword, and all this upon no provocation, but out of meer ill
nature, and to do mischief. Hereupon I sent for him one day to my
Chamber, where with great severity I told him, that I had complaints
of him made me every day, and some of misdemeanours so foul and black, as
I durst scarce believe of a Gentleman, being unworthy even of a Porter;
that could I have perswaded my self he had been guilty of such things, I
should have done him the favour to clap him up in a Dungeon; and that
I advised him to let me hear no more such matters of him.</p>
               <p>This however could not prevail with him, but within four or five days
he fell back to his old villanies, and news was brought me, that he had
wounded a woman, an Advocate, and another man, and was fled upon
it. This news put me into a great passion, seeing all my remonstrances
so soon followed by fresh and greater extravagancies, than he had been
guilty of before. So that I immediately cried out to a Serjeant, and two
of my Servants, to take my Horses and pursue the Wretch, and bring him
to me (said I) bound hand and foot; I'll make him smart for it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they presently took the way they knew he was gone, and having
overtaken him within three leagues of the City, brought him back. I
would neither see him, nor speak to him, but immediately clapt him in a
Dungeon, charging that nothing should be given him but bread and
water. It is not to be believed to what a degree he was enraged, and
how many impertinencies his fury prompted him to utter against me: I
shall only repeat one instance of his rage, which was, that in the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sports
of his passion he would say, that if the five fingers of his hands
were five pieces of Cannon, he would level them all at <hi>Pontis,</hi> to beat
out his brains; and pound him to powder. In the mean while I thought
my self oblig'd to acquaint the King with what had past, both in regard he
was a person of quality, and Monsieur <hi>Saligny</hi>'s Kinsman, and also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I had some reason to apprehend the consequences of this affair. The
King approved what I had done, and according to his custom, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to me the severity of discipline.</p>
               <p>After I had let this Cadet lye a month of six weeks in the Dungeon, I
had a mind to try whether it had wrought any alteration in his temper,
and to this purpose sent a Monk to sound him, and put him under some
terrours. The Father going down into the Dungeon told him, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
were upon meeting, and there was some reason to apprehend, it
was for bringing him to his Trial; that therefore he advised him to take
some care of his Conscience, and not suffer himself to be surpriz'd, and
that the least he could do was to manifest his repentance by a confession
of his faults. At this heavy news the poor young man began to quake
every bone of him, and conjur'd the Father to intercede for him to me,
saying, that he acknowledged his past offences, and that they would make
him wiser for the time to come. The Father told him he durst not speak
to me of it, I was so incens'd against him; and that he had no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100923:55"/>
but only to prevail with him to think upon his soul. This answer
troubled him yet more, and he conjur'd the Monk not to forsake him. The
Monk reply'd, that he durst not so much as come frequently to visit him,
for fear he should be suspected of some secret intelligence with him, and
by that means lose the opportunity of ever seeing him at all. This put
the Gentleman into great anxiety, to think what would become of him.
The Monk came and told me what a change he found, and how successful
a visit he had made, of which I also presently gave an account to the King,
who made me this remarkable answer: I advise you not to depend too
much upon this hasty repentance. This looks like a false penitence, and
he being of so wicked a nature, may kill you in a fit of his passion: It will
be convenient first to try whether his conversion be real, or not. Oh Sir,
(said I) I fear him not, and know very well he is so afraid of me, that I
am very confident, he will always tremble but at the sight of me.</p>
               <p>The King gave me leave to do what I thought fit, and I sent the same
Priest to my Prisoner again, to whom he confest himself with great testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of repentance, and afterwards receiv'd in the Chappel, as to
prepare himself for death. When he had scarce any hopes left, I sent for
him by a Serjeant into my Chamber. There I told him, that his Trial
being pretty far advanc'd, I thought fit to send for him, that I might
know from his own mouth, whether he was still the same man he had
been, and if he still persisted in not acknowledging his fault. Then he
threw himself at my knees, and begg'd of me to spare his life. He told
me, that he confess'd his crimes deserv'd death, but if I would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
on him, he did protest and solemnly engage, that his life should
for the future be wholly employed in the King's service, and that he
would never again commit the like disorders, confirming what he said, by
taking God to witness of the sincerity of his heart. Whereupon I told
him, that as to the saving his life, that was not wholly in my power,
but I promis'd to do what I could in order to it; and that he should on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have a care to keep his word faithfully. Then I sent him back to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
again, and let him lye there a little longer still, till his business had
been examin'd, and his Pardon obtain'd. The acknowledgment of this
favour I had Procur'd for him, when he look'd upon himself to be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than a dead man, made him love me ever after as his Father. He grew
from this time forward a very civil honest man, and was advanc'd to a
Command, in which he lost his life honourably. I was willing to shew
by this instance, that there is scarcely any disposition so preverse, but it
may be reclaim'd, and that there are some seasons, when we must not be
afraid to oppose the roughest Chastisements to the torrent of corrupted
habits, and brutish passions, when they are not to be dealt with by less
violent methods.</p>
               <p>VIII. The Captains of the Regiment of Guards, and one especially
above all the rest, that shall be nameless, had a long time been incens'd
against me, and born me a private grudge, because the King out of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
favour, appointed my Quarters before all the other Lieutenants,
when he went into the Field; but yet the greater part durst not make
any open discoveries of there hatred me, only one there was, who out
of spight, seiz'd upon the lodging his Majesty had assign'd me; and lay
in my very bed, where I found him at my return from the King. But
being not yet assur'd with what intention he had done it, I would make
no bustle, but went and lay all night upon the Straw. The next day, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100923:56"/>
of excusing himself, he told me plainly, that I must go seek out some
other Lodging. This was more than enough to set us together by the ears;
but age and experience having taught me a little to moderate my passion,
I only told him, that it was my humour to content my self with what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to me, and for that matter, since it was the King's favour to me,
is was not for him to oppose it, and the King himself was the person to
whom he was to make his complaint.</p>
               <p>The King being inform'd of the business, declar'd himself very much
dissatisfy'd with it, and said, He was free to do what he pleas'd in his
own Kingdom, and that it was not for Captains to King it with him,
and controul what he did in favour to any particular Officer, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
attended his person: Declaring at the same time, that the Captains
should not have their lodgings markt out any more, but they should lye
where they pleas'd in the Quarters that should be assigned them. This
nettled them to the quick, and they waited only for some fair occasion
to be reveng'd on me. My Company was at that time the first of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment,
by reason of the great number of Cadets of Quality, whom their
Parents did me the honour to commit to my care, that I might bring them
up in the first exercises of War; and I had there among the rest, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal
<hi>de St. Geran</hi>'s Son, of whom I shall have occasion to say more by
and by.</p>
               <p>IX. One day, being upon the Guard at <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> as another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
was coming on to relieve us, and I had thoughts, according to my
custom, to go back with mine to <hi>Montereau,</hi> which was our Quarters,
the King call'd me out of his Window, where he stood to see the Tilting,
and running at the Ring, which were then doing in the Court below. I
presently went up, and being come into his Chamber, orders were given
me to send away my Company, and to stay my self about his person. I
went then presently to look out the Serjeants, and gave them order, as
his Majesty had expressly commanded, that they should be very careful
to prevent all quarrels, especially among the Cadets, (who stood mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon their honour, not to put up any thing from one another) and
also not to let any one stay and drink by the way, by reason of the disputes
which are often occasioned by Wine. I had once a mind, by a sort of
prophetic fear of the misfortune that happened, to detain the Mareschal of
<hi>St. Geran</hi>'s Son with me, whose forward humour, and too generous Soul
made me eternally uneasy for him. But at last, I know not how, I let
him go back with the rest.</p>
               <p>That very day in the month of <hi>May,</hi> 1624. the King had resolv'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
causing Collonel <hi>Ornano</hi> to be apprehended, who in the Evening
came into his Chamber, and was entertained by his Majesty as formerly,
with all the kindness imaginable. The King talked with him a great
while about a Chase the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> was to make next morning in
the Forrest of <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> asking him very familiarly, what ways they
had best to hunt, because he was well experienc'd in the Forrest, and
knew all the least, and blindest paths of it. At last the hour design'd for
his Arrest being come, Monsieur <hi>Hallier,</hi> Captain of the Guard at that
time, and several other Officers came into the Chamber. Now it is the
custom, when the Captain of the Guard is upon entring, for the Usher to
give three blows upon the threshold of the door, which was also the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
the King had given for his own retiring. So then his Majesty hearing
the three stroaks, bid Collonel <hi>Ornano</hi> good night, and withdrew into
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100923:56"/>
another room, whither I also followed him, according to the order he
had given me. Immediately Monsieur <hi>Hallier</hi> came in, and making up
to Monsieur <hi>Ornano,</hi> gave him a very surprizing Complement; which was,
that he was sorry to tell him he had orders to secure his person. How!
(said the Collonel in great amazement) I am but just now come from the
King, and he receiv'd me with all the kindness in the world; let me
speak to him however. Monsieur <hi>Hallier</hi> told him, he had no order to
suffer that, and he entreated him to give leave, that he might execute
what orders he had; that as for any other matters, his own innocency
ought to support him with a good assurance, and put him out of fear.
Monsieur <hi>Ornano</hi> then seeing himself under a necessity of obeying, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
the Captain of the Guards, who led him into the chamber of <hi>Saint
Louis,</hi> which was appointed to ferve him for a Prison.</p>
               <p>At the very moment he was arrested, the King, supposing that some
of his Family would not fail to make all possible speed to <hi>Paris,</hi> that
they might secure his Papers, gave me and three Officers more orders to
go into the Forrest, that we might lye upon the great Road, and stop
all that should attempt to pass that way. So we divided our selves into
two and two, and about eleven at night took our separate posts, upon
each of the Roads; where we waited a great while before any body
appear'd. At last we saw at some distance a man mounted upon a <hi>Spanish</hi>
Gennet, that came galloping full speed toward us. Our orders were
not to shoot, and so the other Officer and I resolv'd to turn our Horses
head to head across the way, when he came up near us, that so we might
stop his passage. But this man, who was admirably well mounted, shew'd
us a trick for our trick, and without any manner of concern, riding full
drive upon us, he gave us such a brush, as threw my Companion and his
Horse above ten paces off: We never thought of pursuing him, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it had been to no purpose, he being so much better mounted; and
I for my part was not sorry we had been thus broke through, for the
respect I bore to Collonel <hi>Ornano.</hi> I went back to give the King an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of what had past, who only laught heartily at the story.</p>
               <p>X. But that very morning I had most afflicting news brought me: For
the Serjeants of my Company not having executed my commands as they
ought, some Cadets stopt at <hi>Moret,</hi> and the Wine being got into their
Heads, they quarrell'd, and fought three to three, so desperately, that
two of them were kill'd upon the spot, one of which was Mareschal <hi>St.
Geran</hi>'s Son; and two more very dangerously wounded. When this news
came to <hi>Fontainbleau</hi> it put me almost out of my wits: I went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to wait on the King, and tell him of it first, humbly beseeching
him to remember the order he had given me, that I should stay that night
about his person. Whereupon his Majesty commanded me to go and
tell the Mareschal <hi>de St. Geran</hi> my self, and promis'd to make my peace
with him. I went, but very unwillingly God knows, having so sad news
to carry; and I had scarce began to speak, but he understood me at half
a word, and askt presently if his Son was kill'd? I did my best to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
him by considerations meerly humane, thinking more of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
his Honour, than his Salvation; and at last entreated him to do
me the justice upon this occasion, not to impute this misfortune to me,
whom a positive order from the King had put out of a capacity to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it. He answer'd me with all the goodness I could expect, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
lockt himself up in his Closet. The King sent shortly after to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100923:57"/>
let him know that he bore a part of his grief with him; and when he
came to return his thanks, his Majesty, after comforting him with all
the expressions of a particular tenderness, did me the honour to justifie
me to him, and to assure him that I was in no fault at all; to which the
Mareschal reply'd, with all the Civility imaginable, that he was very
far from accusing me, that he knew me too well to lay the misfortune to
my charge, and that he should always love me, at the same rate he
had ever done.</p>
               <p>But the Captains of the Regiment, who were all of them very angry
at me, for the reason I gave before, thought this a favourable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to do me an ill office with the King. For not knowing that I
stay'd behind at <hi>Fontainbleau</hi> by his express command, they came all in a
body, and entreated leave of his Majesty, to proceed against me in the
ordinary methods of Justice; giving him to understand, that some Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants
thought it below them to do their duty, and to attend their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
and lov'd to be at Court, and by that means were the cause of
infinite disorders. The King, who very well knew their malice against
me, and the private jealousie that animated them to it, would not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
take any notice to them, but let them go on, and prefer their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations.
But as soon as they were perfected; and they came to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
them to his Majesty, he took them, and told him, he would take
care to have them examin'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But afterwards he threw them into the fire,
and gave the Provost order to stop all farther prosecutions. This made
them understand too late, that they had committed an errour, in attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a person, whom the King honour'd with his particular protection, and
in whose favour he so openly declar'd himself.</p>
               <p>XI. Some years after the King had given me a Lieutenancy in the Guards,
he sent me to <hi>Fort-Louis</hi> with a private Commission, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d upon an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that he would have no body know, but me only. Monsieur <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauld,</hi>
Camp-master to the Regiment of <hi>Champagne,</hi> and Governour of
this Fort, was at that time in great repute for his knowledge and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
in War, and in all the arts of Military Discipline. He was equally
prudent and bold in his undertakings, and no less successful in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them. The prudence of his conduct made him admir'd, even by
those who were above him in birth and command, and there seem'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wanting, to restore the old <hi>Roman</hi> Discipline in <hi>France,</hi> but his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made General of the King's Forces. One may truly say too, that
<hi>France</hi> owes part of the glory of destroying <hi>Rochel,</hi> that Cittadel of the
<hi>Hugonots,</hi> to him, for he first began by <hi>Fort-Louis</hi> of which he was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
to block up the City, and cut the Inhabitants off from ravaging
the Country, till the King afterwards came to make himself Master of
this important place. This great reputation that Monsieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> had,
both in the Armies and at Court, was the cause, why the King, who
hath ever had a natural inclination to all the concerns of War, desired to
learn his methods of drawing up men, and exercise, and discipline. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
therefore to employ some one of his Officers, in a thing impossible
for him to learn in his own person; he cast his eyes on me, as one proper
to keep the secret, and likely to inform him of what he had a mind to
know. He intrusted me with his design, and told me, that to make the
matter more private, I should first take a Journey into <hi>Provence,</hi> and go
from thence to <hi>Fort-Louis,</hi> to pass some time in the quality of a Volunteer
with this Governour, as if more particularly to instruct my self in a trade,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100923:57"/>
for which all the world knew I had a great passion. He gave me order
to stay there, till he sent for me, and till I had exactly observ'd all the
particulars he had a mind to learn, but he expresly forbad me to tell any
man alive, that I went thither by his command.</p>
               <p>With these instructions away I went, not so far as <hi>Provence,</hi> but from
<hi>Lions</hi> turn'd toward <hi>Rochel,</hi> and so directly to <hi>Fort-Louis,</hi> to lye at a
Gentleman's quarter, with whom I had been acquainted when I was in
the Regiment of <hi>Champagne.</hi> He receiv'd me with several testimonies of
friendship, telling me, that I must of necessity go wait upon the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
who was very exact in his Discipline, and expected an account of
every one that came into the Garrison. This was just as I would have it,
and accordingly he carried me to him two days after. Being not known
to Monsieur <hi>Arnauld,</hi> or at least believing my self not to be so, I told him,
his great reputation had drawn me thither, and that having eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> from
my youth been strongly inclin'd to make my self expe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> in martial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
I was come with a design to be instructed under him, and to serve
some time in his Garrisons a Volunteer, that I might try to improve by his
judgment, in observing what he made to be practis'd by his Troops in
their exercises, and in practising the same my self the best that possibly I
could, under his command. He reply'd, that he had indeed made it his
particular business and study, to understand his profession, and thought
he might say, that he had made some little progress in it by his pains and
experience; and that he hop'd, if he liv'd any time, to settle part of the
antient discipline once again among his Souldiers. The openness he us'd
in the end of his discourse, gave me some suspicion, that I might possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be known to him, though he were not to me. And he being one of
a piercing wit, might perhaps think, that I came to pass some time there
by private orders from the King, for he added at last in a very obliging
way, that I did him honour in coming to learn under him, what he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had acquir'd with great pains; that he promis'd to conceal no part of
his knowledge from me, and that he would keep me there, and shew me
every thing. I return'd his civility the best I could, but entreated him
to consent, that I might perform all the exercises as a Volunteer, so to
learn things more exactly, and be able to do them with the better grace.</p>
               <p>Thus I staid with him about three months, eating almost every day at
his own Table, and keeping near his person as much as I could, and study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what I came to learn with extraordinary application of mind. And I
can truly say, that though I had some knowledge and experience before,
having been bred up from a Child in War, yet I learnt a great deal in a
little time under so good a Master, and knew several things which were
not practis'd by others. For being happy in his inclination for me, and
I having one too for the Art he excell'd in, I improv'd both by practice
and exercise, and by the private conferences he was pleas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to honour
me withal, and learnt a great deal of that, which made him so great a
Souldier, and gave him such esteem in the world, I took great care to
set down whatever I learnt that was new, and drew out upon Paper
several schemes of Exercises, Battalions, Encampments, Marches and
Defiles, pretty well guessing what would best please the King.</p>
               <p>XII. At this very time one of the Captains was upon ill terms with his
<hi>Maistre de Camp,</hi> who complained of him, that he scarce ever came at his
Company, and when any command in it fell, he still procur'd it for some
of his own Relations, without regarding merit, as he ought to have done.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100923:58"/>
It was no wonder, that one so exact for discipline, should blame an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
who observ'd it so little; and who having more respect to fitness and
services, than to affinity, should condemn conduct so unlike his own.
For whenever he observ'd any brave Souldier, who had serv'd the King
well in his Armies, he would without any notice taken of his quality, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
him the recompence of some command in the Regiment, which was
a great encouragement to others, who saw, that under such a Governour
honourable employments were made the reward of doing well. This
different conduct then produc'd a misunderstanding; which was increas'd
upon a particular occasion. The Ensign of this Captain's Company being
dead, Monsieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> desir'd the Colours might be given to a very brave
Serjeant, who had signaliz'd himself in several actions that merited re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
The Captain on the contrary would give it to one of his own
Kinsmen, who seem'd to have no other Title to this command, but that of
being related to him; and Monsieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> having sent him a very civil
Letter, took it ill to be deny'd, of which he complain'd highly, and
spoke of him, as a person that sought all opportunities to disoblige him.</p>
               <p>I, who had the honour to be this Captain's near Relation, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Friend, and who had so many engagements to Monsieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> too,
thought my self concern'd to manage this business, and to do a piece of
service to both of them at once. I told Monsieur <hi>Arnauld,</hi> that having
the honour to be particularly acquainted with this Officer, I knew him
in his own temper very far from this disobliging carriage, which he seem'd
not without some reason to resent upon this occasion; that I could not
impute this refusal to any thing but pure misfortune, and some misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
that he had Enemies, and that a man when absent easily
passes for more guilty, than he really is. I engag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d my self at the same
time to write to him, and it was my good fortune to manage the matter
with so good success, as to bring them to a very fair understanding of
one another.</p>
               <p>XIII. A few days after this difference was compos'd, I receiv'd a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Order from the King to return to Court. I knew very well that the
Governour, who was grown kinder to me, by reason of my great assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity
and constant application, would be much troubled at my going
away, so that I was fain to prepare him for it, lest a sudden departure should
give him any reason to accuse me of being less grateful than his obliging
entertainment of me deserv'd. So I signify'd to him the indispensable
necessity of my returning to <hi>Paris,</hi> upon business of great consequence.
He was very importunate for my stay, and offer'd me any thing in the
Regiment, that was in his power; but he found at last I could not help
going, and perhaps suspected too (as I hinted before) the true reason of
my coming thither, and so left me at full liberty to follow my own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.
After which I staid with him a few days longer, and in that time
was witness of a very generous act of his, which deserves a room in these
<hi>Memoirs.</hi> As we were going the Round with him one night, he stept
alone a little before to hearken what the Souldiers said, who were very
loud in their Hutt; where he heard one of them begin his health, and
the rest took him up, cursing and railing in very insolent and injurious
terms. At first indeed he was a little surpriz'd, to find the Governor's
health so odly receiv'd, but knowing how naturally men are inclin'd to
licentiousness, and how far this inclination works with some sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and how great a violence it is upon them to be reduc'd to so exact a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100923:58"/>
discipline as that he made them observe; he was not angry, but turn'd all
into raillery, and calling me to him, These are rare Fellows (said he)
they drink my health after a strange fashion, and make fine Panegyricks
in my praise. Then he continu'd his Round, and visited all the streets,
and at last coming again to the door of these precious Health-drinkers he
knock'd. They within, whom the Wine had a little elevated, answer'd
briskly, Who comes there? The Governor reply'd with Authority, Open
the door; which they, being a little astonish'd to hear his voice, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
did. He only ask'd them, why they were not in bed so long after
the Tat-too, to which they made answer, that they humbly begg'd his
pardon, but having by his leave been out to forrage, and got something,
they were merry together, drinking the King's health, and his. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
throwing them some Gold, and giving them caution to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
more discreetly for the future, that they should drink his health
after a more decent manner; they transported with joy, fell down and
embrac'd his knees. Thus instead of punishing the insolence of these
Souldiers, who had dared to give him such language for the severity of
his discipline, he rather chose to win them by gentle ways, and vanquish
them by his bounty.</p>
               <p>Nor can I forbear in this place to report another action yet more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
than the former, as indeed the occasion was more important. He
was very punctual in keeping his Regiment always full, and in this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
consulted both the Kings advantage, and his own inclination;
whereupon orders were given that no Skip-jacks or intruders should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
upon the review of the Companies. One of the Captains of his
Regiment fail'd in this point, and upon being reproved, took such offence,
that he broke out into a passion, openly declar'd he would not obey
the order, and was so far transported at last, as even to draw his Sword
upon his Collonel. This revolt needed the Kings authority to suppress
it, which made Monsieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> write to Court, and represent the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
consequences of so rash an action, if it past unpunisht. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the King commanded that the Captain should be broken; and this
great example wrought its due effect upon the Garrison. In the mean
while, the Officer humbled to the last degree by this disgrace, was sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of his fault, when it seem'd irreparable. Monsieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> had
notice of it, and resenting what was past no farther than was necessary
to promote the Kings real Interests, he writ to Court a second time, and
conjur'd the Ministers to procure this Captains resta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ration; entreating
them to consider, that it was of more consequence to a Governour to
make himself lov'd than fear'd; and therefore this extraordinary grace
which he entreated of them, would be of no less service to the King,
than their Justice had been. His reasons prevail'd; and all the Officers
of the Regiment were so mov'd with this generosity, and the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they found their Governour in at Court, that they ever after took
a delight to please and obey him.</p>
               <p>XIV. I took my leave of Monsieur <hi>Arnauld,</hi> and went from <hi>Fort-Louis</hi>
to the King, whom I found at <hi>Compeigne;</hi> and when I presented my self,
his Majesty, the better to disguise the matter, took no notice of me at
first, and rather seem'd to be angry, asking me why I had stay'd so long?
I, who very well understood this language, readily answer'd that I had
scarce had time to obey his Majesty's orders, and had made all the haste
I could away upon his Letter. The next morning he took me alone with
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100923:59"/>
him into his Closet, and there lockt himself up, demanding an account
of what I had learnt in my Journey. I gave it him as exactly as possibly
I could; shewing him the Observations, and the Draughts I had taken.
This Prince, who took a singular delight in this noble Diversion, spent
an hour alone with me in his Closet almost every day for a month toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
making me set out all that I had done in Companies of Souldiers,
by knotted Threads, or little figures of Lead. And after he had learnt
all that I my self could learn of Monsieur <hi>Arnauld,</hi> he would command,
and be commanded in turn, as well as I, so that we did as it were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
our exercises one after another, by the ranging of these figures,
according to the different methods that I had observ'd.</p>
               <p>XV. This very particular confidence of the King's put several at Court
to a stand, who knew not what to make of my being shut up with him so
often alone. Among others the Serjeant Major of the Regiment of
Guards, grew so extremely jealous, as to tell me one day, that I had an
ill reputation among the Souldiers, and many of them began to suspect
I inform'd the King of all they did, not being able to guess from what
other cause this exceeding familiarity between his Majesty and me should
proceed. I must confess so rude a complement nettled me much, so
that I reply'd briskly, I thought till then he had known me, but what
he had said, being very distant from my nature, and constant course of
life, he made it plain that he was little read in men; that those who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
me better than he, could have no such jealousy concerning me,
and all my acquaintance (himself exeepted) were satisfy'd I'd rather
dye than do a thing so base, and unbecoming a man of honour. Must
people wonder (said I) that the King should sometimes talk to me in
private, and after having sent me into so remote a Province about seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
affairs, require of me an exact account of all I have done there? does
not all the world know this is his humour, and that he delights to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
over his business very particularly? But that which disgusted this
Officer, was, that the King had shew'd him my draught of Battalions,
without telling him whose it was, only he gave him to understand, that
he liked this method better than his, which he had caus'd to be printed.
He had some suspicion however that I might be the man that had drawn
it, and question'd me about it; but the King having forbidden me to tell,
or give it to any body, I answer'd him so as was likely to take off his
jealousies of that kind.</p>
               <p>XVI. My life was so checquer'd and mixt, that it was one continu'd
succession of good and ill adventures. I had about this time a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
with a famous Commissioner concern'd in the Salt-Customes, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon a Donation from the King. For the Duke of <hi>St. Simon</hi> and I
having obtain'd a considerable Grant, assign'd us upon this Commissioner;
and I having need enough to make the best of his Majesty's favour, prest
upon him for payment; and upon his refusal, thought my self oblig'd
to prosecute him in the Kings Council, and obtain'd a Decree against
him. But he was a Master in his Trade, a cruel litigious fellow, that
car'd not a rush for a Decree, and carry'd his pockets always full of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
and Injunctions. I soon saw he was too cunning for one so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in Law-suits as I, and that the safest way was to think of an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation.
To this purpose I apply'd my self to his younger Brother,
who was my very good friend, telling him I was so well perswaded of the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100923:59"/>
Justice of my Cause, that I should not scruple the referring the matter
between his Brother and me, to him. He promis'd me to speak about
it. But the Commissioner little regarding his Brothers recommendation,
and thinking a Souldier as I was would soon be weary of those dilatory
proceedings, and that he might save his money by this means, was deaf
to all propositions made in my behalf, and absolutely refus'd any terms
of accommodation.</p>
               <p>One day, as I and some other friends were walking in Monsieur <hi>Deffiat</hi>
the Superintendant of the Treasury's Hall, I saw my adversary come in;
and without employing any other Mediators, went to discourse him my
self; where I told him freely thus: Sir, I know you do not love me, but
for my part I bear no ill will to you: I ask you nothing but what the King
has given me; and is it not a shame for a rich man, as you are, to refuse
that little you owe me; and slight the Rules of Court obtain'd against
you? I am naturally so averse to Suits, that I had rather submit peaceably
to the Judgment of any Arbitrator you will name, so we may but put
an end to this business. Since you open your heart to me (reply'd he)
it is but fair that I deal as openly with you: I have only one thing to
say, which is, that I have at this very time seven and twenty Causes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending,
and I have Money enough to maintain them seven and twenty
years: So that you had best consider whether it will be for your purpose
to engage in a Suit with me. This knavish answer, and ridiculous boast,
was what I least expected, and made me really angry. Give me your
hand (said I to him) I promise you upon the faith of a Gentleman, and
a man of Honour, that since you resolve to stand Suit, I will ply you so
close, that the Kingdom shall be too hot for one of us. From that time
forward I began to sollicit my Judges with all my might and main, and
sparing neither pains nor money, obtain'd at length another Decree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, and a Writ to seize his Body. This forc'd him to leave <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
and flee to <hi>Lions;</hi> I pursu'd him thither, but he seeing himself prest,
stopt the proceedings by a fresh Injunction; so that we were to begin
all again. Both of us return'd to <hi>Paris;</hi> and about this time I found a
way to humble the insolence of a Serjeant after a very pleasant manner.</p>
               <p>I had some new Citation brought me every day, either to command
my appearance, or the producing some paper or other; and the Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
took a pride to serve these Citations, because they were under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.
At last, growing weary of this sort of Officers, who are not
very acceptable Guests to men of our way in ones own house, I resolv'd
to make use not of force, but cunning, to rid my self fairly of the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
I suffer'd by them. To this purpose I invented a Trap at the
entrance into my Chamber, as wide as the door, so that when the Bolt
was drawn, none could go in or out, but they must needs fall into it.
Then I had a great Sack nailed to the roof of the room below, wide
open, just under the Trap, that whoever slipt into the hole might fall
into the Sack, and hang in the air. In regard I had often company with
me, they thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t to choose out one of the stoutest Serjeants to serve
these Citations. One of which having boasted that he fear'd me not,
and being very jolly upon the account of some Pistoles that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
as his reward, came to my House, and enter'd my Chamber, with
a Citation in his hand. As bold as he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>etended to be, he appear'd to me
not much assur'd; and told me, that being oblig'd to bring me a Citation,
yet he would ask my leave, and not serve it unless I were willing he should.
I answer'd, that he very little understood how to be civil to men of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100923:60"/>
and that he ought not to mock me, by asking my consent to bring
what I saw him hold in his hand. He seeing me angry, had recourse to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
and excuses; but at last I began to raise my voice, and then
fearing if he did not get out of the Room, that I should reward him
with a Cudgel, he began to retire, and shift towards the door. In the
mean while my man had drawn back the Bolt that staid the Trap, and
so my brave Serjeant, that thought of nothing but making his escape,
vanisht in an instant, being fallen through the Trap-door into the Sack,
which clos'd at the top with the weight of his body, as did the Trap al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
returning in a moment to its former posture. There was my Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
dangling between Heaven and Earth, in an astonishment so great,
that he scarce knew whither he was dead or alive. I gave him leisure to
come to himself, and let him hang about a quarter of an hour. After I
had order'd him to be drawn out, he begg'd of me, as the greatest favour
I could do him, not to divulge a thing which would disgrace him for ever;
which I promis'd, being sufficiently satisfied, that I had so innocently
humbled the pride of a Serjeant. But he would ever after put me in
mind of the Sack, and laugh heartily at the jest.</p>
               <p>In the mean while I prest my Commissioner as close and vigorously as I
could, and made him know, that, if he had better knowledge in Craft
and Quirks of Law, yet I had the better Cause, and credit enough to
defend it. At last seeing his business in an ill condition, he resolv'd to gain
the Judges by great Presents, and found a way to surprize the Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant,
entreating the assistance of his credit, against a Gentleman of
<hi>Provence</hi> that perplex'd him with a Suit of Law. Monsieur <hi>Deffiat</hi> being
thus caught, sent the Marquess his Son to sollicite all the Judges in his
name against me, without knowing all this while that I was the party
concern'd. My Advocate gave me notice of it, and tho I had much ado
to belive this of a person who had always giv'n me great testimonies of
his good will, yet I entreated the King to speak to him about it. Next
morning putting on my Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>let, and taking three or four of the bravest
Cadets of my Company along with me, I went to wait on the Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
just as he was at Dinner: I stay'd till he rose from Table, and coming
up to him while he was washing his mouth, I told him in his Ear, I am
come hither, Sir, to present you a Request, whether it be a civil one or
no, I can't tell, but I'm sure however it is just. Am not I very unhappy,
Sir, I who have ever had the honour to be your Servant, to pass all on the
sudden for a Criminal in your opinion, and to draw your displeasure
upon me, without knowing how I have done it? You must needs think
me guilty of some great fault sure, Sir, since after having honour'd me
with your favour and affection, you now sollicit against me in so just a
cause, and where the execution of the King's pleasure is the only thing in
dispute. Monsieur <hi>Deffiat</hi> much surpriz'd at such a complement, said,
interrupting me, I sollicit against you! I protest I do not know what you
mean, pray unfold the mystery, and make me understand you. Here is
Monsieur <hi>F.</hi> (replied I) who is present in the room, hath commenc'd a
Suit against me, and maliciously trifles off the Duke of <hi>St. Simon</hi> and my
self, about a Donation the King hath been pleas'd to bestow upon us. I
have obtain'd several Decrees against him both in Parliament and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
but he is an Ecl, that always slips through my hands, when I think to
grasp him. If you undertake to defend him, Sir, as it appears you do,
by the sollicitations the Marquis your Son has lately made in his behalf
against me; I know too well that it is in vain for a poor Officer as I am,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100923:60"/>
to stand it out, and think to carry his point against a Superintendent; and
if the case be so, I had better give up my cause to my Adversay, and be
quiet. I protest to you (reply'd Monsieur <hi>Deffiat</hi>) that I did not know
it was you, that was at Law with Monsieur <hi>F.</hi> he has surpriz'd me, but I
will make him know, that there is nothing to be got by surprizing men of
honour. At the same time he call'd him, and made but few words, but in
short took my Gentleman down; you have abus'd me, (said he) and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
me, in making me ignorantly sollicit against Monsieur <hi>Pontis.</hi> You
owe me Five hundred thousand Livres, I declare if you do not pay me
within a week, I will lay you by the heels. He was offering to justify
himself, but the Gentleman commanded him to withdraw, and think of
what he had said to him. All the Company were extremely pleas'd to see
an Excise-man so humbled. At the same time he order'd his Son, the
Marquis, to go along with me and undeceive the Judges, and to tell
them, he was sorry he had suffer'd himself to be so surpriz'd, and that
he had sollicited against a man he lov'd. Several of them had receiv'd
great Presents, and some whole Cart-loads of Orange-trees; which when
I saw in their Gardens, I could not forbear saying in jest to these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
Oh! what corruption! Oh how do I suspect my Cause! For God's
sake, Sir, when my concern comes before you, do not look upon these
Trees, for they will be very ominous to me if you do.</p>
               <p>I was advis'd by my Friends to except against one of these Judges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
having been my Adversary's Advocate in this very Suit against me,
he had since by his means obtain'd to be Master of Requests, and so all on
the sudden from his Council, was preferr'd to be his Judge. The thing
appear'd odio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s enough of it self and a man of any equity at all, would
never have staid to be excepted against for such a reason. But two
thousand Crowns pension, which he receiv'd from this Commissioner,
made him proceed against the ordinary Rules of Justice. Before I would
except against him, I had a mind to try what civility would do, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
went to see him, where I complemented him to this effect: I
am come, Sir, (said I) upon a business that is very just, and I think you
a man of more equity than not to grant it. You know you have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleaded for Mons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eur <hi>F.</hi> with whom I have a Suit now depending,
and I do not wonder you have s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>v'd him the best you could, for it is
the business of an Advocate so to do. Nay, I have several times com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
the Wit, Learning and Wisdom, that you have shewn upon this
occasion. You are since made a Master of Requests, which, Sir, is the
Reward of your Merit; and we must believe, that having been so good
an Advocate, you will prove as good a Judge; but pray, Sir, give me
leave to tell you, that I conceive the first testimony of your Justice, ought
to be the refusing to sit as Judge, in a Cause where you have been Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel.
For though I do not doubt your probity, yet it would reflect upon
your honour to judge him, as a Master of Requests, whom you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
so severely condemn'd as a Pleader. To which he reply'd, that if
he should wave all the Causes he had been concern'd in, he might even
as well throw up his place, for most of the business had gone through his
hands. After a long debate, finding him resolute, and that he would
not decline sitting upon this Cause, I took my leave: And going imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to the King, I told his Majesty the whole story. Just as I had done,
in came Monsieur <hi>Sequier,</hi> Chancellor of <hi>France,</hi> and the King taking him
by the Arm, said, Hark you my Lord Chancellor, I have a Question to ask
you: May an Advocate, who hath pleaded against a man, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100923:61"/>
bought a Judges place, be Judge in a Cause of his own pleading?
The Chancellor look'd a little surpriz'd, and answer'd, that he did not
believe any body would say he might; that it was a thing contrary to
all Law, and all Reason. But yet, said the King, it is what ... pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to do in <hi>Pontis</hi>'s case here. This was enough to engage the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
to promise me Justice, and next day he was as good as his word,
in granting me a Decree, forbidding Monsieur <hi>De la</hi> ... to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at the Judgment not only of this, but of any other Suit that I might
hereafter have with the Commissioner aforesaid. I deliver'd this Decree to
an Usher of the Court, to signifie it to this Master of Requests; but he had
notice of it, and being at his wits end, to see his design publickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
by King and Council, he immediately apply'd to my best friends,
to interpose with me, that this business might go no farther. I gave
them a true account of my behaviour in it, which they approv'd, and
told them it was meer necessity made me proceed after that manner;
so that upon any other account I should be ready to serve him. But this
business having made a noise, and Monsieur <hi>De la</hi> ... fearing, that
my access to the King might give me opportunity to do him ill offices,
as it had been no hard matter to have done indeed, had I been of so mean
a Spirit, he came to me himself not long after, and after a great deal of talk,
which is not necessary to be repeated here, he desir'd me at last to go
with him to the King, and speak in his behalf. I went with him in his
Coach to <hi>St. Germains</hi> at the Kings rising, and presenting my Judge, said,
Sir, Monsieur <hi>De la</hi> ... upon consideration that I belong to your
Majesty, will needs be formally reconcil'd to me, tho indeed we have
never been Enemies; but he knowing that your Majesty is pleas'd to do
me the honour to allow me about your person, will out of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
generosity use my mediation to beseech your Majesty to forget what
has past between us, seeing I have forgot it with all my heart. Had I
known him for the generous person he is, I should have proceeded in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
way, as I believe he would have done with me, had he known
me for such as I am; and therefore I most humbly beseech your Majesty
ever to look upon him, as one of your good and faithful Servants. The
King was pleas'd to take this address well, and Monsieur <hi>De la</hi> ...
and I went out, very well satisfy'd with one another.</p>
               <p>But I was not rid of my Suit for all this, but forc'd to continue my
prosecution against him, who had held me in hand so long about the
Donation from the King. I obtain'd at last another Attachment against
him, which forc'd him to leave <hi>Paris</hi> a second time, and flee to <hi>Lions.</hi>
I pursu'd him so close, that he was fain to take Sanctuary in the Popes
territories at <hi>Avignon.</hi> Then I writ to the Kings Ambassador at <hi>Rome,</hi>
which was the Marquis <hi>d' Estree;</hi> and having obtain'd leave of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
I was about to arrest him; and he escap'd from me again to <hi>Orange.</hi>
I was not discourag'd for all this, but writ to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> at the
<hi>Hague,</hi> to demand Justice against this litigious Knave. He had notice of
it, and seeing no re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uge left, but either flying into <hi>Germany,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi>
and hazarding the being taken in his flight too, he writ to the Duke of
<hi>St. Simon,</hi> to desire an accommodation; and chose at last to pay, though
against his will, what at first he resolv'd never to give us, rather than
to banish himself the Kingdom. So he paid the Duke twenty thousand
Crowns, and me about forty thousand Livres. But this Suit, tho upon
a summ so trivial to so rich a man, was the cause of his utter ruine. For
he spent above four hundred thousand Livres in it, and was made a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100923:61"/>
Bankrupt. So truly was the promise I made him kept, that the
Kingdom should grow too hot for one of us. And I thought it not amiss by
this remarkable instance, to shew the world how very apt the false
trust a man puts in his Credit, and cunning in Law, is to betray and
undo him. Yet for all this, I did his Brother a very good office to the
King; for he having a mind to buy a Lieutenants place in the Guards,
and the King asking me what I thought of him, I gave the best
Character I could, both of his valour and deserts: Adding withal, that
since he had Money, it was fit he should spend it in his Majesty's service,
who had an original right to it.</p>
               <p>XVII. It was near about this time that Monsieur <hi>Bouteville</hi>'s misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
happen'd; who having fought (as 'tis well known) contrary to
the Kings express prohibition, was seized, just as he was upon the point
to escape into <hi>Lorrain</hi> with the Count <hi>de Chapelles.</hi> The Marquis <hi>de

made so good haste, that he overtook them at <hi>Vitry-le-Brushe.</hi> It had
been the easiest thing in the world for them to ride on, till they had
got into a place of safety, for they wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ted but two Post-stages, and
the Count <hi>de Chapelles</hi> did all he could to perswade Monsieur <hi>Bouteville</hi>
to it: But providence so order'd it, that himself should be the cause
of his own ruine, by pretending an unseasonable bravery, and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Count with want of Courage, for the necessary caution he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
him to. In the mean while this Servant had time to go to <hi>Vitry-le-Francois,</hi>
of which the late Marquis <hi>de Bussy</hi> was Governour, where
he gave notice to the Provost Marshal of the place, where the men
that kill'd him were; and this Provost with his Archers beset the house,
took them, and carry'd them to <hi>Vitry-le-Francois.</hi> The King heard of
it, and immediately order'd Monsieur <hi>de Gordes,</hi> Captain of the Guards,
and me, to go with two hundred men to <hi>Vitry,</hi> and bring Monsieur
<hi>Bouteville</hi> and <hi>des Chapelles</hi> to <hi>Paris.</hi> I, who had the honour to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
acquainted with Monsieur <hi>Bouteville,</hi> was employed in such a
Commission sore against my will, and it went to my heart to do so sad
a piece of service to one who had always exprest a great deal of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and affection for me. Tho on the other side, I could not choose
but disapprove and condemn so criminal a thing, in them whose death
I lamented before-hand. As soon as we were arrived, he exprest great joy
for my coming, and in complement said, I was exceeding welcome; for
he knew now I was of the party, there would be no foul play. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
that indeed he had reason to think so, for Monsieur <hi>Gordes</hi>
was a man of too much honour to suffer any such thing. He was very
pleasant all the Journey, and shew'd little or no trouble, depending no
doubt upon his great relations, and the Interest of his friends. When
we came to the Inn, he would needs have me to play with him, as
being undisturb'd in his thoughts, and perfectly master of himself.
There was a rumour abroad, that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> had put seven
or eight hundred men into the field to rescue Monsieur <hi>Bouteville</hi> out
of our hands. The King was made acquainted with it, and sent us a
reinforcement of five hundred men a league beyond <hi>Loguy,</hi> with posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
order to defend our selves very well, if any attempt were made
upon us. I observed Monsieur <hi>Bouteville</hi> was a little surpriz'd at the
arrival of this great Convoy, and said to me, by way of confidence;
What's the meaning of all this Company? What are they afraid of?

Have I not given you my word? and having given it, can any body
imagine I will break it? But I, who thought I might easily disengage a
man from his promise, who was so well guarded, and had no great
reason to hope well in this business, told him again with the same free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Look you, Sir, this is not a time to stand upon generosity, and
punctilio's of honour, I release you of your promise, and if you can
make your escape, do not scruple to do it. In good earnest I could
heartily have wisht it done, provided it might have been without any
fault of mine. When we drew near <hi>Paris</hi> he began to be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
and told me, that if we carry'd him to the <hi>Conciergene,</hi> he was a
gone man: But when he found he was to be convey'd to the <hi>Bastille,</hi>
he exprest great joy, and assur'd himself he should not dye. In the
mean time, we knew well enough his hopes would deceive him, and
that the King would make him an example; the rather by reason of
the Holy-days, which he had pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

being to be prevail'd upon by the intercessions of the most eminent
persons in this Kingdom, he gave all his Nobility to understand, by
this instance of severity, that it was their duty to reserve their valour
for his service, and the publick Interests of the Crown.</p>

circumstances wherein I my self was concern'd, and shew how providence
was pleas'd to order my affairs, whether in putting me by the present
fortunes I might reasonably have aspir'd to; or in preserving me from
those great dangers, in which, according to all humane appearance, I
must otherwise have perish'd. Having staid at <hi>Paris,</hi> by the Kings order,
to gather some Troops that were left behind, and bring them to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Army; after I had discharg'd that Commission, I went to wait
upon the King at <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> from whence after a few days he mov'd
towards <hi>Rochelle.</hi> Assoon as he came near, he lay the first night at <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geres,</hi>
about three or four leagues off from the City; and afterwards came
up to <hi>Etray,</hi> which was but a mile from the Camp. One day Monsieur
<hi>Marillac,</hi> who was then but Mareschal <hi>de Camp,</hi> but afterwards Mareschal
of <hi>France,</hi> was commanded to attack a Fort, that was far advanc'd, by
night; and being he was first to discover the Ditches, and all without,
he chose two Serjeants, who were very brave Souldiers; for that purpose.
But before he sent them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he went to the Kings Quarters at <hi>Etray,</hi> to
give him an account of what he intended to do. The King, who knew
the gallantest men of his Army, askt the two Serjeants names; which
being told him, after a little pause turning to Monsieur <hi>Marillac,</hi> As for
<hi>Cadet,</hi> said he, (which was the name of one of them) I know him to be
a very brave fellow; but I have not so good an opinion of the other. I
know a man, (said the King) who would acquit himself well of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
and bring us an exact account of every thing: I have made tryal
of him upon many such occasions: I mean <hi>Pontis,</hi> the Lieutenant of my
Guards: tell him I desire him to go, and bring me an account of what
he can discover.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:100923:64"/>
The design had been taken to attack the Fort about two hours after
midnight; so that I was to go by eleven of the Clock at farthest, for it
requir'd at least an hour to go thither, and as much to get back again.
I went in the dark of the night, accompany'd with two Serjeants, whom
I sent two several ways, and went my self a third. Instead of going di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to the Ditches, where I should have had much ado to get down,
I fetcht a compass, and put my self into <hi>Rochelle</hi> road. When I came
near the Draw-bridge, I went all along by the sides of the Ditches, as
if I had come out of the City, that so if any one should chance to meet
me, he might think I belong'd to the Town. After I had gone a little
way, I found a great Gate, that they were building to come down into the
Ditches by, but it was not yet finish'd. I went down by this Gate as
softly as I could, but yet I could not do it so as to escape being heard
by the Centinels, who cry'd out, Who goes there? and made several
shots at me, which whiskt on every side of me. I kept on my way in
the Ditches, and found in one corner a pair of winding stairs, that led
up to the top of the Ditch: Up I went, but when I was got almost to
the top, I met a man coming down the same steps. I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ixt my self instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and without betraying any surprize, made as though I was peeping
through one of the Skit-gates, that was upon the stairs, that lookt down
into the Ditch. The man that was coming down, finding my back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
him, and taking me for one of their own side, askt what I was
doing? to which I answer'd, that having heard shooting, and a great
noise, I was looking to see what was the matter. Whereupon, without
having the least suspicion of me, he reply'd, It is nothing but these ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
Centinels, that are afraid of their own shadows; and having said
so, he went down, and I went up to the top, where I met a Serjeant,
who was come from posting and relieving the Centries. He askt me
whither I was going? and I answer'd coldly, that I was order'd to come
and see what was the meaning of those shots that had been made. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Serjeant, who was an honest old fellow, without giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
any further trouble to examine who I was, told me it was nothing
but a false alarm; and askt me, if I had nothing else to say to him? I
told him, No; and in truth I was a little impatient to be gone out of his
company. After this manner I past, and escap'd so great a danger, by
a visible effect of the protection of Almighty God.</p>
               <p>I return'd the same way I came, and found <hi>Cadet,</hi> who waited for me,
and when he heard me struck two stones one against another, which
was the signal agreed upon betwixt us. He had a Bottle of Wine, of
which he made me drink two or three draughts, which refresht me very
much; and I had great need of it, having taken a great deal of pains,
and stumbled a long time up and down in very uneven way. As soon as
we were return'd to the Camp, I made a report of all I could observe of
this Gate I had found into the Ditches, the depth and breadth of the
Ditches themselves, the little Winding Stairs, and all the rest I had disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd.
But there being some contest upon a report made by one of the
two Serjeants, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> which made it necessary to call a Council of War, and a
great deal of time being spent that way, as the Troops were marching
along the shore to gain that Gate, day broke upon them, and the Enemy
discerning our men at a distance, made such a furious fire upon them with
their Cannon, that several of our Souldiers were killed and wounded.
This contest, which was in part the cause of our misfortune, made the
King after the taking of <hi>Rochell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

II. I shall only take notice of one example more upon this occasion, to
shew of what importance it is in these enterprizes not to expose an Army
rashly, upon the reports of silly People, or the vain projects of such as
do not understand the profession. Father <hi>Joseph,</hi> a famous Capuchin,
who had a rambling kind of Wit, and employed himself principally in
War, and State affairs, had intimation given him, that there was a large
Common-shore by which all the nastiness of the Town was carried off,
and that it would be an easy thing to make our selves Masters of the
place, by sending men up this Shore by night. Immediately he resolv'd
upon this attempt, and proceeded so far as to propose a terrible Engine
to serve for the effecting it. But first we must k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow, whether the Passage
were good, for it was a Citizen who had told Father <hi>Joseph</hi> of it, and
we were not secure, that the information was to be depended upon.
They straight began to talk of sending me thither, and the King made
great enquiry after me, but I kept my self out of the way, as growing
weary of being perpetually employed upon such discoveries, which got
me but little honour, for my report was not always credited, and yet
expos'd me to abundance of danger. However, found out I was at last,
at a friends quarter, where I was at Supper; and not knowing how to
excuse my self, I went presently to wait upon the King, who told me,
he had sent for me upon a business of consequence, which Father <hi>Joseph,</hi>
who was then by, could give me an account of.</p>
               <p>The good Father, acting the part of a General, represented to me his
whole design, and told me afterwards, with a grave and discreet zeal,
that the King having singled me out from ten thousand for this important
service, I ought to think of answering the good opinion his Majesty had
of me; and that if I did not find my self so much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dispos'd to it as the
matter requir'd, I had better fairly desist, than undertake it unwillingly.
This discourse displeas'd me much, and I knew not well how to relish it, that
a Capuchin should take upon him to read Lectures of Courage and Resolution
to me. Which made me reply with some resentment, tho in the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
that he did me wrong, and it did not become him to talk at that rate;
that his Majesty had never commanded me any thing, wherein I had
not behav'd my self like a man of honour; and that had the occasion
been less perillous, where there could have been no ground to suspect
me of fear, I would have begg'd his Majesty to excuse me from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
it, after such an affront put upon me in his presence. The King,
who saw me a little mov'd, appeas'd me, by turning to Father <hi>Joseph,</hi>
and telling him that he knew me very well, and durst answer for me. So
away I went with an Ensign, in a dreadful windy night, which favour'd
our design. There were Souldiers plac'd at every fifty paces to sustain
us, in case we should be attack'd, as also to shew us where the Ditches
were, lest we should lose our selves in the dark. Being come to the
Drain, we sounded the Ouze with a long pole, and found the Mud cruel
deep on all sides; and after having searcht every passage, concluded there
was no possibility of getting thorough. We return'd and made our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
that forty thousand would perish there as well as two, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was to be hop'd for from this project. Upon this Father <hi>Joseph</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to fret, and said, it could not be; that he had been otherwise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
by a Citizen of <hi>Rochelle.</hi> To which I boldly reply'd, that if he
could take that man, he would do well to hang him for a Liar, and a Rogue;
adding withal, that had the passage been good, it were impossible to do
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100923:65"/>
any thing that night, because there was no Bridge over the Graffe, but a
Plank, over which one man had much ado to pass. At this the Father
grew louder, saying, he had ordered Bridges to be made, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
they were ready. The conclusion came to this, that there being
no Bridges, and his great Machine being broken, all this project fell to
nothigg. The King, after the surrender of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> would needs view
this Drain, and there shew'd Father <hi>Joseph</hi> the danger to which he would
fain have expos'd the Army. Which puts me in mind of what past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Father and Collonel <hi>Hebron,</hi> who hath been so well known
both in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> For as he was forming mighty projects,
and laying wise designs, above any mans comprehension, he shew'd him
three or four Towns in a Map, which he would have observ'd to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
the Collonel, who was not us'd to receive such orders from a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchin,</hi>
answer'd with a smile, Hark you, Master <hi>Joseph,</hi> 'tis an easie thing
to talk, but Towns are not taken with ones fingers ends.</p>
               <p>III. Being now engag'd in discourse upon this good Father, I think it
may not be amiss to take notice of what past between him and me much
about the same time, with regard to Cardinal <hi>Richelie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> This Cardinal
is well enough known to have many eminent qualities, and such as gain'd
him great respect, both at home among the Kings Subjects, and abroad
with Foreign Princes, and a Great Minister he was, and a most cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Politician. But as the greatest men never are without some defects,
every body doubtless must have observ'd this mighty fault in him; That in
the services he did the State, he did not manifest all that zeal for his Prince
that became him, but made it his business to entice away his faithfullest
Servants, and decoy them out of his Majesty's service into his own. He
knowing me to be a person most inviolably devoted to the person of the
King, and having either observ'd himself, or been told by others of
something in me, that was not displeasing to him, so as to incline him to
wish me about his person, he had the goodness to look upon me, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
his inclination chiefly upon the following occasion.</p>
               <p>Being one day remov'd nearer the King's Quarter, from which he lay
very remote before, he desir'd his Majesty, that some Companies might be
sent to keep Guard at his Lodgings, by reason that now he lay more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to the Sallies of the <hi>Rochellers.</hi> The King orderd him some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of his own Guards, and I was the first that kept Guard before his
Quarter with my Company. In pursuit of his design to win me over to
his service, he gave order that a very fine Chamber should be got ready
for me, where nothing was wanting: but I would not so much as lye down
all night, that I might look to what I had in charge, and observe my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
the better. He found means even from hence to take an occasion of
courting me, and industriously spoke in my commendation before some
persons at Court, that they might tell me again. At last he would have
me tried in good earnest, and made choice of Father <hi>Joseph</hi> for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
A man very fit to execute his designs, being entirely in his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
and one of no less cunning and dexterity than himself. He made
sure of my hearkening to his proposals, because Monsieur <hi>Beauplan,</hi> Captain
of his Guards, was at that time dangerously sick, and he design'd in case
he should dye, to give me that Command if I would accept it so, as to give
my self up to him wholly, and without reserve; For so much I was in
plain terms given to understand, that he expected all his Officers should
look upon him as their Soveraign, and that in all the disturbances and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100923:65"/>
revolutions at Court, they should stand by him against all opposition,
and without all exception. This was the principal condition, upon
which he gave them to understand, that he admitted them into his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
and it was what I confess raised great indignation in me to see, that
they were thus made by a kind of new Oath, to renounce the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
they had made to the King, whom I have ever consider'd as my
Master, and could never dispose of my self to any other to his prejudice.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Joseph</hi> passing by my Lodging one day, or at least pretending
to make that in his way, that I might not think he came on purpose, askt
pretty loud, whether I was within. They presently came and told me,
and I as soon coming down to meet him, we went up together into the
Chamber. Every body in Company straight withdrew, to give way to
this Minister of the Cardinal, who was fear'd almost as much as he. The
Father before he open'd himself upon the chief occasion of his visit, ask'd
me, if I had made trial of a certain invention he had learnt from a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
who had frequently discours'd about some Engines, that might be
proper to incommode the <hi>Rochellers;</hi> which was, to fire a Ship at a great
distance by a Musquet shot. Having desir'd to know my opinion of it, I
told him, since he did me the honour to consult me, I was oblig'd to tell
him, that I thought it a very casual thing; that this Souldier, upon a
tryal he made in my Garden of three or four shots, there succeeded but
one, and therefore I conceiv'd no great stress ought to be laid upon so
great an uncertainty. He then entreated me, that I would bring the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
with me to his house next day, that we might make the experiment in
his Garden, and there (said he) we will regale you, and I will engage
you shall be very well receivd. Father (said I) I shall be much better
receiv'd than I deserve,'tis too great an honour for me, that you are
pleas'd to think of me. Oh (replied he) I am sure I have good reason
to think of you, we are old acquaintance. Do you remember the
time, when you offer'd me your Horse? I am asham'd Father (said I) to
think of so poor a thing, and it shews your generous temper to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
it so long.</p>
               <p>The business he spoke of was, that going one day to <hi>St. Germains</hi> in
very hot weather, I overtook this Father <hi>Joseph</hi> upon the road, and a
Frier, who were likewise both going thither; it was about the time he
first ingratiated himself with Monsieur <hi>Lui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es,</hi> and to creep into Court.
I very civilly desir'd he would ease himself and ride my Horse. He, who
at that time did not think it decent for a Capuchin to ride on Horseback
(though he hath been of another mind since, and discover'd that he might
travel in a Coach for the service of the State) return'd me many thanks,
but told me withal, that since I was so obliging, he entreated I would ease
them in taking their great Cloaks, and a Wallet that the Frier carried, which
I very readily did. So that it was as pleasant a sight to see a Captain car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
a Wallet before him then, as afterwards it was to see a Capuchin
turn'd Courtier, and Minister to, the prime Minister of State. This was
the thing the Father referr'd to, who continu'd his discourse to me after
this manner. I have ever since bore in mind (said he) the Charity you
shew'd to us then, and I could not forget you when I remembred that. I
have taken several occasions to speak to the Cardinal in your behalf; and
have found, that he hath a very great esteem for you. He is much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to serve you, and is never deceiv'd in his choice of men. Really
he hath a marvellous talent in judging of merit, and a liberal hand in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding
it wherever he finds it. Father (said I) I am extremely oblig'd
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100923:66"/>
to you, for so great an acknowledgment of so small a piece of service.
I did not deserve thus much from you, that you should recommend me
to the Cardinal, and am fearful, that what you have had the goodness to
say to him in my favour, may turn to my disadvantage; for since so great
a Soul as his can set a value upon nothing that is not very eminent, and I
have nothing in me but what is very common, it is in some sort to wrong
his Judgment to possess him with an opinion of a person that does no way
deserve it. I have only one thing to boast of, which is the inviolable
fidelity I have ever born to the King, and in that I can say without vanity,
I give place to none. The Father, perceiving I was aware of his design,
and that his Mine was sprung, was not at a loss however, but took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
from my own words to return me this answer. Why this, said he, is
the very thing that the Cardinal values most in you, 'tis that strict fidelity so
known to all the world that he chiefly looks after. He would have Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
that should be faithful to him, and be only his without exception or
reserve; he cares not for them who serve two Masters, (these were his
very words) knowing very well no good is to be expected from such
people. This is it that hath made him fix upon you, because he knows
when you have once devoted your self to a Master, you look upon him
only, and after God will serve him only. And it is so rare in these times
to find men of that temper, that were they to be bought, the Cardinal
would purchase them at the price of their weight in Gold.</p>
               <p>A man could hardly push a thing more home, or declare himself more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly,
and truly I, believing I ought then to come out of the Clouds, made
no scruple to declare my self as openly as he had done. I know Father
(said I) that it is too great an honour for me, that his Eminence looks
upon me, and am very well satisfyd, that in being about his person, I
should secure my fortune; but since the Cardinal himself declares; that
fidelity is so valuable a qualification in his Servants, would not he be the
first that should condemn me of unfaithfulness, if after the King has done
me honour in placing me near his person, and giving me a Command in the
Guards of his own accord, I should so soon quit his service, and dispose
of my self to another. This would betray a most inexcusable levity and
ingratitude, and every body must conclude, that after having served a
King of <hi>France</hi> so ill, I were very unworthy to serve the greatest Cardinal
in <hi>Christendom.</hi> Doubtless, Father, I have all the reason in the world
to believe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hrt the Cardinal intends only to try me upon this occasion,
and hope you will have the goodness to represent it to him, and add this
favour to so many others, for which I am already oblig'd to you. The
Father then taking the opportunity I gave him of coming fairly off,
seem'd to be very highly satisfy'd with me, and having commended me
for the due sense I had of his Majesty's favours, he went away, appearing
outwardly as well content, as he was inwardly disturbed to see his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
so ill return'd.</p>
               <p>IV. The Cardinal seem'd no less satisfy'd with my answer, highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
the fidelity I had exprest in it, and though he could not choose
but be vext, that so poor an Officer durst refuse entring into his service,
it is not to be believ'd how many subtle contrivances the ambition of not
being defeated in what he had once attempted, put him upon to win
me over. If he spoke of any of the Officers, he always preferr'd me
above the rest, and affected to commend me in the presence of the King,
and the great men at Court: Insomuch that several of my Friends told
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100923:66"/>
me, I was highly oblig'd to the Cardinal for the advantageous characters
he constantly gave of my conduct. These complements I receiv'd with
seeming submission and acknowledgment, but inwardly I had no relish for
the affected speeches of a man whose pretences I so well knew. One day the
King having granted me a favour for one of my Kinsmen, bad me go
complement the Cardinal upon that account. Accordingly I went and
told him, that since his Majesty had put all things into his disposal, he
had sent me to ask his consent to a gift he had done me the honour to
confer upon me; at which I perceiv'd, he was mightily pleas'd, and said
with a smiling countenance, that he was very glad of the King's kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to me, that he knew my merit, and instead of repining at any thing
his Majesty should do for me, would with all his heart contribute to it
whatsoever lay in his power. But the kindness he was pleas'd to shew
me did not continue very long; for I shall shew before I have done, that
after having try'd promises and entreaties, and all the gentle ways that a
Minister so subtle as he could contrive, he proceeded at last to methods
of severity and violence. But now I must proceed to give an account
of what past during the Siege of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and relate the most troublesom
business that ever I was e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gag'd in in my whole life; which I dare affirm
to have been just at the beginning, however several circumstances of
time and place, and persons rendred it criminal to the last degree.</p>
               <p>V. Before I give an account of the great difference I had with Monsieur
<hi>Canaples,</hi> my <hi>Maistre de Camp,</hi> and the Son of Mareschal <hi>Crequi,</hi> it will not
be improper to set down in short the cause of a little coldness toward me
formerly. It happen'd that being one day at play with Count <hi>Saligny,</hi> the
Captain of that Company where I was Lieutenant, he had the better,
and won of my Captain six hundred Pistoles. The Count <hi>Saligny</hi> not
knowing what to lay his ill fortune to, would needs examine the Dice, and
finding them false ones, he said a Cheat was put upon him, and he was
robbd of his Money. Monsieur <hi>Canaples</hi> vindicated himself by saying,
that he plaid fair, that he could not answer for the Dice, they were what
he bought for true ones, and since both plaid with the same Dice, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
advantage there was both had it equally. Count <hi>Saligny</hi> went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
out of the house, and finding me out, told me what had past, and
that he was resolv'd to be reveng'd not being able to be so cullied by
his <hi>Maistre de Camp.</hi> I return'd such an answer, as the false honour of
the world inspires men with upon such occasions, and assur'd him of my
service; but letting him know withal, that I had rather make them
friends if that might be, and so both preserve his Honour, and keep my
own Command. The Quarrel was soon compos'd, but as nothing can be
a secret in this world, what I had said was told Monsieur <hi>Canaples,</hi> who
was furiously incens'd against me; yet he always dissembled his displeasure,
and no resentment appeared outwardly, till the occasion of which I shall
presently give an account.</p>
               <p>VI. But still notwithstanding the accommodation there remain'd some
bitterness in the heart of Count <hi>Saligny,</hi> so that being no longer able to
endure to be commanded by one who he thought had affronted him, he
resolv'd to sell his command, He spoke of it to me, and promis'd, if I
would buy it, to make me a better bargain than any other man by two
thousand Crowns. I answer'd, I desir'd it of all things in the world,
but I wanted Money; yet that should not hinder my acknowledgment
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100923:67"/>
of the obligation I had to him, and that I could not hope for any thing
but from the Kings bounty, who had promis'd to give me a Company,
as he had already made me a Lieutenant. Monsieur <hi>Bologne,</hi> whom I
have often mention'd, hearing what had past between us, was very urgent
with me to buy this Command, promising to help me to Money,
and to stand bound for it. But I, who never car'd to trouble my friends,
except there was an absolute necessity for it, told him, the difficulty did
not lye in procuring the Money, but in paying it again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if he stood
bound with me, he would run a great hazard, and I was not of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
to make my own fortunes at my friends expence. Monsieur <hi>St.
Preuil</hi> coming to see me a little after that Count <hi>Saligny</hi> had spoke to him
about selling his Command, but for his part he would never think of it,
till he knew first whether I had not some prospect of the Commission
my self. I made answer as I had done to Count <hi>Saligny,</hi> that I could be
glad to have it, but I would not buy it. That is not the thing, said he,
there are enough of your mind, all that I have to say to you is, that
while you have any thoughts of it, I will never have any; I know very
well what just pretensions you have to if, and if you'll buy it, I have
four thousand Crowns at your service, of which I now make you an offer.
I then very seriously made answer, that I was very much oblig'd to him,
and had much rather he should buy it than any body else, because I
heartily lov'd him, and wisht him as well as I did my self: but added
withal, that since my hopes of a Command were thus lost, which I had
some right to expect from the Kings bounty, as Count <hi>Saligny</hi> himself
had it given freely, I begg'd at least he would give me leave to complain,
and not take it ill if I laid hold on this opportunity to draw some advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
from my misfortune; for I stand in need (said I smiling) of a little
sweetness to moderate the sharpness of my Choler, and soften my Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.
Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> promis'd to assist me with all his heart, in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
some Money from the King, and told me, I might safely impart to
him any contrivance I could make use of to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Necessity quickens a man's invention, and I was not long in forming the
expedient I stood in need of; but presently told him, that being he was
to go to <hi>Taillebourg,</hi> where the King then was, he must take the pains
to write me a Letter from thence, and there acquaint me with his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to buy this Company, and that I would return an answer to it,
full of grievous complaints of the injustice done me. That afterwards
he might speak to the Duke of <hi>St. Simon</hi> in my favour, and shew him my
Letter, that he might shew it to the King, and by making him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the justice of my complaints, might at least procure me a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
for the cause that was given me to complain. Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi>
engag'd to do so, and to serve me the best he could. And accordingly
he writ to me from <hi>Taillebourg,</hi> as we had agreed before; which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
by another complaining one, writing him word, that I should be
the most unhappy man in the world, if this Company went so out of the
hands of one, who had receiv'd it from the King's meer bounty; that I
should have nothing left to hope for, since it would be always sold at this
rate; that I was not concern'd he should be the Buyer, but that it was
suffer'd to be bought at all; that the grief to see all my pretensions ruined
was so violent and so just, that I could not quickly overcome it, nor lay
aside the resentment I ought to have; that he shut the door of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's
liberality against me; but that when I had suffer'd this injustice for
the love I bore him, I might perhaps at one time or other declare my
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100923:67"/>
resentment more openly. Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> shew'd my Letter to the
Duke of <hi>St. Simon,</hi> and spoke to him in my behalf according to the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
betwixt us. The Duke shew'd it to the King, and seeing his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
begin to be angry, he told him, that really there was a great deal to
be said in my excuse, if I did complain, finding my self thus disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
that he did beseech his Majesty to surprize me with some unexpected
favour; that complaints being the natural effects of grief, they were
allowable when the cause of that grief was just; that I was one of his
Majesty's most faithful Servants, one that had expos'd my life in a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
engagements, that carry'd many honourable scars about me, and
deserv'd a Company in his Guards as well as any Gentleman in <hi>France.</hi>
The King a little calm'd with this discourse, reply'd, 'Tis true, he is a
brave man, and it is but just to consider him a little upon this occasion.
After which he sent an Order to Monsieur <hi>Deffiat</hi> to pay me four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Franks.</p>
               <p>But still he was not satisfy'd with my Letter. And when I came to
him at <hi>Surgeres</hi> a little after, he gave me to understand by his silence and
coldness, that he was displeased with me. Not knowing then, whither
I ought to speak, or hold my tongue, fearing on one side, that if I spoke
I should be thought insolent, and if I said nothing it might look like guilt;
at last however I chose the latter, and resolv'd to try if by silence and
submission I could overcome the good nature of the King. At Supper
the Count of <hi>Svissons,</hi> who was upon no very good terms with his Majesty,
came to wait on him, and after a little discourse took his leave, and all
the rest of the great Lords one after another went away. Still I staid,
hoping by my perseverance to oblige the King to speak to me, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he took it well to have people assiduous about his person. But
my patience at last was quite worn out, and being inwardly vext to see
the King keep on a coldness toward me so long, as soon as he rose
from the Table I fell at his knees, and told him, that my fear to displease
his Majesty, and the confusion which the remembrance of my fault gave
me, had oblig'd me till then to keep silence, but I hop'd he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me now to ask his pardon most humbly for my passions and complaints.
Ho ho! (said the King roundly to me) who then put you upon writing
such a hussing Letter? I reply'd that his Majesty having given me hopes
of the Company he had bestow'd on Count <hi>Saligny,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>St.
Preuil</hi> having since bought it, I knew very well, that he would not do
him an injury, in giving me what another had bought. Whereupon
the King ask'd me, what I complain'd of then. It had been easy to tell
his Majesty, that this was the very reason of my complaint, that having
given his word to gratify me with that Command, he had suffer'd it to
be sold; but this was no time to insist upon the justice of my cause, and it
was better to take a more submissive course; and therefore laying all the
fault at my own door, I made answer, I had no body to complain of but
my self, and I most humbly begg'd his Majesty's Pardon for having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
him. The King who pretended to be more angry than he really
was, suffering himself to be easily overcome, said to me, Be more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
another time, and do not complain thus of having injustice done
you: I have commanded <hi>Deffiat</hi> to give you four thousand Livres.</p>
               <p>VII. I was well satisfy'd with this gentle reproof, having great reason
to apprehend very scurvy consequences of this affair. But going to get
my self paid this gift of the King's, I had like to have spoil'd all by a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100923:68"/>
false piece of Gallantry. Meeting with a Commissioner of Monsieur <hi>Def<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiat</hi>
who told me, the Superintendent would speak with me, I presently
went, believing it was to pay me the four thousand Livres; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
he told me, I was much oblig'd to the King's bounty, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
my services, and order'd him to give me four thousand Livres.
I answer'd, that I acknowledg'd my obligations to his Majesty with all
due respect, but if he would give me leave to speak my thoughts, though
four thousand Livres might appear something considerable for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
yet it was but a small matter for so great a Prinee to give. I
thought Monsieur <hi>Deffiat</hi> would have taken my meaning right in what I
said so freely, and presently have offer'd me his service, to perswade the
King to something more, and the kindness he had all along profest for me,
was what might justify my expecting this from him; but I was much sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
to find all my hopes and my policy baffled. For he fell on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
into a violent passion, reproaching me in very harsh language, with
ingratitude, and the unbecoming returns I made for his Majesty's boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Then I saw my fault too late, and thinking of nothing more but how
to repair it, instead of solliciting a new grant, I begg'd him to excuse me,
if the necessity I was in of being at great expence to subsist honourably
upon my Command, had put me upon taking this liberty with him; as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
him it was only the confidence I had in his goodness and favour,
that had encourag'd me to speak after that manner, and that as to any
thing else, I had all my life, and ever should retain, a due and grateful
sense of his Majesty's liberality to me.</p>
               <p>The Commissioner I mention'd, who was a very good friend of mine,
began then to take my part, and endeavour'd to appease Monsieur <hi>Deffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at;</hi>
telling him in confirmation of what I had said before, that the stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I was in about the King expos'd me to great charges above my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
that I was forc'd to run in debt continually, and so it was rather
for my Creditors than my self that I was urgent for Money; that I was
indebted to himself four thousand Franks, and he had an Interest in the
Kings gift to me. This last however was said only in kindness to me,
that by making his Master his own debtor, he might preserve what the
King had already given at least, which was in some danger of being lost
too. But with all that both of us could say, we had much ado to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
the Superintendant, who appear'd perhaps a little more severe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
others, than he was to himself; for 'tis sure he was not of a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
apt to think the Kings bounty guilty of any excesses, when his
own services were rewarded. At last however, being intreated, and sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited
by several considerable persons, he promis'd to do me no ill of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to the King, but to serve me as far as it lay in his power.</p>
               <p>Some days after, being upon Guard with my Company at Sea on board
one of his Majesty's Ships, the <hi>Rochellers</hi> sent out four Fire-ships to burn
our Vessels. When I saw them bearing down upon us, I order'd all my
men to put out Hand-spikes, and set them like a Hedge to keep them
off. This was immediately done, and so the Fire-ships were stopt, and
not able to get within us, or do us any harm, and all their artificial fires
play'd inwards, without flying out upon us. The King at a distance saw
all that past, as he was going to walk upon the Beach; and sending Count
<hi>Nogent</hi> for me, would know from my own mouth what method I had
taken for our defence against those Fire-ships: And being a Prince of a
noble nature, he was glad of this occasion to tell me that he absolutely
forgave my last fault<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And when I had given him an account of our beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100923:68"/>
in this action, he said with a smiling countenance, that he was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
with me, and my services pleas'd him well. The Duke of <hi>St. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
who was by, immediately after gave me to understand what the
King meant by saying so; telling me that I must live in good understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil,</hi> and that he would serve me to the King
upon any occasion.</p>
               <p>VIII. Having given an account before of Monsieur <hi>Canaples</hi> his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
against me, and the cause of it, with some other particulars that
happen'd since, I am now oblig'd to speak of the great falling out we had
some months after, and during the same Siege of <hi>Rochelle.</hi> Going one
day to view a place proper to set a Guard in, about four hundred paces
distant from the Sea-shore, I saw from that eminence Masts of Ships a great
way off, that lookt like Spires of Steeples. I was a little surpriz'd at
first, to think what it might be, but after considering a little, and count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to fourteen, I concluded it must be the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, commanded
by the Lord ... whom all the world hath heard of. Therefore riding
full speed to the Kings Quarter, to make a report of what I had seen,
I said it could be nothing else but the <hi>English</hi> Navy. The King having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
the whole Fleet from the Garret of his Lodgings, (the bravest
and stoutest Fleet for both the number and prodigious bulk of Ships,
that had ever been known) commanded me to go and give notice to the
Officers, to come and receive his Orders, that all the Army might be in
a readiness to engage this Fleet, in case it should make any attempt;
and at the same time he bid me afterwards go and chuse out a fit place,
wherein to draw up the Regiments in Battaille. Being come to Monsieur
<hi>Canaples</hi> Quarter, who was my <hi>Maistre de Camp,</hi> I told him the King had
commanded me to give him notice to draw up his Regiment, by reason
of the arrival of the <hi>English</hi> Fleet. But the Major of the Regiment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very sick, and his Deputy that day a little out of order too, besides
that he understood but little of the business, Monsieur <hi>Canaples</hi> desir'd me
to go and put the Regiment in Battaille my self. I told him, that as soon
as ever I had executed the Kings Orders, who had commanded me to
go view the field, I would not fail to obey his; but entreated him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to remember, that it was my turn to command the Forlorn-hope that
day; for since my entring into the Regiment of Guards, there had no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
offer'd it self for me to command them; and 'tis well enough known,
that those employments, tho full of danger, are lookt upon as posts of
honour, and such as a man never gives up to any body whatsoever.
Monsieur <hi>Canaples</hi> promis'd me to remember, and not dispose of that
Command to any other. Upon this promise I left my <hi>Maistre de Camp,</hi>
not apprehending that a man of honour would fail me in a thing that
was my due, and especially upon so important an occasion. I went af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to chuse the ground, whither all the Companies both of the
Regiment of Guards, and <hi>Swisses,</hi> repair'd in a trice. There I form'd all
the Battalions, plac'd every Company in its post, every Souldier in his
rank, and the Officers at the head of them, to encourage the Souldiers
by their example, and have the first and greatest share, both of the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
and of the Conquest.</p>
               <p>IX. After having thus with my utmost diligence obey'd the Kings Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
I return'd to Monsieur <hi>Canaples,</hi> to give an account of what I had
done; and hard by his Lodging met my intimate friend Monsieur <hi>Savig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac,</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:100923:69"/>
Lieutenant to Monsieur <hi>Rhoderick</hi>'s Company, who told me for good
news, that he was going to his Post, and had receiv'd Monsieur <hi>Canaples</hi>
his Order to command the Forlorn-hope. You may guess what a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
I was in to see such a slight put upon me, in failing of the promise
that had been made me in this business; and I fancy my passion will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
excusable, since such an affront requir'd a very steady vertue to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it with patience, in a man of Courage: Especially since it was that
time my opinion that Heaven always declared for him, who when his
honour was injur'd, repell'd the offence by force of arms. Monsieur <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vignac</hi>
had no sooner said so, but I answer'd in heat, How! hath Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Canaples</hi> given you that Order? He cannot do it, he hath promis'd
it me, and besides it is my right: This were to act contrary to his own
Word, and to Justice. I askt it not of him, reply'd he, speak to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Canaples,</hi> perhaps he will give you some other employment; I pray
be not angry till you have heard his reasons. No, no, said I in great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
a man can have no reason for acting contrary to Justice, and his own
Word; I will have no other employment but that which belongs to me,
and that cannot be given you justly, which cannot without injustice be
taken from me. Monsieur <hi>Savignac,</hi> who lov'd me very well, but did
not think he ought to yield to me upon such an occasion, said to me, Look
you Sir, I made no suit for it, it was given me voluntarily, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a particular Order I cannot leave it.</p>
               <p>Thereupon taking it for granted that Monsieur <hi>Canaples</hi> had put this
affront upon me designedly, since it was not possible he should have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
in so short a time what he promis'd me but just before; I went to
seek him out, smothering my resentment, and taking no notice that I
knew any thing. I told him the Regiment was in Battaille, and when
he pleas'd to come to it, he would find all in order according to the
Kings command. And now Sir, said I, I doubt not but you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
me. About what? said he. The command of the Forlorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hope,
that you promis'd, and which of right belongs to me to day, said
I. At which putting on great surprize, Oh! truly I have given it to
Monsieur <hi>Savignac,</hi> I am very sorry for't, but in earnest I forgot. I, who
had a mind to shew him that I was more angry than he was sorry, made
answer a little roughly, How Sir, forgot! Is it possible a man of honour should
so soon forget his promise? I know not how to help it, said he, I did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
it. Seeing him dally thus with me, I raising my voice, reply'd, You
perhaps forgot it Sir, because you would forget it; but it shall not pass
so, for if you have forgot your promise, I very well remember that it is
my place, and am resolv'd not to lose it. What would you have me do?
said he, the Orders are already given. Change the Orders Sir, said I,
if you please. Would you have me (reply<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d he) be unjust to another,
in taking away a post that I have given him? How! Sir, said I, louder
than before, you have been unjust to me before, in taking from me what
was my right, and what you promis'd I should have. Why, what would
you have me do? said he, very angrily; I cannot change the Orders,
get you gone to the Regiment. Yes Sir, said I, I will go, and go to the head
of the Forlorn-hope; you have given me your word, the faith of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
and a man of honour. I have done what you commanded me,
and you have not been just to your word. I declare to you Sir, that I
am resolv'd to dye rather than part with what is my due; you shall see
strange work. I have not eaten the Kings bread so long, not to shew
him in such an occasion of danger as this, that he has not been mistaken
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100923:69"/>
in the choice he has made of me to be near his person. All that troubles
me is, that I have spoke to you of a thing I should not have spoke to you
about. Monsieur, Monsieur <hi>de Pontis,</hi> said he, consider who 'tis you
speak to. At which, raising my voice yet higher, I know very well
Sir, said I to him, that I speak to a person, who engag'd his faith and
his word to me, and hath fail'd in both. Whereupon Monsieur <hi>Canaples,</hi>
enrag'd to the last degree, to see himself so us'd by an Officer of his own
Regiment, reply'd, Get you gone, you are an insolent fellow. Sir, said
I, the respect I owe you, with-holds me from saying a thing, that would ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much displease you; but, said I, drawing my Sword a little way,
and clapping it down again, Here is that shall one day do me right. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Canaples,</hi> extremely surpriz'd at this menace, said to me, I suspend
you from your Command. But I, knowing he pretended to a thing out
of his power, reply'd calmly, Sir, you usurp an authority that does not
belong to you, while the King is present, none but he can suspend me.</p>
               <p>X. Thereupon I left him, and seeing this affair was like to be of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
consequence, if I did not prevent it, thought it my best course
to make haste, and acquaint the King with it. Accordingly I went and
told him, that while I was executing his Majesty's command, Monsieur
<hi>Canaples</hi> had given away my post to another. The King, who was then
very busie in giving all the necessary Orders for the Army, had not lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to hear me, and therefore referr'd me to the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> as
Collonel of the <hi>French</hi> Infantry. I lost no time, and had none to lose,
in the great bustle and hurry every one was in, and therefore went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to the Duke, to whom I gave an account of my dispute with
Monsieur <hi>Canaples,</hi> for having executed the Kings Orders, and his own:
Telling him, that having addrest my self to the King, his Majesty had
referr'd me to him to do me Justice, being himself so busie in giving out
Orders, that he had no leisure to hear me; and therefore I humbly
begg'd his Lordship to give me the post that belong'd to me. Monsieur
<hi>Espernon</hi> made answer, that this was no fit time to decide such contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
the Enemy being in sight; and publick business being always to
be preferr'd before private: that when the fight was over, they should
be at leisure to consider my case, and to do both of us Justice. But, my
Lord, said I, what will become of me, he hath interdicted me my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
Oh, said Monsieur <hi>Espernon,</hi> that is what he cannot do, while
the King is present, that belongs only to him; and when I am present,
and the King away, it belongs only to me. Go tell Monsieur <hi>Canaples</hi>
from me, that he must permit you to exercise your Command, and this
difference shall be decided, when that we have now in hand with the
Enemy is decided. This word of the Duke's put me in some heart again,
but considering that it would not be proper to carry it to Monsieur <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naples</hi>
my self, for fear of making things worse, and quarrelling afresh,
I presented my Table-book, and entreated his Lordship that he would
please to write in them himself, the message he would have delivered to
Monsieur <hi>Canaples;</hi> telling him, I was afraid if I should go back to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with his Lordships pleasure, that he might fall into a passion
with me, and then I might perhaps forget the respect that was due to
him. Monsieur <hi>Espernon</hi> then writ in my Table-book, and sent to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Canaples,</hi> to permit me quietly to exercize my Command; and thus
being very well content to see my self supported by the Collonel, I
went away to the Regiment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:100923:70"/>
Meeting my Captain <hi>St. Preuil</hi> by the way, I gave him a short account
of the matter, according to the short time I had to do it in, deliver'd
him Monsieur <hi>Espernon</hi>'s Order, and entreated him to carry it to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Canaples,</hi> with all the speed he could. After which I went to take
my post that had been deny'd me; and by great good fortune, Monsieur
<hi>Savignac,</hi> to whom this post had been given in my wrong, was not there
when I came: For tho we were very good friends, I was resolv'd not
to lose my place, and Mousieur <hi>Savignac</hi> would have been as resolute as
I, to keep what had been given to him.</p>
               <p>XI. But it happen'd unluckily, that Monsieur <hi>Canaples,</hi> who was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the round of the Regiment of Guards. just as I took my post, saw
me at a distance, before he had receiv'd the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s Letter.
He made up to me instantly upon a round gallop, with his Cane in his
hand, and thinking to fright me with threats, cry'd out as he came, I
shall remove you with a vengeance, I'll make you quit that post. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not of a humour to be easily affrighted with big words, let him come
within thirty or forty paces, and then call'd out to him to advance no
nearer: Do not go about to offer me an affront Sir, said I, for I am ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
resolv'd not to endure it: What right have you to take that
from me, which the King has given me? Upon this, leaping out of his
Saddle, and drawing his Sword, he came up to me, as if it had been my
duty to suffer my self to be beaten and abus'd; but being willing to save
him that trouble, I drew mine too, and advanc'd half way to meet him,
with a resolution not to attack him, but only to defend my self. I confess
this was an extraordinary proceeding, and such as might appear a capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
offence, for a Lieutenant to draw upon his <hi>Maistre de Camp,</hi> at the
head of the whole Army: But thinking my self backt by the authority
of the King, and the Collonel, and being like to be assaulted, and for
ever dishonoured, without having committed any other fault than obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Kings Orders, I thought of nothing but getting quit of this
scurvy business, tho it should cost me my head.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Angoulesme</hi> and some other great Lords, being come in
to us, when we had made two or three passes at one another, parted us;
and there the matter rested, till we saw the <hi>English</hi> Fleet come to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
in the Road, without preparing for any manner of Engagement.
But then Monsieur <hi>Canaples,</hi> enrag'd to the last degree, at the affront he
thought he had receiv'd in the fight of the whole Army, resolv'd to go
immediately to the King, that he might prepossess him about this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
I saw him take Horse, and presently guest his design, and knowing
of what consequence it was to prevent him, mounted the best Horse I
had instantly, resolving, if I could, to get thither before Monsieur <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
But he, knowing me to he a little hot, and suspecting I would
follow him, took a by-way, and left the direct one to me; by which
means he arriv'd first, and related the whole matter to his Majesty, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his own advantage, telling him that I attempted to assassinate him,
and drew upon him at the head of the Regiment. But he did not tell
him that he himself had first attempted to take away my Honour, and
perhaps my Life too, in the presence of so many honourable witnesses.
He aggravated my fault all that possibly he could, and told his Majesty,
that if Justice were not done upon it, all Military discipline would be
utterly confounded, and lost; that there could be no more safety to be
expected, either for the Officer from private Souldiers, or for the <hi>Maistre
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100923:70"/>
de Camp</hi> and Generals from the meanest Officers in the Army. The King
made answer, that he wovld not obstruct Justice; but that he would
have him go to Monsieur <hi>Espernon,</hi> and let him inform himself of the
business.</p>
               <p>I came into the room just as Monsieur <hi>Canaples</hi> went out, but found
the king strongly prejudic'd against me; for I no sooner open'd my
mouth, but he told me with great severity, <hi>Canaples</hi> hath told it me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
'tis a scurvy business for you, if it be as he informs me. Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
I, your Majesty knows that better than any body. If you have a
mind to inform your self, and will be pleas'd to hear me, your Majesty
will then see that I have done nothing but for your service, and by your
Order: I most humbly beseech you Sir, to call to mind the Order you
gave me. Well, well, said the King, go to Monsieur <hi>d' Espernon,</hi> and
tell him I sent you, and will talk with him about it. I went according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as fast as I could, hoping to find some access with the Duke, because
of the Order he had given me for Monsieur <hi>Canaples,</hi> but was strangely
surpriz'd to find him yet less dispos'd to hear me than the King. Assoon as
ever I came in, he said, O Monsieur <hi>Pontis,</hi> Monsieur <hi>Canaples</hi> hath spoke
to me about your affair, there is now a strange confusion among the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of the Army: There is no such thing as submission or dependance
left among them: The Ensigns will turn Lieutenants, the Lieutenants
Captains, the Captains are <hi>Maistres de Camp,</hi> and the <hi>Maistres de Camp</hi>
will be Collonels: I shall take good care to hinder these disorders: I
wonder how you dare appear before me. I come hither, my Lord, said
I, under the King's protection; he hath sent me to tell you, that he will
discourse you upon this business. You have done wisely, reply'd the
Duke, to come to me from the King, for otherwise I should have laid
you by the heels, to have given you leisure to think of what you could
say in justification of your crime. Seeing then no defence left me but
that of humility and submission, I humbly begg'd of him, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
me upon the single report of my Adversary, and without first hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what I had to say for my self. I conjur'd him to consider, that the
innocent are often opprest by the authority of their Enemies, who will
have every thing pass for a fault, that opposes their injustice; and all
men Criminals, who defend themselves from their oppressions. I hope,
my Lord, said I, if you will please to hear the truth of the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from unprejudic'd persons, you will excuse my misfortune, and your
self undertake my defence, and think me more worthy of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
than your anger. I beseech you, my Lord, to remember the Letter
you did me the favour to write in my behalf to Monsieur <hi>Canaples,</hi>
wherein you blam'd him for presuming to suspend me, when the King
and you were present in the Army; and commanded him from the King
to let me alone in the free discharge of my Command. When after this
he went about to dishonour me, against the Kings, and your Lordships
express Order, I conceiv'd that both the King, and you your self, my
Lord, had put the Sword in my hand, to repell the injury that was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to the Kings authority, and at the same time to defend my self
from the affront they would have put upon me.</p>
               <p>These reasons were of force to work upon Monsieur <hi>Espernon,</hi> whose
honour and authority seem'd to be engaged in my quarrel; but he not
being then at leisure to consider of it, and possest too by what Monsieur
<hi>Canaples</hi> had told him, and in regard my action appear'd really very foul
and odious in it self, when all the circumstances were laid aside, that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100923:71"/>
might make it appear more excusable, I plainly perceiv'd that he was
very ill dispos'd toward me, and that I ought to take my leave. And
withal, thinking my self not very safe, I resolv'd to withdraw to Mareschal
<hi>Schomberg,</hi> who hath ever done me the honour to love me, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
me with extraordinary kindness and favour.</p>
               <p>XII. Then it was that I began to reflect on the inconstancy of mens
fortune: I sigh'd heartily to see, that after serving the world so faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
so many years, I should be so ill rewarded by it, that after exposing
my life a thousand times in the service of my Prince, I was now like to
lose it ignominiously by the rigour of publick Justice; or at least to pass
the remainder of it in exile and oblivion. I represented to my self the
misery of a fugitive, and a vagabond, who fears every thing, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to hope, looks upon all Creatures as combin'd against him to render
him unhappy, and one that can only expect from death the end of all
his miseries and misfortunes. And indeed I never wisht to dye but that
day, for then I thought death the greatest good fortune that could have
befallen me, fearing above all things the hand of Justice, and almost as
much as that, to live wretchedly, out of the Court, and my native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
Such were the thoughts mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly humane, and the low considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that wholly possest my mind. I was not then sensible, that it is a
happiness for a man who hath liv'd long in Courts and Armies, to be
oblig'd to leave them, and driven to think of something more serious,
to dedicate the remainder of his life at least to God, when the World will
have no more to do with him. But God was pleased thus at a distance,
and by degrees, to prepare me for renouncing the world, by giving me
a taste of its bitterness; and tho I did not then apprehend it, yet the
various afflictions he try'd me with were so many earnests of his mercy to
me. While I was thus intent upon my self, with regard to the outward
consequences of this extremity, to which I was then reduc'd, God was
pleased to look upon me, and inspire me with a thought of begging his
assistance. This made me with deep sighs say, Lord thou knowest my
misery, and I know thy mercy, take upon thee my defence, for I have
no defender. My prayer was short, but my devotion was ardent and
sincere. But my grief and disquiet were so excessive, that within a few
days I was so chang'd, as hardly to be known; my very hair turn'd grey
in that short time; and I am sure none who have not experimentally
known what it is for a man of Honour and Courage to see himself re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to fear the hand of a common Executioner, can be a competent
Judge of the condition I was in.</p>
               <p>XIII. When I had withdrawn to Mareschal <hi>Schomberg</hi>'s house, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to examine my business. The usual informations were made, and
the Drum beat throughout all the Quarters to cite me to a personal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance;
but I, chusing rather to pass for a Criminal when at Liberty,
than to surrender my self up a Prisoner, and be expos'd to all the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
designs of my Enemies, was interdicted and cashiered, and all Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and Officers of the Regiment were forbid to own me for an Officer.</p>
               <p>The Proceedings when concluded were carry'd to Monsieur <hi>Espernon,</hi>
as Collonel of the Infantry, and so the principal Judge. He spoke of it
to the King, who not being able utterly to cast off the extraordinary
goodness he had ever had for me, and designing to save my Life, had a
mind not to oppose Justice publickly, but to spin the Cause out as long
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100923:71"/>
as he could, that so when time had qualify'd mens Spirits, he might the
more easily grant my Pardon, without being blamed by the principal
Officers of the Army, whose authority seem'd to be concern'd for my pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
The King therefore answer'd the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> that
they were to have the opinion of the Mareschals of <hi>France,</hi> and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Officers of the Army; and so the business was ended.</p>
               <p>But that which made very much for my Justification, was the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
generosity of Mareschal <hi>Cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uy,</hi> Monsieur <hi>Canaples</hi> his Father, who
as soon as ever he heard of our quarrel, declar'd highly in my favour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his own Son. He condemn'd Monsieur <hi>Canaples</hi> publickly, as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that broke his word, and commended what I had done, as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my Courage, and repelling an extraordinary injury by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
action. This declaration from Mareschal <hi>Crequy,</hi> who thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
his natural inclination for the sake of Justice, was of very great
weight in my Cause; for it could not easily be imagin'd that a Father would
pronounce against his own Son, if he could have found any Justice on
his side. Nevertheless my business was examin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d in the Council.</p>
               <p>In the mean while Mareschal <hi>Schomberg</hi> wrought privately with the
King, to have compassion upon an Officer, who had serv'd him all along
with so great fidelity and zeal; and to incline him to order it so that all
things might be composed. The King, as I said, was pretty well inclined
to this of his own accord, and had often spoken of it to several people;
but every body answer'd cautiously, fearing on one side to offend his
Majesty, and doubting on the other lest they should offend Monsieur <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naples,</hi>
who was a person of great Interest and Power. There was one
however that spoke his thoughts freely to the King upon this subject:
But this mans opinion was as base and unworthy, as Mareschal <hi>Crequy</hi>'s,
my adversary's Father, was generous. He had formerly been my Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
under <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, when I was a young Cadet in the Regiment of
Guards. And the King being pleas'd one day to do him the honor to unbosom
himself to him upon my concern, said, You have known <hi>Pontis</hi> longer
than any body: He seems to me to be patient, tho he be a little hot
and provencal; doubtless he must have been highly provok'd, what
think you? This was plainly to declare himself for me, and to engage
this Officer to speak favourably of a man, whose cause the King himself
had taken upon him to defend; but he, contrary to all people's expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
had the ill nature to answer the King, that though it had been his
own Son, that had committed such an action, he would condemn it as
criminal even in his Son. The King, who look'd for another kind of
answer, and that his own opinion ought to have met with more respect,
gave some significations of his being much surpriz'd at so rude a return,
and went off toward the Window, without saying any thing at all: This
was in effect to condemn a man severely, whom his Majesty had by his
own question absolv'd; and there's no great doubt to be made, but his
Vote had been sold against me, or he would never have exprest himself
at that rate upon such an occasion. And indeed after the matter was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
determin'd, and my Pardon obtain'd, he several times made me
great excuses, which serv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d really only to aggravate his own Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>XIV. While my affair lay before the Council, Monsieur <hi>Hallier,</hi> then a
Captain in the Guards of the Body, who hath since been made Mareschal
of <hi>France,</hi> and Governour of <hi>Paris,</hi> under the name of <hi>de l' Hospital;</hi> and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100923:72"/>
Monsieur <hi>d' Estissac, Maistre de Camp</hi> of a Regiment of Infantry, either
came, or sent to me every day, to give me notice of all that was said in
Council, or in the King's ordinary Discourse concerning my business;
shewing by this good office the particular kindness they had for me, even
in the time of my greatest disgrace. And by this means too, I knew who
were my true, and who my false friends, and who my declar'd
enemies. I knew there were in the Council eight and forty Judges against
me, Princes and Mareschals of <hi>France,</hi> Dukes and Peers, Collonels, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschals <hi>de Camp,</hi> and <hi>Maistres de Camp;</hi> the reason of which was, that
these great Officers were willing by favouring Monsieur <hi>Canaples,</hi> to raise the authority of their own Commands, and to render themselves more formidable to the Captains, Lieutenants and Ensigns. Thus were they
in some sort both Judges and Parties, and had a mind to make me an
example; for fear, if this boldness of drawing upon a <hi>Maistre de Camp</hi> were authoriz'd by escaping unpunished, that they should hereafter find
more resistance than submission among the inferior Officers; and so be
often engag'd to fight like private Gentlemen, instead of making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
obey'd by vertue of the King's authority.</p>
               <p>And I must confess their fear had been just, if the circumstances of my
action had not absolutely secur'd me from this reproach, and made it
plain to all the world, that if an inferiour Officer is never permitted to
draw his Sword upon the person that commands him, a <hi>Maistre de Camp</hi>
is no more allowed to break his word with one that is commanded by
him, and without any manner Justice, contrary to the King's, and the
Collonel General's Order, to take from him that rank which belongs to
him by his Command.</p>
               <p>But at the same time that so great a number of persons declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for my death, I had the comfort to see a great many others take
my part to the last, and make my cause their own. Besides those I have
named, Count <hi>Soissons</hi> Prince of the Blood, sent to invite me to retire at his Lodgings, assuring me of his protection, and that as long as he had life he would preserve mine. Monsieur <hi>Thooras,</hi> Governour of Fort <hi>St. Martin</hi> in the Ifle of <hi>Rhe,</hi> sent
me a tender of his service, and begg'd of me to come into that Island, where he promis'd me all imaginable secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But Mareschal <hi>Schomberg</hi> advis'd me not to stir out of his house, by reason of the favour the King shewed in my concern. So that return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my thanks to those Gentlemen, with all the respect and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due for such honourable and advantagious offers, I still continued where I was.</p>
               <p>At last the King being eternally importun'd by Monsieur <hi>Schomberg,</hi> and
put forward by his own inclination too, sent me word by Monsieur <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>
that I might retire into his Quarter, which he gave me for my refuge.
But fearing every thing in the condition I was then in, and apprehending
above all, lest I should fall into the hands of Justice, I contented my self
with staying in the King's Quarter in the day time, and retir'd my self at night in the Mareschal's.</p>
               <p>XV. One day as I was walking in the <hi>Basse-Court</hi> of the King's Lodgings,
with Monsieur <hi>Montigny</hi> and <hi>Marsillac,</hi> both Captains in the Guards,
these two Officers told me, they would not advise me to stay any longer
in the Camp, for a long as I past for criminal, I was always in danger,
and if ever I came to be arrested, there would be an end of me. Nay,
Monsieur <hi>Marsillac</hi> offer'd me an hundred Pistoles, and Monsieur <hi>Montigny</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:100923:72"/>
fifty, entreating me, as I lov'd them, to accept the offer. I told them
I had two hundred left, and that their kindness was what I valu'd much
more, than the Gold they made me a tender of just then; the King putting
his Head out at Window perceiv'd me, and becken'd me to come to
him, but as unhappy people see every thing by the fear that possesses
them, and my mind was full of the fright these Officers had put me into,
I took this sign from the King in the worst sense, and believing it to be a
manace, was perfectly confounded; Did you see the King threaten me?
said I. You told me as much. I am a dead man. I must flee for it.
You'll never see me more. At that instant, without any farther delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
I embrac'd them, and out I went, betook my self to my Heels,
and fled, as if all had been lost. I look'd all about for my Man and my
Horse, but could find neither, which made me quite mad, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
now that I was deliver'd up into the hands of Justice. I repented
my self of going into the King's Quarters at all; and not knowing at last
whom to blame, I discharg'd all my anger upon my man who was missing,
resolving with my self to be very liberal of my Cudgel, as soon as ever I
could set my eyes on him. But while all things seem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to conspire to
trouble me more, as I was thus running up and down among the Sutlers,
like a Mad-man, to seek my Servant, and could not find him, I was fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more than ever to see a man come running and calling after me: It
was a young fellow call'd <hi>Cadet,</hi> that belong'd to the Kings Chamber,
whom his Majesty had sent to assure me all was well, and to fetch me to
him. I thought he pursu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d me with an ill intent, and therefore fell to
running faster than I had done before. At last however coming a little
to my self, and beginning to fancy I might have taken a false alarm, I
stopt. The man came up and told me, The King had sent for me to him,
I askt what people said of me? at which he fell a laughing, and answer'd
merrily, Why they say that you have taken a fright, and have led me
a fine course: But what are you afraid of? The King would only speak
with you. I have had this day the satisfaction of seeing Monsieur <hi>Pontis</hi>
run away from me. Then I presently resolv'd to go wait upon the King,
tho the trouble and agitation both of my mind and my body had been so
excessive, that I had sweat to that degree, that it appear'd on the outside
of my Doublet.</p>
               <p>I had no great need of consideration what I should say to the King.
My retirement had given me but too much leisure for revolving in my
mind every thing that might serve to prove my innocency. And having
always hoped that at one time or other the King would give me liberty
to justifie my self before him, I had meditated and prepared an exact
narration; wherein following only common sense, I had put together,
all that a Souldier (who had liv'd thirty years about Court, and had no
other Eloquence than what Nature gave him) could say, that was plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to render such an action less odious; and to cloath it with all those
circumstances, that could make the Justice of his Cause appear.</p>
               <p>XVI. So soon as I came into the Court of the Kings Lodgings, the
Duke of <hi>St. Simon,</hi> who was looking out at window, made a sign to me
to come up the stairs by the Wardrobe; and when I was there he told
me, the King had sent for me to learn the truth of the whole matter
from my own mouth. The King was laid down, by reason of some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
physick he had taken. Being come to the Bed-side I fell upon my
knees, and in my countenance plainly discover'd the remorse I had for
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100923:73"/>
having offended my Prince, who had ever been so gracious to me. His
Majesty then told me, he would have me declare the whole truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any disguise; and that he had sent for me purely for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>There was all that time no body present in the room but the King,
the Duke of <hi>St. Simon,</hi> and my self; so that having an opportunity of
speaking freely to him, I did it after this manner:</p>
               <p>Sir, I can never sufficiently thank your Majesty, for the grace and honour
you are pleased to do me, in permitting me to render you an account of my
actions; for I have ever hoped from your Majesty's goodness, that would you
vouchsafe to hear me, you would judge me rather unfortunate than faulty. I
dare boldly say, that if my Conscience could reproach me with having failed in
my duty, or ever disobeying your Majesty's orders; I should never have had
the boldness to present my self before you; and that I should voluntarily have banish'd my self both from your Court and Army; and have sought death out
of your Kingdom, for in it I could not have liv'd after I had lost my Honour.
So that tho those in the Council of War, who are either friends to Monsieur <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naples,</hi>
or have not been rightly informed of the truth of the matter, have
declared against me; yet I hope your Majesty being so equitable as all the world
knows you to be, will judge things as they are, and as I shall lay them before
you; That, it was Monsieur <hi>Canaples</hi> only, who acted contrary to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
orders, to the Rules of War, and his own Honour; and that, whereas
he complains of my having done him an injury, 'tis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e on the contrary who
hath injured me. Your Majesty knows I have always told you the truth, but I
protest afresh, that upon this occasion I will not utter one sy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>able, not only that
is not true, but nothing except what your whole Regiment of Guards know to
be so, as well as I, and what Monsieur <hi>Canaples</hi> himself cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
for such.</p>
               <p>Your Majesty may please to call to mind, that having brought you the news
of the <hi>English</hi> Fleet's arrival, you commanded me to go give notice to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
to go and receive your Majesty's Orders, and afterwards to make choice of
a sit place to draw up the Army in Batta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lle. Thereupon I went immediately
to carry this Order to the Officers, and acquainted Mansieur <hi>Canaples</hi> with it
among the rest. He entreated me to go draw up our Regiment my self, because
our Major was sick. I told him I would first execute your Majesty's Orders,
and when that was done, I would not fail to obey his. But it being my turn
to command the Forlorn-hope that day, having never yet done it, since I had
the honour to be received into the Regiment, I entreated him to remember it,
telling him the passionate desire I had, by some considerable piece of service, to
acknowledge the singular favour your Majesty had done me, in commanding
me to be near your person, and in preferring me of your own accord to be a
Lieutenant in your Guards. He promis'd me he would, and upon that assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
I left him. When I had obeyed your Majesty's Orders first, and then
his, I return'd to give him an account of the whole, and at the same time to
beg the effect of his promise, asking him if he had remembred me? But he at
first made as if he did not understand what I meant; and after I had explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my self to him, he shew'd me as plainly that he had forgotten me. I beseech
your Majesty to consider, whether it was possible for a man of honour, as Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Canaples</hi>
is, to forget in so short a time the promise he had made me
but just before; and whether this was not plainly to tell me, he had forgot me,
only because he would forget me.</p>
               <p>I confess, Sir, I was sensible toucht with this injury, and found my self net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>led
to see that Monsieur <hi>Canaples</hi> had not only used me like a pittiful fellow,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100923:73"/>
and a Foot-man, in breaking his word with me; but besides that he usurp'd a
power which no way belong'd to him, to take from me the rank your Majesty
had given me; and meerly out of a design to affront me, to change the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and establish'd order of your Army. I thought, Sir, that Monsieur <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
was not allowed to set himself above your Majesty, nor by his own private
authority to take from me that right, which my Command and my Rank made
mine, and which I have endeavour'd to deserve. This a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ront, Sir, wounded
me more than all the injurious words he could give me in the heat of passion;
and I humbly beg your Majesty's pardon, if I told him, that he toucht me in the
tenderest part, and made me mad: For I saw very well, that he used me so in
cold blood, and that the affront he put upon me was a premeditated one. I do
also Sir confess, for I dare conceal nothing from your Majesty, who command
me to speak freely, that in the heat of my passion, I could not forbear giving
him some language that was a little rude, the better to represent the injury he
did me; but if I failed something in the respect due from me to him, as my
<hi>Maistre de Camp,</hi> he first failed in that which he owes to your Majesty, and
his own word. And therefore I think I may say, that his fault was greater,
and less excuseable than mine, because, Sir, it was upon your own authority
that he attempted; and how much soever I am his inferiour, yet there is more
proportion between a <hi>Maistre de Camp</hi> as he is. and a Lieutenant as I am,
than between your Majesty and Monsieur <hi>Canaples.</hi> Besides Sir, he was the
first offender, without any provocation from me, and contrary to his own word,
so that if I said some disrespectful things to him, it was himself that drove me to
that extremity. Your Majesty knows, I am, I thank God, patient enough,
but Sir, he provokt me to the last degree; and had a mind I think to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there was any spark of Honour in me, after he had endeavoured to take
it all away by this af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ront. Thus your Majesty sees plainly enough, he was
not only guilty of his own fault, but of mine too; nor can he justly complain
of my being loud with him, after he had so sensibly injured me.</p>
               <p>He was not content, Sir, to deprive me of the rank that was my due, and
in that to go against your authority, but he proceeded yet farther; for upon my
letting him see that I had the resentments of a man of Honour upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
and told him roundly, I could not quickly forget so great an af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ront, he
took my sense of this offence for an injury, and flew into such a passion, that
forgetting the order of War, which forbids every <hi>Maistre de Camp</hi> to suspend
an Officer, when your Majesty, or Monsieur <hi>Espernon</hi> is in the Army, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
would needs take upon him the power of interdicting me the exercise of my
Command. But I knowing this was more than he could do, contented my self
with telling him so, and left him as ill satisfy'd with me, as I had reason to
be with him, to come throw my self at your Majesty's feet, and beg justice for
the affront that had been done me.</p>
               <p>The great affairs with which your Majesty was taken up at that time not
affording you leisure to hear me, your Majesty sent me to Monsieur <hi>Espernon,</hi>
who after having heard our difference, made answer; that I should go tell Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Canaples</hi> from him, that it was your Majesty's pleasure he should permit
me to execute my Command. I entreated he would give himself the trouble of
writing to him himself, that I might not be ingaged in some new Contest
with him, which he accordingly did upon my Tablets presently, and this I deliver'd
to Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil,</hi> who promis'd me to carry it immediately to him.</p>
               <p>Vpon this confidence I went and took my pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e at the Head of the Army, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
my self, that Monsieur <hi>Canaples</hi> would make no scruple of obeying the
D. of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s, which indeed was your Majesties Orders; but was very
much astonish'd to see him oppose them throughout, meerly to dishonour and ruin
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100923:74"/>
me. For as soon as ever he spy'd me at a distance in my Post, he immediately
gallop'd up to me with his Cane in his hand, threatning all the way what he
would do. I, Sir, who knew my self supported by your authority, and the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels,
seeing my self like to be used like a Rogue in the presence of the whole
Army, thought f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t to caution him both for his honour and my own, while he was
a good way off, not to come near me in that posture, nor offer me an Affront,
which I was not prepared to suffer; telling him, Your Majesty had given me
that place; and Monsieur <hi>Espernon</hi> maintain'd me in it, and therefore I could
not quit it without an express Order from your Majesty, or the Collonel. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Canaples</hi> guessing then by my countenance, and my words, that I was not
dispos'd to receive a Caneing, thought to deal better with me, and leapt from
his Horse, advancing toward me with his Sword in his hand. I confess,
Sir, when I saw my self prest after this manner, and perfectly constrained to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
my life, which I had reason to believe he had a mind to take away, as
well as my honour, I made a Virtue of Necessity, and put my self in a posture to
defend both the one and the other.</p>
               <p>I dare not declare more particularly to your Majesty what I did afterwards,
nor how I found my self dispos'd. I know the respect I owe, and the confusion
the remembrance of my fault ought to put me in, while your Majesty is so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to hear me. <hi>At that the King interrupting me, said,</hi> Speak boldly,
and fear nothing, you know I charged you to conceal nothing from me,
and I would know all. <hi>This answer, and the change I observ'd in the
King's countenance, made me think he took some pleasure in hearing me,
and that what I had to say would not be disagreeable to him. So conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
the discourse with a more free and Souldier-like air,</hi> Since your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
<hi>(said I)</hi> will have me speak out; I confess, that when Monsieur <hi>Canaples</hi>
did me an honour, I durst not have hoped for from his generosity, I accepted it,
being pretty well dispos'd to defend my life, which it was more honourable to
preserve for your Majesty's Service, than to give it up cowardly to the passion
of a man that would have destroy'd me. So that when he came up hotly with
his Sword drawn and blustring words, I was not dismaid at it, and only
thought of acknowledging the honour he did me, in saving him part of the way,
and putting my self in a posture for returning his civility. And I may boldly
tell your Majesty, since 'tis your pleasure I should dissemble nothing, that if the
Duke of <hi>Angoulesme</hi> had not come in seasonably to part us, Monsieur <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
might perhaps have found, that it was an easier matter to threaten, than
to kill me; and to interdict me my Command without any Authority to do so,
than to drive me from my Post by force of Arms.</p>
               <p>The King well pleased with so sincere and natural a narration, and
seeing that the Circumstances did really render what I had done very
excusable, was so moved at these last words, which I had pronounced
in a Military and kind of Provencal tone, that he said to me with a
smiling countenance, <hi>What then thou drew'st too? I did indeed Sir,</hi> reply'd
I, <hi>and dare not deny it to your Majesty, but 'twas Monsieur</hi> Canaples <hi>that
forced me to it; and I think your Majesty would not have been pleased with
having me killed like a Rogue that had neither Courage nor Honour. And how
didst thou do then?</hi> said the King. <hi>Sir, Your Majesty will pardon me if I
tell you, that I began to measure my Sword with his, and was defending my self
the best I could when they came in to us.</hi> But that was not what the King
would have, for perceiving me a little warm'd with the recital, he would
have the diversion of seeing me represent my action with something of
that heat which was but too natural to me. So that the Duke of <hi>St. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
who had withdrawn toward the Window, to leave me at greater
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100923:74"/>
liberty with the King, comprehending what he meant, gave me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it. At which animating my self as much as the presence of the
King would allow, throwing my Cloak upon my left shoulder, and stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon my Guard, I did that with my Hand and Arm, which respect
would not suffer me to do with my Sword. The King, who saw the
sprightliness of my gesture, and observ'd the fire that sparkled in my Eyes,
cover'd his face a little with the Sheet, that he might laugh without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
discover'd which made me presently conclude the Cause was won,
and all my own.</p>
               <p>As soon as this little Farce was over, the King bad me be sure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
all the particulars I had told him, and let no body living know
of my having been with him: And withal he commanded me to be ready
at his Chamber-door when he went to Council, there to throw my self
at his Feet, and give him an account of my whole business, as if I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
spoke to him of it before. Upon which I immediately withdrew,
and went down the Stairs by the Wardrobe as privately as ever I
could.</p>
               <p>XVII. Then I plainly saw, that Providence, instead of forsaking me,
(as I imagin'd at first) had assisted me after a visible and extraordinary
manner, and that two ways: First by inclining the King to be favourable
to my Cause; and then in not permitting me to find either my Horse or
my Man, in order to the making my escape, for had I fled, I had been
utterly lost.</p>
               <p>At eleven of the Clock I presented my self at the King's Chamber
door, and at his coming out with a great deal of Company that attended
him, and among others the Cardinals <hi>Richelieu</hi> and <hi>la Vallette,</hi> I threw my
self at his Majesty's Feet, and began to speak and beg his audience after
this manner.</p>
               <p>Sir, I am come to lay my self at your Majesty's Feet, to implore your mercy.
I put my life into your Majesty's hands, for I had better lose it by the Sword of
your Justice, if I have deserv'd to lose it, than live miserable, a Fugitive, and
under your Majesty's displeasure. But I most humbly beseech you, Sir, that you
will first do me the favour to hear me, that if I shall have the good fortune to
make my Innocence appear, I may have the consolation of being absolv'd by your
Majesty's own Judgment; and on the contrary, if I cannot justify my own
conduct, I may be condemn'd out of my own mouth.</p>
               <p>The King, who seem'd very cold to me, on purpose to conceal his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
intelligence betwixt us, heard me with a fierce countenance, his
hand on his side, and standing between the two Cardinals. Then with
a fierce look he said, <hi>Rise, that I may the better hear you, and if you have
any thing to say in your own justification, speak it, but be sure you speak
truth.</hi> All the Court was present at this extraordinary Audience, and I
pleaded my cause for half a quarter of an hour, after same manner I
had done it in private, in the Kings Chamber, but much more seriously,
as speaking now in publick before the Cardinals, Princes, and Lords of
the Court.</p>
               <p>While I was harranguing thus, the King said softly to Cardinal <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi>
as I have been since told by a Lord that overheard him, <hi>You see</hi>
Canaples <hi>provoked him to the last degree, for my part I do not think him so
much in fault;</hi> and when I had done speaking he said aloud, <hi>'Tis true,
he ought not to deprive him of the Post due to him by his Command, when he
did nothing but only execute my Orders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:100923:75"/>
Upon this they went presently into Council, and Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>
having understood from the King, that he would have the judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this business put off, by reason of the <hi>English</hi> Fleets lying there, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of a fair Wind to assault the Mole, his Eminence declared it to
the Council.</p>
               <p>Thus the matter was deferr'd, that is, the King reserv'd the judgment
of it to himself, and at his coming from Council he very graciously told
me so; I humbly begg'd of his Majesty to do me the favour, not to let
me lye idle, but to employ me some way in his service, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
me to do, but withal ordered me in the mean time to stay in his
Quarters, without going to the Regiment of Guards, or executing any
part of my Command.</p>
               <p>XVIII. The King accordingly did remember me as he had promised,
and a few days after made me Captain of a Galliot, to go out to Sea, and
discover the Enemy. I then began to think of reconciling my self to
the King, by some signal action in this new Command his Majesty had
conferr'd upon me. I bought a great many Ells of Taffata, and made
Streamers of them with the Arms of <hi>France:</hi> These I plac'd round about
my Vessel, and made it look so fine, that several Lords were eager to come
aboard, and would needs go with me to Sea. Finding my self thus
crowded in the time of my disgrace, and fearing it might do me some
new mischief with the King; or at least, that I might not be able to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
his orders faithfully, if I were not absolutely Master of the Vessel,
and had her to my self; I thought fit to acquaint him with it, and did
so. His Majesty was well pleased to see that I rejected the favour of
others, and sought after his only, and that I would apply my self to no
body else, but him, as in truth, I had more occasion to do now than
ever. Therefore forbidding the Lords and all others to go aboard me,
and having told them for a blind, that he would have them all keep
about his person, except such as had Commands, I was left to my self,
and my Ship at my own disposal. Then I fell to cruising, to try if I
could discover the Enemies designs, passionately desiring to do the King
some considerable service, that I might have a little merit to intercede
for my peace, and gain an absolute Pardon.</p>
               <p>I was once at open Sea in the night, when my Pilot, who was a Master
in Navigation, came about an hour before day, and told me, a fresh
gale was rising, and both Wind and Tide stood fair for the Enemy; and
therefore he was afraid, if they had any mind to attempt the Mole, they
would not lose this opportunity. The Pilot was in the right, and spoke
like a man of wisdom and experience; for a little after we heard a
Cannon shot from that part where the <hi>English</hi> Fleet rid, which the Pilot told
me was the first signal, for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight, and if we should hear a second we
might depend upon it that it was so. Having a great confidence in this
man, I immediately raised all my People, both Souldiers and Slaves, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
them to be ready, and at the first touch of the Boatswain's Whistle,
fall to their Oars amain. The second Cannon shot came to our Ears pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after, and then I made them row toward the shore as fast as they
could, and saw the Enemy spreading their Sails, to prepare for attacking
the Mole. Being landed, I immediately went to the King, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, that the Enemy were hoisting Sail, and that the Weather, Wind
and Tide were so favourable, that they could not lose so fair an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:100923:75"/>
At this news the King gave his orders throughout, and afterwards
went with part of the Nobility to the Battery, which was at the Head
of the Bay, commanding me to lye under the shelter of this Battery.</p>
               <p>There was nothing very remarkable in this fight, except the Cannon
shot, of which a prodigious number was fir'd on both sides. There was
nothing to be heard but Peals of Thunder, nor to be seen but Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
in the midst of a dark Smoke, that cover'd the whole Sea. It was
a fine sight to see those monstrous Vessels too, that resembled great floating
Castles; and advancing one after another in very graceful order, gave
Broad-sides at our Mound, of fifty or threescore Cannon shot at a time.</p>
               <p>But as the <hi>English</hi> attack'd briskly, they were as warmly receiv'd. The
Battery where the King was did wonders. He made several shot himself,
delighting extremely in every thing that related to War, and never was
more liberal, either of Lead to the Enemies, or Gold and Silver to his
Souldiers and Gunners. During the whole fight, I kept my self close
under the Cannon of his Battery, according to the orders I had receiv'd,
venturing out only a little now and then, to pursue a Vessel when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
from the Charge, but being forc'd to return very quickly, for fear
of being snapt by some other that came on. There was only one Cannon
Ball fell into my Galliot, with which she was much damag'd, and two
Slaves kill'd.</p>
               <p>XIX. At length the Enemy seeing Heaven declare on our side, and that
all their attempts were vain, made a retreat, fatal to <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to the King and his Arms. Then I fell to cruising again, and
was so happy as to meet with a favourable accident, which was of great
advantage towards restoring me to the King's favour. Seeing a very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
guilded Prow floating upon the water, and the Arms of <hi>England</hi> in
it, I made up, and found it was a considerable Prize, and a Present wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the King. With much ado I haled it up into my Galliot, and return'd
a proud man toward the Beach, where after I had got it ashore, I went
straight to the King's Quarter. As I was going, Monsieur <hi>Bassompiere</hi> met
me, and told me, Monsieur <hi>Canaples</hi> had entreated him, to beg my Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of the King in his name, by reason that his Father Mareschal <hi>Cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ui</hi>
did, as I said formerly, very much condemn his behaviour, and besides
he knew well enough how the King stood affected, which made him speak
first, to get the merit of a thing which hop'd might turn to his honour.
I told him of the good luck I had met with, and he gave me all the hopes
imaginable, advising me to make use of this advantage to ingratiate my
self with the King. I then declared my design, which was to let the
King know, that the Shot which took off this Prow, came from his Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
as indeed it did, and so by degrees insensibly to persuade him, that
his Majesty himself had made the shot. He approv'd of my design, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
me, he thought the true way to go to work for my own interests,
was to advance the King's honour.</p>
               <p>On I went, and at my entring the King's Lodgings, I compos'd my
countenance the best I could, without discovering the least gayety, but
looking very modest and dejected, as became a man, who had reason to
apprehend the consequences of so unlucky an affair as mine, I told his
Majesty, that one of the <hi>English</hi> Vessels was much disabled, and I had
found a great piece of her Prow, which I thought it my duty to bring away,
that his Majesty, if he pleased, might see it. I would not say any thing more at first, thinking he would be apt enough of his own accord to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100923:76"/>
attribute the glory of this shot to himself. He told me he would go view
it, and askt me by the way whereabouts I had found it. I answered very
innocently, and without spurring on too fast, in such a place, on the right
hand, which was the part expos'd to his own Battery. The King, who
passionately desir'd it might be thought his own doing, but durst not yet
take it to himself without some ground, was pleas'd with my answer, and
reply'd, 'twas I that made that shot at such a time, I saw the Vessel fall
off as soon as ever I had discharg'd, and did then believe she had receiv'd
some damage, Upon this I began to confirm his opinion by several cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
which was matter of great Joy to this Prince, who stood
much upon his being a good Marks-man, and did really excel in all mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
matters; there being perhaps scarce a man in his Kingdom, that could
draw up the greatest Army in Battalia so soon, or so advantageously as
himself. He took great pride in showing this Prow, and telling every
one that came, that I could testify it fell upon a shot of his; which was as
much for my satisfaction as his own, for thus I was made a Judge in the
case, and did not question, but having determined favourably for him,
he would not fail to do as much for me.</p>
               <p>Mareschal <hi>Bassompiere,</hi> loth to lose so fair an opportunity, when the
King was in so good a humour, got his Majesty to do that at his request,
and for his sake, which he was inclin'd enough to do of himself, but that
he would have seem'd to proceed more upon favour than justice. I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
beseech your Majesty (said he) to grant me one humble request
which I have to make you. The King who probably guest what he would
be at, he seem'd a little shy, telling him, he could not engage his word
till he knew for what. Sir, reply'd Monsieur <hi>Bassompiere,</hi> I can assure
your Majesty the cause is good, and you will have no reason to repent of
the favour. But tell me what it is (said the King) if the cause be good,
why are you so nice in declaring it? Is it something that concerns your
self, or some of your Relations? Sir, said he, the favour I would obtain
neither concerns my self, nor any Relation of mine, but another that hath
more need. Oh! you are too subtle for me, reply'd the King, I am no Diviner
to know your thoughts. At last Monsieur <hi>Bassompiere</hi> told him that it
was my Pardon, he took the boldness to beg, and did it from Monsieur
<hi>Canaples</hi> too, who was infinitely troubled for the misfortune he had brought
upon me. The King seeming mightily surpriz'd, stood some time silent,
as if he had much ado to grant his request, and yet at the very moment
that Monsieur <hi>Bassompiere</hi> spoke, he prest a little upon my shoulder, as it
were to signify his secret consent. Monsieur <hi>Bassompiere</hi> repeated it again
with more than ordinary importunity, and the King, who only held off to
disguise his own inclination, made a shew at last of being vanquisht, and
said to me, Thank <hi>Bassompiere.</hi> I, who all this while had kept my eyes down,
without speaking a word, as soon as I heard the King's Command, went
to thank Monsieur <hi>Bassompie.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and, then fell down to embrace the
King's knees with these words, Sir, 'Tis to your Majesty that I owe every
thing, I hold both my fortune and life from you, which I hope one day
to lay down for your service, and with my blood to seal my acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for your bounty. The King after a short whisper with Monsieur
<hi>Bassompiere,</hi> bad me go along with him, and do as he should direct me.</p>
               <p>XX. We went immediately to Monsieur <hi>Canaples,</hi> who having had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
by a Gentleman whom Monsieur <hi>Bassompiere</hi> had sent before, came out
to the top of the Stairs to receive him. As soon as we were come into
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100923:76"/>
the Chamber, Monsieur <hi>Bassompiere,</hi> said to Monsieur <hi>Canaples,</hi> Here is
Monsieur <hi>Pontis,</hi> Sir, whom I bring to you by the King's Command.
I will be the Mediator of a perfect reconciliation betwixt you two; You
must either utterly forget all that is past, or otherwise I declare myself an
Enemy to you both. Monsieur <hi>Canaples</hi> whose desire it was, that this
business might be husht up, for the reasons I mentioned before, came im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to embrace me, and willing to prevent me, in civility, said
pleasantly; Sir, I entreat you let us no more remember any thing that
hath happen'd, for it will not be for our advantage, for either of us to
have such an Enemy as Monsieur <hi>Bassompiere.</hi> We have both of us been a
little too obstinate; there hath been heat on both sides, and excess of
passion, and so both ought to excuse it, because both are to blame; and I
hope that this will produce a great good, and that we shall love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the better for it hereafter. Finding my self highly oblig'd by so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
a complement, I made answer with great sincerity and freedom,
that I now esteem'd my self happy in my misfortune, since it procured
me the honour of his friendship; that I hoped to let him see how sensibly
I was oblig'd by this generosity, that he very well knew the air and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of my Country; but could assure him, that tho I were a little rough
sometimes, yet I had a great deal more and better heat for those who ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
me with their friendship. I make you no excuses, Sir, because
you have been pleased to prevent me in first excusing me your self; and
it is best, that neither of us think of a thing, which both wish had never
happen'd. With that we fell to embracing afresh, and Monsieur <hi>Bassom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piere</hi>
made us do it a third time, the better to confirm the Union, which
was ever after so sincere, that Monsieur <hi>Canaples</hi> could not forbear expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a coldness toward those who had sollicited him to prosecute this affair
against me, for he several times declared, that he had not done it of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
so much as by the ill advice of some false friends.</p>
               <p>Then Monsieur <hi>Bassompiere</hi> carried me to Mareschal <hi>Crequi,</hi> who had
shewn himself so generous upon this occasion. And being I could never
sufficiently acknowledge the particular testimonies he had given me of
his noble nature; after the first complements I told him, that I was much
concern'd it was not in my power, to shew by my actions the sense I had
of his generosity to me in this business; that I should most impatiently
long for some occasion of assuring him by my services, how much I thought
my self obliged by his extraordinary goodness in vindicating me, when
almost all the world besides had deserted me; and that this had been one
of the principal arguments, that convinc'd me I had not been altogether
so guilty, as some others would represent, for I knew him too good a
Father, and too just a person, to declare himself without good reason
against his own Son in favour of a Stranger, whom nothing but the merits
of the cause could render worth his consideration. Mareschal <hi>Crequi</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
me with all imaginable civility, that I did him wrong in magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what he had done; as if for being a Father he was to devest himself
of all humanity and justice toward those who might have some difference
with his Children; and that having done no more than his duty, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to be commended so much less, as he ought to have been
condemn'd if he failed in it. And turning to Monsieur <hi>Bassompiere,</hi> Is it
not fit (said he) that every one should have their due? Why should my
Son be allowed to affront a Gentleman, and a man of honour? Let us not
take so much upon us. My Son, though a <hi>Maistre de Camp</hi> in the Regiment
of Guards, hath no right to offer violence to Monsieur <hi>Pontis,</hi> who is
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100923:77"/>
but a Lieutenant. Perhaps my Sons Command is an honour to him,
whereas other perhaps are an honour to their Commands. In short, I
have only this to say, that in case Monsieur <hi>Pontis</hi> had been condemn'd,
I would have carry'd my Son my self to have made him ask him pardon,
for the affront he had put upon him.</p>
               <p>After this I went to pay my respects to the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> and some
other Lords, that had done me service in my affair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it happen'd I
know not how, that I failed of acquitting my self to Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>
of what I was indebted to him upon this account. The conference I had
with Father <hi>Joseph,</hi> and the design I knew he had to draw me from the
Kings service, together with my refusal of entring into his, made me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to appear before him. In the mean while, being a little jealous
of the good offices he did to those who sought his favour, he was much
offended, that after he had himself sought to gain me by his chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
I had failed of thanking him upon this occasion, for what he said
from the King to the Council, about deferring to give Judgment in my
Cause. I knew too, that he had not conceal'd his disgust, for some days
after, the Bishop of <hi>Manda</hi> asking me if I had been to pay my thanks
to the Cardinal? and I innocently answering, That my little access to his
Eminence had hindred me from doing it; he said I was much to blame,
and that the Cardinal would certainly resent it. Then I saw my fault
too late, and desiring to redeem it, I begg'd Monsieur <hi>Cominges Guita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t</hi>
to introduce me to him. But the Cardinal, who never cared for late
homages, and liked only the first incense, receiv'd me very coldly, and
by his set countenance gave me to understand, that my civilities were not
at all acceptable to him. The Bishop of <hi>Manda</hi> too, being willing to
make my excuse, his Eminence could not conceal his indignation from him,
but said these words, which were told me again; He did come indeed to
return me thanks, but it was after he had been with every body else;
I had nothing but the leavings of his Complements: He allowed me only
the last place in his memory and respects, though I had the first in the
defence of his cause; and then too, he did not come so much of his own
accord, as he was brought by Monsieur <hi>Cominges.</hi> So that this fault,
which he took for a slight, joyn'd with my refusal of his service to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Joseph,</hi> was the principal ground of that obstinate aversion he hath
had to me ever since. I was afterwards restor'd to my Command as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
and all the informations preferr'd against me were torn to pieces.</p>
               <p>XXI. The excess of trouble and fear this unhappy business brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me threw me into a violent Feavor. The distemper was suspended
till the affair was over, and then as excessive a joy succeeding, Nature
found herself overpowred by so sudden and so different a change; so
that after having escaped death by the hand of Justice, I found my self
in a new danger, both from my Disease and my Physicians, who were
very near dispatching me, tho without any ill intention. During this
illness, I was somewhat disturbed with the remembrance of my past life,
and particularly for having upon some occasions caused a great many of
the Enemy to be knockt on the head, more out of passion, than for the
service of the State: I fancy'd I saw all those men remonstrating against
me, and demanding justice of God for their deaths. This imagination
afflicted me much, and I resolved to make some amends for this fault:
But upon my recovery I soon found that the resolutions of sick and dying
men seldom are sincere; for when I was well I scarce ever remembred
what I promis'd when I lay sick.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:100923:77"/>
Upon my growing better, the Kings Physicians, Monsi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ur <hi>Bouvart</hi> and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Privos,</hi> having order'd me a purging potion, a wretch that I forbear to
name, took this occasion to get rid of me, and procure my Command: He
corrupted the Apothecary, who sold him my Life, and instead of the Apozem,
mixt me the most mortal poyson he could think of. But I can never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
acknowledge the good Providence that took care of me; for
the night before I was to have taken this deadly draught, I had a very
great Crisis, and sweat to that degree from ten a clock to one, that I
found my self perfectly well. The aversion I ever had to Physick made
me order the Vial to be set by in my Closet, and leave Nature to finish
what she had so well begun. The Physicians coming to visit me, and
see the operation of their Medicine, I told them Sparkishly, Look you
Gentlemen, here is a Miracle, is not this a prodigious effect, and a plain
proof of the vertue of your Physick? They believing it in earnest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
presently to magnifie their prescription, not seeming so much sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
at it, but to expect all this from a remedy so well chosen; adding,
that since the first dose had succeeded so well, I must needs take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to carry off what that might have left behind; and so went away
highly pleas'd with the success of their Physick. I thought however it
was not fit to conceal it from Monsieur <hi>Privos,</hi> who was my particular
friend; and when the company was gone, told him, I had a great Crisis
in the night, and finding my self better upon sweating, had forbore my
Physick: And to confirm what I had said, bid my man bring the Potion.
Assoon as he saw it he cry'd out, Ah Sir! what did they intend to do
with you? They would have destroy'd you, this is rank poyson. God
hath had a particular care of you, for if you had taken this you had been
a dead man. Then he fell to exclaiming and swearing to vindicate his
own reputation, and sent away immediately for the Grand Provost. They
went presently to the Apothecary's, but he was run away, which made
me conclude it was a design, and no mischance, or mistake. I had a sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
of the person that thus attempted upon my Life and my Command,
but it was enough for me that I got off so. I would not bring any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
upon it, and was glad the Apothecary was not taken, lest the
Author of this Crime should have been discovered.</p>
               <p>XXII. And here I must not omit the generosity of Monsieur <hi>Buisson,</hi>
that Gentleman that was a Cadet in my Company, and afterwards quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell'd
with me, for whom as a testimony of my forgiveness and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
I procur'd first a Pardon, and then a Lieutenants place: For he
hearing, tho very late, of this unfortunate business of mine, which was
the chief cause of my sickness, came purposely from <hi>Italy</hi> to the Camp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Rochelle,</hi> some months after I was restored to my Command, to
make me a proffer of his person, and all he had in his power; assuring
me, that both himself and his fortune was absolutely at my service and
disposal. By this extraordinary acknowledgment he had a mind to vye
friendships with me, and let me see, that no misfortune could cool his
affection, nor any distance of place stop the zeal he had for the safety
of a person, to whom he thought himself oblig'd for his life and preferment.</p>
               <p>XXIII. The King, resolving to relieve the Isle of <hi>Rhe,</hi> commanded
by Monsieur <hi>Thoiras,</hi> and invested by the <hi>English</hi> Navy, gave Mareschal
<hi>Schomberg</hi> orders to pass over into it, with the best of our Forces. His
Majesty was then at <hi>Etray,</hi> within a mile of the Trenches. As I was one
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100923:78"/>
night upon the Guard, I saw on a sudden a great flame and thick smoak
over <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and at the same time heard a great noise. I dispatched
two or three Souldiers to know the cause of this uproar, and none of
them returning back, I thought the Enemy might have taken this
opportunity of our Forces being separated, to make some attempt upon
the King's own Quarters. So I drew up our men, and after acquainting
Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> with what past, with him and Monsieur <hi>de l' Isleroy</hi> I
went to the King's Bedchamber. The Mareschal waked him, and I
told his Majesty what I had seen and heard, which continu'd still. The
King presently got up, and went into a Garret to satisfy himself of the
truth of it, and having been an Eye-witness of my report, lookt upon
us, and said, This is no jesting matter. Then he askt me if I had sent
to the Trenches, and order'd the Guards to stand to their Arms; and
when he was satisfy'd I had, he commanded them to dress him, and bring
him his Arms. At that time a considerable Officer, and otherwise a
brave man, but perhaps a little too rash in his zeal upon this occasion,
said to the King, Save your Servants, Sir, save your people; if the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
attack us here your person may be in danger, since part of your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
is gone to the Isle of <hi>Rhe,</hi> and we are but a few left here; I conjure
your Majesty retire to <hi>Surgeres.</hi> The King answered without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n,
I wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot stir from this place, but will fight at the head of my Foot
in person. Bring me my Arms presently. In earnest this generous stout
answer from the King, gave me a joy not to be exprest, which made me
fall down at his feet, and in a great transport say to him; Sir, when we
have our King at the head of us, every single man will be as good as
twenty, and each Company as good as a Regiment; no body will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to spare himself upon such an occasion, but we will all serve you
with the last drop of blood, in our veins. The King then armed and
gave out necessary orders for sustaining an Assault, in case the Enemy
should attack him in his Quarter. But while every one was preparing to
engage, the Souldiers I had sent to the Trenches came and assured us,
that instead of making a Sally, the <hi>Rochellers</hi> had been terribly frighted
with a mischance that had befallen them, by their Magazine of Powder
taking fire, which caused that great noise we heard. The King received
this news, as he had done the other, without any great concern, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
any more joy to see himself in safety, than he had done fear at
the expectation of danger. Then Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> made this reflection
to me, Look you, said he, if the King had followed the advice that was
given him, to retreat to <hi>Surgeres,</hi> he would have had us all three tost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea, when once he found a false Alarm had made him run away. I
was of the same opinion too, and whatever might have happened, I
could never have prevailed upon my self to have given him counsel,
which though it might be for his safety, could never have been for the
honour of so great a Prince. But unexpected accidents do not always
leave us the liberty of thinking, and the wisest men in such cases may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
be mistaken. I remember too, while every one was in trouble
about the King's person, which we thought too much expos'd, an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
consulting perhaps his Majesty's safety more than his own, after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
what might be the cause of this great noise, let this word slip by
chance, I hope 'tis nothing in grace of God. Whereupon all that were
by, and little used to such language, fell to rallying him, as one who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traid
his fear by that expression. And tho I was no better than the rest,
yet I could not choose but be offended at those kinds of Jefts, which
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100923:78"/>
seem'd to me so ill grounded. For is it not brutish to imagine, that to
appear brave a man must forget that he is a Christian? and doubtless if
that Officer had called upon the Devil instead of God, they would have
thought better of him, and not have reproved him. So little do we
know what a man of courage is, when men think being impious is enough
to make them thought brave. In the mean while the affronts there were
perpetually put upon this Officer, were so severe, that not enduring to
be the constant jest of all the Hectors and young Bullies, he was forc'd
a little after to beg a dismission, and withdraw from out of the Army.</p>
               <p>Next morning all the General Officers came to pay the King their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
accompanied with great praises; his Majesty had ordered me to
be about his person, and indeed I made my Court that day after a very
pleasant manner. For the King did me the honour to call upon me
every now and then, and said, Ask <hi>Pontis</hi> how it was, choosing rather to
have it told by another than himself. And accordingly I represented
this action of his Majesty's with all imaginable advantage and zeal; nor
was it any hard matter to succeed that way, for upon this occasion a man
might be a good Courtier without any flattery, and there needed only
a relation of what I had seen to give the King his due commendation.</p>
               <p>XXIV. One day going to relieve the Guard, and being to pass through
a little Valley that lay expos'd, and commanded by a Hill, where four or
five pieces of the Enemy's Cannon were planted; as I rode at the Head
of four hundred men, marching very leisurely, and talking with a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
called <hi>de la Croix,</hi> I laid my Leg upon my Horse-neck, as men do
sometimes to ease themselves, though indeed it was no proper time to
do it, but rather to mend my pace: Just then came a Cannon Bullet,
which exactly took off the Stitrup out of which I had taken my Foot,
and battered it to pieces. The force of the blow beat down my Horse,
but he got up again presently, and attempting to recover my Stirrup, I
found it was clear gone. Then I acknowledged the good providence
of God, that had thus saved my Leg, and probably my Life too, fearing
nothing more than to be maim'd, and out of a capacity to serve the
King. They made a jest of it to the King, and told him I had one of
my Legs taken off by a Cannon ball, but his Majesty hearing afterward
that I had only lost my Stirrup, turn'd it into mirth, and laught at the
oddness of the accident.</p>
               <p>The <hi>English</hi> had blockt up the passes by Sea so effectually, that we
could put no provisions into the Isle of <hi>Rhe.</hi> But the King resolv'd to
thrust in twenty light flat-bottom'd Boats, and order'd me to go along
with Monsieur <hi>d' Esplandes,</hi> who was to conduct them, that I might bring
him back an account of the expedition. When all things were ready,
and the Wind favourable, we embark'd by night, and in a short time
came very happily ashore in the Island, through all the fire and ball that
was liberally bestow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d upon us, and in spight of six great <hi>English</hi> Ships,
that made after us, but could not come up to us for want of Water. The
Bullets lighting upon the Grabel of the Beach, beat great heaps of Stones
into our Skiffs, and kill'd us a great many men; and sometimes one of
them would take off a Sack of Flour from a Souldiers shoulder, as they were
unlading. Monsieur <hi>d' Esplandes</hi> and I sat down to rest our selves, and a
Cannon Bullet hit a Portmantua upon which I sat, carried away part of
the things within it, without doing me any other harm, than throwing
me some fifteen paces off. And as Monsieur <hi>d' Esplandes</hi> urged me to sit
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100923:79"/>
down again, upon a Free Stone hard by him, divining as it were, that
this was no safe place, and better to stand up; just in that nick of time
(which is almost incredible) a shot struck this Stone, and shatter'd it to
pieces. There was but little pleasure in being so familiar with great
Guns, which made me think of hastening back with my report to the
King. And so going aboard a small Boat with only one Waterman, I got
over this Arm of the Sea, through above four hundred Cannon shot that
were made at us in our passage: but that which was a greater difficulty, was
several long chains of beams of wood laid in the Sea at every quarter of
a League, and these linkt together with great rings of Iron, so that at
each of these we were forc'd to wait for some great wave to lift the
Bark over the beams. The King, who scarce expected to see me any more,
believing we had all been sunk, by reason of the great firing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
all night, was very much surpriz'd at my return, and the success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of our passage.</p>
               <p>XXV. At last the time was come for the City, which was the main
hope and support of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> party, to fall into the hands of its law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Prince. It was reduced to such extremity by famine, that a great
many people died for want of Bread; and I will here relate what I had
from my Landlords own mouth, when we were got into <hi>Rochelle.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
the necessities they were in, he protested to me, that for eight
days together, he made himself be let blood, and made it be fry'd to
nourish his poor Child, so by degrees taking away his own life to preserve
his Son's. The Eloquence of one <hi>Salbert,</hi> a Minister of great considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
among them, contributed much to the perswading them to endure
great extremities; their religious zeal made them insensible of every
thing, together with the authority and heroick conduct of <hi>Guiton,</hi> Mayor
of the City, who got great renown in this Siege, seem'd to inspire them
with new vigour and courage. To give you some Idea of his resolution,
I need only say, that one of his Friends shewing him an acquaintance of
theirs languishing and dying of hunger, he answered coldly, Is this so
strange? Tis what we must all come to. And when another came, and
told him they were all dying of hunger, he reply'd as coldly, Provided
there be one left to shut the Gates it's well enough. But Heaven seem'd in
favour of the King's Arms; the <hi>Rochellers</hi> themselves were aware of it,
and confest it very surprizing, to see the weather so fair in that season,
when the Storms and the Sea were used to make all <hi>Rochelle</hi> tremble, and
overflow all the Streets of the Town. But that which made it yet more
astonishing, and which might be very well thought a miraculous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
in this great undertaking, was, that tho the Plague then raged
with great fury in two thirds of the Kingdom, this Canton continu'd
entirely free from it, in the midst of the dreadful necessities of a City
reduc'd to this miserable condition, and of the infection used to attend
great Armies, especially after so long a Siege.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rochellers,</hi> having no hopes left of fresh succours from <hi>England,</hi>
and the Fleet having several times in vain attempted to relieve them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to treat about a Capitulation. One Article of which was, that the
Mayor <hi>Guiton</hi> should still enjoy the honours of his dignity, and its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges entire. The 29th of <hi>October,</hi> 1628. ten Deputies came with the
ratification to lay themselves at his Majesty's feet in his Chamber, where
he was attended with Count <hi>Soissons,</hi> the Cardinals <hi>Richelieu</hi> and <hi>laVal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette,</hi>
Monsieur <hi>Chevreuse,</hi> and <hi>Bassompiere, Schomberg, Deffiat,</hi> and others,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100923:79"/>
where they implored his Majesty's mercy afresh; and the Sieur <hi>de la Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sre,</hi>
the Kings Advocate in the Presidial Court, spoke for them. At the
same time the Citizens from the Rampiers and Counterscarps, crying out,
God save the King. Four hundred men were appointed to go take pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the Town, and prepare the King's Lodgings, to clean the
Streets and Houses, and make all things ready for his Entry. He made
choice of four Captains and four Lieutenants, of which I was one, to
command them, under the Duke of <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> whom we were to obey,
and had express charge not to make the least disorder in the City, with
threatnings of exemplary punishment in case of any complaints against
us. Among other things, the King ordered particularly, that we should
not suffer the Souldiers to sell bread to these hunger-starv'd Wretches,
and only to let them receive some little presents in case people offer'd them
of their own accord. Thus we entred <hi>Rochelle,</hi> possest our selves of the
Gates, and posted Guards in several places. We found the Town in a
most horrid and deplorable condition; the Streets and Houses tainted
with dead bodies, which lay about very thick, without being so much as
covered: For toward the end of the Siege the <hi>Rochellers</hi> were meer
Skeletons, and not men; they were so feeble, that they had not strength
enough to dig Graves, or carry the dead out of their Houses. The
greatest present a man could make to them that remained alive, was
Bread, which they preferr'd as their only remedy that could save them;
and yet this remedy too prov'd mortal to some, who eat it so greedily as
to choak themselves.</p>
               <p>I had like to have been ruined by a quarrel with a <hi>Rocheller,</hi> which
happen'd thus. Having given some Loaves of Bread to one in great want,
I had a mind to a Gun of his, which was a very neat one; I ask'd him if
he would fell it, and finding him a little unwilling, I prest him, till at
last he was content I should have it for eleven Cardecu's. But as soon as
I had paid him, and was carrying off the Gun, he repented of his sale, or
rather that he had not so much Bread as he desir'd, and fell into a rage,
speaking so loud as I heard him, I wish (says he) the silver of those
eleven Cardecu's were melted in his Heart, and the lead of the Gun in
his Brains; he takes my Gun, and makes me sell it him, whether I will or
no. I was surpriz'd at so brutish a complement, and presently turning
back toward him said, Why what's the matter Friend? Have I done you
any wrong in paying the price we agreed upon for the Gun? I thought
you had been an honest man till now, but now you have undeceiv'd me.
The other presently gave me the lye; and then my patience escaping me,
without regard to the King's charge, or the poor fellow's extremity, I
gave him a good swinging C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ff upon his lean Cheek, telling him, he ought
to know whom he spoke to, and not give the lye to a man of honour.
With that he began to chafe and storm, crying out, that he would complain
to the King, that he had violence done him, contrary to his Majesty's promise.</p>
               <p>I quickly saw where this would end, if it were not taken up in time,
and was pretty sure to lose my head, if it came to the King's ear; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did all I could, both by my self and friends, and this man's relations
to pacify him; I offer'd him eighteen Cardecu's more, which he refused,
and resolv'd to be reveng'd whatever came on't. But at last he was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
so close with the entreaties of his best friends, that he grew calm,
and for the pains he had been at to make himself so very angry, I gave
him about a dozen loaves over and above what he had received before.</p>
               <p>Afterwards he came and excused himself to me, and said, his extremity
had thrown him into that violent passion. I made him a friendly remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100923:80"/>
which he took kindly, and gave him to understand, that one of
ahe greatest points of conversation, was to know whom a man spoke to,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd not to offend men of honour by rudely giving them the lye, as he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ad done. At the same time I proffer'd him my service, and as much
bread for himself, or his friends, as he wanted; and thus this difference
was compos'd.</p>
               <p>When the King had made his Entry into <hi>Rochelle,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Angou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesme</hi>
would needs visit the famous <hi>Guiton,</hi> who had held out so long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the greatest Prince of <hi>Europe;</hi> and some Officers, of which I was
one, attended him thither. He was a little man, but of a vast under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and a great Soul; and I was really extremely pleas'd to see in
him all the marks of a gallant person. His House was magnificently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht,
and his Hall adorn'd with a vast number of Ensigns, which he
shew'd one after another, naming the Princes from whom he had taken
them, and the Seas he had sailed. He had a great many Arms in his
House, and amongst the rest one very fine Partisan, taken from a Captain
in fight. I had no sooner commended it, but being exceedingly gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
he would needs present me with it, and forced me to accept that
and a hundred Pikes besides. He made Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> a handsom
answer, when he went to pay him the civility of a visit, speaking to him
of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the King of <hi>England.</hi> He was afterwards
very much dissatisfy'd with the Cardinal; for not having surrendred the
City to the King, till after a promise of having all the Ensigns of his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
continued to him, and one of his Priviledges being, to go attended
with a dozen Halberdeers in his Livery, whenever he appeared in the
Streets of <hi>Rochelle:</hi> His Eminence one day sent him word, That the King
being present in the City, it was contrary to rule that he should retain
these marks of a Dignity, that did not now belong to him, and that the
King was then the only Master and Mayor of <hi>Rochelle:</hi> This new order
strangely offended <hi>Guiton,</hi> who saw himself thus deceived, and fallen
from his honours, contrary to the assurance that had been given him.

                  </gap>ch that he told me, Had he believed they would have broken
their word with him, the King should not have found one living creature
at his entring into <hi>Rochelle,</hi> for he would have held it out to the very last
man. And probably the King would have been forc'd to raise the Siege,
by reason of the Winter, and Storms that came on immediately upon
the surrender of the City; for the fair weather ended the very same day
the Town was reduc'd; and the seventh of <hi>November</hi> following, the Sea
was so boisterous in the night, that it broke down above forty fathom
of the Mound on <hi>Marillac</hi> side. The Chevalier <hi>de la Foyett</hi>'s Vessel was
driven by a gust of wind into the Port, and broke three or four Machines
without any damage to it self; and five or six <hi>English</hi> Ships ran
ashore upon the Coast of <hi>Augoulia:</hi> So that a man may say, had <hi>Guiton</hi>
taken a resolution to hold out but one month longer, as he might have done,
we had been in great danger of losing in one day all the fruit of so many
labours, and so long a Siege. For the ill weather, together with the
breaking of the Bank, would infallibly have relieved the besieged, and
there was nothing but a visible and eminent Providence, that oblig'd them
to yield in a time so favourable to the King's Arms.</p>
               <p>After his Majesty had made some stay in <hi>Rochelle,</hi> to give necessary or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and prevent any new revolts, he returned triumphant to <hi>Paris,</hi> with
the Glory of having in a great measure disarm'd the Protestant Religion
in his Kingdom, by the taking of this City.</p>

               <p>I. DUring the Siege of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> they of the same Party with the
<hi>Rochellers,</hi> under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> made
a great attempt upon the City of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> and had a mind
to draw in one of my intimate Friends, the Baron <hi>de M.</hi> second Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in the Regiment of <hi>Normandy;</hi> the event whereof was so consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
as to deserve a mention in this place, before I go on to the rest of
my <hi>Memoirs.</hi> This Baron <hi>de M.</hi> had married a Wife of the <hi>Hugonot</hi>
perswasion, and being one day at a house of hers, the Baron <hi>Bretigny</hi>
propos'd to him to favour the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> in his design upon <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier,</hi>
and in reward they promis'd to make him Governour of the place,
and Lieutenant General of Monsieur <hi>Rohan</hi>'s Army, or to give him two
hundred thousand Crowns, which the Duke himself engaged to pay him. The
Baron <hi>de M.</hi> was a person of greater fidelity than to consent to so base an
action; but by avoiding one mischief he engaged himself in another, and
resolved for the Kings service to betray the man, who pretended to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
him in betraying the King. The answer he return'd to the Baron
<hi>de Bretigny</hi> was, that an affair of such consequence deserved some consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration;
that he would go back to <hi>Montpellier,</hi> where his Company was
in Garrison, and from thence would acquaint them with his resolution,
by a very brave Souldier, one <hi>Cadet,</hi> whom he had bred up from a Foot-boy,
and in whom he reposed great confidence.</p>
               <p>He lost no time, but gave notice immediately to Monsieur <hi>des Fosres,</hi>
Governour of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> what proposals had been made him. These
two conspired in the same design, which was to betray them, who dar'd
to propose the betraying of their Prince. Monsieur sends <hi>Cadet</hi> away pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
to strike up the bargain with Monsieur <hi>Bretigny;</hi> and the Duke of
<hi>Rohan</hi> was made acquainted with it, who said, he would not engage in
the attempt, except the Walls were laid open on that side by the Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del.
Monsieur <hi>Fosres</hi> accordingly caused them by little and little to be
laid open, in several places, and upon different pretences. Upon which
the Duke, to make sure work, sends an Engineer in the habit of a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100923:81"/>
who was received into the Governours own Company, that he
might see all without any manner of suspicion. The Guard in the mean
while was kept but negligently both in the Cittadel, and the lines of
Communication, by which the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> with four hundred men
was to storm the Wall, and the Ditches which were but of a moderate
height, and so make himself Master of the <hi>Esplanade,</hi> which lay between
the Cittadel and the City. When all things were ready, Baron <hi>M.</hi> gave
notice it was time to execute their design. The Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all jealousies from the drawing his Forces together, gave out, as if
he intended to besiege the Castle of <hi>Courconne,</hi> three leagues from <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier,</hi> to which place he came with seven thousand Foot, and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Horse. The night appointed came, and Baron <hi>M.</hi> and <hi>Guitaut</hi> a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Regiment of <hi>Normandy,</hi> to whom the Governour had entrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the secret, mounted the Guard in the Cittadel. The Engineer, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised
in the habit of a Souldier, saw all that past, so that he could not
have the least jealousy of foul play. Monsieur <hi>M.</hi> after this opened all
the Gates, Draw-bridges and Posterns, and the Engineer went out with
<hi>Cadet,</hi> to go fetch the Duke of <hi>Rohan.</hi> They agreed before, that when
the Duke should be near with his Army, two Officers should be sent to
know, whether any alteration had happened. As soon as ever the Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer
was gone, the Governour understanding it from Monsieur <hi>M.</hi> call'd
all the Captains together, and made the Regiments of <hi>Picardy</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi>
stand to their arms, which might all make up two thousand eight
hundred men. Of these eight hundred were posted in the principal
places and avenues of the City, with order to kill all the Citizens that
should stir out of their houses, or that attempted to throw themselves
over the Walls, by reason four thousand <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gonot</hi> Inhabitants were to take
arms. He posted twelve hundred at the breaches of the Wall of the
City, that looked into the <hi>Esplanade,</hi> going to the Cittadel; and there
threw up in haste great retrenchments with very good barricadoes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
and openings to give way for the twelve hundred men, who had
order to sally out upon the Enemy, as they entred the <hi>Esplanade</hi> by the
Lines of Communication. He set eight hundred men in the Cittadel, of
which five hundred were likewise to sally at the same time, and the other
three, who were all chosen men, to remain with him in the Cittadel.
He caused besides all this twenty pieces of Cannon to be planted upon the
<hi>Esplanade,</hi> and loaded them with Musquet Bullets, and placed a certain
number of good Souldiers with Halberts behind the inner door, within
the Cittadel. On the top of the Draw-bridge, which was made like a
Trap-door, he set <hi>Beine</hi> the Engineer of the place, with a Hatchet in
his hand, and express order not to cut the Rope of the Bridge, till Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Goustonville</hi> should cry out to him, <hi>Harle la main.</hi> All things being
thus disposed with incredible diligence, Baron <hi>M.</hi> told the Governour,
that if the two men they were to send would have him go back with them
to Monsieur <hi>de Rohan,</hi> he was absolutely resolv'd to go, rather than give
them any suspicion, tho he were very well assur'd they would give him
a thousand stabs after he was dead, when they saw themselves so cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but he valued not death, provided he could do the King service,
in revenging himself upon those who thought him capable of failing in his duty.</p>
               <p>II. All things being husht, at last two Officers according to agreement,
came to the Postern to meet Baron <hi>M.</hi> He told them things were in a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100923:81"/>
very geod condition, and that if they pleased, he would bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the place. But they made answer, that knowing him to be a man of
bravery, they had an absolute confidence in him; that Monsieur <hi>de Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi>
was hard by, and would give his orders out, and be with them in
half a quarter of an hour. The Baron reply'd, he would go in then, and
keep himself behind the door within the Cittadel, to open it for them
when they came. Thus they return'd back, and immediately all the
Enemies Forces drew near. Monsieur <hi>de Rohan</hi> in coming altered his
first design of falling on by the lines of Communication, hoping that if he
could get into the Cittadel at first, he should in three hours be master of
the Town. He had with him seven thousand Foot, and three hundred
Horse, and the next morning came three thousand more of <hi>Vevarets.</hi>
The order was, that two hundred chosen men, among which were a
great many Gentlemen and Officers, were to fall on first; that they
should be backt with a thousand more, and the rest according as need
should require. The Baron of <hi>Bretigny,</hi> author of the Enterprize, who
marcht foremost of all, came and knockt very softly at the outward Gate
of the Cittadel, and addressing himself to Baron <hi>M.</hi> ask'd, Cousin, are
you there? To which a Serjeant, who was well instructed what to say,
made answer, Sir, He is gone to take a turn at the Guard, but he hath
left me to assure you, that he will come again immediately to receive
you; in the mean time draw your men up close into order of Battel.
With that Baron <hi>Bretigny</hi> gave the word from hand to hand, Close, close.
One and fifty of these first two hundred being advanced with him, <hi>Beine,</hi>
who was afraid to see so many let in, cut the Rope with his Hatchet,
without staying for the word, and immediately the Bridge fell down
behind, and one part being inclosed between the Gate of the Cittadel
and the Bridge, the rest fell into the Ditch. Those of the Cittadel im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
threw a great many Fire-works, both into the Ditch, and all
about it, that they might the better see what they did, and shot at the
main body without, of which a great many were kill'd and wounded.
As for those that were trapt between the Gate and the Bridge, there
were nine and thirty kill'd, and twelve taken prisoners, of whom most
part were very much wounded. <hi>Cadet</hi> who guided them, naming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and our men having let down a Rope to pull him up to them, they
who were near him drew him back; and detain'd him by force, saying,
They would never suffer him to escape, unless the Governor, or some
body in his name would promise them their lives. And accordingly when
they saw that they shot at them without proffering them any thing at all,
they gave him above twenty wounds, of which however he did not dye:
Monsieur <hi>Rohan</hi> withdrew, full of concern and passion, and ordering his
Ammunition-bread to be thrown away, he loaded his Carriages, with as
many of his dead and wounded, as he could recover.</p>
               <p>What judgment others may pass upon this action I cannot tell, but
for my own part, though some perhaps may excuse it by reason of the
indignation a man of honour may conceive, to see himself thought ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being false to his Prince; yet I own it troubled me very much,
and I could look upon it as no better than a piece of treachery: Nor
could my inviolable devotion to the King's service and interest, prevail
with me to approve that in my friend, which I must have condemned
in my self. The treachery they would have drawn him into, ought not to
have engag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d him in another treachery; nor was it in my opinion an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
he understood the rules of honour and fidelity, to pretend to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100923:82"/>
merit frmo his King, by betraying those that tempted him to betray him.
Treachery does not change its nature, when it changes its object, and it
is always infidelity to break a promise; and to forfeit faith once given,
though it were for the interest of the greatest Prince upon Earth. This
Officer was doubtless highly to be commended for rejecting the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
offers made him by the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> that he might stand firm
in his duty; but that it was not consistent with that duty to surprize the
Duke with fair promises; and that word ought not to have been given,
which ought not, nor ever was intended, to be made good. There was
a way open, and the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> must have esteemed him the more,
if he had flatly refus'd to serve him against the King; but he drew upon
himself the censure of his best friends, in quitting the way of honour,
and taking double and indirect methods; and I confess I could never look
upon a man guilty of so foul and unfaithful an action, as my friend.</p>
               <p>III. A little while after, upon our return from <hi>Rochelle</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> the
King commanded me to go into <hi>Dauphine, Savoy</hi> and <hi>Piedmont,</hi> to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all the passes of <hi>Italy,</hi> designing to march his Army into those parts,
against the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> I went accordingly, and having examined
with all the care I could, all the ways by which an Army could possibly
pass the Mountains, I took an exact account of them, and after two or
three months return'd to <hi>Paris.</hi> The King sent for Monsieur <hi>de Escures,</hi>
who made the Charts, and was Quarter-master General of the Army, and
shewed him the account I had presented; ordering him to examine it
carefully, and compare it with his Charts; and found after by his report,
that my account was exactly true as to the leagues, which was all he would
undertake to answer, not being acquainted with the passes, so well as I,
who was of the Country. Whereupon his Majesty was graciously pleas'd
to say, he was satisfied very well with my service, and that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
it. And he gave present order for all things, for the expedition
of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> whither he intended to go in person with his whole Army.</p>
               <p>IV. About this there happened to me a very unlucky accident at <hi>Paris,</hi>
from which it was a great providence that I escaped. Coming one night
late from the <hi>Louvre</hi> on Horseback, and going to carry my Captain, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>St. Preuil,</hi> some orders, that I had just receiv'd from his Majesty,
found him at play in a house beyond the <hi>Hostel de Bellegarde.</hi> As soon as I
was past this <hi>Hostel,</hi> and got over against the Chappel of the <hi>Hostel de Sois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
my Footman going before me some twenty paces with a Flambeau,
a man at the corner of a street made a thrust at me with all his might,
enough to have run me through and through, and kill'd me upon the
spot; but God guided both the Hand and the Sword so happily for me,
that instead of running me into the belly, it hit under the pummel of my
Saddle, and there broke. The thrust was so violent, that a piece of the
Sword, half a foot long, stuck in the Saddle. Surpriz'd at this pass, which
I heard before I saw it, I leap'd off my Horse, and drawing, I threw the
Fellow down, beat him, and in the heat of my passion was very near kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him. He profest to me, that he was mistaken, that he was <hi>Valet de
Chambre</hi> to Monsieur <hi>Bellegarde,</hi> and took me for another Gentleman, by
whom he had been cudgell'd. Such a mistake displeas'd me very much,
but however, taking some compassion on him, I turn'd back, and went
into the <hi>Hostel de Bellegarde,</hi> and his Master being in bed, I contented my
self with committing his <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> into the custody of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100923:82"/>
of his Horse. The next morning I thought my self oblig'd to go,
and make my complaint to him, and tho he lov'd the fellow very well,
yet to make me satisfaction, he told me, He was a Rogue, and should be
hang'd. But that was not the thing I came for, but chiefly to give him
notice of this disorder, that he might prevent any thing of that kind for
the future; and therefore I told him, That since it had been my chance,
and the man had no malice against me, nor had I received any harm,
I entreated he would pardon him, and only give him warning to be
wiser another time. Notwithstanding he still insisted upon what he had
said, that he would have him hang'd. But assoon as I was return'd home,
he sent him to me by the Gentleman of his Horse, to tell me, he put him
absolutely into my hands, to do what I would with him. I made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that since Monsieur <hi>Bellegarde</hi> was so generous to leave him to my
disposal, I freely forgave him. But the King heard of it, and said he
should be hang'd; tho he contented himself with saying it only, and
did not cause it to be done.</p>
               <p>V. Another occasion was given me of acknowledging the Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
which did not only very visibly spare my life, but gave me an
opportunity of saving another person's, which was in danger. Having
supp'd one night with a Courtier, a good friend of mine, and going
home on Horseback about eleven a clock, attended by two Foot-men,
one of which carry'd a Flambeau, I saw at a distance upon <hi>Nostre-Dame</hi>
Bridge, three or four Villains assaulting a man, whom they had forc'd up
to a Wall, where he was defending himself the best he could. I did
not much deliberate upon giving him the relief I my self should have
expected from another man upon the like occasion, but spurring as hard
as I could in among these Rascals, I so amazed them, that immediately
they ran: but the man was almost as much troubled and astonish'd, as if
he had been still among the Rogues. He did not think himself safe with
me, and I could scarcely bring him to his senses. I askt him, who he
was? to whom he belong'd? and where he liv'd? but could not get one
word out of his mouth. In the mean while, I could not find in my heart
to leave him in this condition neither, doubting he might be attempted
again, and more easily robb'd. I gave him time to recover, and naming
the most considerable parts, and Inns of <hi>Paris,</hi> I got it out of him at
last, that he lodged in the Place <hi>Maubert,</hi> and was Steward to the Duke
of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who was then at <hi>Paris.</hi> I try'd to get him up behind me,
but not being able, because he was a very big fat man, and not yet cur'd
of his fright, I thought it best to alight my self; and giving one of the
Foot-men my Horse to lead, I walk'd with him to his Lodging; where
he return'd me thanks as well as he could, being not yet perfectly come to
himself. He ask'd one of the Footmen who I was, and where I liv'd,
and came next morning to acknowledge the service I had done him, and
a few days after invited me to Supper, to which I took some Persons of
Quality, my Friends along with me, who were no less surpriz'd than I,
at the Magnificence of this Entertainment.</p>
               <p>VI. The King designing (as I said) to march his Army against the
Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> made them set out in the depth of Winter, and he
himself follow'd in <hi>February, 1629.</hi> I staid a little after him at <hi>Paris,</hi> to
pick up some Souldiers that were left behind, and went with about two
hundred to overtake the King beyond <hi>Fontain-bleau,</hi> according to the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100923:83"/>
order his Majesty has given me. As soon as I was come up, I distributed
every Souldier into his owu Compauy, and then took my own place in
the head of mine, to march along with the Army to <hi>Lyons.</hi> My Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
(that is Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi>'s, which I almost always commanded)
consisted at that time of two hundred and fifty men, all lusty fellows,
and well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lad. There were among them about fourscore young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
most of them of very good families, and had very handsom equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page.
I having the honour to be known by all the persons of the Court,
and all the principal Officers in the Army, for one that had always with
great industry apply'd my self to my profession, was very exact in my
discipline, and had a great care of my Souldiers; this made a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
people of Quality do me the honour to entrust their Sons with me,
to learn what the experience and diligence of so many years had taught
me. And I think I may say without vanity, that I was beloved, feared
and obeyed by my men after a very extraordinary manner. But I try'd
by a particular address to win upon the affection of the Cadets; for I gave
them the Command of the Company by turns, that while they were
learning to be Souldiers, they might learn to be Captains and Officers too
at the same time.</p>
               <p>The King was much pleas'd to see this Company in so good order,
and exprest his satisfaction, by granting it a priviledge which others had
not. For seeing my Company so large, and full of Gentlemen of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
I thought it my duty to acquaint his Majesty, that being alone, as I
then was, without my Captain, and having so many young Gentlemen,
whom their Parents had committed to my care, I should find my self
over-burden'd with the charge, unless his Majesty made me some grant
in favour of all those young Cadets, that they might be treated with more
respect than the common sort of Souldiers; for they not having been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured
to hardship, would soon grow discontented, and complain to their
Relations, whom I should by that means make my Enemies, and so might
make most of them at last disband, and quit the Army. The King very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
reply'd, That I did him a kindness in giving him this notice, and I
am glad (said he) that you have askt me what I grant you most willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Thus I had ever after double Quarters for my Company, and by
this means had it in my power to make some distinction betwixt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dets,
and the ordinary sort of Souldiers.</p>
               <p>I was also very careful to prevent any disorders in the Quarters, not
being able to endure that the Souldiers should wrong poor people in
the Villages. To this purpose, when I went out, I always drew up my
Company, and made proclamation, that if any Countryman had cause to
complain, he might come and do it without any fear. Before I dislodg'd I
saw all things restor'd, and never went out of the Town, till I had first
got a Certificate from the Lord and the Parish Priest; being resolv'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to carry my justification in my Pocket, and fearing lest I should be
accus'd to the King. who was more severe to me than all the rest, because
he made me the instrument of reforming the discipline among his Guards.
But I had another reason still, which oblig'd me to some exactness in this
point, and that was, that having so many Gentlemen in my Company,
who were like to be Commanders themselves shortly after, I would not
use them to pilfering, lest when they came to be Officers, they should
suffer their Souldiers to do the same, that they had been formerly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowd
in themselves. And those mean things were not to be indured in
men of birth and quality, whose minds ought to be noble and generous
above the meaner sort of men.</p>

VII. As soon as our Army was arriv'd within some few leagues of <hi>Lyons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
we being to pass the River in Boats, fearing some disorder might happen
in the passage, I told Monsieur <hi>Vienta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> a Captain of the Guards, that
we must endeavour to pass <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, if we would do it safely, and without
confusion; and accordingly we embarkt our Companies, and past early
without any loss or tumult. It afterwards appear'd that our fear had not
been groundless, for there was such a disorder in getting over the Army,
that a great deal of Baggage was lost. The King staid a while at <hi>Lyons,</hi>
and we refresht our selves in the Country round about, and I and my
Company went to a Village about a league beyond <hi>Lyons;</hi> but it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
that this Village, which was assign'd for our Quarters, belong'd to
a Kinsman of mine, a Captain of a new-rais'd Regiment, who was then
in <hi>Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>phine.</hi> His Wife frig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ted to see so many Souldiers, came and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
me to use my best endeavour for exempting her Estate from Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering.
This was no easy matter to obtain, the Army lying so disperst all
over the Country as it did; and I had much ado to prevail with my self
to go about it, but told, the orders were given, and it would breed a
great confusion. But at last yield I did, to a Woman's, and a Relation's
request, and went back to <hi>Lyons,</hi> to see if I could obtain what this Lady
de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r'd. As soon as I came into the King's presence, I humbly besought
him to remember, he was now entring into my Country, and that I came
to beg one favour, which was, that he would direct our Quarters to be
chang'd, because the Village assign'd us belong'd to a Kinswoman of mine.
They press me hard, Sir, said I, to make use of my credit with your
Majesty upon this occasion, or at least the credit they imagine I have.
The King turning to the Lords about him; 'Tis true (said he laughing)
we do now approach his Country, and ought to consider him a little. So
he gave order presently to Monsieur <hi>d'Escures</hi> to change the Quarters;
and as soon as I had receiv'd the order, I return<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to the Village, and
dislodg'd the three Companies the same day, who lost nothing by the
bargain, for they were much better provided for in their new Quarters.</p>
               <p>VIII. But it fell out by an odd accident, that at the same time I did
this good Office for my Kinsman, in clearing his Village of Souldiers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
fix'd in their Quarters; he who had raised a recruit of thirty
or forty men, must needs, forsooth, go quarter at <hi>Pontis.</hi> In my Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor-house,
I had a good stout Bailiff, one of generosity and wisdom too.
This Captain then coming into the Castle, and telling the Bailiff, that he
came to quarter in the House, the fellow receiv'd him very civilly, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to be my Relation, and told him, all there was at his service. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
he entertain'd him well, had his Horses set up and drest, and
gave Bread and Wine to the Souldiers. But when the Captain declar'd
he would stay three or four days, and the Tenants were to receive and
lodge the Souldiers at their own charge, this Bailiff a little surpriz'd at
that, told him, He receiv'd him as his Master's Kinsman, and not as a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and that it was not reasonable his Master's poor Tenants should be
opprest; at which the Officer began to huff, telling him he had his orders
to quarter there. The Bailiff, who was no Fool, thinking it best to give
way, dispatch'd a Messenger privately to me, and inform'd me of all that
past.</p>
               <p>This man's ill nature and unworthy carriage vex'd me I confess, and in
my ill humour I wrote my Bailiff an angry Letter, wherein I said, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100923:84"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

his kindred and friendship, and could no longer look upon him
as a man of honour; and that if his Trunks and Baggage were still in the
Castle, he should not deliver them, till he was paid for all that had been
spent. In the mean while this Captain after two or three days was upon going,
and entreated my Bailiff to send him his Trunks to a certain place that he
nam'd, which the fellow, having not yet receiv'd any orders from me,
promis'd to do; and thus he march'd away with his Company, much
pleas'd with having us'd a Kinsman and a Friend, as if he had been the
most perfect Stranger in the world. My Bailiff, upon the receipt of my
Letter, took an honest resolution to execute my pleasure faithfully, and
like a brave fellow; for soon after, the Captain troubled that his Trunks
were not sent him, sent again to demand them, but the Messenger was
surpriz'd at his answer, That when the Captain paid for what he, and
his Company, and his Horses had eaten and drunk, the Trunks should be
delivered. This news was no sooner brought him, but he came himself
in a great fury to demand his Baggage. The Bailiff answered, When he
would please to defray what expences he and his Souldiers had put me to,
the things were ready for him. How! said he, the expence of my Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers;
why was it not their due? Sir, said the Bailiff, I have order to
deliver nothing without that: My Master hath forbidden me, I know
he will be obeyed, and it would not be safe for me to fail in it. Here
is his Letter, and if you will give your self that trouble, you may read
it your self. He read all my angry Letter against himself, and seeing his
ill nature and baseness represented there to the life, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e could not look
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it without abhorring his own deformity; and not knowing which
way to discharge his passion, he sputtered it out in railing and injurious
language, and at last went away in a rage, seeing his strength too small;
for there were in this Village near a hundred good Souldiers, and brave
Fire-men, ready to fight, as Provencals usually are, and these were all
very well resolv'd to defend the right and interest of their Lord.</p>
               <p>But this Captains mind was soon changed; His Wife, to whom I had
so lately done the good office you heard of, writ him a Letter at this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
time, of the considerable service they had received from me, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring
him, that where-ever he met me, he should express the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments
they would ever have of my generous proceedings, and the
proof I had given of my friendship to them, and my credit with the
King. It is not easie to think the perplexity this news put him into:
He saw himself overpower'd with civilities, when he was loading that
very friend with opprobrious language, and ill usage. Thus he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
between two contrary passions; Anger on one side, and Shame on
the other; and he could not tell at first whether of these he should yield
to: but at last Shame carried it, he confesses himself to blame, is sensible
how he had wounded our friendship, and resolves to make amends. Thus
full of confusion he goes back to my Bailiff, makes a thousand excuses,
pays both for himself and his Souldiers, and hath his Baggage delivered
to him. Afterward he employ'd all his friends, and among others Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Bonne,</hi> who was a Lord of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> to reconcile me to him.
But I could never prevail with my self to own a man for my friend, who
had betray'd such want of honour and generosity; and all I could grant
those who interested themselves for him upon this occasion, was only an
Interview, where all the Complement I made him was this, That having
the honour to know him, I thought my self no less happy in being known
by him, for the man I was. He excus'd himself mightily, but I would
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100923:85"/>
never see him more, thinking a man that had been capable of so much
baseness, would hardly ever change his Nature, or render himself wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be beloved.</p>
               <p>IX. When the King had staid some time at <hi>Lyons,</hi> he past on to <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble,</hi>
and from thence to <hi>Ambrun;</hi> and being his Majesty was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
there some days, I askt leave of him to go before, as far as <hi>Pontis,</hi>
which was not far off, with fifteen ot twenty Officers of the Guards.
We stay'd there four or five days, in which time I entertain'd them so
magnificently, that it cost me two years Revenue. We thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but diverting our selves, when all of us had a great combat to
undergo. On a sudden we heard a great noise as we were walking, that
rattled like a Whirlwind, and looking that way from whence it came,
we saw a prodigious large Eagle, which had fallen upon a flock of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies.
Twelve or thirteen of us that were there, all ran with our Swords
drawn to engage this King of the Air; but the Bird, instead of being
frighted, came on himself to charge us, not being able to mount, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Country was low, and he had not air enough to raise himself,
being very heavy, and surpriz'd too, before he could take all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
for flying away. 'Tis incredible with what fury he made at us,
his strength being so great, that with one blow of his Wing, he stunn'd
and fell'd one of us to the ground, and had like to have kill'd one of the
biggest Mastiffs in the Country, with seizing him in his Talons, as the
Dog came out to seize him. To conclude, after all we could do could
not hurt him with our Swords, nor ever get the better of him, till we
sent for a Fowling-piece, and shot him twice or thrice to get him down.
We carry'd this Eagle along with us to <hi>Ambrun,</hi> to shew it to the King,
to whom Monsieur <hi>Comminges,</hi> who was one of the company, gave a narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Combat; and his Majesty saying he wish'd he had been
there, he very pleasantly replyed, that his Majesty's person had been
less secure in an engagement with this Eagle, than if he had fought
against that of the Empire.</p>
               <p>X. I had order'd all the Souldiers of the Village of <hi>Pontis</hi> to give a
Volley of all the Shot they could make (which amounted to no more
than a few Musquets, and a good many Chambers that I had got ready)
to salute the King, when he past by the foot of the Hill on which the
Village stands. Thus when nothing less was expected, on a sudden a
great noise was heard, and the King standing still upon the Bridge over
the <hi>Durance,</hi> which was in the Valley, seem'd pleased with this Rattle
that I endeavoured to honour my House with, and said in merriment,
He will furnish us with Cannon for a need. After this came the Parish
Priest with the Cross, and all the Inhabitants, to salute the King; the
Curate harrangued his Majesty in his Provencal language, and the King
attemp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed to reply in the same tone, but could hardly make himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
which gave great diversion. After the King had with great
goodness lookt upon these poor people, who fell on their knees before
him, he made them rise, and dismist them.</p>
               <p>I thought this a favourable occasion humbly to entreat his Majesty
would determine a great controversie this Village was engaged in, which
being scituate upon the Confines of <hi>Dauphine</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> was every
day by the ears with the Officers of each Province, while both of them
equally pretended to it. I represented to his Majesty the Tyranny ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100923:86"/>
every year over his poor Subjects, in making them pay their
Taxes twice over; and humbly begg'd his authority would put an end
to these unjust persecutions. The King spoke of it to the Council, and
I had it left to my choice, which of the two Provinces I would settle it
in. Monsieur <hi>Crequi,</hi> who was Governour of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> hearing of it,
laid hard at me to fix it there, promising me his service and protection
upon all occasions. To whom I answer'd, that he did me great honour,
but I humbly begg'd of him, that I might have leave to consult the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the poor people, who found it much more commodious to be
seated in <hi>Provence;</hi> and I knew him so generous and kind, that he
would continue me the honour of his protection, tho of another Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
since of what Province soever I were, I should still belong to
the King, whom he himself was proud to serve. I chose then with his
Majesty's good liking to fix it in <hi>Provence,</hi> to which it belonged indeed
in Monsieur <hi>d' Escure</hi>'s judgment, rather than to <hi>Dauphine;</hi> and I obtain'd
an Order of Council upon the matter. But the King granted me besides,
a fair Privilege to the Mannor-house of <hi>Pontis,</hi> which was, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
all Affairs and Differences of the Village were to be determin'd by the
Judicature of the Province, those that concern the Mannor-house are all
referred to the Kings Council. And this hath been observed ever since,
as well in respect of the Parish business, as the Lords; the Officers of
<hi>Dauphine</hi> make no more pretensions to the one, and the other acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
no Judge but the Council.</p>
               <p>XI. The King came to <hi>Braincon,</hi> where there is a Mountain not to be
past but upon Hurdles, a kind of Carriage, behind which the person that
guides it sits, and makes it slide down extreme steep places, with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
swiftness. His Majesty told me, I being the Guide must shew the
way. The Consul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Daughter of the Country came and offer'd her self
to let me down. The King at first was in some concern, to see a young
Maid undertake a thing that he thought had so much danger in it. But
they assured him this Maid understood the Trade very well, and so
he said smiling, Well, we shall grow wise however at his cost. I sat down
upon the Hurdle, under the conduct of this Girl, and away we flew
down over the Snow, as swift as an Arrow out of a Bow; and having<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
scrambled up again to come tell the King there was no danger, he sat
down, and was guided by the Consul himself, and down he went as fast
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd as safe, as I had done before. He rewarded the man with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
and some Pistoles; and all that waited on the King had th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that
they might pass with greater ease.</p>
               <p>When the King was advanc'd with his Army, within a league of the
City of <hi>Suza,</hi> he commanded Monsieur <hi>Comminges,</hi> a Captain of his
Guards, to go next day to <hi>Suza,</hi> with the Quarter-masters, to take up
Lodgings for him and all the Court. He order'd me to bear Monsieur
<hi>Comminges</hi> Company, that if Count <hi>Verrue,</hi> who guarded the Pass of <hi>Suza,</hi>
should give us free passage, I might bring him back an account; but in
case he should deny it, we might observe the places and ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ner by
which it should be attackt. We went away next morning some twelve
or fifteen in company, and being come within two hundred pac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s of the
streight, we sounded a Trumpet. Upon which Count <hi>Verrue</hi> sent an
Officer with ten or twelve Souldiers, to know who we were, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d what
we would have. Monsieur <hi>Comminges</hi> askt if he were the person that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100923:86"/>
commanded there, beccuse the King had sent him to speak with him.
The Officer bid us stay where we were, and he would return with an
answer immediately. After he had made his report to Count <hi>Verrue,</hi> who
kept this Pass with about two thousand men, he came again to tell us,
That the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nt was coming himself, and that we need not draw forward;
which he said to prevent our discovering the place. Presently after the
Count appeared at the head of two hundred Musqueteers, and after a
civil salute, Monsieur <hi>Comminges</hi> said to him; Sir, the King my Master
hath commanded me to go to day to <hi>Suza,</hi> to prepare his Lodgings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he intends to lye there to morrow night. To which the Count re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
very civilly, Sir, His Highness would take it for a very great honour
to lodge his Majesty, but since his Majesty comes with so much attendance,
you shall give me leave if you please to acquaint his Highness with it
first. What then, Sir, reply'd Monsieur <hi>Comminges,</hi> will not you let us pass?
Sir, return'd the Count <hi>de Verrue,</hi> You must give me leave, as I told you
before, first to acquaint his Highness. To which Monsieur <hi>Comminges</hi>
made answer, Well, Sir, then I go, and make my report to the King.
You may do as you please for that Sir, reply'd the Count.</p>
               <p>Thus we took leave of him, and went back to his Majesty, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
he did not take Count <hi>Verrue</hi>'s answer ill at all, but said, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
like a wise man, and a good Commander; and he would prepare
to act like a great King. So orders were presently given for attacking
the Pass. What was most remarkable upon this occasion, which hath
been so much talkt of since, was, that the Enemy standing firm to expect
us at this streight, which it had been impossible for us to force, was very
much surpriz'd, to see the Count <hi>de Saux,</hi> who had shovell'd away the
Snow, and crawl'd up those high Mountains, come fall on them on a sudden,
and enclose their Rear, upon which they fled immediately, and left all
their Fortifications; so that our Souldiers had leisure to make them feel
the weight of the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Arms, to whom they had the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to deny a passage. There were however a great many of our men
kill'd by the Cannon of <hi>Suza,</hi> which scowr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d all the passage after a strange
manner. Mareschal <hi>Schomberg</hi> was wounded there, but his wound only
serv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to render him more glorious, and more hardy against the Enemy.
<hi>Suza</hi> presently surrendred to his Majesty, and a Peace soon after being
concluded, the King was visited there by his Highness; and the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
to pay his visit, did all he could to surprize him, but he could not.
For the Duke having notice of his coming, came down stairs to meet the
King, who said, I had a mind to surprize you, and have got into your
Chamber. To which his Highness very pleasantly reply<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, So great a
King as he, could not easily be conceal'd. And as the King and the Duke
were passing with a great crowd over a Gallery, that was not very strong,
the King saying, That they had best make haste, lest the Gallery should
fall under them. The Duke return'd this complemental answer, That
one might see, that every thing trembled under so great a King. His
Majesty then shewed him all his Army, and gave him the pleasure of
contemplating the <hi>French</hi> Nobility, after having made him some time
before feel the force of their Courage.</p>
               <p>While our Army lay in <hi>Piedmont</hi> before the Peace, they plunder'd by
right of War; and I having three very beautiful <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Coursers
for my share, Count <hi>Soissons</hi> sent to entreat me to sell him one of them,
to restore it to the Duke; I sent him word, that having given thirty
Pistoles for one of them, he should have him for the same price if he
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100923:87"/>
thought fit; but for the other two which cost me nothing, I would free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
send them to him, without taking any thing for them, The Count
was a little surpriz'd at my answer, and sent me a Purse full of Pistoles,
with this Message; That he would not have my Horses unless he might
pay for them; but though I was not so rich as many others, yet my Soul
was as great, so that I sent him back his Purse with the Horses, without
ever taking any more but the thirty Pistoles, that the Horse I mention'd
cost me.</p>
               <p>XII. The King while at <hi>Valence,</hi> after having repast the Mountains,
understood there, that several Cities had revolted by the inducement
of the Religionists, and therefore went to besiege <hi>Priras,</hi> which was one
of the strongest. Here I lost a very good friend, a Captain of the
Guards, who was unfortunately kill'd by one of our own Centry's, as
he was going to discover some works. And what was most deplorable of all
in this accident was, that his best friend was the cause of his death against
his will. For as he was climbing up the side of a little Hill, this Officer
taking him for one of the Enem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, commanded the Centinel to fire, which
he did, discharging a great Musquet shot upon him, by which he was
slain. I miss'd but little of sharing in his misfortune, having offer'd my self
to go along with him; but he would go alone, and so perisht alone.
Who can in such cases but acknowledge and admire that Providence, that
rules and ordains so many different events, as best pleases him, who parts
two friends to take away one, and save the other; and permits that one
who would have given his blood for his friend, should himself be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
the cause of his death! But my Eyes at that time were too much
fix'd upon the earth, to raise me up to this principle, and went along
as other people with the stream of the age, lamenting the loss of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whom I lov'd, and improving that thought no farther. I shall say
nothing more of this Siege, nor of the other Towns that surrendred to
the King; my design being not to compile a History, which were an
undertaking above my abilities, but only as I said, to observe the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
accidents and circumstances that occur to my mind; such as may be
useful to manifest the Government of the Almighty in the course of this
mortal life; or may afford some light into a profession that I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
my self to so many years with more than common assiduity and
application.</p>
               <p>XIII. At the King's return to <hi>Paris,</hi> there befel me what the world
would think a great fortune, especially for such a one as I, who seem'd to
be cut out more for the acquiring Honour than Wealth; while I saw so
many others advance and enrich themselves in a short time. One day as
the King was at <hi>St. Germains,</hi> and coming very nimbly down stairs to go
a hunting, I happen'd to be there, and his Majesty leaning upon my arm,
that he might go faster and surer, I thought to snatch this opportunity
of begging a considerable Escheat of a Sempstress of the Queen's, one
<hi>Rachel de Viaga, a Spaniard</hi> by birth, one who had not been naturalized,
and then lay extremely sick. I contented my self at that time with giving
a very short account of the matter, and beg that his Majesty would please
to remember me, as he had done me the favour to promise he would.
His Majesty assur'd me he would not forget it; and accordingly hearing
some days after that the woman was expiring, and could not live till
morning, he promis'd me the Escheat. I was sensible I should not want
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100923:87"/>
Competitors, and begg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d the King's protection, representing to him, that
a great many would attempt to deprive me of his bounty, as being more
worthy than I. To which the King reply'd, Go, go, take you no care,
I'll support you against them all. And his Majesty shewed afterwards,
that he had taken me into his protection, preferring me before several
Lords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who would fain have been nibbling at this Escheat, which was
indeed very considerable, and what I might very well look upon as a
reward his Majesty's bounty intended me for all my past services.</p>
               <p>The Sempstress dying that night, next morning by break of day seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
great persons, as the Duke of <hi>Elbeuf,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de Rambouillat,</hi>
Great Master of the Wardrobe, and some others, came to beg this Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheat
of the King; but his Majesty, mindful of the promise he had made
me, told them all, It was not in his power, for he had dispos'd of it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
He explain'd himself no farther as yet; but presently after told
the Duke of <hi>Elbeuf</hi> all, who had a great kindness for me, and declared
himself very well satisfied with my having it; protesting that had he
known his Majesty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s inclination to do me that favour, he would have
joyned with me in the request; but the rest were not of his temper,
and especially a great Officer in the Houshold, who shew'd himself too
importuning and troublesome, when it was too late; and after he knew
it was given to me, charged the Usher of the Chamber not to let me in
the next day. So that when I thought to prevent the ill offices which I
knew very well were design'd me, and came to present my self betimes in
the morning at the Chamber-door, to have audience one of the first, the
Usher a little roughly bad me stay till the King was up. I guest whence
this came, and knew the shutting me out of the Kings Chamber was to
shut me out from his bounty too: But I believed that a Prince, when he
had declared himself as his Majesty had done, would soon stop his Subjects
mouths, and that no one could be so bold to ask, or so successful to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a Grace that his Majesty had so frankly bestow'd upon me.</p>
               <p>I waited then till the Crowd came, and went with some Lords into
the Chamber; as soon as I was in the room I made my reverence to the
King, and pray'd him to remember me; to which his Majesty replyed,
I have remembred you, I give you what I promised, and what others
have tryed in vain to take from you. Go presently to <hi>la Vailliere,</hi> and
bid him from me draw up your Bill of Donation for this Escheat. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
his Majesty to send some one immediately from himself, telling
him, that Monsieur <hi>la Vailliere,</hi> might otherwise make some difficulty of
the thing. I see, said the King, you are used to take your securities; go you
before, and I will send some body after you. I went away immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and it fell out as I had foreseen, for Monsieur <hi>la Vailliere</hi> told me, he
would speak to the King about it first; that he was going to the <hi>Louvre,</hi>
and would discourse him about it. I had a mind to be by, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
going into the Coach with him, we went together to the King.
There I found Mr <hi>L.</hi> and <hi>St. G.</hi> who not judging so favourably of me,
as his Majesty had done, and thinking this gift more fit for them, were
so bold as to ask him, If he knew what this Escheat was worth? The
King told them, he thought it might be worth fifty thousand Francks.
How, Sir! said they: Yes, above two hundred thousand; whereas if
your Majesty had given Monsieur <hi>Pontis</hi> fifty or threescore thousand Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres,
would not he be well enough rewarded? This confident answer
very much displeased the King, who not liking to have his actions so
controul'd, said with a voice of Authority, Kings govern themselves by
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100923:88"/>
their own wills, if this Escheat were worth a hundred thousand Crowns,
I would give it <hi>Pontis</hi> with a much better will. You think because he
has but little, I should give him but little; and I quite contrary would
give him much more than I do, because I know he hath a great deal of
Merit, tho but a small Estate. This answer out of the mouth of a King,
and pronounced with a more than ordinary Emphasis, struck them all
dumb, and gave me a joy past my power to express, to see his Majesty
take my part so warmly against the great ones, who thought they had a
right to oppose his favours to me.</p>
               <p>My Bill being presently dispatched, a Courtier who had a considerable
Office, made me this pretty Complement; Sir, You are not acquainted
with affairs of this kind, if you will give me one half of this Escheat, I
will quickly put you into secure possession of the rest, without any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or dispute at all. I knowing him a very cunning man, and a little
concern'd in the business, thankt him civilly for his kind proffer, to do me,
or rather indeed himself that good Office, telling him, the burden was
not so heavy, but that I both would, and could bear it all my self. I
sent away some Souldiers of my Company into the Country-houses that
belonged to this Sempstress, whose Heir I was constituted; and being
desirous to acknowledge in some measure his Majesty's liberality toward
me, I sent him a Present of all the Holland and Baptiste which was in her
Shop at <hi>Paris;</hi> and among other things a great Point<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bed, which the
King gave the Queen, valued at ten thousand Crowns. The Hollands
he gave among the Queens Maids of Honour. But I afterwards found I
had been too free, thus to give back again a good part of what the King
had given me: For after I had cleared my hands of the rich Cloaths and
sumptuous Bed, and had taken pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ession of the Lands and other Estates
of this Sempstress, one of her Kinsmen presented a Request to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in pursuance of an old Letter, by which he pretended to shew,
that this <hi>Spanish</hi> woman had been naturalized. I was basely down in the
mouth at this news, and resolved to send one on purpose into <hi>Spain</hi> for
more particular information; but all the service that did me, was only
the throwing away five hundred Crowns more, which this mans journey
cost me. For after the matter had lain a long time before the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
at last Judgment was given against me, that all the Land should
go to the Kinsman, and the Movables should be mine. Thus after I had
given the best of the Goods away, I was dispossest of the Land; and
that which should have been worth to me above two hundred thousand
Livres, was not worth above ten thousand, all charges born. The King not
being able to forbear laughing at me, said one day, Well <hi>Pontis,</hi> thou
wert born to be a man of Honour, but not a man of Fortune. Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reply'd
I smiling, it has depended upon my self to make me a man of
Honour, but it will depend only upon your Majesty to make me a man
of Fortune, and that may be done whenever you please. But how
comes it to pass, said the King, that thou couldst not keep this Escheat?
Sir, said I, your Majesty gave it me, but your Justice hath taken it from
me; but you have it in your power always to repair this loss of mine
with advantage, by some other Grant. The King only laugh'd at what
I said, and I remain'd the same I was before. For most certainly, God
who knew that Riches might have been my ruine, by tying me faster
to the World, always set those great fortunes, to which I might have
some pretensions, at a distance from me; and by an effect of his infinite
mercy, that I did not then discern, let me be crost in the designs of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100923:88"/>
my whole life, because he had another design upon me, much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious,
than all I could wish for then. The more diligent I was in
my Command, and the more faithful in all parts of my duty, the less I
advanced in my fortune. The King, whom I serv'd with incredible zeal,
shew'd a particular affection for me, as several passages in these <hi>Memoirs</hi>
declare; but then his keeping me always about his own person, hindred
him from raising me to considerable Commands, that might have given
me greater liberty to retire; and he was not over-hasty in doing any
great matters for me in the condition I then was, that so he might keep
me to a more absolute dependance upon him alone.</p>
               <p>XIV. There happen'd to me about this time, as I was upon the Guard
at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> a rencounter pleasant enough in it self, but untoward for
the consequence it might have had, and the quality of the person con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in it. The King had given me command to lye upon the Guard,
contrary to what other Officers used to do; desiring to have me extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
obsequious to him, and fixt to his person, knowing me par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
faithful and affectionate in his Service. The Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi>
who then lay in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> coming home on foot one night very late, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to surprize the Guard in a jest, which had like to have cost both
him and us very dear. He being always well attended, some of his Train
had got within eight or ten paces of the Centinel; and then threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so nimbly upon him, that they wrapt him up in a Cloak, and stopt
his mouth with a handkerchief to hinder his crying out. Then they
came all together to the Guard, and began to cry, Kill, kill: I was laid
down upon the Mattrice, and most of the Souldiers were asleep; but
we were soon rouzed; and I, surpriz'd to see my self so prest on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
ran out of door with my Sword, crying, To me, To me. I call'd
the Pikes and Musquets, and began to push our assailants very vigorously;
whose shoulders were well cudgell'd with bangs of Pikes distributed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
liberally; and finding such warm entertainment, they cry'd out, The
Duke of <hi>Orleans;</hi> and he himself cry'd out, <hi>Gascon, Gascon.</hi> But the
more they cry'd the more I laid on, without hearkning to any thing
they said, till at last we enclosed them all in the Guard-room, and were
about to use them very scurvily: But knowing the Duke, I cry'd out,
Oh, my Lord! what have you done? you have hazarded your own, and
all our lives. I got him presently into my Chamber, and with much ado
appeas'd the tumult, the Souldiers being heated, and much enrag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, for
having suffer'd themselves to be so surpriz'd.</p>
               <p>There were no lives lost, because it was done all on the sudden, and
the Souldiers had not time to recollect themselves, or come into a posture
for doing mischief. I came afterward to the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and told
him, I was at my wits end for what had happen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d; but his Highness ought
to pardon us, since we could not do otherwise than we had done, not
knowing who they were, and that we had all been lost, had we suffer'd
our selves to be forc'd. To which the Duke answer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, Go, go, it was
only a frolick, and if you say nothing, we have no great reason to brag
of it. I could not take this for a jest though, and apprehended some
disgrace from it. The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> protested that he pardon'd me
with all his heart, and gave me the assurance of it by looking graciously
upon me. Never was Prince in such a fright, his Jest having succeeded so
ill, and seeing himself so vigorously attack'd by his own fault, and ready
to be knock't o'th' head by those whose duty it was to defend him. It
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100923:89"/>
was very fortunate both for him and us that he came off with life, since
otherwise we had all been lost without remedy, though it was but the
performance of our duty. It is ill playing such pranks, unworthy not
only of a Prince, but of the meanest Gentleman. I attended him to his
Apartment, where he caus'd himself immediately to be let blood. I
reprov'd the Centinel severely, who was a brave Cadet, and more unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
than faulty, though according to the Rules of War, he deserv'd
to have been punish'd.</p>
               <p>In the morning I was at the King's rising, not daring to conceal this
affair from him, which he must needs have heard from others. He took
me into his Cabinet, and I gave him an account of all that past. He askt
whether his Brother were hurt, and understanding that he was not, he
only laught, and said, I perceive they were well beaten, but 'tis no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
they deserv'd it. But fearing still lest the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
this affront, I took the liberty to beseech his Majesty to make my
peace with him, which he promis'd to do. He sent one of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the Chamber to see how he did, without taking notice of any
thing. The Duke, who had no great mind to divulge what had befallen
him, sent word he was well, but had been let blood for a slight indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.
And coming a little after to the King, his Majesty took him into
into his Cabinet, where, after having intimated that he had heard of
the business, and rattled him soundly for his rashness in exposing his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
so, he call'd me in, and said to the Duke; Here is <hi>Pontis</hi> in great
confusion about your matter. To which the Duke immediately made
answer, That he did not take any thing I had done the least ill, but
was ready to serve me upon all occasions. And indeed he resented it so
little, that when I desir'd a little after a Colours for one of my Souldiers,
his Royal Highness gave it me at first word.</p>

               <p>I. THE Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> seeing the King at a distance, and now
gone back to <hi>Paris,</hi> thought his honour concern'd to break
that Treaty with him, the making of which had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the effect of necessity more than choice. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he sought the alliance of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and of the Emperour,
who had sent the grand <hi>Colalto</hi> with a strong force to invest the Duke
of <hi>Mantua</hi> in his Capital City. The King conceiving a just indignation
at this breach of Faith in the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> sent Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> in
the beginning of the year 1630. to repass the Mountains, that he might
relieve his Ally the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and revenge this false dealing of
the <hi>Savoyard.</hi> The Cardinal's March was very splendid and remarkable,
when he past through the Plain of <hi>Montohris</hi> to go to <hi>Pignerol.</hi> For he
march'd the Army in Battalia, and all the Officers on foot for a
whole day, himself in the middle of the Army in his Coach, playing with
a very pretty little Boy, that was almost always with his Eminence, and
never from him, except when he came as a Spy to make his observations in
the Army. He discharged this piece of service notably, though he was
but very young, and in this respect proved himself a wonderful Scholar
of so great a Master. For he would come and toy and play up and down
among the Officers and Souldiers, without ever discovering any thing of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100923:90"/>
his design, and then all he heard he was sure to tell to the Cardinal. Thus
he put a trick upon all the world the more securely, because of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
that appear'd in his behaviour, and concealing his malice under
the usual simplicity of that age. I for my part being then in the Army,
and particularly observ'd, by reason of my refusing to put my self into
his Eminence's service, no doubt was no more spar'd by this youngster
than all the rest; though I kept my self pretty much upon my guard, so
as to be careful not to speak any thing worth telling again. But who
would ever have suspected so young a Spy, or have thought that the play
of a Child so little, should have been made use of to cheat, and put a
trick upon all the Officers of the Army?</p>
               <p>When we were come to a Village near the little River of <hi>Oria,</hi> his
Eminence was visited there by his Highness of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to whom, by his
orders, we all paid the same honour as to the King himself. After this
first interview, which was to propose an accommodation, the Cardinal
made ready to pass the River with all the Horse at the Foord, having
sent the Foot another way about to go over the Bridge. That which I
thought very observable on this occasion, was to see a Bishop and a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
with a water-colour'd Cuirasse on, and a Feuille-mort colour'd
Habit, embroider'd with Gold, a curious Feather round his Hat, two
Pages marching before him on Horseback, one of which carried his
Gantlet, and the other his Head-piece; and two more Pages on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
on each side of him one, with a very fine led Horse; and after him
came the Captain of his Guards. Thus equipp'd he past the River <hi>Oria,</hi>
with his Sword by his side, and a Case of Pistols at his Saddle-bow. And
when he was got to the bank on the other side, he made his Horse prance
and curvett before the Army, some a hundred times together, as if he
took a pride to shew the world, that he very well understood that
exercise.</p>
               <p>II. From thence we remov'd and lay at <hi>Rivoli,</hi> where the Cardinal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a second visit from his Highness of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to whom at his coming
we paid the same respects as before. But after the Cardinal and the
Duke had some discourse together, and the Duke would not comply
with some proposals made to him, we receiv'd orders to take no more
notice of him at his going away than if he had been a meer private man.
So that presently laying down our arms, we walk'd and talk'd with
one another, and made as though we had not seen him pass by.</p>
               <p>III. The Cardinal resolving from <hi>Rivoli</hi> to go besiege <hi>Pignerol,</hi> made
use of a common stratagem to impose upon the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
a laying Siege to <hi>Turin,</hi> that so his Highness being wholly taken
up with the fortifying himself there, might not take any care of putting
any succours into <hi>Pignerol.</hi> His Eminence therefore having march'd upon
the Van-guard and Artillery within a league of <hi>Turin,</hi> gave order that
the Rear should immediately draw off towards <hi>Pignerol,</hi> and so changing
the Rear of his Army and making it the Van, he gave this City such a
surprize that they saw themselves invested before any succours could get
into them, which reduc'd them to a necessity of surrendring in very
few days. Poor Monsieur <hi>de Comminges,</hi> a Captain of the Guards, and
my very particular friend, lost his life at this Siege through his own fault.
For I having been two or three times to make my observation of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
work, and see if it could be carried on still further, so as to make
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:100923:90"/>
a Lodgment nearer the Town. He would needs go to view it too,
and ask'd the Mareschal <hi>Crequi</hi>'s leave to do so: Who told him at first,
that he advis'd him not to put himself upon any unnecessary hazard of
his life, since I had seen all that there was to be seen already. This however
did not prevail with him, but he urg'd the Mareschal on, till at last he got
leave to go have his brains knockt out; not considering that God often
punishes the rashness and ostentation of such as court danger. He begg'd
of me to shew him the way, which I knew not how to deny; and he
went on farther than I did. As we were coming back again, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
I know not how, that I stay'd a little behind, and as he walk'd on
before me very softly in a place that was much exposed, I desir'd him to
mend his pace, and not value himself upon his Courage, because I saw a
fellow levelling directly at him.</p>
               <p>He, without question loth to discover any fear, went on at his old
rate, defying the death that threatned him, and in that very instant was
shot quite through the body, with a Musquet-bullet, with which he fell
to the ground. He did not dye however upon the spot, but was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
into the Camp, and liv'd some days; and then, tho too late, he
confest himself to blame, for not having taken Monsieur <hi>de Crequi</hi>'s, and
my advice. I was sensibly afflicted to see him in this condition, but there
is no preventing a mans misfortune, that will run upon his own death;
and I never saw a plainer instance of the Divine Justice, in punishing
those that presume to tempt Providence, and cast themselves into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
when there is no occasion for it. For tho he was really a gallant
man, and my very good friend, yet I cannot but condemn such impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
carriage as this was. It is fit, nay it is necessary not to be afraid
of death, when the discharge of one's duty is concerned, but to brave it
unseasonably is the very extremity of folly. I own I always disdain'd
that ridiculous fool-hardiness, and never could value my self upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
my person to a Gun, without being called to it. Nothing is more
idle than to dye at this rate; 'tis to draw upon ones self the scorn and the
censure of all mankind, for the sake of a mistaken notion of Gallantry.
Indeed I cannot inveigh too severely against this vain imagination of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
that takes off a world of young persons; and they would do well
to learn from the examples of those that have gone before them, that
such a sort of death connot be reputed honourable, either by God or
Man.</p>
               <p>After the surrender of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> I was one of them that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to see the Town fortify'd, and there I built a large Bastion,
that went afterwards by the name of <hi>Pontis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. While the Kings Arms met with so good success in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> under
the command of Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> his Majesty made preparations for
removing with the whole Court to <hi>Lyons,</hi> about the middle of <hi>May, 1630.</hi>
And in regard the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> still persisted in maintaining what he had
begun, the King went and besieged <hi>Chamberry;</hi> which yielded present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
with very little opposition. But as little as it was, Monsieur <hi>de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naples</hi>
received a Musquet-shot before it, of which he dyed a little while
after. Upon the surrender of the place, he was carry'd in thither. It is
impossible for me to express the friendship and tenderness which he did
me the honour to profess for me during his illness: Perhaps there never
was a more perfect reconciliation seen. He desired me not to stir from
his Bed-side; and once mentioning the difference that happen'd between
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100923:91"/>
us at the Siege of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> he said, with a most extraordinary goodness,
<hi>Really, poor</hi> Pontis, <hi>I did not know thee, and it seems a quarrel was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to bring us to a right understanding of one another, and make us good
friends.</hi> I had much ado to steal from him to discharge the duty of my
Post; and unless he was told that the King or some of the Generals had
sent to speak with me, he complained that I had a mind to desert him,
in a condition, when he profest to repose the greatest confidence in me.
I did all in my power to return so sincere a kindness: I comforted him
the best I could, I encourag'd him, and gave him good hopes; and I
may say, that if Providence had not otherwise disposed of him, I might
have expected to find a second <hi>Zamet,</hi> for friendship and open-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
But his hour was come, and so will ours at one time or other; and
I must do him the Justice to say, being by when he expired, that he dy'd
with a great sense of Piety.</p>
               <p>V. Several other places followed the example of <hi>Chamberry,</hi> and every
thing yielded to his Majesty's Arms. But one remarkable accident befell
me at <hi>Montmelian;</hi> which the Mareschal <hi>de Chatillon</hi> was ordered to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege,
or rather indeed to carry on the Siege begun by the Sieur <hi>de Vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noles.</hi>
Our men having one day raised a Battery against two low Flank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and distressing them pretty much, the Enemies cast up another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
ours, consisting of five or six of their biggest pieces of Ordnance,
which fired so terribly, that all the Carriages of our Guns were broke to
pieces, and the Gunners either kill'd or beat off from their Post. I was
upon the Guard about fifty paces off, and apprehending that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
exalted with this good success, might make a Sally; I immediately
went to the Centinel, and directed him to keep close upon his Guard,
for fear of any surprize, which I very much suspected; and then repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to my own Post. Assoon as ever I came there, a Cannon-bullet
grazed along a Wall, against which the Souldiers of the Guard had set
their Musquets an end, and taking them in a row, cut them all off in
the middle, and at the same time made them all go off. This great noise,
and the surprize of so odd an accident, made me retreat some few steps
backward, as men commonly do in the first fright: But Providence so
ordered it, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>consternation I was in at this sudden and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Crack, was the occasion of saving my life. For in the very instant,
came one or two Cannon-bullets more, that took the top of the Wall,
and overturn'd it just in the place, from whence the first had made
me retire. God however design'd to make me sensible that my preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
was owing to him, by suffering me to be overtaken by a great
Stone, which falling upon me, broke my Gorget, and bruised my
Shoulder.</p>
               <p>VI. In <hi>September</hi> the same year 1630, the King was taken very ill at
<hi>Lyons:</hi> And in the time of this sickness Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> had very ill
offices done him to his Majesty. The Cardinal having notice of it, thought
his presence at Court neces<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ary, to scatter this great storm that was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
against him, by the secret practice of some very powerful Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
He left the Army therefore under the command of the Mareschals
<hi>la Force, Schomberg,</hi> and <hi>Marillac;</hi> giving nevertheless all the private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
to Monsieur <hi>Schomberg,</hi> who was his particular Friend and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident;
and so went straight to <hi>Lyons.</hi> The King, afterwards being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> whither the Cardinal attended him, that
his fortune might not run a second risque by his absence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:100923:91"/>
While our Army were refreshing themselves in quarters, I was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Generals and Controllers, to fit up all the Mills on the River
<hi>Mante;</hi> and the Commissioner for Victualling being fallen sick at the same
time, I receiv'd a Commission to provide the Army with Bread. Going one
day to view the Mills that wanted repairing, I saw at some distance a Chapel,
which I went up to, not out of devotion, but curiosity. Finding the
doors barricado'd, I had a mind to know what was within; so I made a
Souldier get up, who having broke a piece of Glass, discover'd a great
many Sacks of Corn heaped one upon another. After this so fortunate
discovery, and so beneficial to our Army, who were then in want of
Bread, I waited on the Generals, and promised to furnish them with a
great supply of Corn, provided they would but find me a good many
Waggons, and a sufficient Convoy. The next day all the Waggons of
the Artillery, and about a hundred and fifty belonging to the Army,
were sent me in, and with them as many Souldiers as I desired. We
loaded, and carry'd off this Corn, all except some fifty Sacks, which we
could not bring away, because the Country was alarmed, and some
Troops fell upon our Convoy, which charging the rear of the Baggage,
had done us a great deal of mischief, if we had not made a timely retreat.
The Generals order'd me for my recompence the fourth part of a Crown
for every Sack: But I can safely say, that in the trust committed to me
of providing Bread for the Army, I could easily have made my self a
very great gainer, had I not declin'd industriously all other advantage,
but what I thought fair, and strictly agreeable to the rules of honesty
and honour.</p>
               <p>VII. Thus our Army refresh'd themselves in the County of <hi>Mante,</hi>
when the King was importun'd by Monsieur <hi>de Thoiras,</hi> who held out the
Cittadel of <hi>Cazal,</hi> to relieve him against the <hi>Spanish</hi> Troops, that were
set down before it. Hereupon he sent orders to the Generals, that the
Army should march with all possible speed to the relief of <hi>Cazal.</hi> When
this resolution was taken and made publick, Monsieur <hi>de Schomberg</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
me to provide Bisket-bread sufficient for the whole Army for ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
days march; which accordingly I did. And besides this provision,
I presented Monsieur <hi>de Schomberg</hi> with two thousand Aniseed Biskets,
Monsieur <hi>de la Force</hi> with eight hundred, and Monsieur <hi>de Marillac</hi> as
many; and to the Mareschals <hi>de Camp,</hi> Controllers, and Treasurers
of the Army proportionably.</p>
               <p>The whole Army, with all their equipage, being come to the plain of
<hi>Raconis,</hi> was drawn into form of Battel, and divided into three bodies,
the Van-guard, Main body, and Rear. Thus they continued to march,
till we advanced within fourteen or fifteen leagues of <hi>Cazal;</hi> when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
was given, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had joyn'd the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to fall
upon our Flank. This obliged us to alter the method of our march.
The Army was then ranged in three Columns; the Van-guard composed
the right, the Battalion the middle, and the Rear the left Column. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the middle and the right Column marcht all the Cannon, Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
and Ammunition; between the left and the middle, went the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
of the Generals and all the Army; so that all was hemm'd in. The
Horse went upon the wings, in front and flank, by Squadrons, and in
form of Battel. Marching in this manner through all the plains, our
Army was continually in a posture for fighting, either for the <hi>Savoyards,</hi>
who were upon our Rear; or the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that were in Front of us.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100923:92"/>
But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not stir out of their Trenches, making themselves
sure of the Fort of <hi>Cazal,</hi> which they kept close blockt up. When we
came to the Village of <hi>Oximeane,</hi> about four small leagues distant from
<hi>Cazal,</hi> we halted there three days, in expectation of news from Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Thoiras;</hi> to whom six men had been sent to give him intelligence
of our approach, and to assure him of relief, as also to agree upon a
time, when our Troops should be drawn on, to attack the Trenches.
But only one of those six that were sent came back to us again. All mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
being duly adjusted, orders were given to lead on strait to <hi>Cazal.</hi>
About a league from the Town we halted, to stay for the signal from
the Cittadel, which was to be a great smoak, to give us notice that all
the Garrison were ready, and in Arms.</p>
               <p>As soon as ever the sign was given, all the Troops advanc'd, being
distributed into three bodies: Monsieur <hi>la Force</hi> commanded the right
wing, Monsieur <hi>Marillac</hi> the left, and Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> the main battel,
because this happened to be his day of commanding in chief. Before we
came up to the Trenches, he gave us a short speech to this effect, but
with abundance of warmth, and such a lively and warlike eloquence as
becomes the mouth of a General, and is most likely to inspire an Army
with courage. Fellow-Souldiers, (said he) you have now an occasion of
the greatest honour, and highest consequence that our age hath ever seen:
I cannot but expect a good event of it, when I observe both the courage
and zeal of so many brave men, whom the King hath entrusted with the
honour of his arms; and the confusion of our Enemies that tremble al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
before they engage us. If you have been stout formerly, to day
you must be Heroes. Danger and Death overtake those that fear and
fly from them, but the man that can look these in the face, and fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
is half a Conqueror already. We have one Army before, and
another behind us. They that flee will be killed shamefully for Cowards,
and they only that take their enemies lives while they lose their own, will
dye like men of honour. I pardon that man from this minute that falls
upon me, if he sees me behave my self like a Coward, but I will not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
him that runs away himself. Come on then stoutly, where honour
and duty call, and I engage my word to all them, that shall signalize
themselves in the service of their Prince, to give his Majesty a true esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
of their bravery, and to take care, that their services shall be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
and rewarded as they deserve.</p>
               <p>These few words, with the advantage of that vehemence with which
they were uttered, and the courage of those that heard them, made the
whole Army go on, as though they were already secure of coming off
Conquerors. The Forlorn-hope, and those appointed to support them
advanc'd. When they were within half Cannon shot they went to
prayers, as is usual; and all in deep silence expected the discharge of a
Cannon from the Town, which was to be the signal when we should fall
upon the Enemy. In the moment we heard it, our Troops advanc'd with
incredible resolution and heat, though we put our selves full upon the
mouth of the Cannon, that was planted along the Enemies Trenches, and
must needs make a horrible slaughter among us. The Mareschal <hi>Marillac,</hi>
who by his Post was the forwardest, had began the attack, and we were
all in the best disposition that ever Army was seen, to fight for the honour of
our Prince and Country; when all on the sudden, to the great dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the whole Army, Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> was discovered riding
from the Enemies Camp, holding a Sheet of white paper in his hand, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100923:92"/>
waving it about, for a sign of a Treaty of Peace, crying aloud, Halt,
halt: Stand, stand. The Souldiers were so enraged to see themselves
checkt in the midst of their Career, that some of them were so extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
as to discharge several Musquets at him. Our Generals had much
ado to stop them. But at last Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> having liberty to draw
near, and confer with the Mareschals of <hi>France,</hi> declared to them, that
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Generals, had sent him to present them that paper, that they
might propose what terms of peace they pleased. Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi>
reply'd, that this matter was of so great consequence, that it was fit the
Generals on both sides should personally confer together, and that as long as
they treated by Messengers and Writing only, there would always be some
scruples remaining, which would only be the seeds of fresh disturbances.</p>
               <p>VIII. Then Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> return'd to the Enemies Camp, to agree
upon a place where they might meet together. One between both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
was chosen, as the best and most secure. All the Generals on both
sides repaired thither, and there formed the Articles of Treaty as was
agreed between them: that is, <hi>That the Town of</hi> Cazal <hi>should be put into
the Duke of</hi> Mantua<hi>'s hands; that the</hi> French <hi>Souldiers should be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out, and</hi> Montferrins, <hi>who were the Duke of</hi> Mantua<hi>'s Subjects, sent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in their room; That the Kings Army should draw off from</hi> Montferrat,
<hi>but yet keep the post where they then were, till such time as they had embarked
all the Enemies Cannon and Baggage upon the</hi> Po; <hi>and that the Cittadel should
be delivered to a</hi> Montferrin <hi>Officer, such as they should name.</hi> The Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
being mutually signed, the Generals parted, after great Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on both sides; and our Army retired about a quarter of a league,
that they might give the Enemies no Jealousie; and encamped there
that night in their Arms for fear of any surprize. The Enemies also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
that night in their Trenches, and decamp'd next day very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that they might pass the River the same day, according to our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement.</p>
               <p>That night there fell such abundance of rain, that the Souldiers Arms
were all spoyled with it, and they wet to the skin. Wherefore next
morning the greatest part dispersed themselves into the Villages all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts
to dry themselves, and left their arms at the Camp in much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.
In the mean while Monsieur <hi>Thoiras</hi> came from the Cittadel to
our Camp, to wait on the Mareschals. Monsieur <hi>Schomberg,</hi> who had no
great kindness for him, said at first meeting, <hi>So, Sir, this is the second
time;</hi> meaning that he had relieved him once before at the Isle of <hi>Rhe,</hi>
when he was besieged in <hi>St. Martin, by Bouquinquan</hi> the <hi>English</hi> General.
Monsieur <hi>Thoiras</hi> return'd him a civil, but cold answer, <hi>Yes, Sir, I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden
to the King's Arms, and to you, Sir.</hi> Afterwards Monsieur <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>
invited him and the two other Mareschals to dinner.</p>
               <p>While they sat at Table in the great Hall, with a great many persons
of quality, where I also was, and saw all that past, immediately the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Generals, <hi>Picolomini</hi> and <hi>Colalto,</hi> had passed through our Camp, and
came into the Hall. Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> being extremely surprized, as
well as the rest of the company, said to them, <hi>Really Gentlemen, I am
much concerned that I had no notice of your coming, for I would have rode to
meet you.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Picolomini,</hi> who was a man of Wit as well as Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
reply'd, <hi>Sir, we did it on purpose; and since we could not surprize
you in War, had a mind to try if we could do it in Peace. But I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that I my self was a little surpriz'd as I came through your Camp: For
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100923:93"/>
whereas I must own, that tho I have commanded several Armies, and in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Countries, I never saw any that lookt better, and more orderly, nor more
eager of sighting, than yours was yesterday when drawn up in Battel, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to attack our Trenches; yet to day I see no body in your Camp, nor any thing
but the Souldiers Arms lying up and down in great confusion and disorder.</hi>
Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> tipping us the wink, to go and get the Souldiers to
their Colours presently, answer'd <hi>Picolomini</hi> with great readiness of wit,
<hi>This need be no surprize to you at all Sir, for I who am a</hi> German <hi>born, when
I came to settle in</hi> France, <hi>and put my self into the King's service, was in
truth at first at a loss, what this humour of the</hi> French <hi>should mean. But when
I had been a Commander some time, and was used to the Genius of the Country,
I presently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound, that the</hi> French <hi>were the briskest Fellows in the world,
when there was occasion for fighting; and the most inclined to ease and divert
themselves, when there was none. One good quality they have is, that as they
quickly lay down their arms, so they quickly stand to them again. And that
you your, self may bear me witness that I say true, I will immediately shew
you an instance of the</hi> French <hi>temper. I will order the Drum to beat through
the Quarters, and dare promise you, that before we have gone through the Camp,
you shall see all the Army in good order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the same time all the Officers that were there w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt out, and getting
on Horseback, rode about to get the Souldiers together. In the mean
while Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> employed all his dexterity, to hold the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Geneaals in discourse, and detain them insensibly. Afterwards he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with them to take a little walk, and amused them a good while
without their suspecting any thing. At last the diligence and address of
the Officers was such, that when <hi>Picolomini</hi> and <hi>Colalto</hi> return'd, they
found the Army in excellent order. The Officers with their Pikes in
their hands, and the Souldiers their Arms made a very graceful appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
which the <hi>Spanish</hi> Generals were so much surpriz'd at, that they
could scarce perswade themselves, this was the same way they came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
fancying it was rather delusion upon their senses, so much was it
beyond any thing they had ever seen, either in <hi>Spain,</hi> or any other part
of <hi>Europe. Picolomini</hi> observing this good order, and the courage of
the men, could not fobear expressing his admiration of it in very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisant
terms, saying to <hi>Schomberg,</hi> That it could not be any dishonour
to be vanquisht by so many brave Souldiers, and such great Commanders.
After this they took leave of one another, and return<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d each to their
own Army.</p>
               <p>IX. But what follow'd was not agreeable to all this civility; and our
Generals ill conduct had like to have lost the whole Army. The Treaty
of Peace was broken in some of the principal Articles; and whereas it
was agreed, that our men should give safe conduct to all the Enemies
Baggage, Cannon and Artillery, as far as the River; the <hi>French</hi> behaved
themselves very unworthily, and in such a manner as all the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
fell to pillaging the Ropes, Bridles, Horse-collars, and the rest
of the Baggage that belonged to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army. And whereas we
had engag'd, as I said before, to draw all the <hi>French</hi> out of the Cittadel,
and put <hi>Montferrins</hi> in their Rooms; they set men on work night and
day to make <hi>Montferrin</hi> Habits, and so many Taylors were employed on
this occasion, that in four and twenty hours time near eight hundred of
these Habits were made, in which they drest up as many <hi>French</hi> Souldiers,
and after having taught them two or three words of the language of the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100923:93"/>
Country, put them into <hi>Cazal,</hi> under pretence of so many <hi>Montferrins</hi>
Thus by means of their Coats with Hanging Sleeves, and the help of these
words, <hi>Seignor se, Seignor la!</hi> they possest themselves of the Castle; and,
which helpt to conceal the cheat yet more, they migled some real <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrins,</hi>
whom they had bribed, among these <hi>French</hi> Souldiers, that so one
part might keep all the rest from being discovered.</p>
               <p>Nay, they went farther still, and fail'd in making good the chief Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of all, which was that concerning the Governour, who was appointed
(as I said) by the common consent of both parties. For, resolving to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
him from this Post, upon pretence that he was a <hi>Spaniard</hi> in his
heart, they chous'd and surpriz'd him as you shall hear. Two days after
the Enemy had past the <hi>Po,</hi> with their Baggage and Ordnance, our
Army divided it self into two bodies. Eight thousand Foot, and some
Squadrons of Horse past the River also, without any Cannon, at <hi>Libourne;</hi>
the remainder of the Foot, and all the Horse that staid behind with the
Cannon, for greater security, march'd along the River side, without
passing it, fearing lest the Enemy should make any attempt upon our
Army, that was on the same side with theirs, and not caring to clog it
with the whole Train of Ordnance, which would have made their retreat
difficult. In the mean time Monsieur <hi>Marillac,</hi> who had resolv'd to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
the new Governour of the Castle, when our Army, except the
Generals and some few Troops, were gone over, contrived to invite the
Governour to Supper. When he was come out of the Castle, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
disguis'd like <hi>Montferrins,</hi> had orders to change the word, and to
deny him entrance at his return from Supper, as not knowing him, and
he not knowing the word. The Governour then after having supp'd
with Monsieur <hi>Marillac,</hi> who shewed him great civility, took his leave full
of satisfaction, to go back to his Castle. But he was astonisht at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
the Centinel gave him at the Gate. For as soon as he heard him
he bid him stand, and ask'd who was there. The Governour, said he.
The word, reply'd the Centinel? The Governour having told him the
word, which himself gave before he went out, the Centinel cry'd out,
Stand where you are, you <hi>French</hi> Traitor, would you seize the Castle?
if you come here I will shoot you. The Governour was in a strange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion;
he heard himself call'd Traitor, and <hi>French-man;</hi> but he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
perceived it was a <hi>French-man</hi> that betray'd him. He bawls and
rages against <hi>France,</hi> calls us treacherous Villains, Knaves, and all that;
but the more he raged, the more the Centinel cryes, that he was a Traitor,
and charged him not to come there. He repairs immediately to our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
who after they had chous'd him with so much civility, answer'd
him as civilly, That they could not be responsible for the treachery of
the <hi>Montferrins,</hi> that he must make his complaint to the Duke his Master,
since it was into his hands that the King had delivered the Town. But
the Governour, who saw through the meaning of this answer, was not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
in the matter, and immediately writ after the <hi>Spanish</hi> Generals,
who were not above two or three leagues off, to acquaint them how the
<hi>French</hi> had kept him out of the Castle.</p>
               <p>X. Mean while our Generals having past the River to joyn their
Army, which waited for them at a Village about a league off, made great
haste, and advanc'd with all their Troops as far as <hi>Libourne.</hi> On the other
side, the Enemy understanding the breach of faith we had been guilty of to
the Governour of <hi>Cazal,</hi> and being enrag'd besides at the plunder of their
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100923:94"/>
Baggage, resolv'd to fall in upon us, when we were weakned by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
of our Troops, and began their march to this purpose. But Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> who performed the part of a Mediator, and had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
this peace, plaid the <hi>Spaniards</hi> a true <hi>Italian</hi> trick, and came riding
full speed to our Camp at <hi>Libourn</hi> about midnight. I happen'd that night
to be upon the Guard on that side of the Camp where he came, and the
Centinel having stopt him, and hearing the name of <hi>Mazarin,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
call'd me to him. I came presently and saw it was Monsieur <hi>Mazarin,</hi>
who with great passion cried out, Ah, Sir, you are all lost, the Enemies
are within a mile, and are coming to fall upon you with their whole Army.
Give orders to sound to arms throughout the whole Camp immediately.
I answered him with some kind of indifference; <hi>Sir, we have no Commission
to sound to arms without the Generals order, his Tent is but just by, and I
will conduct you thither if you think sit.</hi> However I took the advantage of
this Intelligence, and sent to give notice in all the quarters, that they
should be ready; and in the mean time I waited on Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi>
to Mareschal <hi>Schomberg</hi>'s Tent. He threw himself about his neck, and
made him this Complement, <hi>Ah Sir, must I embrace the man now, that I
shall see dead within this hour? How so, Sir,</hi> said Monsieur <hi>Schomberg, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
you have a mind to try if you can fright us.</hi> Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
<hi>I have no design to fright you Sir, but to preserve your life, and the
whole Army; for your Enemies are coming to charge you, and are not above a
mile off.</hi> They were really however two leagues distant, but he had a
mind to alarm us the more, that we might make greater haste. Monsieur
<hi>Schomberg</hi> reply'd with the indifference of a great General, <hi>If we can but
see them when they come, we shall not fear them; but yet it is fit we should take
care to secure our selves as well as we can.</hi> Immediately he ordered to
sound an alarm through the whole Camp; and as many of us Officers as
were there, ran about to carry his orders; so that in a very little time
our Army was ready for the march.</p>
               <p>XI. They call'd a Council of War however, to debate what was fit to
be done, and it was determin'd that our Army not being in a condition
to stand so great a shock, we ought to provide for a retreat. It went
against the grain though to see our selves forc'd to flee from the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard;</hi>
but at last it was judg'd that a Retreat is never dishonourable, when
opposition is manifestly hazardous. Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> commanded the
Van-guard, and the two other Mareschals the Rear. Our whole Army
was drawn up in Battalia, and kept this order during the whole Retreat,
because we had two leagues of wide Champaign to go over. Monsieur
<hi>Marlissy,</hi> Captain of the Guards, commanded the Forlorn-hope, and
under him a Lieutenant and my self commanded those of the Forlorn
that were nearest the Enemy. This Lieutenant and I had a great quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel;
for I would command alone, as being his ancient, and he would
needs command with me in the quality of Lieutenant; telling me besides,
that if I happened to be kill'd, there would no body to command, which
would occasion much disorder, and might expose those first Troops to
great slaughter. Our stiffness in maintaining each his post, flew so high,
that we had like to have come to blows, so blind and so furious is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
even in the most dangerous circumstances. The Generals coming
in to compose this difference, appointed that I should command the
Lieutenant; but that the Lieutenant too should command under me,
which was the regular way, and put an end to the whole dispute.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:100923:94"/>
When we were got a good way in this plain, I spy'd a great way off
four Horse-men making full speed toward us. I sent to acquaint the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
who came to the head of the Forlorn-hope to wait for them; who
when they were come up within a Trumpet, told the Mareschals of
<hi>France,</hi> That the <hi>Spanish</hi> Generals had sent to tell them, that they were
much injured and provoked by our breach of Articles, and that they
were coming with the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army to demand satisfaction. Our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
replyed, That since they thought themselves wrong'd, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to revenge it, they also were ready to do them reason in a fair fight;
That for their parts they were so far from breaking the Agreement, that
they were making it good at that very time, by drawing off from <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi>
as one of the Articles enjoyn'd; that their march was not now a
running away, but that of gallant Souldiers who return'd Conquerors;
that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves had dealt unfaithfully, who not daring
some few days ago, to stand the assault of the <hi>French</hi> Army, were now
attempting to fall upon their Rear, when they were divided; that this
discover'd their Treachery and Cowardice, since it was manifest that
they made the Peace before, only because they thought themselves too
weak; and broke it now, only because they thought themselves too
strong for us. That notwithstanding our unequal number, would
make them know, that few <hi>French</hi> are able to deal with a great many
<hi>Spaniards;</hi> and that Courage, not numbers, made men Conquerors. Thus
they drill'd on these four Horse-men with such blustering words as these,
fitter indeed for a <hi>Spaniard</hi> than a <hi>French-man,</hi> who commonly loves to
talk big of what he has done, more than what he should do.</p>
               <p>All this while our Troops continu'd marching, and made all the speed
that possibly they could, notwithstanding all our General's brave words,
which might amuse those Horse-men, but could not put a stop to our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
that knew it self too feeble. At length, having had enough of our
Generals eloquence, they took leave, and return'd back as fast as they
came. At the same time our Army were order'd to mend their pace;
and the Van-guard being come into dale to a River call'd <hi>Doni-Balta,</hi>
over which there was a Bridge, they past as quick as they could to make
way for the Rear against they should come up. On the other side, the
Rear being at some distance, began, as they came up a little rising ground,
to discover by degrees some five and thirty or forty Squadrons of Horse,
coming on at a great rate. We after saw more and more of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
drawing up to us, who made sure of cutting us in pieces, and lookt
upon us as sacrifices to their revenge; as indeed it was impossible, that
of few as we were should stand out against so many Troops. But they
were mightily disappointed in their expectation, and we gained time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to leave the River I mention'd between us and them. Which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
after a very odd manner, and by a small stratagem that I contriv'd,
and which these great Generals of <hi>Spain</hi> were not able to discover.</p>
               <p>XII. When our Rear was come into the road by which they must go
down into the dale, at the entrance into which there was an old ruinous
house: We taking it for granted that we were lost, and especially those
of us that were the hindmost, and were almost close to the Enemy; I made
some stout Souldiers and a Serjeant leap all on a sudden into this Cottage,
and order'd them, that when the Enemy were about forty or fifty paces
from them, they should discharge upon them, shooting leisurely one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another; which I was in some hopes might a little stop, or it may
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100923:95"/>
be, divert those that pursued us, upon a surprize they might have, that
the danger was greater than in truth it was. This contrivance succeeded
very well: For the Enemy coming on, and our Musqueteers making several
shot successively, as I had directed them, all that part of the Horse
halted immediately; and fearing that there might be among those ruines
a great number of men, that might put a stop to their march, because
they were loath to give our Army time to file off, they never attackt this
supposed Guard, but immediately wheeled away to the left to fall upon
us at another place. But the fetching this compass was a greater hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
to them than they lookt for, and occasioned all our Rear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off safe, who by this means gained time to pass the River, some by
the Bridge, and some at a Mill, where they waded only up to the waste.
The Musqueteers whom I had posted in the old house, seeing the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
Army gone off, came on to joyn our Rear, and only one young
Fellow staid behind, who was loaded with a Sheep that he had caught
up. Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> made him come over too with the rest, and
telling me in raillery, that we had not left so much as a Sheep behind
us, embrac'd me very kindly for the good service I had done the Army.
He went over the last of them all, followed by me only, and immediately
we broke up the Bridge after us. The Enemies came up almost the minute
we got over, and shewed themselves on the other side of the River. But
finding this bar betwixt us, and not being able to come to blows, they
reveng'd themselves upon us with reproaches and hard words. They
made one furious discharge however, which made a terrible noise in the
Vale, but did little exe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ution, there not being above five and twenty or
thirty of our men killed and wounded, for a monument of so noble and
honourable a retreat.</p>
               <p>Our Army then marched on toward <hi>Fouijs,</hi> having left a strong guard
upon the River to hinder the Enemies crossing it, which they attempted
to do that very night, but were so briskly repulsed both by the Guard,
and a Relief sent to them from our Army, which as yet was got but a
little way off, that they were forced to give over their design, and return
shamefully to the place from whence they had posted so fast. Our men
also came up again to joyn the body of the Army, which went into Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
at <hi>Fouijs</hi> and the Towns thereabouts.</p>
               <p>'Twas in the Castle of this Town, which belongs to three Counts of
that Countey, that Mareschal <hi>Marillac</hi> was arrested some days after by a
strange turn of fortune, or to speak more like a Christian, by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, which should make those men tremble, who look upon
their fortune as fixt and sure. There are in this Castle three or four
pretty Bed-chambers, in each of which each Mareschal of <hi>France</hi> took
up his Lodging</p>

Queen Mother, <hi>Marillac</hi> Keeper of the Seals, and some other Lords, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
to <hi>Paris,</hi> and there by private intrigues form'd a very strong party
against Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> to remove him from Court. It would require a long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
to unravel this great mystery, and relate all the particulars of it, which indeed
were a subject for a large History. I need only tell you then in short, that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
enemies prevailed so far with the King, as to forbid him the Court. The
Keeper of the Seals dispatch a Courier instantly, to his brother the Mareschal <hi>de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillac,</hi>
to inform him of this disgrace, of the man whom they lookt upon as an Enemy
to them in particular, as well as to the whole Kingdom in general.</p>
               <p>This news gave mighty satisfaction to the Mareschal, and fill'd him full of great
expectations. He publickly declared his joy to the two other Mareschals of <hi>France,</hi>
his joynt Brothers in Commission; one of whom, Monsieur <hi>Schomberg,</hi> who was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
dear to the Cardinal, was very melancholy, that he had received no Letters
himself, and suspected that his fortune too might be tottering, by the fall of his old
great Patron. I was that very day upon the Guard in <hi>Fouijs</hi> Castle, where I told you
our Generals had taken up their Quarters; and continuing upon duty the next day
too, and the night after that, was an Eye-witness of all that passed upon this occasion.
Monsieur <hi>Schomberg,</hi> thinking of nothing but his own dissavour, which he judg'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable
from that of the Cardinal, would not sup that day. And the Mareschal <hi>de
Marillac</hi> for his part, fancying now that he should be the greatest man in <hi>France,</hi> fill'd
his imagination with vast preferments, which he promis'd himself shortly, and had
in some measure tasted of already. But we shall see in the person of this Lord, one of
the terriblest instances imaginable, how unstable all humane affairs are, and how
empty the projects of the wise men of this world.</p>
               <p>II. Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who was lookt upon as one perfectly subdu'd by the party
that hated him, and past all hopes of rising any more, deceiv'd all his Enemies in an
instant, and by one of the strangest turns of policy that ever was known, trod all those
under foot that insulted over him. He turn'd all the effect of their malice upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and took advantage of the easiness of that very Prince whom they had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to ruine him, to get the better of them again. His Friend, the Cardinal <hi>de la
Vallette</hi> being acquainted with his disgrace advised him to take courage, and not let
matters go off so. He perswaded him to go wait upon the King once more, and make
another tryal how far he could prevail upon him; he argued with him, that Kings
being the images of God, did in this resemble their divine original, that they loved
men should importunately address to them, and that nothing but perseverance could
carry the point. Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> followed this politick advice of his friend, and
couragiously went to the King: and making use of all his cunning upon this occasion,
and arming himself with all his resolution, to do violence as it were to his Prince, he
accosted him to this effect. <hi>I am come, Sir,</hi> (said he) <hi>to make an offer of my head to
your Majesty, that you may dispose of my person as you think good, if I do not prove by undeniable
arguments, nay, by Papers of unquestionable authority, that the Mareschal</hi> de Marillac, <hi>and

                     </gap>signs against your person. That the only reason
why they are Enemies to me, is because they are so to you, Sir; That they load me with false
accusations, me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rly because I support the interest of your Majesty, against their wicked attempts;
and that my quarrel is not that of a single or private person, but such as all the State is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in. They know very well, Sir, that I see through all their disguises, and that I make
use of your Royal Authority to disappoint their treasonable projects, and therefore would fain take
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> from about your Person and Court, and drive me out of your Kingdom, that they may more
securety abuse your goodness, while you take them for faithful Servants, but while they are in
truth hatching nothing but Treason and Falshood. If your Majesty will give me leave to inform
you, what I can do of my own certain knowledge, you will scarcely believe, what really I could very
hardly have believed my self, and yet all but too true. You will see that my Enemies are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
contriving to depose you, and that their Cabals strike at nothing less than the securing
your Royal Person; that so when they have shut you up in a Monastery, (instances whereof we
may find in our History) they may get the Government into their own hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. These and many other such expressions deliver'd with an air of assurance, and
by a person who had gained an absolute mastery of the King's breast, perswaded so
strongly, or rather indeed confounded this Prince to so great a degree, who (as all
the world knows) was naturally of a very jealous distrustful temper, that he gave
the Cardinal leave to cause the Mareschal <hi>de Marillac,</hi> and his Brother the Keeper
to be apprehended. The latter was imprison'd immediately; and a Courier presently
dispatch'd to the Mareschal <hi>de Scbomberg,</hi> with orders from the King to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ecure the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal <hi>de Marillac.</hi>
This Courier used such wonderful expedition, that tho he came
out two days after the former, which brought the news of Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
yet he reacht the Camp the next day after him. Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> at the
reading the order from the King, was infinitely surpriz'd, to see the whole face of
affairs at Court so prodigiously chang'd, and in so short a time. He was well pleased
to find his own hopes and fortunes so quickly settled again, but much concern'd to
see this done by the ruine of his friend, the Mareschal de <hi>Marillac.</hi> He acquainted
the Mareschal <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> la Force</hi> with the command sent him from the King; and calling me
to him, he bad me go fetch Monsieur <hi>de Montigny,</hi> the first Captain, and all the other
Officers of the Regiment of Guards, to draw up my Company in the Castle-Court,
and then to take up the Draw-bridge. I perform'd what he had given me in charge
without delay; all the Officers came into the Castle, my Company, which kept
guard, into the Court; and the Bridges were all drawn up. All this preparation
might have given the Mareschal <hi>de Marillac</hi> some jealously, had not this been muster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day;
and he himself declared his opinion the day before, that all the Officers should
be shut up in the Castle to prevent the foisting in of false Musters, so that he had not
the least suspicion of any thing at all.</p>
               <p>We came all together into the Mareschal <hi>de Schomberg</hi>'s Chamber, and Monsieur
<hi>Marillac</hi> with us at the same time, who only congratulated him upon the receiving
a Courier, and desir'd he would shew him his Letters, that he would go to Dinner,
and when that was over, come again to see the news. Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> desir'd
him not to give himself that trouble, and assur'd him he would come himself to his
Apartment, and communicate his Letters to him, and then waited on him half way
to his Lodgings. The Mareschal <hi>de Marillac</hi> seeing my Company below in the
Court, said to Mareschal <hi>Schomberg,</hi> without suspecting any thing, I see you have
taken care to prevent false Musters, it is very well done indeed. So he went to Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
for Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> would not have him apprehended then, because he had
no opportunity of imparting his order to the Officers. He came back therefore into
his Chamber with us all, and after having observ'd, whether there might not be some
body by, who was a particular Confident of Mr. <hi>Marillac</hi>'s, he shut the door, and
spake to us after this manner. <hi>Gentlemen, the King hath done you the honour to intrust you
with the Glory and the Security of his Arms, and now he intrusts you with the Safety of his
person and Kingdom. I am sensible the Order I have received from his Majesty will be a great
surprize to you all, but it is no part of our business to pry too curiously into the secrets of a Prince's
pleasure; all that we have to do is to respect his Commands, and to execute his Orders. The
King hath commanded me to secure Monsieur</hi> Marillac<hi>'s person. It is enough that I let you know
what he would have done, and I know you are too loyal not to obey him, especially in a matter of
this consequence.</hi> Afterwards that the business might not be suspected, and be the more
effectually done, he bad us make some complaints at the going down from his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
as if he always kept back our Musters, and refus'd to pay us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:100923:96"/>
It's impossible for me to express the amazement and concern I was in at this bad
news. For Monsieur <hi>Marillac</hi> being a person whom I lov'd and honour'd very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
and one who, I may take upon me to say, did me the honour to have a
kindness for me; my very heart was ready to burst when I heard this order for appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
a person for whom I had infinite respect, and saw that my duty made it
necessary for me to have any hand in his ruine. But there was no remedy, I must
contain my self, and yield to the powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s above me, my post obliging me to obey the
King's comand. We <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent down then all together out of the Mareschal <hi>de Schomberg</hi>'s
Lodgings, every one complaining loudly, that it was a miserable case to have a man
of that temper to deal with, that continually promis'd us pay, and we never could get
any thing but words; That kept men in a distant Country, and would not suffer them
to come near their King; that after all, there was nothing like being about one's
own Master. These complaints they made, and several such like, which he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
them to disguise the same business withal.</p>
               <p>IV. When the Mareschal <hi>de Marillac</hi> had din'd, Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> and <hi>la Force</hi>
went with us all to his Chamber, and he coming to meet us, with a very pleasant
and gay countenance, askt what news from Court? but alas! he heard very bad
news for him, when Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> presenting him the Kings Letters that
contained the order for apprehending him, desired he would give himself the trouble
of reading those Letters. One may easily imagine what an operation so strange and
sudden a turn of Fortune would have upon a mans mind; but for all that, it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to represent the violence of his passion, which indeed put him quite beside him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
when he read the crimes falsely laid to his charge, and upon which he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to be secured. For then forgetting himself utterly, and not knowing where
he was, he lost all fear and respect, and fell to railing against the Cardinal in a most
furious manner, saying aloud, tho without naming him, That he that told the King
those things, was Rascal, a Traytor, and a Perjur'd Villain.</p>
               <p>The Mareschal <hi>de la Force</hi> seeing him so enraged, and thinking this passion might
turn to his prejudice, if the Cardinal should come to know it, endeavoured to soften
him, telling him very wifely, <hi>Come Sir, matters are not desperate yet: You know I my self
had once the misfortune to be in Arms against my Prince, and yet he was so gracious to pardon me,
and since that to trust me with the Command of his Armies. If you are innocent, your Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
will by this means be render'd more conspicuous, and honourable; and if you be guilty, your
Offence cannot be greater than the Clemency of the King, and his disposition to forgive, if you do
but throw your self at his Majesty's feet, and implore his Mercy, as I did.</hi> But nothing was
able to stop the transports of his just indignation. And tho I cannot approve the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of his passion, yet at the same time I must needs own, that if it were allowable
upon any occasion, to repel a false accusation with violence, this was such a case;
when a man of Mareschal <hi>Marillac</hi>'s quality and honour, who had always preserv'd
an untainted Loyalty to his Prince, saw himself maliciously charged with attempts
upon his Liberty, his Crown, and his Life. And these accusations, of which he
knew himself perfectly innocent, put him quite past his senses, and carry'd him to
speak without any consideration or regard to persons, whose interest and power at
least he ought to have stood in fear of.</p>
               <p>Mareschal <hi>Schomberg</hi> seeing that there was no bringing him to any temper, and not
being able to see him any longer in that excess of trouble and despair, was about to
withdraw, and took his leave, telling him, that he could not put a better guard about
his person, than that the King honoured with the securing of his own. But in regard
he had his Sword on still, Monsieur <hi>de Montigny</hi> told Monsieur <hi>Schomberg,</hi> that it was
necessary he should be desired to take it off, and so put himself into the condition of
a Prisoner: Then Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> whisper'd him in his ear, that since the Kings
order must be submitted to, it were well if he would of his own accord step into a
Wardrobe just by, and lay aside his Sword; which he did immediately. But if he
had had his wits about him, he might easily have made his escape out of a Window
in that Room, under which there was a load of Hay, and he need not have leap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
down above six or seven foot at most. But he was so full of trouble, and so utterly
past all sense, that he thought of nothing but the injustice they had done, without
ever considering how to save himself from it. I being, as I said, upon the Guard at
that time, guarded him the remaining part of that day, and all the night following.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:100923:97"/>
V. The Marquis of <hi>Autichy,</hi> who was his relation, having obtain'd leave to come
speak with him, after some discourse, the Mareschal desired him to go write to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
persons, but not seal his Letters for fear of giving any suspicion. In the mean
while he pray'd me to go ask Mareschal <hi>Schomberg,</hi> whether he would please to inclose
in his Pacquet a Letter, which he was desirous to write to the King. Monsieur <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>
after having consider'd of it a little while, answer'd, That he would do it with all
his heart, but in regard the Courier belonged to the Cardinal, he durst not engage it
would come to the King's hand. He said to me afterwards, speaking of Monsieur
<hi>Marillac, I thought him passionate I confess before, but could never have imagined it to this
degree. How poor a thing is man when left to himself! His Judgment always fails him when
he stands most in need of it.</hi> But without question any other man in his circumstances
would have felt what a shock so heavy and to unexpected a blow as this of Monsieur
<hi>Marillac</hi>'s can give to the most resolute man in the world. 'Tis a much easier matter
to find saults with those lamentations and complaints, which excess of grief forces
from the mouth of others, than to bear up with patience and temper under ones own.
But yet this great man, 'tis true, was guilty of a great fault upon this occasion, and
did by no means behave himself to his own advantage. For the very Courier hearing
part of what he spoke with too much heat against the Cardinal, no question but he
helpt to make matters worse with his Eminence, who to be sure was very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
inform'd of all these things.</p>
               <p>Well, I went to return Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi>'s answer, about the Letter Monsieur
<hi>Marillac</hi> desir'd to write to the King, and he composed a very handsom, and very
eloquent one four pages long; for Grief always expresses it self well. In this
Letter he told the King, That his Enemies made it their business to ruine him upon
the account of the good service he had done his Majesty, which therefore made them
hate him: That it is the very character of Envy, to fall upon the most commendable
actions of them that it looks upon with an evil eye; That it endeavours to find evil
in good, darkness in light, and turns vertue into vice; That it inspires those that are
acted by it, to accuse and murder the innocent with a greater degree of confidence,
than these innocent persons themselves can attain to for their own vindication; but
that he hoped, the King's wisdom and justice would not suffer him to be prepossest
by the malice of his Enemies; and that on the contrary, he would please to take a
true estimate of him and his Loyalty, and judge how inviolably he was devoted to
his service, from the publick testimonies he had given of it all along, and not by the
false prejudices of his Slanderers and Accusers: That therefore he cast himself
wholly into the arms of his mercy, who had always been a Protector of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
That, for his part, he could not believe that his Majesty, after having done
him the honour of a most gracious Letter but the day before, should so very quickly
change his opinion of him to that in degree; that in this he plainly discerned the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Enemies, who betrayed themselves, and began already to usurp his Royal
Authority, at the very instant that they accused him of attempts against it. Several
other passages there were, which I cannot now recollect, and after having given it me
to read, as to one whom he was pleased to honour with his particular favour, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
I would carry it to Monsieur <hi>Schomberg,</hi> that he might peruse it too. Monsieur
<hi>Schomberg</hi> when he had read it, gave it me again to carry back to Monsieur <hi>Marillac,</hi>
and to beg that he would make it short, for fear that the King seeing so much of it
should not trouble himself to read it. Monsieur <hi>Marillac</hi> according to his advice short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it, and then sent it him again. But Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> in civility would not read it,
saying, That he was satisfied Monsieur <hi>Marillac</hi> had said nothing, but what was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the respect due to the King: which pleased him very much, and put him upon
extolling Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> for this great civility to him.</p>
               <p>VI. All night long he never once shut his eyes, and did nothing but walk about,
cry out, bewail himself, write Letters, and then rear them to pieces again; so violent
was the disorder of his mind. He reflected perpetually upon the horrid malice of his
Enemies, and could scarce perswade himself, that there was, either any Wretches so
vile as to put about such calumnies against an innocent person, or any Princes so cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
and easy, as to be possest with them. Sometimes he did not know where to
lay the fault, and after many reflections upon the respect he owed the King, the
Cardinal's pique against him, and his own innocence, he lookt up at last to the Divine
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100923:97"/>
Providence, as the supreme Disposer of all humane events, and humbly besought
the Justice and Mercy of God. In short, I cannot express how many, how various,
how violent motions, even to a degree of Convulsions appeared in his body and
mind both, that fatal night next after his disgrace. Then he felt plainly, that his
Greatness weighed him down, that his Eminent Post only served to increase his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
and make it more remarkable; and in short, that his innocence had never
been accused, if his condition had not made him a mark for Envy.</p>
               <p>I confess the seeing a person, for whom I had an exceeding great respect, and had
the honour to be beloved by him, in these deplorable circumstances, rent my very
heart to pieces that night, when I was present at all he said and did upon this occasion.
And, committing great violence upon my self to contain, and not daring in point of
prudence to give any vent of that which opprest me within, I found my passion grow
upon me the more, the more I strove to stifle it. Then sure I had time enough to
make many reflections, and to see clearly by several instances, how little the best and
most fixed fortunes in this world are to be depended upon. A Cardinal in di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>grace
one day, and in favour again the next, and the hopes of all his Enemies defeated and
overturn'd in an instant, were subjects large enough to furnish me with arguments, to
pall my appetite of favour at Court. But the time for effecting this was not yet come, and
indeed it very seldom happens, that what we see come upon other people is apply'd
home to our own selves. The mind observes the accident, and considers it after a specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
kind of way, and then stops there, and seldom goes any farther. I could dwell
for ever on this subject, which yet I cannot to this day so much as once think upon
wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hout great concern. All that I need add more of it here is, that this great Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
two or three days after he was apprehended, was carry'd almost as far as <hi>Turin,</hi>
and that from thence he was sent under a Guard of five hundred Horse to <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VII. It was now about the end of the year 1630, and an Indictment being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
against him, by the King's, or rather by Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s order, they set up at
<hi>Ruel</hi> a Chamber of Commissioners chosen out of several Parliaments for this purpose.
But the Tryal was not brought to an issue till 1632. I shall not take upon me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
here the particulars of what past in this important affair. The publick News,
and Memoirs, that are in every bodies hanos, tell us, that if the opinion of some of
his Judges, who till then never were thought incompetent ones, had prevailed, the
conclusion of this affair had been as much for his honour, as at last it prov'd fatal; and
his Enemies would have had reason to be asham'd for the assault they had made upon
his Innocence. But God in his Justice, which Monsieur <hi>Marillac</hi> himself found rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to adore, permitted him to be over-power'd by the majority of his other Judges.</p>
               <p>Near the end of his Tryal, about a fortnight or three weeks before his Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when he was guarded at <hi>Ruel,</hi> by Monsieur <hi>des Reaux,</hi> Lieutenant of the <hi>Guards
du Corps,</hi> whom he had no affection for, the King order'd me to go and guard him. I
had much ado to bring my self to comply with this, dreading what might come on't,
because I knew the Cardinal hated me, and that he knew I had a particular esteem
for Monsieur <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>illac.</hi> For being to deal with so vigilant and so formidable an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
I knew very well, that if I fail'd in the least punctilio of my duty, he would be
sure to take all advantages to ruine me. I resolved therefore to do all that ever I could
for declining this Commission, and earnestly entreated his Majesty, that I might not
be removed from about his person, to take the charge of guarding a Mareschal of
<hi>France,</hi> who had often commanded me in the Army. I added moreover, that all the
world was sensible he had some kindness for me, and therefore my Enemies would
be sure to keep a strict eye upon me, and I should be exposed to all the mischief their
malice could do me. <hi>Why, what are you afraid of,</hi> said the King <hi>is it not I that send you? Do
you suspect your self, that you shall not be true to me?</hi> I answer'd, That I had rather dye a
thousand deaths than be false to my duty; that this was no part of my fear, but that I
was afraid of what his Majesty knew better than my self I had good grounds to fear;
and at the same time I threw my self at his Majesty's feet. The King reply'd mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and with a great deal of goodness, <hi>Go, go your way man, and be obedient; be true to
me, and fear nothing.</hi> So I was forc'd to go.</p>
               <p>The Mareschal <hi>de Marillac</hi> profest himself much comforted to see me, and to be
under the custody of a man he lov'd. I found him full of all the confidence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
that a good Conscience uses to inspire men with. He would often say to
me, <hi>What can they convict me of, except having been a most faithful servant to the King? Let
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100923:98"/>
them but do me Justice, and I am sure they cannot hurt me.</hi> He drew up all his Writings
himself, and was so assured of his own Innocence, that he thought it absolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
they should condemn him to death. I declin'd discou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng with him alone
as much as I could, that I might give no suspicion of any private correspondence with
him. In the mean while, the Commissioners sent for him before them several times,
to examine him upon se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eral Articles exhibited against him. One day as I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting him into their Chamber, he leaned upon my arm, and with a smiling counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
said to me, <hi>Look you Sir, all that I can accuse my self of, is not fault enough to whip a
Page for.</hi> But he was much astonisht, when coming into the Chamber, and finding
how his Judges stood inclined, (who made what his Enemy had a mind to have done
the measure of their proceedings) he saw that he was to expect nothing better than a
Scaffold. From that minute he was so alter'd, that one could scarce know him when
he came out of the Chamber. Death was plainly to be seen in his face and eyes: His
mind was full of nothing but this horrid Injustice that triumph'd over Innocence; and
his body grew so weak from that instant, that he could scarce stand. He lean'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, and cry'd aloud, but alas! in a voice very distant from that at his going in,
<hi>Ah! where is the God of truth, that knows my innocence! Lord, where is thy Providence, and
thy Justice! make haste my God to help me.</hi> Nothing can be imagin'd more moving, and
any one may judge, whether I was not melted with it. But I was oblig'd to put a
good face upon the matter, and stifle that grief within me, with which I was ready to
burst<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>I had used to go and acquaint the King from time to time of all that past, and when
I saw the Mareschal sentenc'd to death, I took occasion to beseech his Majesty, that
he would please to discharge me from guarding him any longer, for that I could not
bring my self to conduct a person to Execution, for whom I could most willingly have
laid down my own life. The King very graciously condescended to my request: So
that I shall say little of his death, the particulars whereof have been carefully collected
and publish'd. I only add, that notwithstanding all the heat and passion of his temper,
and all the confidence he had from the knowledge of his own innocence, yet at last
he submitted with an entire resignation to the Divine Justice, which knows how to
use the injustice of men, when he sees fit, and make that an instrument of bringing
about his own decrees. And then being sensible, with all due humility, that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended this publick death for a mercy to him, thereby to chastise his secret faults; in
this sense he suffer'd this last punishment, and all the shame that attended it, having
his Head struck off in the common place of Execution, and amidst a vast throng of
People. Nay not only that, but he endur'd the barbarous insults of his Enemies too,
whose malice seem'd scarce satisfied with his death. For, which is very odd, when
Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> was told of the Mareschal's Condemnation, he could not be of
opinion, that the matter ought to have gone so far neither; but it was likely the
Judges saw further into the case than other people. Thus after having used his u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>most
endeavours to destroy the man he hated, he would appear to justify himself, by cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Judges all the odium of a Sentence, which every one knew was owing
to him alone. And that which must needs seem the greatest, and most intolerable
hardship to the Mareschal <hi>de Marillac,</hi> is, that the Cardinal's speaking of his death with
all that coldness and indifferency, after having been so eager and warm, both in wishing
and procuring it, could not be supposed to come from any thing but a secret bitterness
and spight, that made him insult over the barbarous end of an innocent person;
whose blood deserved the tears of all good and wise men, much better than the keen
jest of an Enemy.</p>
               <p>VIII. I shall not now insist on any thing that happened to his Brother Monsieur
<hi>Marillac,</hi> Keeper of the Seals, who dyed in Prison upon the same account; nor to the
Queen Mother, that illustrious Princess, whose banishment and death gave her yet
more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ustre than her life. All these were so many Victims devoted to the humours
and petts of that great Minister of State, who found, that the only method to secure
his own high station, was to ruine all that stood in his way, and that were entirely
fixt in the service and true interest of their King.</p>
               <p>IX. I proceed now to what concerns another of his Victims, whose person was in
deed more eminent than Monsieur <hi>Marillac,</hi> and his death every whit as tragical, tho
the cause in which he suffer'd, deserved it more. The great Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> I
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100923:98"/>
mean, who, not being able to endure the Tyranny of that arbitrary man, that had
got both the soul and person of the King absolutely in his power, combined with the
Duke of <hi>Orieans</hi> to rescue <hi>France,</hi> all the Grandees, and even the King himself from
the oppression under which they all groaned. The design was highly commendable,
if the methods of compassing it had but been as innocent. For knowing, that he
could have no sufficient ground to take up arms against his Prince, he thought himself
safe enough by engaging the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the King's only Brother, and that backt
by him he might rise, not so much against the King, as against the man that
abus'd the King's Authority, to lower all the great Lords, and make Princes truckle
under him. In this he was not so wise as he ought to have been, for reason and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
both would have told him, that he should first have considered how unsafe it is
to have any great dependance on the obligations of Princes, who are engag'd the
more easily, because afterwards they can easily leave them in the lurch that engag'd
them, and are sure by the greatness of their quality to secure themselves from punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at last.</p>
               <p>X. Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> being at that time with an Army in <hi>Languedec,</hi> to oppose
the designs of <hi>Monsieur,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Montmorency;</hi> Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> and my
self were ordered to go joyn him there with some Companies of Guards. When we
were come up, the whole Army, which was not above six or seven thousand strong,
marched to <hi>Castelnau-d' Arry,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Auragais,</hi> that held out for the King.
Monsieur's and the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s Forces, consisting of thirteen thousand
men, came up within three leagues of us. But between the two Armies there were
great Waters and Bogs, which were a great security to us, and made us amends for
the disadvantage of unequal numbers. About a quarter of a league from thence there
stood among some Vineyards an empty house, very convenient to put a Guard into,
because the situation of it being high, all the Enemies motions might be discovered
from it. For this reason Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> sent a Serjeant and some Souldiers thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but yet with orders to quit it again, if they should find themselves prest by the
Enemy. The Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> likewise, who with five hundred men advanc'd to
make his observation of the posture and condition of our Army, perceiving this
house, thought there might possibly be some Guard there. He went therefore imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately up to it and charg'd them, and with great ease beat them from that Post,
where he placed a strong Guard of his own afterwards, of a hundred and fifty men.</p>
               <p>Our Army never stirr'd all this while, Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> resolving to stay till he
was attackt, in regard he was so much weaker, and had the Town of <hi>Castelnau d' Arry</hi>
to secure his retreat upon occasion. The Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> return'd mighty brisk
to Monsieur, and said to him, <hi>Oh, sir, The day is now come, that will make you Master
of your Enemies, and bring the Son and the Mother together again</hi> (meaning the King and
the Queen Mother) <hi>but</hi> (says he, drawing his Sword) <hi>we must dye this up to the hilts in
blood.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> fearing what the event of an engagement might be, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
him a very cold answer, <hi>Ho, Monsieur</hi> Montmorency, <hi>you will never leave your
blustering. You have promis'd me mighty conquests a long time, but still I see nothing but hopes.
I would have you know, that I for my part can make my peace, and retreat whenever I please,
and make a third man.</hi> Upon this some hot words arose on both sides, and the Duke
of <hi>Montmorency</hi> withdrawing to a corner of the Room, to the Counts of <hi>Moret,</hi> and
<hi>Rieux,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>d' Aiguebonne,</hi> (one of my particular friends who related all this to
me) said to the two former, <hi>Our young Spark</hi> (meaning the Duke of <hi>Orleans) is turn'd
Coward he talks of securing himself, and making a third man; but neither you Monsieur</hi> de Moret,
<hi>nor you Monsieur</hi> deRieux, <hi>nor I will shew him the way; and we must engage him so far now, that
he shall be forc'd to fight to day, whether he will or no.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time Monsieur <hi>de Montmorency</hi> put himself in a readiness to come up to
us, and Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> put his Army into line of Battel before <hi>Castelnau d' Arry,</hi>
into which place he designed to retreat if he were prest to it; a Gentleman of that
Country, about seventy years of age, came and told him, that if he would trust him
with five hundred Musqueteers, and two or three hundred Horse, he would secure
the day to him; and engage to make him master of the Enemies Army, by laying
an Ambuscade, which they could not possibly avoid, at a Bridge, by which they must
of necessity come, to attack the Kings Army. Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> very gladly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Gentlemans advice, and seeing that he could not well decline following it,
since not above eight or nine hundred were hazarded for a whole Army, he ordered
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100923:99"/>
Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil,</hi> and some Officers besides, and my self, to go along with the
Gentleman, and take five hundred Musqueteers of the Guards, we had brought into
the Army, and gave us besides three hundred Horse. The place prov'd very fit for
an Ambuscade, for there were several bogs, and hollow ways and ditches, by which
the Monsieur's Army must needs come to gain the Bridge. We set the Musqueteers in
these hollow places, where they could not be discovered, and the Horse a little higher,
for they had orders to make the onset, and to draw the Enemies into the Ambush
among the Foot; who were so placed, that they could easily make five hundred shot
in a very little time.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> having prevail'd with Monsieur to come up with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
notwithstanding the ruffle that had been betwixt them, marched at the head of
the Van-guard, and after him the Counts <hi>Moret</hi> and <hi>Rieux.</hi> Monsieur's post was
the main body, and there was no Rear-guard, but a party of Reserve. Monsieur
<hi>Montmorency</hi> commanding the Van in chief, came first into the way where the Ambus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade
lay, and being attackt by our Horse, repuls'd them very briskly, and in some
measure defeated them. But as he was pushing on his advantage a little too warmly,
he and the Van-guard fell together into our Ambuscade, who made in an instant so
violent a shot, that perhaps there never was a greater slaughter in so small a time.
The Counts of <hi>Moret, Rieux,</hi> and <hi>la Feuillade</hi> were killed in it. The Duke of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency</hi>
himself, after having done all that a great General could pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ibly do upon such
an occasion, and even forc'd several ranks of our men, was at last beaten down under
his Horse; and the news spreading immediately, that he and all his party were slain,
Monsieur threw down his Arms, and said the sport was too hot for him. So he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to sound a Retreat immediately.</p>
               <p>Mean while one <hi>St. Mary,</hi> a Serjeant in the Guards, came and told me, that he
thought he saw Monsieur <hi>Montmorency</hi> lying under his Horse. But I, who had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
honour and esteem for this Duke, upon the account of his great worth, was
much concern'd at his misfortune, and would not go my self to make him my Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner.
I went then and told Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> of it, being very well satisfy'd to
leave the honour of this to him. He did not care for going alone neither, but urg'd
me so earnestly, that I yielded at last to go with him. We went then with some
Souldiers and the Sergeant, to the place where he had seen him lye. Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> perceiving him in this lamentable condition, cry'd, <hi>Ah Master!</hi> for so he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
used to call him. The Duke, who had formerly had a quarrel with <hi>St. Preuil,</hi>
and had no kindness for him, thought he was very glad of an occasion to disoblige
him, and to take his revenge upon one that he thought his Enemy: And in this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
cry'd out in a great passion, <hi>Come not near me, I have life enough left to kill
thee still.</hi> Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil,</hi> who was very far from having any malicious intentions
toward him, and indeed was much affected to see matters thus with him; protested
to him, that he came thither with no other design than to do him service; and that
he would rather dye a thousand deaths, than do any thing unbecoming the respect
due to his person. The Duke, a little better satisfied, and seeing me with Monsieur
<hi>St. Preuil,</hi> told us he was engaged to us, and thought himself happy in falling into
such hands as ours, who had such kindness for him. Then we came nearer to help
him, and had very much ado to get him out of the Ditch, where his Thigh was set
fast under his Horse, which was dead, and lay very heavy upon him. It was really a
very sad sight, to see him all over blood, and almost strangled with that that came
out of his mouth, for he was much hurt. At last I got him in my Arms, and laid
him in a Cloak, which I made four Souldiers carry, at each corner one. We met
Monsieur <hi>Brezay</hi> by the way, whom as soon as the Duke perceived, (as indeed he
was afraid of every thing, and had not the perfect use of his reason) he was concern'd
to see him, because he was his particular Enemy. He begg'd of Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi>
to bring a Confessor to him, that he might dye like a Christian at least: But Monsieur
<hi>St. Preuil</hi> encourag'd him afresh, and engag'd to him that no wrong should be done
him, while he was under his Custody. We brought him after this to Monsieur
<hi>Schomberg,</hi> who exprest great resentments of tenderness and compassion, and that he
was extremely concern'd at his misfortune, and could have wisht, rather to have lost
his own blood, than to see him in this miserable condition: For in truth all the
world lov'd and honour'd this excellent man. He desir'd Monsieur <hi>Schomberg</hi> to let him
have a Confessor, fearing he should dye every minute without Confession. But the
Mareschal bad him fear nothing, for he would send his own Chyrurgion, or any
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100923:99"/>
other he should make choice of, to dress his wounds, and shortly after he was carry'd
to <hi>Letoure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XI. The King had commanded me, if any action happen'd, to come and bring
him the news; so I went with all the expedition I could, and of three Couriers that
were dispatcht at the same time, I got first to <hi>Pezenas,</hi> where his Majesty then was.
Being come into the Hall, where the King, the Cardinals, and several great Lords of
the Court were, I directed my self, not to the Cardinal, as others frequently did,
but to the King; and acquainted him, that we had engaged, and his Army had got
the day. The King at this news was seized with such fear that Monsieur might be
kill'd, that he grew very pale and disordered, and cry'd out in great confusion, <hi>What!
and is my Brother dead then?</hi> I reviv'd him presently, by telling him, No, he was not,
but very well. Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> was so surprized with this sudden exclamation
and the tenderness his Majesty had exprest for his Brother, that he could not forbear
saying to some persons that stood by; <hi>Ay, he makes War upon his Brother to fine purpose;
you see Nature discovers herself, and commits violence upon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then I inform'd the King particularly of the several passages in the action, and the
taking of Monsieur <hi>Montmorency;</hi> and while I was telling my story, the other Couri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
arrived, and these addressing themselves to the Cardinal, and not to the King,
told him the same that I had just before told his Majesty.</p>
               <p>XII. Some time after this the whole Court remov'd to <hi>Tholouse;</hi> and now the War
was ended, I being desirous to take this opportunity of going for a little while to
<hi>Pontis,</hi> where I had a great deal of business, asked leave of the King, but he would
not give it me, and commanded me to wait on him to <hi>Tholouse.</hi> This design was, to
employ me in conducting Monsieur <hi>Montmorency</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> where in the right of a
Peer of <hi>France,</hi> he ought to be try'd by a Parliament of Peers, which is that of <hi>Paris.</hi>
But Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who lookt on him as his peculiar Enemy, had no mind to such
tedious methods; and fearing that the Quality, the great Alliances, and the Worth
of the man he hated, might by gaining of time incline the King to mercy, he went a
shorter way to work, and waving the stated forms of Tryal for Peers of <hi>France,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
the King to appoint the Duke's Process before the Parliament of <hi>Tholouse.</hi>
Besides, it was some satisfaction to him, to have him try'd in the midst of his own
Government, and before the face of a Country, that honour'd him exceedingly.</p>
               <p>Then the King commanded me to go to my Company, which was some leagues off,
and which I had left, to attend his Majesty's person, under the command of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
only, when Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> and I were ordered with five hundred Musquets
into <hi>Languedoc.</hi> His Majesty directed me to be the next day at <hi>Narbonne,</hi> whither him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
intended to come, in his way to <hi>Tholouse.</hi> There had been heard for some days
before, terrible noises, like the roaring of Bulls, upon the Sea; which to me seemed
to foretell some great raging storm: And thus we quickly found it: For as I and my
Servant were upon the Road, we heard of a sudden a loud clap of Thunder, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with mighty Lightnings, and immediately upon it fell a fearful shower, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
for four hours with such violence, as if Heaven and Earth would come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I had a Bridge to pass, over a small Brook, and rid full speed to get over be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Waters rose, but they were so high in a very little time, and there ran so
strong a stream over the Bridge just at my going over, that it took my Horse up to
the Belly, and had like to have carry'd him away. My Servant, who came after,
was in more danger than I. We had like to have been drowned a hundred times,
our Horses being forced to swim in many places, and the Roads being all like Rivers.
The King, who was then upon the Road too towards <hi>Narbonne,</hi> had much ado to
recover the Town; all the Court lost their Baggage, more than three hundred men
drowned; several Coaches, and some of the Queens were left behind, and her Maids
had much ado to save their lives. A Light-Horse took up two of them, and set one
before, and another behind him. I for my own part, after a world of hardship, getting
to my Company, saw all sorts of Birds and Beasts, nay, even the very Rabbets run
into Houses and Barns before mens faces. I do not at all magnifie the matter, for
one would have thought a second flood had been coming, the Rain continuing (as I
said) for four hours together without any abatement, and four and twenty hours
in all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:100923:100"/>
I never was more put to it in all my life: For being much concern'd to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
my order exactly, which was to be at <hi>Narbonne</hi> next day with my Company, I
resolved not to fail. I got them thither at last, but fatigued them beyond what you
can imagine; insomuch that the King chid me, and told me, I play'd the fool in
bringing my Company cross the Country such weather as that was. His Majesty went
forward to <hi>Tholouse,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Montmorency</hi> was brought thither by his order:
Where he arrived the 7th of <hi>October,</hi> in the year 1632, about noon. They carry'd
him to the Town-house, and put him under the Custody of Monsieur <hi>de Launey,</hi>
Lieutenant of the <hi>Guards du Corps.</hi> The streets and publick places, from the Gate
where he came in, up to the Common Hall, were lin'd with Souldiers and <hi>Swisses;</hi>
and several Guards were set in other places about the Town; so very loth was the
Cardinal, that he man, whom he lookt upon as his Prisoner, should get out of his
hands.</p>
               <p>XIII. Some three hours after the Duke's arrival, two Commissioners came to the
Town-Hall to examine him. The Commission given the Parliament to proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Tryal was first read to him: Whereupon he said, with a great deal of temper,
that tho his Peerage made him accountable to the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> and no other
Court, yet he must cofess his offence was such, that if the King was not favourable,
any Judges had right enough to condemn him; that he was very well satisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be try'd by the Parliament of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> whom he had ever had a respect for,
and lookt upon them to be very honest Gentlemen. The Commissioners sat at the
end of the Table, and seated him on their left hand. They brought seven Witnesses
in against him, that is, four Officers of the Regiment of Guards, two Serjea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s,
and the Clerk of the States of <hi>Languedoc.</hi> He owned all that the Officers of the
Guards evidenc'd against him, concerning the action of <hi>Castelnau-d' Arry.</hi> And one
of them being questioned, whether he knew Monsieur <hi>Montmorency</hi> in the battle, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
with tears, that seeing him covered with fire, and blood, and smoak, he
had much ado to know him at first; but when he saw him break six of their ranks,
and kill several Souldiers in the seventh, he concluded this could be no body but
Monsieur <hi>de Montmorency;</hi> and that he knew him perfectly well afterwards, when his
Horse fell dead under him, and he lay there without being able to get off.</p>
               <p>The Commissioners askt him, if he had sign'd the debate of the States of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,</hi>
of the 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. of <hi>July,</hi> in which they entreated Monsieur to give them the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his protection, and promis'd to supply him with whatever Money he should
want, for the support of his Party, and that they would never desert his Interests.
He denied that he had subscribed it, and the Clerk being produced against him, and
affirming that he had, he fell into a great passion, calling him a forging Knave, and
charged him with counterfeiting his hand.</p>
               <p>All this while the whole Court was employed in importuning his Majesty for
Monsieur <hi>de Montmorency</hi>'s Pardon, and every body pray'd to God in his behalf. For
(besides that he was a person extremely to be valu'd) his great alliances with the
Royal Family, having the honour to be Brother-in-law to the first Prince of the
Blood, and Unkle to two Princes besides, and one Princess, which is my Lady
Dutchess of <hi>Longeville;</hi> and the illustrious reputation of his own Family, the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
renown of which is as old as Religion in <hi>France,</hi> was the reason that all the
Kingdom interess'd themselves in his preservation. The Cardinal <hi>de la Valett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> exprest
an extraordinary zeal above all the rest, and when he had done all he could with the
King, as well as the Pope's Nuntio, and all the Princes, he betook himself to the
Prayers of the Church, which he directed to be made every where, assisting in them
himself, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>everal great persons at Court with him, and omitting nothing, that so
affectionate and generous a friendship as his could inspire a man with upon such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</p>
               <p>The Blue Penitents also made a solemn Procession, among whom walked a great
many persons of Quality, and they went to visit the bodies of St. <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> on
their Feast-day, at the Abby of St. <hi>Cernin,</hi> where they sung Mass, and abundance of
people communicated, every one professing those devotions to be perform'd upon
Monsieur <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s account, and with an intent to beg his life of God. Nay,
Monsieur the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> though a party in that revolt himself, having, as I said
before, laid down his arms, and return'd to his obedience, was not unmindful of the
Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> in this extremity: But sent a Gentleman, who threw himself
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100923:100"/>
thrice at the Kings feet, and entreated him in his name, with all the earnestness
imagin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble, to spare a person, who had ever exprest an exceeding great zeal for his
Majesty's service, and who had engaged in this unhappy business (as he himself had
done) more out of levity and inconsideration, than out of any malicious principle, or
settled disaffection to his Majesty.</p>
               <p>Among all these persons of Honour that importun'd for Monsieur <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s
Pardon, my Captain, Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil,</hi> had the weakness to presume to put in his
particular intercession too, and begg'd his life of the King in Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s presence,
which was thought so very ridiculous, as to be made the Jest of the whole Court. The
King laught at him for it; and the Cardinal, when he heard him offer this request to
his Majesty, reply'd to him, with a true <hi>Richelieu</hi> complement, <hi>St. Preuil, if the King
serv'd you right, he would set your head where your heels stand.</hi> I heard this complement
my self, which I confess to me seem'd something Sparkish for a Bishop to make. But
it must be own'd, that it ill became a small Officer, to take upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> him the asking a
favour, which so many Princes and Nobles could not obtain. Thus much however
may be said in his excuse, that having not only a very great respect, but a particular
friendship for Monsieur <hi>Montmorency,</hi> and having made him his Prisoner, he thought
he had some priviledge upon this account to sue for his Pardon; and in so doing was
more guided by his affection, than judgment. For my own part, tho I had it may be as
great a respect and as tender a concern for him as he, and had as much rason to look
upon him as my Prisoner, yet I thought it my duty to satisfie my self with the suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of the principal persons of the Kingdom, and by no means proper to joyn my
self with them, any farther than by my good wishes and my prayers. I was affected
more sensibly than it is possible for me to express, both by my own private concern,
and by that general dejection observable, not only in the Court, but even among the
common people; which was so great, that one day as the King was in his Palace,
with abundance of company, we heard all on the sudden a mighty noise, occasioned
by the people, who quite transported with grief, came to the Kings Lodgings, and
cry'd out, <hi>Mercy, Mercy, Pardon, Pardon.</hi> The King askt what was the meaning of
all that noise? and Monsieur <hi>de Brezay,</hi> that had been made Mareschal of <hi>France,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the action of <hi>Castelnau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d' Arry,</hi> told him, that if his Majesty would give himself
the trouble to look out at the window, he would have pity upon those poor men.
But the King answer'd him very roughly, and without all question, more according
to the Cardinals sense than his own, <hi>If I would be guided by the different inclinations of my
poople<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I should not behave my self like a King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIV. While these important applications were making for saving the Duke of
<hi>Montmorency,</hi> and those so universal and unanimous, that it seem'd almost one voice
of Nobles and People, that begg'd of God and the King, the life of a person entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beloved of all the world; the Duke himself seem'd the only man that had forgot
all concern for the preservation of his present life. The convictions of his own breast,
that he deserved death; and the knowledge he had particularly, what temper his
chief Enemy was of, made him very little sollicitous about his Pardon: and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
himself into the hands of God, he employ'd himself wholly for the obtaining
a favour, much above this life, which he was about to leave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that we may say,
tho all that pray'd for him were not heard as to their particular request, yet that they
were in another respect much more for his advantage; for at the same time that the
King deny'd him favour, Almighty God was particularly good to him, having wrought
him to a lively repentance for his mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>carriages, and a desire to atone for them by his
death. To this therefore he seriously prepared himself by a general Confession, and
for that he qualify'd himself by a very particular reflection upon all his past life, for
two days together. And desiring to strengthen himself yet more against a tryal so
sharp as that he was to undergo, he requested, and received the Body of our Lord, as
that holy <hi>Viaticum,</hi> from whence he expected his whole support.</p>
               <p>The same day, being the 29th of <hi>October,</hi> the Courts being met in Parliament, the
Keeper of the Seals came thither, attended with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ix Masters of Requests, and there his
Tryal was examined. The next night, all the Souldiers quarter'd about <hi>Tholouse</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
orders to come into the Town, and were posted in all the streets and avenues,
to the number of twelve thousand men. About seven or eight of the clock next
morning, the Count <hi>de Charlus</hi> took Monsieur <hi>Montmorency</hi> from the Town-Hall, and
brought him to the Palace in his own Coach. He conducted him to the Chamber
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100923:101"/>
where the Court were met, and where the Keeper of the Seals had taken the Chair;
and after having plac'd him at the Bar upon a Stool, he withdrew. The Judges all
cast their eyes down upon the ground at his coming in, and most of them held their
handkerchiefs before their faces, as if they were desirous to hide their tears, which
they could not with any decency let the world see upon such an occasion. The Stool
was set in the middle of the Court, and rais'd higher than ordinary, so as to be almost
even with the Benches, where the Judges sat. He sat upon it bare-headed, and unbound,
which is not usual with the Parliament of <hi>Tholouse;</hi> before whom none are brought
to the Bar unshackled. The Keeper of the Seals, having first askt him the usual que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
which are but matter of form, desir'd to know whether he had sign'd the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation
of the States of <hi>Languedoc?</hi> to which he reply'd, that he confest he had;
and that upon second thoughts, he had recollected it, and was to blame for denying
it before.</p>
               <p>It was then put to him, whether he had not invited Monsieur the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>
into his Government? he reply'd, No, but that the States of that Province had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
him to take their priviledges into his protection. Being farther question'd,
whether Monsieur had not put him upon taking up arms? he said, he was not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to excuse himself by laying the fault upon Monsieur. Being askt, what it was
then that put him upon doing what he did? he answer'd, that it was his ill fortune,
and his own imprudence. When he was prest to declare the persons that were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
with him, he reply'd, that he own'd all that the Witnesses had depos'd against
him. They demanded, whether he had kept any correspondence with the foreigners
upon the frontier? he deny'd it positively, and affirm'd, that it was never any part of
his design to injure the Kingdom at all. He reply'd indeed to every question they
put to him so modestly, and like a man of honour, and with so engaging an air, that
the Judges had much ado to contain themselves, when they saw this great man in so
moving circumstances. When the Interrogatories were over, the Keeper of the
Seals askt him, whether he did not acknowledge himself in a great fault, and that he
deserv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to dye? To which he made this feeling return, that he deserv'd more than
could be exprest. Afterwards being order'd to withdraw, he begg'd to be admitted
once more, and then before the Court excus'd the Clerk of the States, whom he had
accus'd, and used him roughly the day before.</p>
               <p>After he was withdrawn, and while they carried him back to the Town Hall, the
Parliament proceeded to give their voices. A case so plain would not bear any long
debate; and it was impossible but a person taken actually in arms against his Prince,
must be condemned. One of the Commissioners therefore first pronounc'd him guilty,
and it was observ'd, that in the close of his Sentence the tears stood in his Eyes. All
the rest of the company exprest their consent, in dumb show, by taking off their
Caps; and the Keeper of the Seals confirming the same, he drew up the Sentence,
and signed it before the Court broke up. The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> all the Judges made haste home, that
they might at their own houses give free vent to those tears and groans, which Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
put a restraint upon in the publick Court of Justice. The Sentence being
brought to the King, his Majesty could not bear being a little mollified, and changed
two Articles in it. The one, that whereas he was to have been executed in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Market place, this should be done privately within the Town Hall; and the
other, that Monsieur <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s Estate, which was confiscated, he should have
leave to dispose of as he pleas'd. Which accordingly he did by Will, and deliver'd
it to Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> to carry to the King, desiring him to beg his Majesty's Pardon
in his Name. Nay, which was an action truly worthy of a good Christian, he had
a mind to let his bitterest Enemy see, that he died without any grudge or revengeful
thoughts against him; and therefore gave the same Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> a Picture of St.
<hi>Francis,</hi> with charge to make a Present of it to Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> as a testimony
that he died his humble Servant.</p>
               <p>About noon, the same day that Sentence was given, two Commissioners and the
Recorder came into the Chappel of the Town Hall, and sent for Monsieur <hi>Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi>
thither; who, kneeling down at the foot of the Altar, and fixing his Eyes upon
a Crucifix<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had his Sentence read to him. Then rising up, and turning to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he said, <hi>Gentlemen, I beg your Prayers, that God would enable me to suffer like a
Christian, the Execution of what was just now read to me.</hi> The Commissioners leaving
him with his Confessor, one of them as he was going said, <hi>Sir, we are going to obey your
commands, we will pray to God to strengthen you.</hi> He, continuing in the Chappel, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100923:101"/>
looking again up to the Crucifix, and afterwards down upon his Clothes, which were
very rich, threw away his Night-gown, and said, <hi>Shall such a sinful wretch as I presume
to go to dye gaily habited, when I see my innocent Saviour stript naked upon the Cross? No Father</hi>
(said he to his Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>essor) <hi>I must strip to my Shirt, that I may do some fit pennance for the
Sins I have committed against God.</hi> Just at this instant the Count <hi>de Charlus</hi> came from
the King, to demand the Order of the Holy Ghost, and the Mareschal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Staff of
<hi>France.</hi> The remainder of his time was employed in committing himself to God, and
strengthning his mind against death, by the Contemplation of his Saviour's Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
and in praying him to pardon his Sins. When notice was brought him of the
hour appointed for his Execution, he begg'd they would do him the favour to let
him suffer about the same time of the day that Christ dyed, which was some two
hours sooner than the Order; and this was left to his own choice. Before he went
to dye, he wrote a Letter to his Lady, Madam <hi>Montmorency,</hi> conjuring her to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
and to present the concern for his death as an offering to God; to procure rest
for his Soul, by moderating her grief in consideration of the Mercy God had shewn
him.</p>
               <p>XV. He order'd his Hair to be cut short behind, and being stript to his Shirt and
Drawers, he went in the middle of the Guards, who saluted him as he past, cross a
walk that leads into the Court of the Town-Hall, at the entrance of which he found
the Scaffold, which might be some four foot from the ground. When he was come
up upon it, attended with his Confessor and his Chyrurgeon, he saluted the company,
which were only the Clerk of the Parliament, the Grand Provost and his Archers,
and the Officers of the City Train-bands, who had orders to wait there. He begg'd
of them to acquaint the King, that he dy'd his most humble Subject and Servant;
infinitely troubled for having offended him, for which he begg'd his and their pardon.
He enquir'd for the Executioner, who had not yet come near him, and, in great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
would not allow his Chyrurgeon to do any thing about him, but giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
up entirely to be dispos'd of by the Executioner, as to the binding part, the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him into a right posture, and the cutting off his hair again, which was not cut
close enough before; he said with great significations of remorse, that so great a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as he could not dye too ignominiously. At last he kneel'd down near the Block,
upon which he laid his Neck, and after he had recommended his Soul to God, the
Executioner immediately cut off his Head; all the company turning away their eyes
from the sad sight, all melting into tears; and even the Guards themselves expressing
their concern, by deep sighs and groans.</p>
               <p>Thus dy'd <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> Duke and Peer, Mareschal, and sometime Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
of <hi>France,</hi> Governour of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> Grandson of four Constables and six Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschals,
first Christian, and first Baron of <hi>France,</hi> Brother-in-law to the first Prince
of the Blood, and Unkle to the renowned Prince of <hi>Conde;</hi> after having won two
Battels, one by Sea against the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> by which he made way for the taking of
<hi>Rochelle;</hi> and the other by Land, against the Empire, <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> by which he
forc'd the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and sav'd <hi>Cazal:</hi> Both which actions contributed much to that
Glory which the King of <hi>France</hi> hath. Those that were present at his death gave him
this testimony, That so much Piety and Courage was never seen upon such an occasion,
and in a man of that Quality; and indeed it was but fit, that both Nature and Grace
should work wonders in the person of the first Christian, and the bravest man in all
<hi>France.</hi> Since our Monarchy began there never was any Nobleman in the Kingdom,
with whom both Nature and Fortune had dealt so bountifully. He was born in the
year 1595. the wealthiest, best accomplished, most generous Lord in the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
graceful in his Speech, and charming in all his Conversation: A person of that

all his powers of Wit, Wisdom, Quality, and every other advantage of Honour and
Reputation both at home and abroad, in the service of his Majesty; and that to so
great a degree, that he sacrific'd his own interests to the good of the King and State,
and for ten years together maintained a War against the Rebels in <hi>Languedoc</hi> at his own
proper charge. In short, the King himself was pleased at two several times, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
his praises throughout his whole Realm, in so honourable and advantageous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
that it might be truly said of this last design in which he was unhappily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd,
that it was in some degree excusable, not being able to endure to live, and see

and so many persons of Honour, some banish'd, some clapt up in Prison, some pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
put to death, and all this by the Tyranny of one single Minister of State; and
that it was his great misfortune to be of opinion, that the taking up arms against that
Minister, was the best way of doing a real service to his Master.</p>
               <p>XVI. After all that has been said it cannot seem strange, if the people, and the
whole Kingdom where so sensibly affected with his death. As an instance of their
being so, as soon as ever the Execution was over, and the Grand Provost had ordered
the Gates to be opened, they throng'd in prodigious crowds to see the body. Their
concern, and the mighty respect they had for the great <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s person were such,
that when they could find no other comfort for the loss they sustain'd in him, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
stifled one another to get near the Scaffold, and to gather up the blood in their
Handkerchiefs, and lay it up by them at home. Nay some were so very extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
zealous, as to drink of it, and the least that any body did, was to go away
again in tears.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, two Priests that belong'd to Cardinal <hi>Valette,</hi> came and took
the body into the Chapel of the Abby-house of <hi>St. Cernin,</hi> where it was first embalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and put into a leaden Coffin, and afterwards, by a very particular favour, bury'd
in <hi>St. Cernin</hi>'s Church, a place that no person had been allow'd to lye in, ever since
<hi>Charlemayne</hi> brought the bodies of the Apostles thither; and this was so strictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that the very Counts of <hi>Tholouse</hi> could never obtain leave to be laid there
themselves. An eminent mark of respect this, for this illustrious man, that he
should be esteem'd worthy an interrment, where no body else had the priviledge of
lying. At four in the morning they began to say a great many Masses, as was usual,
and among others, the Bishops of <hi>Pamiez</hi> and <hi>Commenges</hi> said Masses. The greatest
part of the Parliament came thither with the common people, to pay their last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
to the person, whose condemnation they could not pronounce without tears
and extreme regret. And thus ended this bloody Tragedy, which by presenting the
greatest man in the Kingdom beheaded publickly upon a Scaffold, in the very midst
of that very Province, and the Capital City of it, which was under his Government,
shews us at the same time how much that favour and the grace of heaven, which
assisted him so powerfully at his last hour, is a more desirable blessing, than the good
Graces of the Court, which forsook him when he stood most in need of them. It
may not be amiss to present you here with a Copy of Verses, which may serve for an
Epitaph upon him, and with them I shall conclude this story.</p>

XVII. After the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s execution, the King and all the Court
went back to <hi>Paris.</hi> And the next year, which was 1633, we met with new distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances
from another Prince, who though he was a Soveraign one, yet was so with
dependance upon the King. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> having violated several Treaties,
formerly made with his Majesty, and denying to pay homage to the Crown, upon
account of the Dutchy of <hi>Bar,</hi> the King resolved to go do himself reason by force
of Arms. He went about the month of <hi>August,</hi> and sat down before the Town of
<hi>Nancy,</hi> which was then one of the best Fortifications in <hi>Europe.</hi> I had the honour to
attend him constantly, when he gave himself the trouble to go in person, and mark
out the lines of our Trenches, which he did with most extraordinary skill, being,
as I said, eminently ingenious in all matters relating to War.</p>
               <p>XVIII. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> perceiving himself in very great hazard to lose his
whole Dominions by his own fault, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt his Brother, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to the
King, to propose a Treaty of Peace: He was forc'd at last to truckle under a strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
force, and a more discerning judgment than his own. He resolv'd to come himself
at last, and wait on the King in his own Quarters, which were at <hi>Neuville</hi> a league off
of <hi>Nancy,</hi> and there made all manner of Submissions. The King receiv'd him with
great kindness and respect, and entertain'd him with the same expressions of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
as if he had never had reason to take any thing ill from him. He stood for some
time bare-headed, and afterwards putting on his own Har, obliged the Duke to put
on his too. But being by several experimental proofs sufficiently convinc'd, of how
fickle and crafty a temper he was, he was resolv'd by some contrivance to hinder his
return to <hi>Nancy</hi> that day; vilely suspecting that if he let him go back, he might trump
up some new device upon him, and shutting himself up in the Town, deny to open
the Gates, notwithstanding his word was engaged to the contrary. The Kings Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
was a very dark room, and therefore pretending he could not see to read some
Letters that were brought him, he called for Lights, that so the Duke might not be
sensible when night came on. And this was about four of the clock in the afternoon,
in the month of <hi>September.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who would fain have been going to <hi>Nancy,</hi> seeing the King
taken up in reading of Letters, would have taken his leave, and desir'd he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him to go home, and give directions for the due performance of what he had
promis'd should be done. The King, who was much of opinion, that his going was
rather design'd to obstruct, than to further the performance, answer'd him, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any notice, <hi>Methinks, Cousin, you are quickly weary of my company; it is not late yet,
you have but a league to</hi> Nancy, <hi>and may go it in less th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n an hour.</hi> Thus the King ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd
the matter so dextrously, that what between caressing him, reading of Letters,
and turning the discourse from one thing to another, night drew on before he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of it. At length the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> began to be very uneasie, and made a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
offer to take his leave, and be going: The King enquir'd of those about him,
what a clock it was? and being answer'd, that it was seven, he reply'd to the Duke, as
in a seeming surprize, <hi>Oh strange, how time runs away! Nay, it is too late for you to go now, Cousin.</hi>
The Duke, who had much rather have travell'd all night, than have staid where he
was, in the Kings custody, answer'd, That he knew the Road very well, and as his
Majesty had done him the honour to observe, should soon be at his journeys end.
The King, who saw him extremely eager to be gone, and had no mind' to discover
any thing of his own design, brought himself off very handsomely, by asking some
Officers that were there, whether the Guard was set? For, upon their informing him
that it was, and the Orders all given, he said to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain, Cousin, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
well leave me to night, it is too late to go; and if you should, now the Guards are set, it
would make a great confusion: You had much better lye here, and to morrow morning you may be
going very early.</hi> So after a great many fresh attempts to go, he was under a necessity
at last to comply with the Kings invitation, not daring, as matters then stood, to
give him any occasion of displeasure.</p>
               <p>XIX. The Cardinal of <hi>Valette</hi>'s apartment was appointed for the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s
Lodging; and the King commanded my Lord Duke of <hi>St. Simon,</hi> and the Count of
<hi>Nogent,</hi> to keep him company at Supper, and some other Officers and my self to wait
upon him. But all this honour done him by his Majesty, was only meant to secure
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100923:103"/>
him the more effectually. And upon the same account twelve <hi>Swisses</hi> were ordered
to keep Guard at his door, which was to pass for respect to him. The Duke of
<hi>Lorrain</hi> invited the Duke of <hi>St. Simon</hi> and the Count of <hi>Nogent</hi> to sup with him, who
staid till eleven at night. In the mean while, ten or twelve Souldiers were privately
posted to secure the house within, and then as many Officers of us as were there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
with the Duke of <hi>St. Simon</hi> and Count <hi>Nogent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When his Highness of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was gone to bed, I receiv'd orders to keep a strong
guard about his house with my Company, for fear he should make any attempt to
get off under the covert of the night. Therefore considering of what consequence
such a Guard might prove, I set a Centry at every six paces, and posted my self near
one of the Centinels, under a Tree, just over against a Window of the Chamber
where the Duke lay. The jealousie he had that he was caught, and trickt by the
wile of the King, as in truth he was, gave him great disturbance, and not being able
to sleep in his Bed, he had a great mind to try if it were possible for him to make
his escape. Well, about one a clock at midnight he got up, and came to look out at
the Window, that lay directly against the Tree where I sat, and was at least as
wakeful as he. At first he began to sing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s if he intended to divert himself; and
presently after calling to the Centry, he cry'd, <hi>Centry, Centry, I hear a great noise, what
is the matter?</hi> I reply'd instead of the Centry, and told him it was a body of Horse
that were walking the Rounds. <hi>How many of them may there be?</hi> said the Duke; <hi>About
two thousand, Sir,</hi> said I. <hi>How!</hi> said he, <hi>two thousand Horse! this is something more than
ordinary; the Guard does not use to be so great. Excuse me, Sir,</hi> said I, <hi>it is commonly of
this strength. O there must be less,</hi> reply'd he, <hi>you represent it bigger than it is; away,
away: And who commands there? Every one in his turn, Sir,</hi> said I; <hi>sometimes the Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chals
de Camp, sometimes tht Lieutenant Generals, and so the other Officers in course. On my
word,</hi> said the Duke, <hi>that is a stout Guard, you need fear nothing.</hi> I reply'd, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the King was in person, the Guard was always thus big. Afterwards having a
mind to pump me, he proceeded thus: <hi>But is not the person I am talking with, an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer?</hi>
I reply'd, That I was a poor Cadet, and his humble Servant. <hi>Say you so!</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
he, as if he were surpriz'd at that, <hi>by your discourse I should have taken you for an
Officer. Well then, Fellow-Souldier, since thou art but a Souldier, how long hast thou been at
this trade? Some ten or twelve years, Sir,</hi> said I. <hi>And how long hast thou serv'd in the
Guards?</hi> I told him, <hi>About some five or six years. How!</hi> added he, <hi>methinks thou hast serv'd
a great while, to have no reward; prithee how comes it to pass thou art advanc'd no higher?</hi> I
made answer, That some men had better fortune in the world than others; and that
I for my part was one of the unlucky ones; but still I expected every day the same
good fortune, that I saw some of my fellows attain to. He askt me, whether we
receiv'd our pay duly however? I told him I had no reason to complain for that
matter, and that if I was unhappy in other respects, yet in this I was not. After that,
he askt me, how much my pay was? and I answer'd, the common pay of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
<hi>But,</hi> said he, <hi>methinks it is cruel hard for all that, to stick at the mark tkus one's whole
life, and never rise to any Command; Couldst not thou be well pleas'd to have some employ?
Te be sure, Sir,</hi> said I, <hi>if the King saw fit to give me a Command, I should not refuse it. Very
well,</hi> said he, <hi>and hark you Souldier, if you have a mind to it, there are methods for an honest
man to make his fortune.</hi> I answer'd him, That I had the honour to serve the greatest
Prince in the world, who hath it in his power to reward, if I am but able to do him
service. He return'd very pleasantly, <hi>It seems then thou hast not serv'd him well all this
while, for thou hast been a long time in service, and he hath made thee no amends yet. It is a
sign, Sir, that he hath a mind to try me long and throughly,</hi> said I, <hi>that he may be able to make
a surer Judgment whether I deserve his favour. A man loses nothing by waiting: Therefore I
am in expectation every day, and it may be I shall be rewarded to morrow. This I am sure of,
that I can never be false to my duty, and that this is the only way to raise my fortunes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> understood very well by my answer, that I knew who I
spoke to, and that he was to expect nothing from me. Upon this account, tho he
was toucht to the quick, end much enrag'd to see himself so put upon, yet he made as
though he valu'd our Centinel, and said, <hi>Go thy way for a brave fellow, I love thee for
this humour. Good night.</hi> And then he withdrew immediately. A Gentleman that
was with him, and who heard this dialogue between us, said to him upon this, <hi>Ah
Master, you are made Prisoner, there is no possibility of getting off.</hi> In the mean while, I
went forthwith to acquaint the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> with the discourse that had passed
with his Highness, that he might inform the King. My Lord <hi>Espernon</hi> imagining,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100923:103"/>
that the Duke might possibly come to attack me a second time, had a mind or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
himself with the hearing it, and came and posted himself with me under my
Tree. The Duke accordingly appeared again at the Window presently after, and
cry'd. <hi>Comrade, Centry, What's the Clock?</hi> I told him, it wanted something of Two.
He askt me, whether it was I that he had spoke to before? I told him I was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to whom he did that honour. He added, <hi>You are a great while upon duty:</hi> For he
was terrible uneasie, and would have been glad to have had some body else to deal
with. I answer'd, That I had not been two hours there yet, and that now I should
be soon reliev'd. <hi>What's the reason,</hi> said the Duke, <hi>that I hear no more of the noise there was
even now? Sir,</hi> said I, <hi>because the Petrole is gone by, and within a little while it will come
round again. In earnest,</hi> said he, <hi>this is a fine strong Guard, but it must be confest that they
have a great Prince to guard. Well, thou art happy to serve under such a King, he understands
Military Discipline the best of any Prince in</hi> Europe. <hi>Sir,</hi> said I, <hi>I should be the most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man alive, were I not sensible of my happiness to serve so great a Master; and you, Sir,</hi>
continu'd I, <hi>are as able to judge of his greatness as any body, for you have had some knowledge
of it. Does not he exercise you himself?</hi> reply'd the Duke. <hi>Yes Sir,</hi> said I, <hi>he exercises
his own Regiment of Guards, his Musqueteers, and all the Regiments. For ought I perceive</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd he)
<hi>he keeps you to hard work, and allows you but little time to rest in. Yes indeed, Sir,</hi>
said I, <hi>he often makes us sweat soundly, but he favours himself no more than he does us.</hi> Then
he askt me, Whereabouts the Cardinals Lodgings were? adding, That he was afraid
there was but indifferent Guard kept there; and when I answer'd him, That the
Guards were equally set through all the Kings Quarter; he said with a laugh, <hi>Nay, nay,
therre must be more and less, there is not the same occasion to guard all.</hi> After this he enlarg'd
mightily in praise of the King; and when he had try'd and turn'd me every way, and
found that I was proof still against all his methods, he said to me at last, <hi>Well, fellow
Souldier, wheever you are, your servant: Good night.</hi> And so he went in again.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> had like utterly to have spoil'd all, for the jest pleas'd him so
well, that he had much ado to forbear bursting out into a loud laughter. For besides, that
the subject of our discourse was pleasant enough, the manner of our talking together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever seeing one another at all; and one lying all the while upon the attack, and the
other acting defensively, had something very comical in it. I withdrew too a little after,
leaving directions with the Centinel, that if the Duke came again to the window, and
had a mind to talk any more, he should answer him a little roughly, <hi>Pray Sir be pleas'd
to go in and sleep, this is a very unseasonable time of night.</hi> But he never was put to this
trouble: For the Duke perceiving himself caught, came out no more. The King un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
by my Lord <hi>Espernon</hi> at his waking, what pleasant discourse had passed,
diverted himself and the company with it, and was very desirous to hear the whole
story from me. I made all the haste I could to wait on him, and related the whole
matter to him as naturally as I could. When I told him how the Duke had sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, by some hints that there were methods for an honest man to make his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes;
his Majesty told me, that I should have urg'd him a little further, and have
pretended to accept his proffer, to see how far he would have gone; whereupon I
uery readily made the King this reply, That if the thing were to do again, I should
do so, having authority from his Majesty for it; but that I could by no means think
it safe before, because perhaps it would have been hard to perswade him, that this was
only put on; and therefore I chose rather to jest within compass, and keep on the
safer side, than to venture upon any thing that would stand in need of a favourable
construction. The King laught heartily, and because he would have the diversion of
telling this story himself, which indeed he did very pleasantly, charg'd me not to speak
of it. But when he told it to any of the Lords at Court, he would send for me to
confirm what he had said. Every body was well pleas'd with it, and the conference
between the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and the Lieutenant of <hi>Pontis,</hi> was the constant enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of all companies.</p>
               <p>XX. The King sent in the morning to enquire how the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had rested,
and to tell him withal, That he was something surpriz'd to find the people of <hi>Nancy</hi>
did not open their Gates according to agreement, after the Letter he had written to
them; For his Highness had writ once before upon this occasion, but had forbidden
them to comply with his Letter, how positive soever the orders were, till they should
see a particular token from him, such a one as was agreed on between them before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand.
The King therefore sent him word, That he began to suspect he did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:100923:104"/>
to keep his promise with him: That he desir'd he would shew himself a man of
honour, and write again to his Subjects of <hi>Nancy</hi> to surrender. The Duke wrote a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time, but still without the token I mention'd; which he did, hoping the King
would let him go to <hi>Nancy,</hi> to give his personal orders for opening the Gates. The
men of <hi>Nancy</hi> shewing no more obedience to this second Letter, than they had done
to the former, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was urged afresh by the King to be true to his
promise: Whereupon, and upon seeing no hopes of getting leave to go to <hi>Nancy,</hi> if he
did not make good the Treaty, he at last writ a Letter with that token, which was the
signal, that now he would be obeyed. So they opened their Gates to the King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently.
All his Troops entred the Town, with Pikes levell'd, Ranks closed, Match
lighted, and in a perfect posture for fighting, if they had met with any treachery or
opposition. We possest our selves of all the Quarters and Fortifications, and then
gave orders, that, all the Garrison of <hi>Lorrain</hi> should lay down their Arms. A friend of
mine, one <hi>de la Serre,</hi> and one of the principal Officers in the Garrison, when he
heard us cry, <hi>Down with your Arms,</hi> was in a rage, and ready to hang himself; and
told me, if he had thought they should have been us'd at this rate, the King should
never have come in, till he had beat the Walls about their Ears. I softned his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
a little, and prevailed upon him to bear his misfortune with moderation. Thus
the King was absolute Master of <hi>Nancy,</hi> the Government of which place he bestow'd
on Monsieur <hi>de Brassac.</hi>

               <p>I. IN the Year 1634, some months after <hi>Nancy</hi> was reduc'd, the King was pleas'd
to do me the honour, to make me Commissary General of all the <hi>Swisses</hi> in
<hi>France.</hi> He understood that many of the <hi>Swisses</hi> had a good opinion of, and
confidence in me, and that having desired me very earnestly to teach them their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises,
I could not decline it; upon which account they came oftentimes to my
Quarters, where I endeavour'd to instruct them according to their desire. Knowing
therefore, that these honest Fellows had a particular esteem for me, he suppos'd that
this kindness of theirs would make it an easy matter for me to manage them as I pleas'd.
So that asking me one day at <hi>Versailles,</hi> whether the <hi>Swisses</hi> continu'd their visits to
me still, a they us'd to do, and if they improv'd at all? and I replying, that they
came to me constantly still, and that they were a little slow, but very good men to
the best of their capacity; he presently return'd upon me; <hi>Well, I must make you Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary
General over them all within my Kingdom, that you may discipline them, as you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
done your own Company.</hi> I embrac'd this proposal with great satisfaction, because
it was a very honourable Post, and exprest to the King my grateful acknowledgments
for the favour he had done me, in making choice of me for this Command. But not
knowing very well how to compass it for want of Money, I proceeded no farther at
that time, being willing to try whether the King would do me any greater kindness,
than merely to shew his good inclinations toward me.</p>
               <p>The person at present in that Office was one <hi>Ferrary,</hi> whom his Majesty did not
like at all. And this among others, was one reason why the King pitch'd upon me
for it, that I, who was continually about his person, might succeed a man for whom
he had no kindness. Some time after the first mention of it, he took occasion to
speak to me again, and told me, he would have me sell my Command of Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in the Guards, to help towards the purchase of my Commissary's place. As a
particular mark of his favour, he told me too, that he would undertake to help me
to a Chapman for my Lieutenant's place, and make the best bargain he could for
me. I very readily agreed to all these proposals, which were for my advantage, as
well in point of gain, as of honour. But I saw plainly the consequences of being
engag'd in a business, that I knew must cost me three times as much as my Command
would bring me in. But yet I let the King go on, not daring to oppose his pleasure,
and hoping he would at some time or other recollect, that he was richer than I; and
what was impossible for my circumstances, to him would be very easy. He sent
Monsieur <hi>de Chenoise</hi> to me, who had a mind to buy a Lieutenancy in the Guards for
his Son, the Baron <hi>de Boucaut;</hi> and the management of my business lying in the hands
of so powerful an Agent as his Majesty, the bargain was soon agreed at twelve
thousand Crowns; which was more by one third than Lieutenants of the Guards
Commands used then to go at. The King then urged me to treat with Monsieur
<hi>Ferrary</hi> for his Office, and promis'd me a Bill upon the Treasury, by which the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer
should stand engag'd to my Creditors, for what Moneys they should advance
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100923:105"/>
towards this purchase, if I happened to dye in the service. This put me upon treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in good earnest, and Monsieur <hi>Ferrary</hi> and I drove the bargain for thirty thousand
Crowns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>II. My Friends in the mean while coming in very thick to proffer me the Money,
I sollicited the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he would please to give me the Bill upon the Treasury,
which he had done me the favour to promise me, and likewise made my interest
with some other persons who might be assisting to me in the procuring it. Going
one day to wait on Monsieur <hi>de Bullion</hi> for this purpose, and meeting Monsieur <hi>de
Bellievre</hi> upon the stairs, who was afterwards first President of the Parliament of
<hi>Paris,</hi> I was very importunate with him, that he would give himself the trouble of
recommending my business to the Superintendant. He went up with me again at first
word, and did what I requested of him with that usual civility nd good grace, that
hath got him the respect of all mankind. Though Monsieur <hi>Bullion</hi> was a perfect
Creature of Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s, who had no kindness for me, yet he made me this
civil answer, That he should be very glad to serve me, but if the King granted me
this peculiar priviledge above the rest of his Officers, he would bring them all upon
him; that they would expect the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>avour, which the King could neither give
them without dipping his Exchequer in vast summs, nor deny them without creating
me as many Enemies, as there were Officers in the Army: But however, that I might
present my Petition to the Council, and that they would debate the matter in his
Majesty's presence.</p>
               <p>I do not question but he discoursed the thing with the Cardinal, and receiv'd posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
orders to oppose it. For, notwithstanding the King was fully determined to
grant me this favour, notwithstanding he had acquainted the Cardinal with his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who pretended to like it well enough; notwithstanding by a particular act of
condescension, he had undertaken to put in my Petition himself; yet for all that I
was baulkt of my expectation. Insomuch that the King, at his coming out from
Council, gave himself the trouble of speaking to me in these remarkable expressions,
<hi>We have been taken short, we have l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st our cause; but trouble not your self, I will make you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends,
I will give you something that shall be better for you.</hi> I confess it was some astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to me, that a Prince should thus lose his cause in his own Council, and in a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
that depended entirely upon his own free bounty; and that, when he had an
inclination to grant a favour, and reward the services of one of his Officers, it should
not be in his power to effect it. But it is no hard matter to see from what cause this
want of power grew.</p>
               <p>But still, tho the King had made me this promise, to assist, and make me amends
some other way, I did not much care to depend upon a promise, which I saw so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when it came to the push, might possibly not be in his power to make good. I
should have been better pleased with ready Money; and finding my self thus engaged,
upon the confidence the King had given me at first, fearing now that my Creditors
might be in danger of losing by me, I had enough of my Command already, before
ever I got possesion of it. However, the King was so urgent upon the thing, that I
found my self constrain'd, whether I would or no, to get over all difficulties, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon my Office.</p>
               <p>III. At my taking the usual Oath, it was required I should appear in a <hi>Swisse</hi> habit
which was a Coat of Black Velvet, with a border round it. I had a very rich Cap,
which the King had given me, upon which was wrought, a fine large Heron, a Bird
of Paradice, and some other Ornamental devices. I sent for a good many Officers,
some three or fourscore, and coming at the head of them into the Hall, where the
King was, I addrest my self to him, after the <hi>Swisse</hi> fashion. The King receiv'd me,
as he us'd to do Ambassadours, standing at the side of his Couch, and taking off his
Hat to me; he gave me his Hand to kiss, and then said by way of Gallantry, <hi>Come</hi>
Swisse, <hi>now speak.</hi> I answer'd, That his Majesty had not allow'd me time enough to
learn the language. After I had taken the customary Oath, I was placed by the King;
and as each of the <hi>Swisse</hi> Officers advanced to pay him their respects, I presented them
to him, intimating their qualifications and excellencies, and giving a short Character
of every one of them; to inform the King of their several tempers, which I was
throughly acquainted with, which was a sort of a little Farce, that the King and
Lords who were by, thought a good pleasant entertainment. For I strove in my
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:100923:105"/>
speech, and all my motions, to mimick these honest fellows as naturally as I could;
affecting to appear a true <hi>Swisse,</hi> while I was habited like one.</p>
               <p>IV. The King was pleas'd to discourse me very largely about my Office, and told
me he intended to make it one of the most honourable Commands about the Court
to me. And so he really did. He annexed several very considerable priviledges to
it, and himself gave me directions, how to behave my self with regard to the other
Officers in the Army, telling me where I ought to give the precedence, and where not.
There was but one <hi>Swisse</hi> Officer above me, which was the Mareschal <hi>de Bassompier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
our Collonel; and as to the Commanding part, I was first both of the Regiment of
<hi>Swisse</hi> Guards, and all the rest of them that were in <hi>France,</hi> to the number of seven or
eight thousand: all which was agreeable to their primitive institution. It was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Kings pleasure, that in Mareschal <hi>Bassompier</hi>'s absence, I should command in
chief, as well in time of action, as in matters of ordinary discipline: And I must
needs say, this to me was the most desirable Office that I could possibly have thought of.</p>
               <p>About a week or a fortnight after I was actually in my Office, and had taken the
Oaths before his Majesty, I exercis'd the Regiment, before a great deal of company,
and a great many persons of Quality. I began with the Oath which the Lieutenant
Collonel is oblig'd to take, the Ceremony whereof is this: The Commissary Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
representing the Kings person, sits with his Hat on; the Lieutena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t Collonel,
and all the Regiment stand bare. Then the Commissary General, directing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the Lieutenant Collonel, requires him to take the Oath in these words: <hi>Do
you swear, as you hope for Salvation, to be faithful to the King as long as you live; and rather
to dye, than do any thing contrary to his Interest; to discover, or cause to be discovered to his
Majesty, whatever you shall know may turn to the prejudice of him, or his Kingdom, &amp;c.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Lieutenant Collonel hath taken this Oath, as I have described it, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary
General orders him to give the whole Regiment the same, and then they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to their Exercise.</p>
               <p>V. But tho this Office, which I enjoy'd with all its ancient priviledges, had nothing
but what was great and honourable belonging to it, yet I found several reasons to be
quickly weary of it. The King was every day giving me fresh orders for the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the <hi>Swisse</hi> Souldiers, and would have me bring them to a discipline, as strict
as the severest Monastery was under: So that I was cruelly perplext with the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
he laid upon me, and the accounts he expected to be given him of them. His
Majesty talkt of nothing else but new reformations, and I found my self a thousand
times more a Slave, than I was formerly. <hi>To what purpose then</hi> (said I to my self) <hi>is
all this honour, that only enslaves, and makes me wretched? and why should I sell my liberty, and
all the enjoyment of my life, for a little breath, and empty vanity?</hi> Besides all this, I saw my
friend run a great risque in the Money they had lent me for the purchase; for when
the King exprest never so much inclination to do me good, he was not suffer'd to
bring it to any effect; and the favours he intended me were constantly opposed.
Some of my friends too laid before me the unhappy consequences of the employment
I was now engag'd in, very feelingly; and tho my own sense and experience taught
me all that, better than they could; yet these considerations laid all together, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in me a strong resolution to throw up this Command, where I found the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
did by no means answer the burden; for tho that was great, yet this was not
to be endured.</p>
               <p>The great difficulty was, which way to bring the King to consent to it; and but
to mention such a thing to him, I saw plainly was utterly to lose his favour: But yet
I found my self ready to undergo the worst that could happen; and waiting upon
him one day, I told him, that I was reduced to a very sad extremity, that having
bought my place upon the credit of his word, that the Exchequer should be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to my Creditors, they were very importunate with me now to give them secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
<hi>Your Majesty</hi> (said I) <hi>if you please, may see what becomes me to do in this case; and
whether it be fair, that I should impose upon my friends. I had much rather, Sir, give my
Command back into your Majesties hands, and resign it with your approbation, than bring my self
into a necessity of applying to you so often for a matter of this nature.</hi> The King, tho much
offended at the request I made to him, yet conceal'd his resentments at that time. He
told me, that he had indeed promis'd to turn over my debt to his Treasury, but that
his Council for several reasons were against it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as for any other objection, since
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100923:106"/>
I was so very uneasie in my Employment, I should think of some good man, that he
might approve, to succeed me.</p>
               <p>VI, Having obtain'd the Kings leave thus far, I came to terms with one <hi>St. Denys,</hi>
who made me lose two thousand Crowns by my Office, for of the thirty thousand I
had bought it at, I could bring him no higher than eight and twenty. When I had
come off thus by the loss, he desir'd me however to do him one favour, which was,
to speak to the King in his behalf, that this Command might be continu'd to him,
with the same priviledges that his Majesty in favour to me had grac'd it with. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenc'd
him good for evil, and promis'd to use all my interest for the obtaining
this advantage, but told him at the same time, I was afraid it would not be done;
for I pretty well knew the Kings temper, who allow'd me those priviledges, only in
consideration of the long tryal he had had of my faithful services, and that in a season,
when very few were found to have devoted themselves so entirely to him. And so
it happen'd, for when I presented him to the King, and took the boldness to beg the
continuation of the same priviledges, that his Majesty had beed pleas'd to honour me
withal; all that I could say to raise an esteem for this Officers good qualifications,
and faithful services, was to no manner of purpose. He downright refus'd my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
and sent us away without having patience to hear me out. So that he was to
take it as a great favour, that his Majesty permitted him to hold the Office with its
common priviledges, before it fell into my hands.</p>
               <p>The King in the mean while, who was exceeding angry to find me so vehemently set
upon throwing up my place, tho he had conceal'd it at first, yet could not forbear within
a few days to declare his displeasure so warmly, that I had reason to think my best way
would be to absent my self from Court for some time. That which gave the King
the greatest offence of all, was, that he fancy'd I was now grown weary of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
He had observ'd for many years, what methods were taken to draw off his
most faithful Servants affections from him; and the experience of that made him apt
to suspect the same of me; which made him say upon my account to the Chancellour,
who was pleas'd afterwards to tell it me again; <hi>Is not this a prodigious thing, that I
can no sooner get a good servant, but he is presently corrupted?</hi> But really the King was not
so just to me in this, as he was afterwards; and tho I had the honour of being about
his person so long, yet it seems I was not sufficiently known; for no consideration could
have taken me off from the Duty I ow'd to my Prince; nor could I ever have serv'd
any other person with the same zealous affection that I did him. But I was not long
out of favour, for his Majesty shortly after sent me his commands to wait on him,
when he went to <hi>St. Geneviere of the Wood.</hi> I staid some days at Court without any em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
except that of attending upon the Kings person.</p>
               <p>VII. About the end of <hi>May 1635,</hi> when the War was declar'd with <hi>Spain,</hi> a great
many Troops were rais'd, and several Armies composed out of them; one of which
was to enter into the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> by <hi>Picardy.</hi> So, being out of Office, I begg'd a
Command of his Majesty, and that he would give me leave to go with Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
<hi>Brezay</hi> into <hi>Holland;</hi> telling him, that I was quite sick of an idle, and useless way
of living, and long'd to be doing him some service. The Kings reply was a little sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing,
and who very graciously askt me, Whether I was not content to be near
him? how I could be sick for want of service, when I was actually serving, and
attending his person? I answer'd, with pretty good presence of thought, That this
indeed was a greater honour than I deserved; but that my desire of going into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
was only to make my self more worthy of his service; and to learn in a foreign
Nation, and the most accomplisht School of War, several things, that might qualifie
me much better for the employments he honour'd me with. The pretence I used was
fair and plausible enough, and the posture of my affairs at that time as favourable.
But the King, who saw the Servants, in whom he confided most, fall off from him
every day, made some difficulty at first of granting my request, fearing, that when I
was at so great a distance from him, I should be so much the less zealous for him,
and easier to receive any bad impressions, that men might be apt to insinuate into
me. For indeed the coldness he discover'd in most of those that were about him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
him to a very particular regard for the most inconsiderable of his Servants,
where he found a contrary temper; and therefore it ought to seem less strange, if he
stoopt so low sometimes, as to express a kindness for a poor mean Officer, as I was,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100923:106"/>
to fix me faster to him; since the unhappy circumstances of his Government made
such condescensions necessary to him, as would otherwise have very ill become the
Majesty of so great a Prince. But how averse soever he was to my making this Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign
in <hi>Holland,</hi> he yielded at last to the sollicitation of several friends of mine, who
knew that I was then quite out of my Element, while staying at Court without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
employ; and therefore they followed my business so close, as to get me the
Kings leave, tho not without some degree of loathness and reluctancy.</p>
               <p>VIII. Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> had a particular kindness, I may say indeed, the
care and affection of a Father for me; and as a testimony of the sincere friendship he
honour'd me with, presented me with a very fine Gold Medal, with a Sword engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
on one side, and a Purse on the other; designing to assure me by this, that both
his Sword and his Purse were at my service. Which no doubt ought to be esteemed
a very singular favour, especially from a Gentleman of his quality and temper; who
kept himself pretty much upon the reserve, and was intimately acquainted with very
few people. He entrusted me with the raising his Regiment, and made me eldest
Captain and Major of it, and as it were his <hi>Aid de Camp</hi> besides. The Army for
<hi>Picaray,</hi> which he and the Mareschal <hi>de Chatillon</hi> commanded between them by turns,
consisted of at least twenty thousand Foot, and six or seven thousand Horse.</p>
               <p>IX. The Generals design'd to besiege <hi>Namur,</hi> a Town scituate upon the <hi>Meuse.</hi>
In order to it, when the Army was come within four or five leagues of it, Mareschal
<hi>Brezay</hi> sent Monsieur <hi>de Vientais,</hi> Monsieur <hi>Lansac,</hi> and me, with a detachment of
three hundred Horse, to go before, and learn the posture of the Enemy, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skirts
of the Town. At the Village of <hi>Avain</hi> we took some Prisoners, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by them, that the Enemy came on with their whole Army, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> their General; Count <hi>Feria,</hi> Son to the Count <hi>de Benevent,</hi>
Governour of <hi>Anvers,</hi> the Lieutenant General; and the Count <hi>de Buquoy,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Horse. We march'd all night, and when we were got up pretty near
to <hi>Namur,</hi> left our Squadron in a Wood, that we might come still closer to the
Town, and inform our selves better how matters stood. We heard immediately the
Trumpets sound, the Drums beat, and all the noise and clatter of an Army upon the
march, with Baggage and Ordnance. It was Moon light, and strait we began to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Army coming over the Bridge cross the <hi>Meuse,</hi> and we staid to count as far
as forty Troops of Horse.</p>
               <p>After we had seen and heard too much to doubt any longer whether it was the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
Army, we made haste back to joyn our detachment, and recover the Village of
<hi>Avain</hi> as fast a we could. And indeed it was by no means safe to stop by the way,
for the Enemy began immediately to send out parties of Horse to scowr the Country,
and make a discovery of our Army. If I would have been perswaded by Monsieur
<hi>Vientais</hi> and <hi>Lansac,</hi> we had staid at <hi>Avain,</hi> to refresh our selves after the great fatigue
we had undergone; but I made it so plain to them, that by this means they were in
danger of having their Throats cut by these Scowrers, (and that a danger too, that
could bring them no honour) that we continu'd our march quite back to the Army.
We told Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> what we had seen, who at first could scarce believe the
Enemy was so nigh; but not being able to give the lye to our Eyes and Ears, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
gave orders to prevent our being surpriz'd by the Enemy.</p>
               <p>The Mareschal <hi>de Chatillon</hi> with the Rear-Guard was a great way from us; and tho
Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> would not have been much concern'd to begin the action without
him, yet he sent to desire he would come up with all the speed he could. Mareschal
<hi>Chatillon</hi> came himself presently after, and looking upon the Enemy, and how they
lay, with his usual coldness, he said very roughly to the Officers that were by; <hi>I am
glad to see them so near, it is better having them here, than at</hi> Brussels. The Enemies having
possest themselves of <hi>Avain,</hi> we were forc'd to draw out our Army into line of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
in a very streight Valley, where it cost our Generals a great deal of trouble, to
make amends by their skill and prudence, for the disadvantage of the ground. Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
<hi>de Brezay</hi> took the Left Wing, and <hi>Chatillon</hi> the Right. Monsieur <hi>de Brezay,</hi>
who did me the honour to shew me a great deal of kindness, (as I said before) think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I had some experience in War, would needs make me that day execute the Office
of Serjeant of the Battel, and marshal all the men, which engag'd me to be up and
down in several places, and parts of the action, to see the Generals orders duly obey'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:100923:107"/>
In the beginning of the Engagement, the Enemies Forlorn Hope made ours give
ground, who fell in upon the Detachment that supported them in great disorder.
Their Cannon, which was very advantageously planted, made at the same time such
a furious Discharge, that a great part of the Troops of our Left Wing were put into
disturbance with it. In that very instant a considerble Officer who rid close to me,
and whom I was to come to speak with, immediately fell into such a terrible Fright,
that he set Spurs, and rid away as fast as his Horse could go. Some that saw him
began to cry out, <hi>Ah! such a one runs.</hi> Tho I had no great intimacy with him, yet I
was concerned to see that this single Miscarriage might ruine him for ever; and
therefore immediately answer'd as loud as I could speak, <hi>No, No, he does not Run, he
is going to the Post I have assigned him.</hi> And then I sent a Gentleman after him, who
was near me, and one that I durst trust, to tell him how I had vindicated his Honour,
and desire him by all means that he would come back to his Post immediately, and
tell me publickly, That he had dispatch'd the Business I had committed to his charge.
Accordingly he did return, and spoke to me, as if he was giving an account of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
he had done, and he owned himself obliged to me as long as he lived, for this
good office; in saving his Reputation at that time.</p>
               <p>X. Our Troops taking heart again after this first Terror I mentioned, and recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with themselves what a Reproach it would be to them, to have been afrighted
with the noise of the Guns, and have given way at the very first; c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me on again
bravely, and fell upon the Enemy with such indignation and rage, that after a stiff
resistance on both sides for a very great while, they were at last obliged to draw off,
and leave us in possession of the Field. I took particular notice of Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi>
who, after having fought very bravely, was one of the last that went off. He was
followed very close at the heels, and forced to leap over a little Wall to get away;
in the leap he dropt his Hat and Cane, at the end of which his Arms were engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon a golden handle. I, being very near him, took up that Cane, and gave it to
Mareschal <hi>Brezay,</hi> who some time after made a Present of it to the King. Besides, we
followed so hard upon Count <hi>Feria</hi> his Lieutenant-General, that he was forc'd to beg
for Quarter of me, crying out, <hi>Spare my Life, Ten thousand Crowns Ransom.</hi> So I made
him my Prisoner.</p>
               <p>But how great and remarkable soever this Victory was, yet it cost <hi>France</hi> very dear,
for we lost a world of gallant Men, who were sacrificed there for the publick good.
A vast many Colours and Cornets were taken, and abundance of Prisoners. The
chief of them were Count <hi>Feria,</hi> whom I told you of before; <hi>Don Charles</hi> Natural
Son to the Archduke <hi>Leopold,</hi> Collonel <hi>Sfondrate</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Brown</hi> an
<hi>English</hi> Man, were likewise taken there. As for Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the Count <hi>de
Buquoy,</hi> they saved themselves by flight. After the Battel was over, I had a great
quarrel with the Commander of the Forlorn Hope, who would needs have it, that
Count <hi>Feria</hi> was his Prisoner, because it was the Party he led on, that prest him and
forc'd him to retreat, and therefore he belonged to him as Commander of that Party.
I answer'd, That I was the Person of whom Count <hi>Feria</hi> asked Quarter, and into my
hands he surrendred himself; and farther, that for the determination of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy,
I would refer my self to the Prisoner himself. He was asked then, Whose
Prisoner he acknowledged himself? And he immediately made answer, That I had
given him Quarter, and he surrendred himself up to me. Thus our Dispute was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by the Count's own Declaration, who immediately, and as a mark of his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
gave me his General's Scarf. He also made me a Present of a Box of Reliques
which he had about him, and which I have kept ever since. I was in good hopes to
have got Ten thousand Crowns from the King too, which is a Gratuity usually given
to them that take a General Prisoner in time of Action. But I had just the same
Success on this occasion, that I usually met with in the rest of my Life, where what
we commonly call the Fortune of this World, seemed continually to flee from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me. As God would have it, Count <hi>Feria,</hi> after some Months, made his escape,
and tho the King frequently promis'd me the same Sum of Ten thousand Crowns,
which was but my due Reward, yet never any thing at all came of it.</p>
               <p>XI. After this famous Action of the Battel of <hi>Avain,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who
had been declared Generalissimo of both the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Armies, and who
lay at that time above ten Leagues from us, was very much displeased that our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100923:107"/>
had presumed to engage without him. He was extremely concerned, that he had
no hand in so illustrious an Action, and could scarce forbear looking upon this Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
as his own loss. When our Troops therefore were come up, and we drew pretty
near his Army, the Mareschals of <hi>France</hi> thought it convenient to send me with their
Compliments to him, and acquaint him, That whenever his Excellence saw fit, he
should find all our Army in a readiness to receive him, and to pay him all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
due to his Character. They order'd me also, that if the Prince were coming
on towards them, I should leave him about a League from our Army, and return
full speed, to give them notice, that all the Generals and principal Officers might go
meet him. Commands were sent out at the same time to all the Soldiers and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
in the Army, to put themselves in the best condition, and make the gayest and
most splendid Appearance they could, as a mark of Honour to the Person whom they
owned as their Generalissimo, and then the whole Army was drawn out in form of
Battel.</p>
               <p>When I came to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> I complimented him in the Name of our
Generals, with all the Deference and Respect I could, and told him, how eager they
were to submit themselves to him, and to take care that the whole Army should pay
him the Honours and Respects due to their Generalissimo. But the Prince, who was
much dislatisfied at the Business of <hi>Avain,</hi> was at a stand what Answer to make, or
what to resolve upon. Observing him undetermined in himself, I began to grow
weary, and told him I waited his Highness's Answer to our Generals. Seeing me a
little urgent, he told me he would come to our Army, and at the same time gave Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for a Thousand of his own Horse, or thereabouts, to attend him to the place
where we lay. But he presently changed his mind, and by that time he had gone
about half a League, he told me, it was something with the latest to join our Army
that day, and he would put it off till the next. Then he began to open himself, and
express his concern for not being at the Battel; for he said to me, tho in a jesting man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
manner, <hi>Your Army has got itself great Renown, and I doubt not, triumphs much at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
for the noble Conquest they have gained. If they had staid, and taken our Assistance,
they would have had no cause to repent, or at least they would have tried whether the</hi> Dutch
<hi>be good Soldiers or not.</hi> I returned him a very respectful Answer, That our Army was
prest so hard by the Enemy, that we could not possibly decline engaging; but
that he, as our Generalissimo, had the greatest share both in the Action, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Day; That the <hi>French</hi> did not at all question the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Courage, and
this War was like enough to surnish them with a great many opportunities of signaliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves. Then I took my leave of his Excellence, and came back to our Generals,
who were very sorry the Prince was not pleased to come that day, because each single
person, and the whole Army in general, was then the most glorious, and in the best
condition to receive him, that ever they had been seen. But the matter was put off
only till the morrow, and his Excellence was then entertained with all Respects
that became us, and all the Ceremonies usual upon such occasions.</p>
               <p>XII. The two Armies marched asterwards to <hi>Tillemont;</hi> a Town that was made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
by the unfortunate manner of its being taken, and the Cruelties and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
in the sacking of it, such I cannot remember to this day without horror. it
was necesary first to possess our selves of the Suburbs, and I, being in the head of the
Forlorn Hope, had a great Ruffle with Monsieur <hi>Mottehoudenccur:</hi> For he seeing me
in the same Rank with himself, and very warm in pushing my advantage, and scaling
the Walls first, cryed out, <hi>Sir, Monsieur</hi> Pontis, <hi>You do not march in Order, I am Maistre
de Camp, and ought to go before you.</hi> I answer'd him without any disorder, <hi>Sir, Let every
one keep to the Post assigned him, keep you to yours, and I will endeavonr to make good mine.</hi>
My Answer was so far from satisfying him, that it put him into a mighty Passion.
He could not away with that Coldness and Resolution with which I spoke, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to swear a little, called out still louder, <hi>That if I did not stop, he should resent
the Affront.</hi> I answer'd smiling, <hi>That he would remember it for no other purpose, I believed,
than to love me the better for it, when we should both get honourably into the Town, and this
was all the Resentment the Honour of his Friendship would allow me to expect.</hi> But he did
not take what I said for a Jest, and as each of us were still pressing forward, when I
was getting up upon an advanced Work in form of a Bastion, and that he saw me
almost at the top, and like to rob him of the Honour he pretended to of scaling
first, he fell to calling out again, but more violently than before, <hi>That if I did not halt,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:100923:108"/>
he would fire upon me.</hi> It was really a good pleasant thing, to see us two parlying
and contending at this rate, for the credit of the Assault; one with all the indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of a Man in Raillery, and the other with all the fury of a Man out of his
wits with Passion. I was no more confounded at this last Compliment, than any of
the former; and told him with the same easiness I had done before, <hi>If I were not
very well acquainted with Monsieur</hi> Mottehoudencour, <hi>and his generous temper, there would
be some reason to apprehend what he threatned, but I was satisfied this was all in Jest. I am
going Sir,</hi> said I again, <hi>to make way for you, and to open a passage.</hi> With that I recover'd
the top of the Bastion, and the Enemy seeing themselves straitned on all sides, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
into the Town.</p>
               <p>When I was up, I perceiv'd my self just over against one of the Gates; and the
advantage of this Post put Monsieur <hi>Motteh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>dencour</hi> still more out of humor; for
he was forc'd to fetch a compass, and at last found himself in a Post not near so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
as mine. But I had a prophetick Spirit as it hapned, for our Quarrel that
begun with the Action, was very happily composed soon after, and how that was I
will now tell you. Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> having understood that there were several
Tan-fats very convenient to set Guards in, order'd me to go and observe them.
Thither I went in the midst of a deal of Fire and Smoke, and Musquet Bullets that
whistled about my Ears, but none of them did me any hurt. Having got to one of
these Tan-yards, I found it really very convenient for a Guard to be posted in; I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> of it, and told him at the same time, that it would not do
well to venture very many Men there, because if the Enemy should make a Sally,
they would be in great danger of being all knockt o'th' head.</p>
               <p>Monsieur <hi>Mottehoudencour</hi> hapned to be by, and being a little better humor'd, began
now to take his turn of laughing, and said pleasantly to me, <hi>I must own I was horribly
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>raged at thee even now. I thought if I had had thee in my Teeth, I could have crackt thy
Bones like Nuts. But come, to make us Friends, thou shalt carry me to see this Tan-yard;</hi>
which was said out of a gallantry, by no means fit for a person of his worth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
so guessing pretty well at his meaning, and thinking he would take it ill to
be refused, I told him briskly, <hi>That I would not make my peace with him upon such terms, as
carrying him to have his brains beat out; That this was a method of reconciliation fit for none
but an Enemy, and I did not take him for such; That there was no need for him to destroy
himself meerly for a humor.</hi> Mareschal <hi>Brezay,</hi> who was desirous to appear as full of
Courage as Monsieur <hi>Mottehoudencour,</hi> told me hereupon, <hi>That he had a mind to go too,
and I should carry them both thither.</hi> I was a little ashamed to see a Mareschal of <hi>France</hi>
value himself upon these gallantries, and judging all things to be better than an unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Bravado, I answer'd him with the same freedom I had used to Monsieur <hi>Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tehoudencour,
That I had forgot the way.</hi> He pretended to be angry, (tho probably he
would have had more reason to be so, if I had shew'd him the place we talk'd off;)
and told me, he took this really ill, and for one enemy before, I had now got two.
I answer'd him, without concerning my self much at his displeasure, that it did by no
means become a General, as he was, to cast away his life by way of Gallantry; that
young hot fellows only were priviledged to do such things, and that the meanest
Souldier in the whole Army had an interest in the safety of his General's person. Thus
all our difference was made up; he had his End, and I had mine; and after they had
both satisfied the little vanity they had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they thought themselves never the worse, that
they had not gratified it at their own cost.</p>
               <p>XIII. The Enemy finding themselves reduced to great Extremities, and not in a
condition to hold out against two such mighty Armies, chose not to stand the shock
of a general Assault, but sallied out of a Back-gate that was not invested, and so
made their Escape. Notice of this was brought to Mareschal <hi>Brezay,</hi> who order'd
that they should suffer the Garison to go off, and so make themselves Masters of the
Town. I drew his Regiment up against the Gate, having first with great difficulty
beaten down the Draw-bridge. But finding this Gate barricado'd on the inside, and
that there was no way to clear it, but by going in, I order'd the Soldiers next the Gate
to stand very close together, and getting up upon their shoulders, with a Soldier that
had a Hatchet, I put him in through one of the Holes where the Beams that supported
the Draw-bridge came through. I had a mind to go in after him, but it hapned that just
then the Souldiers stood a little wider, so that I fell down among them, and had
like to have been stifled. I got up again however, as I nimbly as I could, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100923:108"/>
able to draw my Shoes after me, I went in by the same Hole without them, and
got the Gate broke open, so that all our Regiment, and the whole Army came in at it.</p>
               <p>It was agreed upon with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> before, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> should not enter
the Town, because of the violence and outrage that Hereticks use to be guilty of.
And the Mareschal <hi>de Brezay,</hi> designing to prevent any disorder, dispatcht me imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
with about twenty Souldiers, to seeure a Convent of Nuns. Here I found a
great deal of Scarlet Cloath, and other commodities of great value, which had been
brought and laid up there, as in a place of security; but knowing very well how
rude and undistinguishing Souldiers are in War, I told the good Nuns, that they took
the ready course to have their Convent plundered; That I advis'd them not to stay
there any longer, and if the Troops came that way, it might not be in my power to
prevent their being ransackt. They answer'd me, in great terror and distraction, <hi>Ah,
Sir! save our Lives, and our Honour; alas! we know not whither to go, nor what to do.</hi> I
promis'd them to do the best I could; but own'd to them freely at the same time, that
I saw no great safety for them there.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Souldiers, upon some discontent for a
summ of Money due from the Town of <hi>Tillemont,</hi> broke in among the rest, contrary
to the agreement. These wretches spread themselves in an instant through all parts
of the Town, plundered, and murdered Priests and Monks with the greatest cruelty
imaginable. And the Nunnery that I guarded being a large one, there presently
swarmed thither some <hi>Hollanders,</hi> some <hi>Cravats,</hi> some <hi>French,</hi> all as mad as Devils, and
grown void of all sence of God, Religion, or Reason. I opposed them as long as I
could with the few Souldiers I had, and bore up against this crowd of Madmen, till
at last having burst the Gates, they throng'd in, and fell upon our Guard, some of
whom were wounded, and the rest fled. For my own part, as I was defending my
self still with my Sword, resolving to dye upon the spot, rather than expose so many
poor Virgins to their rudeness and violence; one of the Officers, a greater brute
than the common Souldiers, endeavoured to cleave me down the middle with his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and let fly a blow at me with his full strength, and he had infallibly done it, if I
had not broke the force of the blow with my Sword, which was broke short in two
by it. Then finding that I was defenceless, they threw themselves upon me, snatcht
that piece of my Sword that I had left out of my hand, cut off my Belt, and away
they carried it. I threatned to complain of them to his Excellence, which gave them
some little check; and so giving me my life, they satisfy'd themselves with thrusting
me out of the Convent. Then finding no opposition, they broke all the Gates,
spoil'd all that came near them, massacred all the Nuns they met, stole all the rich
goods I spoke of, and made such a confusion as is not possible for me to describe. It
was an unspeakable grief to me, to see one of these poor Nuns, that ran about di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted,
with a Knife stuck in her head, and wept, and cry'd out, <hi>Ah Gentlemen, pray
save my Life.</hi> I could with all my heart have ventur'd my own life to save hers, but
I was disarm'd, and at distance, or if I had not I could never have done any good
against so great a multitude.</p>
               <p>Meeting the Collonel afterwards, with whom I was acquainted, I began to call out
to him in a great passion, <hi>Oh Sir, is this the order you observe in War? After I had by our
Generals order brought a guard hither to defend this place, do you allow these Rascals to come fall
upon us, and knock us o'th' head as if we were Enemies; to disarm me by violence, and plunder
and tear all to pieces in a Religious house, which the Generals have taken into their protection?
What would you have me do?</hi> said he, <hi>They are these devilish</hi> Cravats, <hi>that are worse than
so many wild Beasts. Pray go yonder,</hi> said I, <hi>and lay about you with your Cane: Scatter these
Villains, that have taken away my arms, and had like to have kill'd me.</hi> He answer'd me,
That being flesht as they were now, they would kill him too, if he should go amongst
them; and that he could not imagine how I got out of their hands without being cut
to pieces. This was no satisfaction to me however, and I was enraged to see my self
so ill us'd, and that a Collonel could not make his Souldiers obey him. I went then
immediately to look Mareschal <hi>Brezay,</hi> being quite out of my wits, and my very Eyes
sparkling with anger. There I make my complaint, That his authority was slighted,
that I had like to have had my brains beat out at the Convent he sent me to secure;
that they had plunder'd all with the extremest rage and rapine; and there was no
more perswading these Robbers to reason, than mad hungry Wolves. The Mareschal
was very angry at this baseness, and drew a part of the Army behind the Convent,
and securing this place, gave six or seven Nuns opportunity to escape, who fled to
him for refuge, being got away by the back door.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:100923:109"/>
Some two or three days after, being among some of the Officers of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and going to the Kings quarter, I happen'd to meet with that Rogue of an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
that used me so scurvily. I quickly knew my Gentleman, for my concern for such
base usage had given me a very lively Idea of his face, and I could not possibly forget
him: So I went up to him, and in a rage said, <hi>Oh you pitiful Rascal, you are the Rogue
that abused me so the other day; give me my Sword and Belt.</hi> Upon this, he went to lay
his hand upon his Sword, but I presently leapt to him, and caught him by the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and holding the butt-end of my Pistol to his head, I told him, that if he did not
give me my Sword and Belt immediately, I would break his head. He had no mind
to try me, because he saw I was in a passion, and being confounded, he was forc'd to
give me what I required. Then I took him by the Arm, and with the same resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and authority that I would have spoken to a Common Souldier, said to him, <hi>Thou
art no better than a Villain, and I will have thee hang'd instantly, for the outrage thou hast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
contrary to the Generals express orders.</hi> The poor fellow stood so confounded at
my talking so boldly to him, that he thought he came off well with asking my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and promising me to restore my own Sword and Belt, which he had not then
about him, but had instead of it given me his own. He made me a present besides,
of a Silver Powder-box gilt, and a string of Gold twist, that tyed like a Bandelier,
to appease me. He richly deserv'd hanging indeed, for the ravage and horrible bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities,
which both he committed himself, and his Souldiers by his order. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
he was not under my jurisdiction, and besides, that he belong'd to the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Army, I was content for my part to take up with the satisfaction he
made me, besides my Sword and Belt, which he sent me home afterwards. But his
Excellence being complained to by Mareschal <hi>Brezay,</hi> threatned him in my hearing to
hang him and his Companions, as they very well deservd. But whether he was as
good as his word to him, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>XIV. The two Armies parted at their drawing off from <hi>Tillemont;</hi> the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi>'s went toward <hi>Brussels,</hi> as if intending to sit down before that place; and the
<hi>French</hi> Army to <hi>Louvain.</hi> They made a halt for some time in the Country between
<hi>Tillemont, Louvain,</hi> and <hi>Brussels.</hi> But as the <hi>French</hi> went off for <hi>Louvain,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hew'd themselves in the Rear of them. Mareschal <hi>Brezay,</hi> surpriz'd to see them so
nigh, order'd me to draw three Regiments into an enclosure, to stop the Enemies
march. I did it presently, and posted our men very conveniently, both to cover our Army,
and defend our selves from any that should attack us. In this encounter I had like to have
lost part of my Baggage, by the breaking of a Waggon-wheel, when the Enemy were
within six or seven hundred paces of us. But running strait to the Ordnance, I bought
another for forty Livres, and brought it to supply the place of the broken one; so that
I gain'd time enough to get this Waggon off. Our three Regiments being posted in
the enclosure I mention'd, the Enemy fell in upon us, and there was a sharp skirmish
on both sides. The whole Army in the mean while retreated fighting, being too
weak to stand a pitcht Battel, and they marcht at a great rate, which made our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
begin to grumble, who cry'd out, that I brought them thither to be murder'd.
I answer'd, that I look'd for the Generals orders every minute; that I could not quit
that post of my own head; and if the danger was great for them, it was no less for
me too.</p>
               <p>We had not been long in this perplexity, before Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> sent me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
to bring my men off, and joyn him as quick as I could. The Enemy skirmisht
upon us in the Rear, and when we and the whole Army were come up to a little
Village, they made a very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>risk push upon us, and oblig'd us to leave the Village,
and retreat still fighting; till at last, having recover'd a very narrow pass, we fac'd
about, and fought upon equal terms. The Enemies having now lost all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
which their numbers gave them before, thought it the wisest course to wheel
off, and go charge the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Rear. But they could not recover him, for
he had march'd all night, and put his Troops under covert.</p>
               <p>XV. Then the two Confederate Armies joyn'd again, and went to form the Siege
of <hi>Louvain</hi> with united force. It was my fortune to stay at this Siege but ten or
twelve days, for a reason that I shall give presently, and therefore I can give no very
particular account of it. Only I happen'd, by way of Gallantry, to quarrel with two
of our Generals, meerly for bringing them off from a danger they expos'd themselves
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100923:109"/>
to, out of a pure bravado, and where they would have thrown away their lives very
foolishly. Mareschal <hi>Brezay,</hi> and the Great Master <hi>de la Melleray,</hi> being gone up to
the top of a Retrenchment in a meer brag, I came behind Monsieur <hi>Melleray,</hi> took
him up in my arms about the waste, and carried him quite to the bottom of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment;
the same I did to Mareschal <hi>Brezay,</hi> and both so quick, that they neither
of them had time to think where they were, and then told them with the freedom
they allowed me to use with them; <hi>These are pleasant Gallantries indeed, that must cost us all
our lives; if the Generals be taken off, who must command the Army? and what will become of
the inferiour Officers and common Souldiers?</hi> The two Gentlemen, in the greatest surprize
imaginable, lookt upon one another, and laying their hands upon their Swords, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to run after me to revenge this affront. But I, who had no mind to give them
any occasion of doing any thing out of season, and which they would have been sorry
for, after I had done them so good service, set to running as fast as I could, for fear
the jest should be carried too far. I was satisfy'd that in their hearts they were well
enough pleased to see themselves brought off from a danger, which nothing but a vain
emulation had put them upon tempting. And when they saw me run away at that
rate, they were well contented to be out-run, and stood still. However I did not
care to come into their presence quickly, to make the matter look better, and in
shew, at least to return their pretences of offering to do me a mischief.</p>
               <p>A little while after I received a Musquet-shot in the Trenches, it was in the Arm,
and did me no great hurt; but when Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> heard I was wounded, he
pretended to be very angry at me, and said, it was no great matter if I were kill'd,
I am sure he did not think so, for presently after he sent his own Chyrurgeon to take
care of me, and when I went with my Arm in a Scarf to return him thanks for it,
I could not forbear owning to him again, that I was so far from being sorry for what
I had done to them, that I thought it was the best course I could take of expressing
my honour and value for them, to prevent such desperate venturesome actions, as
might very well lose the whole Army. I am amazed indeed, that such great men
should be guilty of these follies, as if a General had no other way to shew his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
but by these kind of tricks, fitter for young fool-hardy Souldiers than for Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
even those of the least quality or consideration; whose lives the King hath a
greater interest in than the person himself, and therefore they ought to be made the
best of, for his service, and the safety of those under their command, and not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishly
squandered away upon every ridiculous vanity, and for meer ostentation.</p>
               <p>XVI. I told you I continued but a little while before <hi>Louvain.</hi> For Mareschal
<hi>Brezay</hi> being in some distress for want of Hay and Forrage for his Horse, gave me in
command to go force the Castle of <hi>Arscet,</hi> about eight or nine leagues distant
from <hi>Louvain:</hi> where there was a great quantity of provisions of all sorts, both for
man and beast. For this undertaking he appointed me twenty Waggons, and about
four hundred Musqueteers; and with these I marched by night up to this Castle,
which was hemm'd in on all sides with very wide Ditches, and desended by a strong
Garrison. I found means to bring my men up to the Gate, some by Boats, and some
by wading up to the middle upon the rubbish of the Bridge that was broken down.
Then with great Levers I forc'd the Gate, and when we had made our way in, after
two or three hours dispute, the Garrison were constrained to retire into a Tower,
and from thence they capitulated with us. I immediately loaded the Waggons that
came with me with Hay and Oats, and sent them to Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> with a message,
that if he would send me the Carriages of the Ordnance, there was store enough to
load five hundred of them, with Wheat and Hay, and Oats, and Barley, and other
provisions: For there were vast Granaries in this Castle, and all full, because the
whole wealth of all the Country thereabouts had been brought in, and laid up there.
Then I began to contrive how I should fortify and barricado my self up, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of my self and our Corn; and Monsieur <hi>Brezay</hi> having sent a fresh supply of
Waggons to a very great number, I return'd them back to him all laden as before,
which was a very seasonable refreshment to our Generals, and their Attendants.</p>
               <p>XVII. At this time there happened a warm dispute between the Marquis of <hi>S.</hi> who
is now Mareschal of <hi>France,</hi> and me. He had a mind to share with me, when he
saw what quantity of forrage and provisions I sent to the Army, and coming with his
Company to the Castle where I was, would fain have been at dividing the spoil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:100923:110"/>
There had been no good understanding between us before; because once, when I
was to appoint quarters, I had ordered a house for him, where he had room enough,

                  </gap>age, but little convenience of Kitchin or Cellar, because the
Master of the house was not at home. This put him in a passion, and provok'd him
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eproach me, by saying, That I took very good care to assign him a dry lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ging.
When he was come then near the Castle of <hi>Arscot,</hi> which, as I said, was begirt
round with large Moars full of water, he sent to speak with me. I went out to him,
but kept a barrier between us, and five and twenty, or thirty Musqueteers, who were
to give fire if he had offered the least violence. Then the Marquis began to give me
joy of my successful attempt; and told me very civilly, that he was come to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd
to me, and that he acknowledg'd the difference between us to have proc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eded
from a fault in him, and a little heat of youth. I perceiving very well that these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments
were strain'd, and designed to serve a turn, answer'd him with some indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
That I was very glad for his sake, he own'd himself in the wrong. Tho my
answer was not very agreeable to him, yet he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st that by, and at last fell upon the
matter, that was the true bottom of all his compliments: He desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed to come in,
and have some loading of forrage. I told him, I could dispose of nothing in that
Castle without an order from the Generals, for they had sent me thither, and all that
was there belong'd to them; nor could I suffer him and his Company to come in,
without their positive command; but if he pleas'd to come in single, the Gate should
be open'd to him alone.</p>
               <p>He presently began to change his note, and told me, with an Oath, I spoke like a
Prince, and a King. Then he threatned me to enter the place by st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ength of arms,
and make himself way with his Sword. The hotter he grew, the more coldness I
put on; and without any concern I told him, I would not advise him to that method,
for if he stirr'd, I would order my men to fire upon him without delay. The even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of temper with which I answered his blustering, surpriz'd him, and he reply'd,
<hi>Thou art as cold as a Well rope, and yet thou threatnest to kill me.</hi> I told him, I did my
duty without passion. At last he took the safest course, and withd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ew, tho still talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
big, which I was not in the least disturb'd at. But app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ehending however, that
he might complain to Mareschal <hi>Brezay,</hi> and preposses him against me, I immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
writ to him, and gave an exact account of all that had past between us. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> when
the Marquis went to make his complaints to him, and among other things to my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage,
told him, that I guarded the Castle so ill, that he could easi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y have sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
it, if he had had any such design. The Mareschal, who understood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement,
and the true reason of his complaint, by my Letter, told him freely, that
he gave no great credit to what he said, and thought me more careful than that came
to. He writ back to me by the same Messenger, and in his Letter was pleas'd to
commend what I had done, in refusing to admit the Marquis, and denying him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
With this he sent me a positive order in the Kings name, to receive no person
whatsoever into the Castle, nor give out any forrage, except the party brought an
order, either under the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s hand, or Mareschal <hi>Chatillon</hi>'s, or his own.</p>
               <p>The Marquis, who knew nothing of Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi>'s answer, nor this fresh order,
came a second time to the Castle, and told me, that he had spoke with Mareschal
<hi>Brezay,</hi> and that he was displeased at my carriage to him; he told me moreover, that
unless I would rebel against the General's order, I must open to him instantly. This
last was what I expected, and therefore presently taking the Letter out of my pocket,
I shewed it him at a distance. and said aloud; <hi>Here's one can tell me Marcschal</hi> Brezay's
<hi>mind better than the Marquis of</hi> S. <hi>Here you may see how he commands me to open the Gate,
for be commends me for not opening to you the other day, and forbids me in the King's name to
admit any body, without shewing a particular order from our Generals. Therefore, Sir,</hi> said I,
<hi>let me see your order, and every Gate here shall be opened to you.</hi> The Marquis was in a strange
confusion to see himself so shamefully disproved, by the very person whose Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
be pretended to; and went away in a rage, without any other satisfaction, than
that of saying several rude things against Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> and me.</p>
               <p>XVIII. I was not so fortunate however afterwards, as I promis'd my self from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
possest of this Castle. But, according to my old fate, what would in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
have made another man's fortunes, to me turned to no manner of acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>unt. The
misunderstanding there was between the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and our Generals, hindered
our success against <hi>Louvain,</hi> and it was agreed to raise the Siege. Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:100923:110"/>
sent me about twenty Waggons, with a detachment of some Companies commanded
by the Lieutenants, and told me, that the Siege being now upon raising, he would
have me load those Waggons with Wheat, and Hay, and Oats, and leave those
Officers that brought those Companies in the Castle, and return to the Camp with
the Troops under my command. This news I confess was a great surprize to me, for
I took it for granted <hi>Louvain</hi> would be taken, and then the Castle of <hi>Arscot,</hi> that I
had taken such pains to keep, would fall to my share, with a good part of the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables
that were brought in thither, and lay in Chests, which I had been very tender
of all along, looking upon them as my own, and not caring to break them open till
all was over. But I reckon'd without my host; and all my diligence in preserving
them was these Officers gain, who as soon as ever they got my place, broke open all,
and furnisht themselves at the expence of them to whom these goods belon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed. I
went away much dissatisfy'd, after having loaded the Waggons Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> sent
with all the speed I could, and put them under a Convoy of the four hundred Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers,
whom I carried back to the Army.</p>
               <p>Some leagues from thence we discover'd a party of four or five hundred of the
Enemies Horse, that seem'd at some distance from us, and came cross us to cut off
our passage. At first we gave our selves for lost, and took it for granted, considering
that we were in a plain, which gave the Horse a great advantage against us, that
there was no remedy but we must be cut to pieces. But the Guide put me a little
into heart, for he told me, that a little further there was a narrow pass upon a rising
ground, where we might put our selves under cover of some Woods; and that if
we made the best of our way, we were time enough to recover the place, before the
Enemy got up to us, who must of necessity fetch a compass by reason of a Ditch that
lay in their way. I immediately drew my men into form of battel, and as I us'd to
do, hemm'd them in with the Waggons, ordering some of them to get up into the
Carriages. Then we whipt on the Horses, and putting on apace, came up to the
place I spoke of, and there were met and attackt by the Enemies Horse. I ordered
our men to halt, and exhorted them to behave themselves well, and make a general
fire upon the first that came up. I must own, I never was better observ'd in my life,
and that Enemies were never more briskly entertained. For immediately they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
so bravely upon the first Assailants, that a great many of them were laid
dead upon the spot, and so cool'd their courage for a second attempt. So the rest
that were wiser went off, though much fewer than they came, and left us to keep on
our way without more d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nger or disturbance.</p>
               <p>By this time Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> had intimation, that some Squadrons of Horse had
met with me, and concluding we were all destroyed, he began to be very angry at
me, and laid all at my door, supposing I came out too late, and had spent time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonably,
in staying to enrich my self with the booty of the Castle. In this ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
I found him at my arrival, but when he understood we had sustained no loss,
and all was safe, he chang'd presently from a deep malancholy, into an extreme good
humour, and told me with some degree of amazement, that he could not imagine
which way we could bring our selves off. I gave him a relation of the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but at the same time exprest my dissatisfaction, that the King's men should be expos'd to such hazards, and all for a little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orrage.</p>
               <p>XIX. The Siege was rais'd quickly after, and the Army was sent for good quarters
towards <hi>Ruremond,</hi> but indeed we fell into very bad ones. This being a sandy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
there happened so violent a storm, and such mighty hurricanes, that for five or
six days together we breathed nothing but Sand, instead of pure Air. Five or six
thousand men were presently choak'd with it, or else died in a little while by distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers

                  </gap>est to me a great
desire to go back into <hi>France,</hi> for he was sure he should dye of want and sickness in that Country. With much ado I got him dismist, for he belong'd to our Army, and
Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> had orders to let no body return into <hi>France.</hi> The sickness, and
wretched condition he was in, having forc'd him to leave the service, I was very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
with the Mareschal that he might go home, who did not know how to
deny me for this man, what he granted scarce to any body; so I sent him away, and
let him have fifty Crowns to bear his charges. But tho he hath recovered himself
since, and lives very well, yet he made it appear, that the greatest kindnesses are but
little acknowledged; and that a false notion of honour tempts men wilfully to forget
obligations, which they are asham'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o remember. For he never came near me, so
much as to thank me, for six whole years, nay he took all occasions of avoiding my
company; and it was above nine years before he paid me what I had lent him, to
redeem him out of his misfortunes.</p>
               <p>XX. While our Army lay sick in <hi>Holland,</hi> I lost and found again a very valuable
Horse, and the best I was then Master of, after a very odd manner. Some body
having taken occasion to steal him from me in the very Camp, some days after he
was gone I met a Gentleman mounted upon a Horse exactly like mine. I presently
told him without more ado, that the Horse was mine, and enquir'd whom he had
bought him of. He answer'd me very frankly, That might very well be, for he had
him dog-cheap of a Souldier, that sold him for three Pistoles, and that for the same
Money he was at my service. I gave him the Money accordingly, and took the
Horse which I thought mine, but really was not so. Some time after, as I was
speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very loud, and calling to some body in the Camp, my true Horse, that was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
and having been long used to me, knew my voice, began presently to neigh
and whinny exceedingly, as if he had a mind to let people know, that he heard his
Master's voice. I was as well acquainted with his whinny too; and sent a Servant to
the place where I heard him, to see if I was no mistaken. He knew my Horse
again, and came back to give me an account of it. Whereupon enquiring out the man
that had him in keeping, I forced him, tho with some difficulty, to restore him to
me. So after a little while I had got both my own Horse, and his likeness. But it
was not long neither before this latter, by a good pleasant adventure, found his own
Master too. For the Officer whose really he was, meeting me one day upon his
Horse, challenged him, and made me the very same compliment, that I should have
done in his circumstances, That that Horse belonged to him: And to confirm it, he
gave me an undeniable token, which was, that we should find at the bottom of one
of his feet a piece of green cloth in the shape of a Plaister, which was laid there for a
hurt he had got on that foot. We found the matter even so. He gave me a Case
of Pistols, and I let him have his again. And thus by these two odd accidents, those
that possest what they had no right to, were dispossest again, and the two Horses were both return'd to their true owners.</p>

<hi>Orange</hi> was resolved to retake it, and to this purpose marched both the Armies toward
that Fort. Then it was that I began to have very free access to the Prince, and (if
it be not too much presumption to call it so) a particular intimacy with his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; for with such he was pleased to honour me, and that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pned upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
He was desirous to know the Officers of our Army, and their Names, and
therefore contrived that they should come in order into a Hall where he was. I, as
the rest, went in my turn, and Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> having been so kind to mention me
to him formerly much to my advantage; and having likewise the honour to be known
to him, by my being deputed from our Generals, to express the Army's zeal to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him as their Generalissimo, he did me the favour to discourse with me some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more particularly than the rest, when I came to make my reverence to him. He
asked me several Questions about the War, in which I gave him the best satisfaction
I could; and at last put it to me, whether, if he should have occasion to use them, I
could furnish him with three or fourscore stout Musqueteers that had their Arms in
good case. I answer'd, because I knew I could make my word good, that I could sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply him not only with fourscore, but a hundred, or two, or three hundred, if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to command them. That I durst be very confident, there was never a Regiment
in the whole Army that kept their Arms so well, and so bright as ours, (which was
Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi>'s) and that it was made up of very gallant Fellows. The Prince
then asked me, what course I took with our Souldiers to make them keep their Arms
clean, and in so good case, even when the Army was upon the march; an I told him,
that whenever we came to any Village where there dwelt a Gunsmith, I always took
care to have all the Arms of the Regiment well scowred.</p>
               <p>This Conference with the Prince, in which he did me the honour to discourse me
upon several Subjects, brought me so far into his favour, that he exprest an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
kindness for me; insomuch that at my going away, as I was taking leave to
make room for another, he bad me give him my hand. I in respect refused that, and
offer'd to kiss the Prince's; but he would have no denial, but took my hand, and
laid his own upon it, with this familiar expression, <hi>I have a mind to be your Friend, and
would have you be mine. You have given me better satisfaction than any body; I am very
well pleased with you, for I love People that talk to me freely, as you I perc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Ever after that time, whenever the Prince saw me, he would c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> honouring me
so highly, as to walk with me a good while together. I soon imagin'd, that all this
was meant to draw me over to his service, for Princes do not use to be so extremely
obliging for nothing. And afterwards he told me, <hi>That if I would stay with him in</hi>
Holland, <hi>he would use me like a Friend.</hi> This was something extraordinary for a Prince
to say; and I suppose the thing he chiefly expected from me, was my fidelity to the
person I se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

offer, though in truth long experience at Court had taught me, how little such friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
of great Men are to be depended upon. Therefore I exprest my self with all
manner of gratitude and submission, but at the same time told him, <hi>I was engaged in
the</hi> French <hi>Service, and not inclined to quit that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However this particular grace of the Prince created me great envy, every one

frequently took delight to prefer me above others. Which, to speak freely, I cannot

                  </gap>ks, should be tender of them whom
he honours with his Favour, and not expose them to the ill will of their acquaintance,
by extravagant Commendations. But on the other hand, it is very injurious to fall
foul upon them that are innocent, for such a miscarriage. For if a Prince be either
prepossest in one's Favor, or think one Man really deserve to be valued more than
others, when the person so valued does nothing but his duty, he is not to be blamed.
And those that are less regarded, do very unjustly, if they take occassion from hence
to hate him. Even Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> telling me, <hi>He could not tell how I had got the
Prince of</hi> Orange<hi>'s Affections.</hi> I answer'd him roundly, but fully, <hi>I have done nothing to
him, Sir, but what I do to you every day; that is, endeavouring by the discharge of my duty, to
give you both satisfaction; and if he honour me with his Favour, this is an Argument of his
generous Nature, which inclines him to love them that are zealous in his Service.</hi> He ret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ed
upon me, <hi>Well, be sure you keep firm to your duty, for I my self would snatch you out of the
Prince of</hi> Orange<hi>'s Arms.</hi> Whereupon I made him this hearty, but respectful An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<hi>Sir, you are my General, and my particular Patron, and, next to the King, you shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
command me. I have too just a sense of your Favours, to return them with Ingratitude,
and that is a thing I can never do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was much surprized afterwards, to see a great Carriage and six Horses brought
me, as a Present from the States, to convey my Baggage. The Prince had procur'd it
for me, as a mark of his Favour, and it was maintained at the States charge, without
costing me a Penny. It came indeed very seasonably, for two of my Horses were
shoulder-slipt, and my Carriage was left behind. And again, when we were come to
the Fort at Schinck, the States provided me a Boat at their own expence, all the time
I continued there.</p>
               <p>II. The Siege was formed against this Fort about the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> in
the same year 1635; and at this Siege it was, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had a mind
to try whether I was a Man of my word. For, having laid a secret design against
the place, he desired of me that I would supply him out of hand with two hundred
Musqueteers, such as he had ask'd me for, and I did so. His Attempt was discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and prevented, but he profest himself as well satisfied, as if it had taken effect.
I cannot recollect any thing very remarkable that happen'd in this Siege. Only the
Cardinal Infant was bravely repuls'd, who came with his Army to the Relief of the
Besieged; for there was an Agreement before, between the <hi>French and Dutch,</hi> that
they should carry on the Siege, and the <hi>French</hi> should only concern themselves with
keeping off the Enemy; which they acquitted themselves of very bravely, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them to retire, without doing any thing to purpose. When Winter came on,
the <hi>French</hi> Army went into Quarters in the Canton assign'd them, and the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> left Count <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Nassan</hi> to carry on the Siege, who took the Fort by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation,
about the end of <hi>April</hi> the next Spring, that is, after about some eight
Months Siege in all. Our Regiment was distributed among four several Towns, and
in each of those I had Quarters; but I spent most part of the Winter with the
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> at the <hi>Hague.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. The King mean while was graciously pleased to think of me, though I was at
a distance from him, and gave me a Command of Captain in the Guards. The truth
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:100923:112"/>
is, after having been so long in his service, I had some title to expect such a reward.

might be of some importance to me.</p>
               <p>Monsieur <hi>de Ch.</hi> the Kings Embassadour in <hi>Holland,</hi> having receiv'd the Pacquet
from Court, and (as he us'd to do) open'd the Letters; when he saw the King had
bestow'd this Command upon me, dealt very unfaithfully with me. He was desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to take this opportunity of advancing his own Nephew, and to keep me in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

might discourse Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> upon those designs of his, and get the Command,
the King had laid out for me, for his pains. But his Nephew lost his labour, for
the King answer'd them with more resolution than was common to him, that he had
dispos'd of that Command before<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Still I labour'd hard to be dismist, for Monsieur
<hi>Boulogne</hi>'s Letter made me very eager of returning to <hi>France;</hi> and besides all that, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
began to grow low with me. But, whether through some private opposition
from the Cardin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l, or some underhand correspondence between the Ambassadour
and our Generals, to obstruct my return, I could never get leave to go, and was
forc'd, sore against my will, and contrary to the Kings express command, to stay in
that Country all winter. So the King not having (if I may so say) authority enough
to procure my return, tho he heartily desir'd it, dispos'd of that Command to another
person, after having staid for me several months.</p>
               <p>IV. About the beginning of Spring the next year 1636, we took Shipping, and
when I waited on the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to take my leave of him, he exprest some
concern, that I refus'd to stay with him, after so many kind offers as he had made me.
But knowing that that very constancy he esteem'd me for, was the thing that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
it, he profest himself well pleas'd with my conduct. <hi>And if you would have me,</hi>
(said he) <hi>I will write to the King in your behalf, and signifie your good services to him.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
him great respect, That being the <hi>French</hi> Kings natural Subject, I was engag'd
to attend his service; but nothing could ever make me forget the many marks of
grace and kindness that I had receiv'd from his Highness: that I had a more grateful
sense of the honour he had done me in approving my service, than was possible for
me to express; and that if he would condescend to honour me yet more with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
to the King, this would be an exceeding addition to all his former
favours.</p>
               <p>V. When we were come into <hi>France,</hi> our Army quartered for some time in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy;</hi>
but shortly we received fresh orders to joyn the Count <hi>de Soissons,</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal
<hi>Brezay</hi> at <hi>la Fere.</hi> Thither I went with our Regiment, and being extremely
harrass'd, I went into a Granary, and there laid me down to sleep; which happened
very luckily upon a double account, for by that means I not only refresht my self,
but escap'd a great danger. The Enemies lying in that Country with a powerful
Army of forty thousand men, under the Command of Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the two
famous Generals <hi>Piccolomini and John of Werth,</hi> plunder'd and seiz'd several Towns, and
all fell before them. There had not been known so general a consternation in <hi>France</hi>
of a long time; and the power of <hi>Spain</hi> had then got such a mighty ascendant over us,
that it lookt like fool-hardiness to pretend to oppose it. We apprehended they had
a design to besiege <hi>Cat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Soissons</hi> intending to send me thither,
made great enquiry after me. Mareschal <hi>Brezay,</hi> who knew well enough where I
was, shew'd great tenderness for my safety upon this occasion; and being of opinion,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:100923:113"/>
that to send me to a place which could not possibly hold out against so great a force,
was manifestly to expose me, he would not own that he knew any thing of me. And
there in all probability I must have been lost, for not being of a temper to surrender
tamely, I should have been likely enough to expose the place to have been taken by
storm. When great search had been made for me to no purpose, another was sent
thither in my stead. And the Enemy sitting down before the place in <hi>July</hi> 1636,
quickly made themselves Masters of it.</p>
               <p>VI. From <hi>la Fere</hi> our Army moved to <hi>Bray,</hi> to prevent the Enemies crossing the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Every one fortify'd himself in his post the best he could: For my own part,
throwing off my Doublet, I workt so hard with the rest of the Officers and Souldiers
of our Regiment, that in four hours time we entrencht our selves so conveniently in
a meadow on this side the River, and over against a hill, which the Enemies must
come down, that we lay quite under their Cannon. I had also contriv'd to have a
great many Stakes driven down in the River, to hinder their Horse from getting over.
Afterwards I discover'd a man at some distance trying the Ford, and went presently
to tell the person who commanded the Regiment of <hi>Champagn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> that he should put
himself in a readiness, and might expect a sharp bout quickly; because their post
was less convenient, and lay more open than ours. At the same time I ran to Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
<hi>Brezay</hi> to inform him, and receive his commands: But he was in such a perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that he knew not what orders to give. I was a little surpriz'd to hear him say, <hi>Make
good your own post as well as you can;</hi> for they were all at their wits end; and I am sure this
coufnsion in the Generals, was likely to discourage the Souldiers, as much as their dread
of the <hi>Spanish</hi> forces. The Enemies began to shew themselves, and having planted four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
pieces of Cannon upon the hill, play'd them upon our Regiment, but it was all
noise and smoak, without any great matter of execution. For we lying intrench'd at
the foot of the Hill, and as it were stuck down into the ground, the Bullets flew over
our heads, and could do us no mischief. Whereas we on the other side had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to fire upon them without being seen, and gall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d them terribly. So not being
able to force this quarter, they remov'd their Cannon to fall upon the Regiment of
<hi>Champagne,</hi> which indeed they tore horribly, because they lay a great deal more
exposed.</p>
               <p>Our Generals, seeing themselves prest in this part, gave order for the Army to
march, and retreat to <hi>Nesle;</hi> for there was no likelihood of standing it out, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Enemies had a strange advantage over us, by I know not what terror that had
seiz'd all our men. It was their intent to repose the Army in this Village, but I
told the Count <hi>de Soissons,</hi> I had been informed that there was a great Morass behind
it, and if the Enemy should follow hard upon us, we might endanger part of our
Troops by so long a defile. Upon this advice, tho they had begun to work upon the
Trenches, yet it was resolv'd the Army should make no stop, till we were got be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
this Morass. As the Count of <hi>Soissons</hi> was set at Table, where he did me the
honour to set me with him, we had all on a sudden news brought, that the Enemy
were come up a great way towards us, that our Out-guards were beaten from their
Post, and the Forlorn-hope in danger to be all cut in pieces. They were about two
thousand Horse detach'd from their Army, and bore forward to charge ours in the
Flank. Then every one hur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ying to Horse ran to the attack; but we found our
men broken. So we were forc'd to retreat fighting, and try to secure our Army at
<hi>Noyon.</hi> The Enemies were much exalted with so much good success, and our mens
hearts fail'd them sadly, who had only just so much strength left, as would serve them
to make off. The <hi>Spanish</hi> Generals seeing the Count <hi>de Soissons</hi> too weak to stand
against them, and withdrawn with the Army to <hi>Noyon,</hi> went to lay siege to <hi>Corlie,</hi>
resolv'd to force a passage farther into <hi>France,</hi> and to follow their blow as far as they
could.</p>
               <p>VII. Some time after this, the King being at <hi>Chantilly,</hi> sent me his commands to
wait upon him as soon as I could. His Majesty having never seen me since my
Journey into <hi>Holland,</hi> asked me a great many questions, and enquired after the news
of that Country; and, after I had told him the principal matters, he discours'd me
particularly about the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and gave me sufficient intimation, that either
the Prince had writ, or some body from him had spoke in my favour. For he
ask'd what charms I had used to insinuate my self so far into his affections. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:100923:113"/>
being well aware of the King's jealous temper, and that this might incline
him to suspect this mighty confidence, I answer'd him with the same freedom I had
done Mareschal <hi>Brezay,</hi> That I had used no other arts but the faithful performance of
my duty, and that I was much beholden to his Excellence for valuing my services
that his Majesty had commanded me to pay him. At last the King asked me, why I
did not come sooner, after that Letter he had sent me? I told him I never received
any such Letter from him, and that when I ask'd leave it was denied me, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that my presence there was necessary. His Majesty not caring to open his
meaning any farther, nor to tell me his design of making me Captain in his Regiment
of Guards, only reply'd, that I was certainly the unluckiest fellow in the world, and
never had any fortune. I, knowing nothing of the matter, could not make him any
answer, tho it were easy to have replyed, that my fortune was in his disposal, and
he might make me happy whenever he pleased. Just then I happen'd to take notice
of a Half-moon that they had made before the Castle gate, and could not forbear
smiling. The King perceiv'd it, and ask'd me what I laught at? I told him, That
it was my humble request to his Majesty, that that Half-moon might be taken down,
and not stand there for a reproach to <hi>France;</hi> as if the person of so great a Prince
could not be safe, without such a Fortification as that was.</p>
               <p>The King then ordered me to hasten with my Regiment to <hi>Abbeville,</hi> to carry the
<hi>Swisses</hi> their pay, and put succours into the Town before the Enemy besieged it. He
ordered at the same time a <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> to be sent for, who in the presence of
his Majesty, Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Chavigny,</hi> quilted sixteen hundred
Pistoles into my Wastecoat. With this order away I went, and making the best of
my way to joyn Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi>'s Regiment, we marched day and night, and made
so good haste, that we came time enough to save the Town. We got into it about
two in the morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the exceeding joy both of the Inhabitants and the Garrison,
who waited most Impatiently for this reinforcement, expecting to be surpriz'd
every hour, and either forc'd to give up the place, or have it carry'd by storm. We
found the Town illuminated with Candles and Torches in all the Windows, as if
it had been all of a flame, and nothing could be heard but shouts of men, women
and children, crying, <hi>God save the King.</hi> They had indeed great reason to rejoyce, for the
Garrison was much too weak to defend the place, and if we had come one half day
later, there had been small hopes of saving the Town.</p>
               <p>VIII. The next day, about ten in the morning, we saw seven and fifty Squadrons
of Horse, who came up in full expectation to carry the place. At the same time
Monsieur <hi>d' Alais,</hi> who had withdrawn thither, and had a small Squadron of Horse
with him, sallied out, and I followed him with our whole Regiment, divided into
several Battalions. The rest of the Garrison were posted upon the Ramparts, and
as many Inhabitans as were in a condition to bear arms, were ordered to shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
there too, so that nothing was seen but Souldiers, resolv'd to hold it out to the
last. Several Vollies of Cannon and Musquet shot were given from the Town, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to make the Enemy believe that they wanted no Ammunition, than out of any
prospect of doing them any hurt. The Enemy debated for two hours what course
they should take, and in the mean while ten or twelve of the Count <hi>d' Alais</hi> Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
sounded several Alarms, to signify that if they came on, we were ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them. At last, thinking this might put a stop to their conquests, if they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted a City so well garrison'd, they we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t off, to carry their victorious arms ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way.</p>
               <p>IX. I staid at <hi>Abbeville</hi> with Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi>'s Regiment about a year, for we
were under continual apprehensions of some attempt upon us, because the Enemy had
Garrisons in several Towns near us. Some days after my coming thither, the Officer
that would have got my command from me, which the King intended me in the
Guards, came thither too with the Marquis of <hi>Brezay</hi>'s Regiment, of which he was
Major. Monsieur <hi>de P.</hi> one of the stoutest men of his time, followed him close,
having a quarrel against him, upon the account of a Box on the Ear, which this Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
was said to have given him. All their acquaintance on both sides were concern'd
to make up the business. Monsieur <hi>M.</hi> protested he never gave the blow, but
Monsieur <hi>de P.</hi> not brooking, that the world should think he had received it, resolv'd
to revenge it whatever came on't. Monsieur <hi>M.</hi> who pretended great kindness to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:100923:114"/>
me, notwithstanding the dirty Trick he had play'd me, which I then knew nothing of,
beg'd that I would interpose in the Case, and proffer'd to refer himself to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of any persons they would chuse, and make any satisfaction they thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it
for him. I was desirous to reconcile the Quarrel by fair means, and used my utmost
endeavour to persuade Monsieur <hi>de P.</hi> to it. I walked with him several times to
this purpose, and told him, I neither knew the ground of their difference, nor desir'd
to know it. But, let the Affront be what it would, it could not be so great, as not to
admit of an honourable Accommodation, without coming to the Extremities he aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at. I advis'd to put it to the judgment of Friends, and told him all that long Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
had qualify'd me to say upon such an occasion, to incline him to terms of
Reconciliation, and undeceive him of his Notion, that no way but fighting could save
his Honour. He continued deaf to all I said, or if he gave me the hearing, yet
(which was as bad) he was still inflexible, and resolv'd to pursue his design. And
about ten or twelve days after he did so, and fought Monsieur <hi>M.</hi> without the
Town, whom he wounded mortally in five places, and was wounded in two places
himself.</p>
               <p>X. Monsieur <hi>M.</hi> being thus hurt, I had him brought to my Lodging, and
took all imaginable c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re of him till his death, which happen'd about three Weeks
after. I spared neither trouble nor charge to do him service, and had as tender a
regard to his Soul as his Body, keeping a Monk constantly in my house all the time
of his illness, who never stirred from him. The most surprizing Circumstance was,
that Providence should so order the matter, that I should ignorantly oblige a Man so
highly, who had disobliged me extremely, and utterly ruined my Fortunes, by design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to get the Command designed me by the King out of my hands, and being the
principal occasion of his Majesty's giving it away to another person. This poor Man
feeling his Conscience burde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'d with this Fault, and the more so, in proportion as he
receiv'd fresh kindnesses from the person to whom he had done such ill offices, resolv'd
at l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>died, I observ'd him
all in tears, and after a great struggle with himself, he spoke to me after this manner:
<hi>Ah! Sir, my dear Friend, I can no longer conceal my greatest pain from you, I must, I must
at last own to you the Remorse I feel, for having injur'd you in a matter, of which you could
never have the least Jealousie. I have sought a thousand opportunities to mention it to you,
and ask you as many Pardons for it. I conjure you therefore, dear Sir, to forgive a Man, who
needs nothing else to make him unhappy, than having been instrumental in ruining your Fortunes.</hi>
I, in perfect amazement at this Discourse, and not able to guess what all this meant,
answer'd him with an innocent sincerity, <hi>That I believed he loved me too well to be guilty
of what he accus'd himself.</hi> But my Answer adding more to his Sighs and Tears, he
reply'd, <hi>Alas! that is the very Consideration that cuts me to the heart, that I who had so much
reason to love you, should yet suffer my self to endeavour my own Advancement at your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.
But if you do not forgive me before I tell you the Story, I shall run mad; since the
wrong I have done you is so great, that if you do not forgive me, now I am going to give an
account to God, I shall have reason to fear he will not forgive me neither.</hi> There was little
room for deliberation in the sad circumstances and great disorder he the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> lay, so that
I told him instantly with great compassion, <hi>That I assur'd him, and solemnly protested, I
would never resent the thing; and that if he had really done me any Injury, I forgave it him
with all my Soul.</hi> Upon this assurance, which I gave after the best manner I could,
he discover'd the whole Matter in these words: <hi>It was I</hi> (said he) <hi>dear Sir, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
your Preferment. It was I that hindred you from being now Captain in the Guards.
It was I that contrived you should be detained in</hi> Holland, <hi>and by my Vncles means k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Command.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I must own this astonisht me strangely. But my Concern to see him in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
stisted my Passion, and I again assur'd him, <hi>That I forgave him heartily, and instead
of loving him less upon this account, should love him more for declaring himself so freely to me,
because this was an Argument he knew me, and entertained the opinion of me that I could wish
he should.</hi> And I can say with great truth, that I still retain'd the same affection for
him, and after his death buried him with all the decency and solemnity of a General;
the two Regiments marching with their Pikes trailing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all the other Ceremonies
of great Commanders Funerals. He was at that time deserted by all his Friends and
Relations, and Providence so contriv'd it, that the only relief he had came from that
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100923:114"/>
very Man, who, according to the false Notions of Honour in the World, ought to
have been his greatest Enemy. His Father was not wanting indeed to express his
thanks to me, and paid me exactly all that I had laid out upon his Son's account.</p>
               <p>XI. While I stay'd in Garison at <hi>Abbeville,</hi> I happen'd to have a great Ruffle with
the Officers of the Customs for Salt. Our Souldiers, who were but indifferently
paid, had got into a little way of trading, much for the convenience both of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
and themselves. They went and bought Salt at St. <hi>Vallery,</hi> and then sold it
again to the Townsmen at good Rates, so both Parties had an advantage by it, only
the Custom-Officers were enraged, that they could not hinder that which turn'd to
their prejudice. These Gentlemen therefore made their complaint to the Duke of
<hi>Angoulesme,</hi> who, for some private considerations, took their part. For my part, not
having wherewithal to pay the Regiment, I let them go on, seeing no great harm in
the thing, and thinking this as well for the King's advantage, who had such a method
for his Troops to subsist, without either the expence of his own Pocket, or the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening
his Subjects. I gave them no express Orders indeed for what they did, but
only connived at it.</p>
               <p>Coming about this time to <hi>Paris,</hi> to give his Majesty an account of the Garison,
he discourst me upon several Matters, and kept me with him till almost One a clock
at night. I told him what Monsieur <hi>M.</hi> had declar'd to me upon his death bed,
concerning the Command he was pleas'd to intend for me, and from thence took
occasion to present him with my most humble thanks, telling him, <hi>That this at least
was out of my Enemies power, to take away from me my Gratitude to his Majesty.</hi> Speaking
afterwards of the Garison, I told the King I was driven to great straits for want of
Money to pay the Souldiers. And his Majesty enquiring what course the Garison
took to subsist then? I answer'd him with the freedom he gave me leave to use, that
they had found out a way to pay themselves. <hi>They go Sir,</hi> said I, <hi>and buy Salt cheap, and
make a little Money of selling it again, till your Majesty have a convenience of sending them
their Pay.</hi> The King laught, and told me, <hi>Hark you, I will not hinder them from playing
the Knave thus, but if they are caught by the Magistrates, I will not hinder them from being
hang'd too.</hi> I answer'd merrily, <hi>That they were stout Fellows, and I was much mistaken if
they would be caught.</hi> And so this went off thus in Merriment.</p>
               <p>Not getting to Bed till Three that night, I took it out next day, and slept till
Eight in the Morning, which prevented my waiting early upon the King; and it
was my very good Fortune, that I had an opportunity of discoursing him the night
before. For the Duke of <hi>Angoulesme</hi> came to the Louvre in the Morning, and told
the King a dismal Story of the Disorders of the Garison at <hi>Abbeville.</hi> I came in this
very nick of time, and met some of my Friends, who said, <hi>I'le assure they are talking
finely of you above.</hi> I went up however, not much dismay'd, because I had discours'd
the King about it already. When I was at the Chamber-door the King saw me, and
because he had a mind the Duke of <hi>Angoulesme</hi> should talk over the Matter while I
was by, he gave me a Sign, that I should not discover my self. I presently understood
his Majesties meaning, and slipping behind the Company, got just behind my Lord
<hi>Angoulesme,</hi> who railed at our Garison very warmly. Then the King seeming surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
and having a mind to draw him in still deeper, said, <hi>But what! Is not</hi> Pontis <hi>at</hi>
Abbeville? <hi>And does not he restrain these Disorders? Yes Sir,</hi> said the Duke, <hi>he is there,
but he is as bad as the rest, though they say he does take some little Care. Be cautious what you
say,</hi> said the King, <hi>for there is one hears you.</hi> With that I shew'd my self to the Duke
of <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> and told him smiling, <hi>In earnest, Sir, I am much obliged to you, for the good
office you have done me to his Majesty.</hi> He being extremely surprized to see one that he
never dreamt had been so near, began to recant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in some disorder said, <hi>Oh! Sir,
Monsieur</hi> Pontis, <hi>I have been informed thus of you, but, for my part, I never believed it.</hi> The
King and all the Company could not hold laughing at this sudden come-off, and I as
readily reply'd, <hi>Oh! Sir, I am the more obliged to you then, for endeavouring to make the
King believe what you never believed your self.</hi> He shuffled the thing as well as he could,
and all went off with a Jest, and Monsieur <hi>Angoulesme</hi> complimented me with the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of his Favour, and any service he could do me.</p>
               <p>At my return to the Garison, I found the Bustle greater than before. For the
Souldiers taking confidence from their not being forbidden their Trade, acted bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d,
and carry'd on the Matter with a high hand, never regarding either the Officers,
or the Archers of the <hi>Gabelle,</hi> because they were not strong enough to encounter
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100923:115"/>
them. They went one day to the number of three or fourscore well armed, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd all
in a body to <hi>St. Vallery.</hi> The Officers of the Customs sent as many Archers out
after them, with orders to fall upon the Souldiers, and bring them in bound hand
and foot. This was sooner said than done. They met with one another, and fought
furiously. Several Archers were killed, and several Souldiers wounded, but the
Souldiers had the better of it. When they were come back to <hi>Abbeville,</hi> two of the
wounded came to shelter themselves at my house, as in a Sanctuary. I began to
scold at them, and call'd them a hundred Rascals, that their Rogueries would ruine
me, and turn'd them out at a back-door, but yet lodged them in a poor Cottage,
where they were privately lookt after. The Officers enraged at the loss and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
of their Archers, came to me immediately with open mouths, and told me,
My Souldiers had put the whole City in confusion, threatning that the King should
know it. I pretended to be very angry at the Souldiers my self, and proffer'd, if
they could apprehend any of the Criminals, I would see Justice done upon them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.
I my self went upon the search with them, and tho no discovery could be
made, yet these Officers were so well satisfy'd with me, and so cruelly harras<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d with
the scuffles they met with, and where they generally came off with the worst of it,
that a day or two after they came to my lodging to propose an accommodation.
They told me they saw I was a man of honour, and heartily devoted to the King's
service and interest, and therefore the best method they could think of to put a stop
to all these disturbances, was, to make their application to me, and offer me an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
which they had found out; which was, That the Souldiers should be allowed
to go buy Salt at <hi>St. Vallery,</hi> only instead of selling it again to the Inhabitants of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beville,</hi>
they should bring it into the King's Granaries, where it should be taken off
their hands, at the same price the Citizens used to give. I quickly saw how fair a
proposal this was for our men, but having a mind to be little intreated upon the point,
I answered these Officers, That they were very honest civil Gentlemen, but the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison had not deserved so much favour, and I was resolv'd to hang all that I could
find had been faulty. But whether they made a favourable judgment of my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or whether from some other cause, they importun'd and conjur'd me so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently, that at last I was forc'd to grant, what I wish'd a great deal more than they.
I proposed the matter to the Souldiers, who embrac'd it most willingly, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
sold their Salt to the King's Stores, and drove underhand bargains with the
Townsmen besides, so keeping both up to a good round rate. Thus I got both the
King's approbation and the Peoples hearts, but especially the Inhabitants, who
thought themselves infinitely obliged to me, for both exercising so good discipline,
that the Garrison did them no injury; and allowing them so considerable an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by their means. I had also one particular piece of respect paid me during my
stay at <hi>Abbeville,</hi> which was to have a voice allowed me in the Council of Monsieur
<hi>le Seve,</hi> then Intendant of Justice, and since Provost of the Merchants a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Paris;</hi> who,
as a particular favour, would have my Vote in his determinations, and by this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
express the friendship he did me the honour to have for me.</p>
               <p>XII. In <hi>May 1637,</hi> Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi>'s Regiment, which I commanded, was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to joyn Cardinal <hi>de la Vallette</hi>'s Forces, who was attempting to enter the <hi>Low-Countries</hi>
with a considerable Army. The King would have constituted me his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
at <hi>Abbeville,</hi> but I had no inclination to that Post; for tho it were honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
yet it oblig'd me to a private and peaceable life, and robb'd me of the only plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
I had, which was to follow the Army, and fight for my Country. But I was
much urged to it, and verily believe the City had a great hand in the importunities
used to perswade me to this Office. But my constant answer was, that I would rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
take it, provided the Regiment I then commanded might always continue at
<hi>Abbeville;</hi> and I would never hearken to it upon any other condition. The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
who seem'd so well satisfy'd with my Government, seem'd as much concern'd
at my leaving them: and the chief of them desired however to make merry with me
before I went; and entertain'd me three or four days as well as they could. The
Gentlemen of the <hi>Gabelle,</hi> I suppose, were not so very loth to part with me. But
it is a hard task to please all the world.</p>
               <p>I went to joyn our Army commanded by Cardinal <hi>de la Vallette,</hi> and the Duke of
<hi>Candale,</hi> and was not long before I paid for the civil usage, and all the good fortune
I had met with for a year and a half in the Town, where every thing conspir'd to ease
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:100923:115"/>
and to divert me. Our Army being come to <hi>Castle-Cambray</hi> in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> I
with two hundred men at the head of the Army, was order'd to set a guard farther
on, and the Horse had orders to support us. But this order being suddenly changed,
and the Horse sent off to another Post, we soon found our selves hemm'd in with
some Squadrons of the Enemies Horse, and at first took them for our own. But we
were soon undeceiv'd, and finding our selves thus surpriz'd, threw our selves into a
place full of Hedges, where we made a good defence a great while. Seeing at last,
that our Enemies grew upon us continually, I thought it a madness to pretend to hold
our against more than 1000 Horse, that were all upon us and we without any prospect of
being reliev'd. So I cry'd out, <hi>Quarter, Gentlemen, Quarter: We have given you proof
enough of our Valour, and it is meer fool-hardiness to stand it out any longer.</hi> Seeing them
charge us still, I cry'd again, <hi>Quarter, Gentlemen; If you deny it us, we will make work
with you; and you may chance to repent it, for we will sell our lives dear, and fight it out to the
last man</hi> Then they stopt, knowing what it is to deal with men when they are desperate;
and gave us the Quarter we askt. The Officers and I were detain'd, the Souldiers
were sent back, and they carry'd us to <hi>Cambray.</hi> As soon as ever the King heard I
was taken Prisoner, he had the goodness to send Monsieur <hi>de la Sabloniere,</hi> Groom of
the Wardrobe, with my Ransom, and as much Money as I needed for my charges,
and to recruit me for the loss I had sustain'd in the fight. So I continu'd under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement
not above six weeks or two months at most.</p>
               <p>XIII. At my return in <hi>August</hi> or <hi>September</hi> 1637, I went to joyn Mareschal <hi>de la
Melleray</hi>'s Army, about the time when he designed to besiege <hi>La Cappelle.</hi> He was
then under the Kings displeasure, and Cardinal <hi>Rich<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lieu,</hi> who had a great kindness
for him, was in some perplexity upon the Kings ill opinion of him. The Mareschal
in the mean while, desirous to make himself considerable by some extraordinary acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
thought himself obliged to undertake the Siege of <hi>La Cappelle.</hi> The Cardinal
was of another opinion; he thought that if this attempt should prove unsuccessful
it would quite lose him with the King, and therefore he endeavoured to divert him
from that design, and writ him word, that he should consider there was danger in the
undertaking, and the place strong enough to bring a disgrace upon him. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal
was not thus prevailed upon, and answered his Eminence, That tho the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
were a good one, yet he saw well enough it might be taken, for several reasons
which he gave him. And when he had writ this Letter, he laid Siege to the place.
The Cardinal being exceeding fearful for a person he lov'd, writ him word again,
That he advis'd him to let that Siege alone, and gave him some reasons that intimated
plain enough, his Eminence did not then stand so fast himself, as to secure him
against the King's displeasure, if he should miscarry. For the great advances the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
had made upon us for some years past, had given a shock to the interest of this
great Statesman, all whose wit was little enough, to bear him up against the insults
and complaints of a whole Kingdom; and so was all his policy too, to get loose
from all the new intrigues form'd against him, as I shall shew in some measure here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
Mareschal <hi>Melleray,</hi> still unmov'd with all the Cardinal had said, sent back
word, that the place was actually invested, and he did not question but to give a good
account of it. And after several other things said upon this occasion, he added at the
bottom of his Letter, as himself was pleased to tell me, that noted sentence of the
Poet, <hi>Audaces fortuna juvat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this Siege God preserved me after such a manner, as I can never sufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,
by snatching me on the sudden from a Post where I was oblig'd to be, and
where if I had been, my death had been unavoidable. One day, when my Regiment
was to come on upon the Guard in the evening, having heard that Monsieur <hi>de Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bures</hi>
my particular friend, was indisposed the night before, I went to visit him. When
I came to his Tent, they told me he was at the head of the Trenches. I went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to him, and found him shivering, like a man in an Ague-fit, and told him with
great tenderness, that he plaid the Fool to be there, when he scarce could go or stand.
<hi>You,</hi> said I, <hi>had more need be in your Bed. Are the Trenches a fit place for a sick man? If
the Enemy should make a sally, what can you do in this condition?</hi> He told me his illness
was nothing, and for the Enemy, they were not likely to make any sallies; that they
had been very quiet all the night before, and did not seem to design any great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
I told him, that according to the little experience I had, I was of a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
opinion, and I thought there was the greater ground to fear them, for the very
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:100923:116"/>
reason why he thought there was none at all. That the Enemies being so quiet lookt
to me very suspiciously, and could portend no good; and that skilful Seamen are
always jealous of a great calm. While I was talking at this rate very seriously, the
Count <hi>de Bussy Lamet</hi> interrupted me, taking me aside with a whisper, which was to
tell me, that he had a Pasty of Red Deer sent him of a Present, and desired my
company at the opening of it, which was to be that morning to breakfast.</p>
               <p>In the mean while came the Mareschal <hi>de Melleray,</hi> to whom I said with the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
he allowed me to take, <hi>Do not you make a conscience, Sir, of letting a sick man, as
Monsieur</hi> Rambures <hi>is, that had an Ague all night, and hath it still upon him, stay here at
the head of the Trenches? Pray, Sir, command him to go to bed, for he has at present a worse
Enemy than the</hi> Spaniard <hi>to encounter.</hi> Monsieur <hi>Rambures</hi> took me up, and pretending
to slight his distemper, when he thought himself concern'd to be upon duty, turned
what I said into raillery, and told us he was very well. Monsieur <hi>Melleray</hi> urged him
to withdraw, but he would not be prevailed upon to leave his Post, and, by not tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our advice, he became quickly after the cause of his own death. Then Monsieur
<hi>Melleray,</hi> who had laid his design upon the Town, told me I must needs oblige him
in one small piece of service, which was to go immediately from him to the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the Ordnance, and bid him get four thousand Baskets of Earth ready, by
six in the evening exactly, for he had absolute occasion for them. I promis'd him to
go, and as he turned about to speak to some body else, Monsieur <hi>Bussy Lamet</hi> told me
again in my Ear, that I should stay till the Mareschal was gone, and then we might
go and breakfast together, before I executed my Commission. But Monsieur <hi>Melle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray,</hi>
who would have had me gone instantly, seeing me again, cryed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>What are not
you gone yet? I thought you would have flown for my sake.</hi> I told him I durst not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, and only waited his motions. Whereupon he answered, That since I was
not gone, we would walk both together as far as the end of the Trench, and then
take Horse and go both about our business. Thus I lost my Breakfast, of which I
had need enough, but by a particular good providence; I miss'd an accident too,
which must undoubtedly have cost me my life, as you will see presently.</p>
               <p>As soon as I had parted with Mareschal <hi>Melleray,</hi> who went to overlook the
Works, I made haste to the Lieutenant of the Ordinance's Quarter. By that time I was got six or seven hundred paces, I heard a great noise of abundance of Guns. I
turn'd about, and saw all the Trench and the Curtain on fire, and fancied it was a
great skirmi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h, and that the Enemy had charged us in our Trenches. Just then was I
in greater confusion than can be exprest. On one side my friendship for Monsieur
<hi>Rambures</hi> call'd me to the Trenches; on the other, the fear of offending Mareschal
<hi>Melleray,</hi> put me upon obeying his orders. At last I resolv'd, if it were possible, to
satisfy both obligations: Then riding full speed, as soon as ever I met with the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
I told him without more ado, that Monsieur <hi>Melleray</hi> had sent me to order in
his name, four thousand Baskets of Earth, to be ready at half an hour after five in
the evening; and for fear he should not understand me right, I repeated it over
again to him. He made answer, that the Mareschal commanded an impossibility. I
repeated it a third time, without staying to reason the case with him, that he must
do what he could, but my orders were to bespeak four thousand at half an hour
past five in the evening; and so I left him, galloping back again full speed to the
Trench: But all was over. All was broke and in disorder, and by the way I met
poor Monsieur <hi>Rambures</hi> with his Thigh broke, and carrying back to his Tent. The
first words he said were, <hi>Ah, Sir, poor</hi> Bussy <hi>is killed, and so are all the rest that you saw
with me at the head of the Trenches. The Guards let themselves be surprized, and that hath lost
us all. What you told me is come upon me; and I had been wiser if I had believed you.</hi> I was
then quite transported with grief, seeing one of my friends lost, another so dangerously
wounded, and so terrible a slaughter in so very short a time. But this was no time to
talk, and Monsieur <hi>Rambures</hi> himself begg'd me to run to the Trench, and see if they
did not want me, and whether it was not necessary to draw down my Regiment to
beat back the Enemy. I ran immediately to put them into a posture of fighting, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal
<hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lleray</hi> meeting me there, said in great concern, <hi>What Monsieur</hi> Pontis <hi>have not you
been where I sent you?</hi> I told him the thing was done, and I had told the Lieutenant, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
it thrice over; that the Lieutenant thought it could hardly be done, but he would
endeavour to satisfy him the best he could. Then he told me there was no occasion
for my Regiment, for the Enemies were repuls'd already; and then, speaking to me,
with great goodness and affection, said, <hi>We have had strange work here in the little time
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:100923:116"/>
you have been away. You are beholding to me for your Life, for if you had stay'd at the
Trenches one quarter of an hour longer, you had had no better Fortune than poor</hi> Bussy <hi>and</hi>
Rambures, <hi>who are both kill'd. Sir,</hi> said I, <hi>I must confess I am obliged to you, you have
lost one of the best Friends and Servants you had in Monsieur</hi> Bussy, <hi>for he was really a very
gallant Man: For Monsieur</hi> Rambures, <hi>he is only wounded.</hi> Monsieur <hi>Melleray</hi> lamented
the loss of Monsieur <hi>Bussy</hi> very much, saying, <hi>That he had indeed lost one of his dearest
Friends, and the Cardinal one of his most faithful Servants.</hi> Then he order'd me to get
my Regiment in a readiness for the Attempt in the Evening, and that he was going
just then to learn the nearest way. I had a mind to go with him, and ask'd whether
he would not please to take me with him, that I might receive his Commands. He
told me at first, there was no need for that. But thinking again upon the matter, he
gave me leave to attend him. And after we had taken due notice of the place, and
made all necessary observations, he carried on a Lodgment there in the Evening above
a hundred and fifty paces towards the Town, by the help of the Baskets he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
to make a passage over a Canal. I shall give no farther account of this Siege,
not remembring any particulars very considerable concerning it, but will now proceed

                  </gap>el me the year after, when I was sent into <hi>Franche Comte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIV. In the year 1638, about the Month of <hi>June,</hi> I was commanded by the King
at <hi>Paris</hi> to go to the Army, under the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi>'s Command, which besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Poligny</hi> in <hi>Franche-Comte;</hi> and the Commission I had given me, was to observe
what condition the Army was in, and give his Majesty an account of it. Some
time after my coming thither, having no Employ, but what my Eyes were taken up
in, the Victualler of the Army, who pretended to confide in me, desir'd I would bear
him company to the Mountains, whither he was then going for Provisions. I was
very glad of the opportunity, being weary of living idle; and what then seem'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an accidental undesigning Journey, prov'd of mighty importance to the Kingdom,
as I shall now shew you.</p>
               <p>As we travelled through these Mountains, it was our Fortune to meet with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
old <hi>Swisse</hi> who carry'd Letters. I presently knew his Face, having seen him in
the Army a great while ago; and being very desirous, by reason of the disorders
and confusions of the War, to get his Letters from him cunningly, that I might know
whether they contained any thing that might be of use to the King, I presently rubb'd
up my old acquaintance, and accosted him very friendly. <hi>How now honest Friend,</hi> said
I, <hi>how far are you travelling through these Mountains all alone?</hi> I am going to such a place
Sir, <hi>said he,</hi> to carry some Letters. <hi>I fancy</hi> (said I again) <hi>I have seen you a good while
ago in the</hi> French <hi>King's Guards; Did not you carry Arms there about such a time?</hi> Yes,
Sir, <hi>(said he)</hi> I was there about that time, and serv'd in them so many years. <hi>I
thought I was not mistaken,</hi> (reply'd I) <hi>I perceive my memory hath not quite forsaken me.
Well my old Friend, and how is it? Have you your health well still? Are you strong and
lusty?</hi> Ah! Master, <hi>(said he)</hi> yes truly, thank God, I am as well as a Man at my
Age can expect to be. <hi>Look you Fellow-Souldier</hi> (said I) <hi>we have both of us one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
that if we cannot expect to live as long as other People, we have the less time to live in fear
of death. For my part I find the best thing an old Man can do, is to cherish himself a little,
and not give way to melancholy. Tell me therefore prithee, Is there any thing good to be had
hereabouts? What Price does Wine bear among you?</hi> The very hearing of that word
Wine clear'd up his countenance, and made him look gay, as the temper of that
Country is, and telling me, that there were good Provisions and Wine to be had at
tolerable easy Rates: <hi>Well,</hi> said I, <hi>we will drink one Glass together then, and renew our
old Acquaintance; Come on, let us drink a Health to old Age.</hi> Then I brought him to an
Inn hard by, and there, after he had drunk some Bumpers, I took his Pacquet, and
open'd the Letters, and found the <hi>Swisses</hi> were upon Rising, to defend their Rights and
Priviledges, which they thought the King of <hi>France</hi> intended to take from them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> was at that time besieging <hi>Poligny,</hi> where there are some
Saltpits, from whence they were priviledg'd to fetch Salt. These poor Fellows are
wonderful jealous, and tender of their Liberties, and thought the King design'd to
incroach upon them by degrees; and therefore they sollicited one another by Letters,
to take up Arms, and send Souldiers into several parts of the Country to maintain
their Priviledges.</p>
               <p>Considering what might be the consequences of such an Insurrection, I left the
honest Fellow fast asleep, and went presently back to wait upon Monsieur <hi>Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:100923:117"/>
to whom I made no particular mention of what had past, but only told him,
that being now of no use to the Army, after I had fulfill'd the King's Command, I
begg'd he would please to dismiss me, that I might give his Majesty an account of the
business he had intrusted me with. From the Camp at <hi>Poligny</hi> I made all the haste I
could to <hi>Paris,</hi> and went immediately to wait upon the King; to whom, after having
given him an account of the Army, I presented the Pacquet of Letters which I
took from the old <hi>Swisse,</hi> and told his Majesty how I got them into my hands. The
King, much surprized at the News, and as much pleas'd with the Service I had done
him, writ away to the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> and the <hi>Swisse Cantons,</hi> to satisfy them he
had no design at all upon their Priviledges; that there was no real ground for their
Jealousies; that he ever did, and ever would love and protect them against all Men
living. And this quieted the disturbances which were upon the very point of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out in their Countries.</p>
               <p>This single Accident would have been enough, perhaps, to have made any Man's
Fortunes but mine, but a higher hand order'd things so, that what would have been
of great service to other people, never did me any at all. And really I could sit and
reflect for ever, and with much wonder as well as delight, upon the different P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of my life. For, though I was then wonderfully stupid, and had no sense of
better things, yet now I can plainly observe in a thousand instances, the care Almighty
God took of me, when I had little or no regard for him. He preserv'd my life again
the year after this, which was 1639, when I was manifestly expos'd to extreme dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
and he made the melancholy and discontent which I sell into upon an occasion I
am now going to relate, to be the instrument of keeping me out of that danger.</p>
               <p>XV. A Friend of mine one day entertaining Monsieur <hi>de Feuquieres,</hi> and another
acquaintance at dinner, I, who had a design to go along with Monsieur <hi>Feuquieres</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the next Campagne, he being a Man of excellent experience, and I desiring above
all things still to improve my knowledge in militury discipline, invited my self to dine
there too, that I might have an opportunity of breaking my mind to him. One of
the Company, a particular Friend of Monsieur <hi>de Feuquieres,</hi> did nothing all dinner
long but whisper first with me, and then with another, which Monsieur <hi>Feuquieres,</hi>
that loved people should always talk aloud, was much offended at. When dinner was
done, the same Gentleman took Monsieur and Madam—into a corner of
the Room to discourse them privately; so another Gentleman and I were left all
alone, much displeased at this way of Conversation. For I, who talkt freely to people
of the best Quality, and had the honour to be frequently admitted into the confidence
of Princes, was not acquainted with such usage. This Gentleman and I therefore
rose up, and would needs be gone. And though Madam <hi>de</hi>—endeavour'd to stop
us, perceiving that I was, and might very well be dissatisfy'd, yet I took my leave in
a pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, without mentioning any thing of my intentions to Monsieur <hi>Feuquieres.</hi> This
Resentment of mine put a stop to my Journey, and by not waiting on Monsieur <hi>Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieres,</hi> as I desir'd to do in that Campagne, I escap'd being at the famous Battel of
<hi>Thionville,</hi> where I should have found it a hard matter to escape with life; because I
should certainly have kept constantly near the person of that excellent Man, who was
lost there.</p>
               <p>XVI. Upon this I went another way, and for some time this Campagne serv'd in the
Army that lay at <hi>Vervins,</hi> under the command of Cardinal <hi>de la Vailoite,</hi> and the Duke
of <hi>Candale.</hi> There I was in quality of Major of Brigades, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Major of four or
five Regiments, whose office it is to receive the General's Orders, and see them duly
executed by the Troops under his command. We had besides another Army at <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beuge,</hi> which the Enemy had blockt up, being encamped between us and them. It
being therefore our great concern to join these two Armies, there was a Council of
War call'd by Cardinal <hi>Vallette,</hi> to advise how we might get to the Relief of that at
<hi>Maubeuge.</hi> Monsieur <hi>Gastion,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de Praslin,</hi> and two other Gentlemen, came
and offer'd their service to our Generals, to get through the Enemy, and carry intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to the Town that we were come up, and ready to relieve them, that so they
might be ready upon a day appointed, and the Enemy be attackt on both sides at
once. The Generals accepted this offer, as very advantageous for both Armies; and
they being well mounted, spurred on strait upon the Enemy. The Centinel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
them, and gave notice to the Guard, who mov'd to cut off their passage. The
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:100923:117"/>
Marquis of <hi>Praslin,</hi> and two others, by the help of a rare good Horse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> got through
them. But Collonel <hi>Gassion,</hi> whom the Enemies had inclosed, made as bold an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
as the other. For throwing himself with Cloaths, Boots and Spurs on into
the River, with his Bridle round his Arm, he swum over to the other side, and so
came round another way to our Army.</p>
               <p>The other Army at <hi>Maubeuge,</hi> understanding our motions by Monsieur <hi>Praslin,</hi>
and the day we designed to attack the Enemy, put themselves in readiness, and
stood to their arms, in expectation of our falling on. As we drew up near the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
there rose such a terrible fog, that one could not see ones way ten yards before
them. The whole Army was much disturbed at this, fearing they might fall into an
Ambuscade before they were aware. The Regiments under my command were very
troublesome, tearing my head to pieces with shouts and questions, not knowing
where they were. And, which made it still worse, the Generals were a great way
off, for we went at the head of the Army, and marched first. At last, wearied with
their bawling, I had a mind to try if I could make any discovery, and went about
some forty paces before the Troops, and streight I began to descry some of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Troops very near me. Then I call'd out to my men, <hi>Forward, forward, To me,
to me.</hi> I ordered them to sound a charge, and we laid on so briskly upon them that
met us, that they made small resistance, and went off in the mist, so opening a passage
for us. For the Troops at <hi>Maubeuge</hi> attacking them behind at the same time, they
durst not venture to engage two Armies at once.</p>
               <p>XVII. This Campagne of the year 1639, about the month of <hi>July,</hi> the Mareschal
<hi>de Chatillon</hi> after Monsieur <hi>Feuquiere</hi>'s Army was defeated, had orders from the King
to besiege <hi>Yvois</hi> in <hi>Luxemburgh.</hi> I was at that Siege, and wounded there by a Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
bullet in my Leg. But my wound was not so bad, as to disable me from exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
the King's Commission of razing that place to the ground. I interceeded how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
for the sparing the Portal of a Church, where I was not a little surpriz'd to find
the Arms of our Family, plac'd there by one of my Relations, that built it, having
been a Canon of that Church. The King, who came to <hi>Yvois</hi> after it was taken,
would not grant my request till he had seen the Portal. And he being of a good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
as he was pleasing himself with walking over the ruines of the Town, I took
the liberty to tell him, that tho no place could refuse access to his Arms, yet such
walks as those ought not to be allowed his person; and I should deserve to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
if, having the honour to be his guide, I led him over ruines and precipices.
The King reply'd very pleasantly, <hi>It is but reasonable Princes should follow those whom they
have chose for their guides.</hi> When the King had viewed what places he had a mind to,
and this Portal among the rest, he granted my desire. But the fatigue and heat of
working about the demolishing of this Town, which I never favour'd my self in,
threw a sudden swelling, and great inflamation into my Leg. So Monsieur <hi>de Seve,</hi>
with whom I had contracted an intimate acquaintance at <hi>Abbeville,</hi> lent me his Coach,
and I went to <hi>Sedan;</hi> whither the Count <hi>de Soissons,</hi> Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and some other
persons of honour retir'd, during their disgrace at Court. I was particularly known
to all the company about the Count, and received so many visits, that I had not time
to keep my bed. The Count was pleas'd to visit me himself, and no question had
an end to serve in it, for this honour was not without a design at the bottom. I,
who was pretty well acquainted with the blind side of great men, fell into discourse
of his Highnesses great exploits, and enlarg'd much upon the action of <hi>Bray,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other things, which I thought most likely to please him. But I knew well
enough how to distinguish between my respects and gratitude for his kindness to me,
and my main duty, and natural obligations. Therefore when he sent me a purse full
of Pistoles next day, telling me, that I might possibly have occasion for Money, in
the condition I was in, I would not take it: But sent it back again with this Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That since it did not become a private man, as I was, to refuse a present from
one of his Quality, I begg'd him, not wanting Money at this time, to do me the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to keep that Purse for me, till I had more occasion for it. And it was very
happy I behav'd my self thus to him: For Mareschal <hi>Chatillon</hi> did me the favour to
write me word as a friend presently after, that my stay at <hi>Sedan</hi> made a great noise at
Court, and the King took it ill my Lodging should be the rendezvous of the Count's
Family. This news confounded me, and made it necessary for me to be gone next
morning for <hi>Paris,</hi> desiring only a Gentleman to make my excuse to the Count <hi>de Soissons,</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:100923:118"/>
and acquaint him, that an order from the King occasioned my so sudden leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the place.</p>
               <p>XVIII. The next year, which was 1640, I went to the Siege of <hi>Arras,</hi> which
was invested about <hi>June</hi> by Mareschal <hi>Chatillon,</hi> and Mareschal <hi>Melleray.</hi> The two
Generals intending to surprize the Town, parted their Forces, and made a shew of
besieging some other place. So a good part of the Garrison within this strong Town
drew off to reinforce some other Garrisons which they were in fear for. But <hi>Arras</hi>
was much surprized to see themselves invested all on a sudden at the same instant of
time with two Armies in two different parts, so that it was impossible to put in any
succours to them. They presently drew the Lines of Circumvallation, and Trenches
for the Camp. Imagining this Siege might be a work of time, I built me a wooden
house glazed, and two pretty lodging rooms in it, into one of which Monsieur <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillon</hi>
used to withdraw sometimes, and there steal a Nap to be free from disturbance.</p>
               <p>The Count of <hi>Isembourg,</hi> Governour of <hi>Arras,</hi> having sallied out before we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
it, to reinforce the Garrison of <hi>Bethune,</hi> which he apprehended we had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
upon; was terribly inraged to see <hi>Arras</hi> thus blocked up, and resolved to put
some relief into it; but all the passes were so strongly kept, that he could find no
way of doing it with safety. Therefore he sollicited the Count <hi>de Lamboy,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> to come and raise the Siege. The
Count accordingly came and encamped some leagues from <hi>Arras,</hi> and detached some
Troops to charge our Trenches. We were at a Council <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> Mareschal <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leray</hi>'s
Tent, when this alarm was given. As soon as ever I heard the noise, I
thought of getting to Horse, and repairing to my Post. Monsieur <hi>de Comminges G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t,</hi>
my very good friend, seeing the risque I ran of falling into the Enemies hands,
who would cut off my passage, cryed out, that I ought not be suffered to run so upon
certain death. So the Generals proffer'd me a Convoy of Horse to see me safe at my
Quarter: But I depended upon the goodness of my Horse, and desired they would
let me go alone, assuring them, that I thought this method the less dangerous of the
two; and so away I went immediately. I had a most excellent P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d under me, for
which I have since refus'd fourscore Pistoles, and I had reason to value him at more,
for he saved my life upon this occasion. For as I galloped to recover my Quarter, a
Squadron of Horse spy'd me, and rid up full speed to stop me, presenting their Pistols,
and crying, <hi>Stand, stand.</hi> I did not care for obeying those orders, so long as there
were any hopes of escaping left, and therefore spurr'd on with my Pistol in my hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and without regarding them, past by. There was a little beyond this a very steep Hill,
which I must of necessity get up to save my self; for the Horsemen still pursued after
me, and had blockt up the common road. Finding my self thus streightned, I put
my Horse to it, for his own and his Masters life: And the poor creature, as if he had
been sensible of our danger, scrambled up this sharp ascent so fast, that he had like to
have burst for want of breath. The Enemies were amazed to see me get up at this
rate, and not daring to follow me this steep way, they went up another part of the
Hill, to try if they could stop me once more. But I getting up a great while before
them, gave my Horse a little breath, and made much of him for the good service he
had done me, and then put on again; so that I got the heels of them quite, and at
last reach'd my quarter.</p>
               <p>Our Generals, hearing I was pursued by a Squadron of Horse, were concern'd to
know what was become of me. But Mareschal <hi>Melleray</hi> coming to my quarter a little
after, found me at the head of my Regiment, which I had drawn out, and put into
a readiness to do their duty. But there was no occasion for it at that time, for the
Enemy only shewed themselves, and percieving our Camp was in a posture to recieve
them, they wheel'd off again.</p>
               <p>XIX. In this Siege I lost several things, contrary to my custom, for I us'd to have
the good fortune of keeping what I had. One day I sent out my Servants to get for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
for my Horses, which were in all about eighteen or twenty. I charg'd them not
to carry out above two or three, that if any unlucky accident should happen, I
might not hazard the loss of them all at a time. My Servants for all that, greedy of
bringing home more booty, took out seven or eight. Some Troops of the Enemy
came upon them, and my stout blades took no further care but to save themselves,
and left my Horses for pawns. Among the rest there was one draught Horse, the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:100923:118"/>
best of that sort in the world; he was naturally stout and fierce enough for a War
Horse, and only wanted tail and shape to make him fit for a General. This Horse
not being used to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Dialect, and percieving he was got into Enemies hands,
began to fall on with his feet and teeth, upon every body that came near him, and
grew so mad all of a sudden, that those who had taken him not being able to rule
him, let him go again, and said they were sure it was the Devil in the shape of a
Horse. He was tyed to another, and so brought him off too; and they were seen
come full tilt into the Camp, and streight to my Stable, which they were very well
acquainted with the way to. I was much pleased with the stoutness of the Beast,
and bad a Servant go see if the rest had taken the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reak, and got away too; but
we heard no news of them.</p>
               <p>Another time, as I was one night upon the Guard in the Trenches, I lost all my
belly-timber. My men had made ready my dinner over night, against next day;
and I us'd always when I was upon the Guard my self, to invite all the Officers that
went upon duty, with me to dinner. Next day expecting my dinner with some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
I had news brought me, that all my provisions were stoln. They took from
me above forty Hams, a Powdring-tub full of Salt Meats, and a great many other
things, to a considerable value. However I had some good luck with my bad; for
our Generals, and some of the principal Officers, hearing my misfortune, sent me in
a sufficient recruit for my loss: and I found it was for my Interest to be robb'd, when
there was more got than lost by it.</p>
               <p>XX. The Besieged one day design'd a considerable Sally, and expected the shifting
of the Guards, as the properest time, because then there is always some little confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
They came out of the City with about eight hundred men, and made up direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the quarter where we lay. Seeing them come on so briskly, I cry'd out to our
<hi>Mareschal de Camp; Sir, these honest fellows hope to have a good bargain of us, and intend to
beat us soundly, if we will but let them; I will go meet them</hi> (said I) <hi>and make them a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
And directing my self to the Officers of our Regiment, <hi>Come Gentlemen,</hi> (said I)
<hi>let us go back into the Town with them.</hi> With that I went out of the Trench, and most
of the Officers and common Souldiers follow'd me. The Enemies seeing us come
on, as brisk to the full as they, were satisfy'd with the civility we intended them,
and turn'd short to another part of the Camp, where they were not so well prepar'd
for them. There, to give them their due, they fell very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oul upon the Regiment of
Guards, who gave way, till at last those that supported them beat them back into
their Trenches. I had observ'd two or three Officers of my Regiment take no notice,
when I call'd to go out of the Trenches, and yet when no danger was nigh, none talkt
so big as these men. I thought it became me to make them know their duty; and
when I came back, said in some heat, as you may imagine; That since it was a rule
the Regiment should obey him, whose place it was to command them, I pretended
a right to see this discipline duty observ'd; and I would have that man shot, that did
not march when I gave the word. <hi>If you will not observe commands</hi> (said I) <hi>take my place,
and I will take yours.</hi> This reproof, given with some passion, because indeed I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a strict regard for discipline, created me several Enemies: and they said among
themselves, <hi>He could but talk thus if he were our General.</hi> I told one of these Officers too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to move him the more, that it was in my power to ruine his honour; and that he
was very stout when there was no danger, and shrunk back when there was. He,
being conscious in himself that what I said was true, excus'd the thing, and begg'd
me to spare him.</p>
               <p>XXI. Besides this, I had a great dispute with Monsieur <hi>de P.</hi> the Lieutenant Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
of my Regiment, upon an occasion that ought not to have bred any quarrel.
The Souldiers made perpetually complaints to me for want of their pay, and I thought
of an expedient to get some Money, and desir'd the Lieutenant Collonel that he
would motion it to the Treasurers of the Army. He, bought off perhaps by the
Treasurers, instead of seconding me in the thing, took me up, and askt me very
briskly, What I had to do with that? telling me farther, that it was always my
custome, not to content my self with my own business, but to concern my self in
other people's. I answer'd him with much the same air. That it was my business to
take care of the Regiment's good; and since the Souldiers had complain'd to me, I
was concern'd to see it remedy'd; and if others did not what they should do, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:100923:119"/>
me to put them in mind of it. He still went on with prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>king language;
and told me I ought to keep my own Office, for other people knew well enough how
to discharge theirs, and had no need of my advice. Seeing him thus unreasonably
averse to the common interest of the Regiment, and without any manner of provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
I thought it was my turn to be sharp too, and told him, that, no disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to his quality, there were persons of great honour that thought it no diminution
to ask my advice; <hi>And you your self,</hi> said I, <hi>Sir, can do it sometimes, without supposing it
any reflection upon you.</hi> Upon this we both grew warm, and there was reason enough
to apprehend some mischief would have come of it, but that the Generals, having
notice of the thing, reconcil'd us again; and we have been very good friends ever
since.</p>
               <p>XXII. But the Bishop of <hi>Auxerre,</hi> who was his Relation, hearing of our quarrel,
took so violent a picque against me, and so unbecoming his Character, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to do my business effectually with Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who hated me already,
as much as he lov'd this Bishop. His Brothers, with whom I was intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted,
gave me notice of it, and told me several times, that I must look to my self,
for he would ruine me; and he was a terrible man, when he was set upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ischief;
which I thought a most extraordinary qualification in a Bishop I desir'd them to do
me good offices to him, and am sure they would have done it with all their hearts,
if it had been in their power; but they told me, they had no manner of influence
upon him; that he was of a fierce inflexible temper, and like enough to ruine them
too, if they should give him any offence. You may well imagine how easie I was
with the thoughts of such an Enemy, whom I could call to no account for his injuries
neither, because his Robe was his protection. The only way left then was to try
what submissions would do; and I can truly say, it is incredible how many of those
I made him, and how many several engines I set to work to soften this barbarous
man; fearing him especially upon Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s account, whose power I had
reason to dread: Nay, I went once to his house, with Monsieur <hi>d' Orgeval,</hi> to proffer
him any satisfaction he could desire. I protested, that what past between his kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and me, was without any the least intention to affront him; but I w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s come to
wait on him, and express my very great concern, that he thought himself injur'd in
it. He pretended to be surpriz'd, and told me, I had not injur'd him at all; but as I
was arguing the matter with him, and came closer to the point, he very rudely turn'd
his back to me all on the sudden, and went away into his Chamber. Thus I lost all
my labour upon him, and what his Brothers had told me was true to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, That
he would be my ruine; for he occasion'd my being in disgrace, as I shall shew after
the taking of <hi>Arras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the true reason why this Bishop would never be reconcil'd to me, was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
necessity he had brought himself under of hating me immortally, by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
he had with the Cardinal upon my account, to ingratiate himself there the
more effectually. For among other things he told him, I was so absolutely devoted
to the King, that whatever he commanded I was ready to do it. This was the very
worst thing that could have been said of me to his Eminence, who was fearful and
jealous, and apprehended nothing more in any body about the King, than this readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to serving him, which was laid to my charge. I explain my self no further up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this point now, but you will see hereafter, he shewed me how he understood it,
by reducing me to those circumstances which I shall shortly describe, and making me
as unhappy as it was possible for me to be; and depriving me as much as he could of
my last refuge, his Majesty's protection and assistance. The most remarkable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
in all this passage was, that when a Cavalier and an Officer of the Army,
as Monsieur <hi>de P.</hi> his Relation was, could so soon lay aside all his resentments
against me; a Bishop, whose character should inspire him with dispositions to Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Peace, should hate a man that only fancied had injur'd him, beyond all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
and value himself upon revenging it to his utter ruine. This so very
distant behaviour of a Gentleman of the Sword, and one of the Gown, might be
Theme enough for reflection, to a man that understands better than I, how far the
wisdom and vertue of a Bishop ought to extend.</p>
               <p>XXII. The King having sent out a very large Convoy one day for recruiting the
Camp with provisions, and a Squadron of above five thousand Horse along with
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100923:119"/>
them. Mareschal <hi>Melleray</hi> went likewise out of the Camp to meet them, with three
thousand Horse more. The Enemies Army snatcht this opportunity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> our
Trenches. As soon as they were discovered at some distance, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
who commanded the Horse, said to Mareschal <hi>Chatillon,</hi> with whom I then was
waiting for orders. <hi>Sir, Yonder is the Enemy coming, we should go meet them with some
Squadrons of Horse to break their first push, and prevent their forcing our Trenches.</hi> The
Mareschal <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> who all the world knows was of a strange cold stiff temper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
answered without any concern, <hi>Sir, our business now is not to engage the Enemies Army,
but to defend our Lines. But, Sir,</hi> said Monsieur <hi>Grammont</hi> again, <hi>it is with a design to
defend tham that I would march out against them; the first aggressor is commonly the better man.
Say you so, Sir,</hi> reply'd Monsieur <hi>Chatillon, and if you be repuls'd, who shall defend the
Trenches then? Look you,</hi> said he, pointing to <hi>Arras, That Town is our Mistress, and our
business is to take that; win it we must at any rate, though it should cost us the last drop of blood
in our bodies. We have nothing to do to go seek out Enemies, our work must be to stand still till
they come, and see what they have to say to us. Ah, Sir,</hi> said Monsieur <hi>Grammont</hi> in a
great passion, <hi>this is perfect Envy. You injure me in stopping me upon this occasion. I will
assure you I will complain to the King of it. Well, Sir, I am content you should complain,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
the Mareschal, <hi>but I beg I may know when you do it, and be by: But in the mean while,
Sir, upon my honour, I command you to your post, and stir not.</hi> Monsieur <hi>Grammont</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
much displeased, and said, he must obey the General, but he would complain,
and that loudly.</p>
               <p>By this time the Enemies fell on about Monsieur <hi>Rantzau</hi>'s quarter, and charg'd
so furiously, that they cut several Regiments to pieces, plundered all that quarter,
and prepared to advance still farther, to try if they could put any succours into the
place. The Fort of <hi>Rantzay</hi> was taken and retaken several times, but at last we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Masters of it. I attended Monsieur <hi>Chatillon</hi> all the time of the engagement,
which lasted about five hours, and had the satisfaction of seeing the whole action
without being concerned in it, because our quarter was not attackt, lying a league off.
Some of them came to Monsieur <hi>Chatillon,</hi> crying, all was lost, and that the Enemies
were coming on to force us? he reply'd with great indifference, <hi>Stay, stay till they have
done;</hi> and presently after he ordered a body of Reserve, consisting of four thousand
Horse, to charge the Enemies all at once. The thing was no sooner said than done.
They charged immediately so briskly, that they cleared the Trenches of them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
some Cannon that were lost, and drove them a great way beyond the Camp.
Then we saw plainly, and Monsieur <hi>Grammont</hi> himself confest, that it was an instance
of Mareschal <hi>Chatillon</hi>'s wisdom to oppose the Horse going out of the Camp, for their
stay was the very thing that saved all from being lost.</p>
               <p>XXIII. At last when we had sprung a Mine, and made a large breach, and had
two more ready to spring, our Generals summon'd the Town to surrender, declaring
to them, that if they were able to hold out after two Mines more, they had some
reason not to comply; and if they doubted the truth of what they said, they would
give them safe conduct, and an opportunity of convincing themselves. Some persons
came therefore from the City, and took a particular view of all. And then being satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
it was impossible for them to hold out any longer, they agreed to a Capitulation,
presently after they had made their report; for they allowed them no more than an
hours time to consider of it, for fear a longer delay should give them opportunity to
defeat the success we expected from those two Mines. So after they were come to
a perfect agreement on both sides, and the Articles drawn, the City was delivered
into the King's possession again, in the month of <hi>August,</hi> 1640. Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>
had promised the Government of it, if it were taken, to Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil,</hi> and
he kept his word with him, and put him into it presently after it was reduc'd. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>St. Preuil,</hi> who as I have said before, was my very particular friend, had given
me intimation of it before, and urged me mightily to ask the King for the Lieutenancy
of the Town. This was what I could have been well enough pleased with, upon
the account of the friendship between us; but not prevailing with my self to beg
it, I desir'd him to ask it for me, telling him, he who had so easily secured the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
for himself, might very well obtain the Lieutenancy for me. He that knew well
enough how the Cardinal stood affected to me, durst not engage in such a request upon
my account; and so, after the reduction of <hi>Arras,</hi> the Lieutenancy under the King was
dispos'd of to Monsieur <hi>du Plessis B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I. IT was not long after the reducing of <hi>Arras,</hi> before I felt the mischievous Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of that Prelate's Malice, mention'd in the former Book. He set Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Richelieu</hi> so violently against me, that I found my self in a moment stript
of all, and not allow'd to see the King, any more than the Cardinal, that hated me.
Who, by a piece of confidence that a Man could scarce believe, did not scruple to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ie so high, as to make use of his Authority against one of his own Officers, and one
for whom he knew very well his Majesty had a particular Favour and Esteem. Being
one day come to <hi>Paris</hi> by the King's express Command, to make large Recruits, and
carry them to <hi>Arras,</hi> I employ'd some time in executing this Commission; and some
few days before my return to <hi>Arras</hi> with my new Levies, had a mind to entertain the
Treasurers of the Army at <hi>Aubrieres,</hi> a League out of <hi>Paris.</hi> I treated them as nobly
as I could, sparing no cost to welcome Persons, whose Favour and Friendship it was
my interest to secure; and little thinking, God knows, of the Misfortune that was
then coming upon me; and which made it but too necessary to have husbanded that
Money more prudently. This day of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ollity and pleasure, was succeeded by another
very black one to me: For while I was set at Table with my Friends, and my
thoughts wholly bent upon mirth and diversion, there came a Messenger to the house
to speak with me from Monsieur <hi>de Noyers.</hi> I rose immediately, and enquired what
his business was; and he deliver'd me an Order under Monsieur <hi>de Noyers</hi> his own
hand, the substance whereof was, That the Cardinal sent to tell me in the King's
Name, that I need not trouble my self to carry the new Recruits I had raised to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras;</hi>
and bade me take notice, that I must be sure not to go out of <hi>Paris,</hi> without the
King's particular leave to do so.</p>
               <p>This Message struck me like a Clap of Thunder, and I stood perfectly stupid and
confounded at it. At last, when I was come to my self a little, I told the Messenger
I would not fail to obey the Order he had brought me; and then striving to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
my self as well as I could, that I might not break good company, I sat down
with my Friends again, without expressing any concern. But in spight of all my
endeavours to the contrary, they perceiv'd it in my countenance; and presently
told me, they saw plain enough by me, I had heard some ill News: But I
put it off as well as I could, and would not discover any thing of the matter to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:100923:120"/>
About the same time that this Order was brought me, the Cardinal had dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Billets to the Exchequer, to forbid them paying me my common Assignments. So
I saw my self all at a push brought as low again as I was when I first came young
to <hi>Paris;</hi> and not daring to make my appearance at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> was dismal melancholy
to see my Fortunes utterly broken in a moment of time. The King, however, still
retain'd the same kind inclinations towards me, and sought all opportunities to assure
me that he did so. But he stood in such awe of the Cardinal, who had presum'd to
shock him so boldly upon my account, that he found it necessary to act a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand
upon this occasion, and durst not own his kindness for me publickly. So
that having a mind to speak with me, he sent me a private intimation, and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me a convenient time and place to meet him at; that he might, by all means, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
it from the Author of my disgrace. One would very hardly believe, that a King
should be reduc'd to all these little Contrivances, for fear of one of his Ministers:
But the absolute Authority this Cardinal had got over the whole Kingdom, and the
Pride he took to make the King himself sensible of it sometimes, is well enough
known to justifie the truth of what I say.</p>
               <p>II. One day particularly his Majesty desir'd to speak with me, and sent me Orders
by <hi>Archambaut,</hi> the first Groom of his Bedchamber, (a person whom he lov'd, and
had a particular confidence in) to be in such a Gallery at <hi>St. Germains,</hi> an hour before
day. I was punctual to my time, and when I came near the Centinel, desir'd he would
have no suspition of me, telling him it was by the King's command, that I came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at so unseasonable an hour. The Centinel, upon hearing my Name, told me
he had directions to let me pass, but entreated me to walk at some distance, because
the Rules of the Guard admit no Man to come near a Centinel. So I walk'd in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of the King's coming out, who came out suddenly, and took two or three
turns with me, as it were by stealth; and after some other discourse told me, He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to carry me with him to <hi>Versailles,</hi> but that Night had alter'd his resolution,
and therefore bade me go to his Privy-Purse, who would furnish me with some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
The condition I was in, made me diligent to observe such an Order as that was;
and accordingly I receiv'd 500 Crowns. Which I lookt upon as a plain demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that he did me the honour to have kind remembrances of me still; and that if
it was not in his power to prevent my Misfortune, yet he had a very tender sense of
my Sufferings.</p>
               <p>And here by the way, I cannot forbear mentioning a Visit I made to Monsieur
<hi>Noyers,</hi> who was not my Enemy at the bottom; and therefore I was so free with him,
to ask the Reason of my being us'd at this rate. His Reply was like what the Fathers
of the Inquisition at <hi>Rome</hi> usually make: <hi>You must needs think</hi> (said he) <hi>the King hath
some ground for what he does.</hi> But Sir, <hi>said I,</hi> I am not conscious to my self that I have
done any thing to deserve this. <hi>O look again</hi> (said he) <hi>examine your self, and recollect
better. It is not a likely thing all this should come upon you without some very great provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
He quarrell'd with Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> upon my account, because he, who lov'd
me very well, thought Monsieur <hi>Noyers</hi> was my Enemy, and did ill offices; though
really I dare be bold to say, that he never hated me in his heart.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Idleness,</hi> they say, <hi>is the Mother of Evils;</hi> and so I found, by experience, in the
time of my disgrace. For having then no manner of employment, there happen'd a
very unlucky business, which yet Providence so dispos'd, as to make it the occasion of
great good to me. There was a certain Lady of quality, both rich and beautiful, with
whom Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> was in love, and would fain have married. A Cousin of
<hi>St. Preuil,</hi> and a very pretty Gentleman, was in love with her too, and made the same
pretensions to her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Their Passions thus meeting in the same Object, created, as it
generally does indeed, a mortal hatred and jealousy between the two Rivals. And
Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil,</hi> impatient of any other Pretender, resolv'd to fight him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
their difference this hellish way. It is you know one of the common testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the friendship of the world, to engage ones best Friends in this kind of
wickedness; and accordingly he chose me for his Second, upon this bloody occasion.
But before the design was put in execution, we spent two Months in an employment,
that I cannot without horror so much as mention now; which was to fence every
day together, that we might learn some extraordinary Pass, by which each of us might
quickly dispatch our Man. There was nothing but horrible consequences to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100923:121"/>
from so devilish and mischievous an exercise, if God by a mercy, which I
can never adore sufficiently, had not prevented our putting it into practice at last;
and how that was brought about I will now inform you.</p>
               <p>About this time he put it into my mind to go to Confession, and ask the advice of
some good grave Father with regard to our design. I went to the <hi>Feuillans</hi> of <hi>St. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius</hi>
Street in <hi>Paris,</hi> and desired the first Monk I met, that he would do me the
favour to bring me to the speech of the most pious and most learned person of their
Monastery, because I had a matter of great consequence to impart to him; as indeed
I had felt several pangs of conscience about the matter. Accordingly he sent a very
reverend Father to me, and, as the story will shew you, a very honest man. He
was an old Gentleman, one <hi>Borom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o,</hi> whose very aspect was able of it self to st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ike
terror into such an old Sinner as I was. After our first salutation, I begg'd the favour
of him to hear my Confession, to which he consented. After having revealed to him
among other matters, the present engagements I was under, and what wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
had been used to prepare my self for a Duel; the good Father, full of horror
and amazement to see me in so wretched a condition, said with much vehemence,
and great indignation; <hi>With what face have you dared to come before the Tribunal of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, while you continue under this wicked thought of committing so detestable a fault,
and exercise and fit your self every day to destroy both the body and soul of one of your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?
You are in a worse condition than the Devil himself. For that accursed Spirit de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ires the
ruine of others, because he is ruin'd beyond all redemption himself. But you are within the bosom
of the Church, and a Member of Christ, and yet you, notwithstanding all this, are contriving
to damn one of your own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rothers, and one of your own Members. If this had been some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,
which could not have been foreseen nor prevented, and you had lain under an absolute
necessity of defending your se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>udden transport of passion, your crime had
been much less; and the guilt, tho great even so, had yet made you with such mittigations more
capable of mercy. But to fit and prepare your self for such a cursed action in cold blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for
a long time together to use art and exercise, that you may stab your Brother to the heart with
greater sureness and dext<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rity; Is this to act like a man? Is this agreeable to the Character of
a Christian? I cannot give you any Absolution, while you continue under such Circumstances:
No, God forbid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I should draw your guilt upon my own head if I did; and my Absolution would
be to the full as wicked as your action.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the hearing of these words, pronounced with great zeal and emphasis, I was
perfectly thunder struck, so amaz'd and confounded, that I scarce knew where I
was. But God was pleased to assist me: And I was so far from opposing any thing
the good Father had said to me, that I told him with great temper; He had oblig'd
me very highly in the sharpness he had used; that I was now convinced the design I
had was what both God and Man must needs abhor; and that now all the hopes I
could pretend to, were from the great Mercy of God, and the benefit of his Prayers.
The good Father seeing me so sensibly affected with his reproofs, began to speak to
me in a milder tone, and with great compassion said, <hi>Your fault, Sir, it must be confest
is so great, that it seems to be above all forgiveness; but nothing is impossible with God. You
must implore his Mercy, you must have recourse to Prayers and Tears. And yet, alas! which
way can you ask his Mercy? With what confidence can you pray, or come into his presence, with
so black a guilt about you?</hi> Perceiving my self moved with the affectionate behaviour of
this good Father, and the prevailing power of Truth, I rose up, and he rising at the
same time, I embraced him with most sincere kindness, and told him, That I found
no reason to hope from any thing in my self, but I reposed great confidence in his
Prayers, and I begg'd them of him most heartily. He embrac'd me again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with
the compassion of a true Father answered, <hi>Well, Sir, I promise to remember you in the
holy Sacrifice of the Mass. It is to be hoped that God, for the sake of that blood which Christ
hath shed for Sinners, will hear my Prayers.</hi> I begg'd to know his name, that I might
have the happiness of visiting him sometimes. He told it me, and withal, that he
should be exceeding glad to serve me, and so I went home, very much mov'd with
what had past.</p>
               <p>IV. Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> came, according to his custom, to practice with me as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and was much surprized to hear me say, I intended to trouble my self no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
about that matter; that I had discoursed a man who had dealt plainly with me,
and being very well satisfied with one Lecture upon the subject, I had no inclination
to provoke another. <hi>St. Preuil,</hi> whom all the world knew to be an obstinate man, and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100923:121"/>
who very seldom troubled himself with going to Confession, answered me merrily;
<hi>Nay, now we are come to a fine pass, what new fit of devotion hath possest thee now, man? Thou
art grown mighty conscientious. But prithee where is this man? I would fain speak with him
too. Would you?</hi> said I, <hi>well, and you shall if you will. I am pretty confident he will stun you
as well as me, though you were ten times as wicked as you are. But who is it,</hi> said he again;
I promised to carry him to him, and then told him who it was, and withal, that this
good Father had not spared me, and I was very sure would be no more tender of
him. <hi>I protest,</hi> said <hi>St. Preuil, thou art bravely hoodwinkt with thy Monks, this was the only
qualification wanting to compleat thee. Hark you,</hi> said I, <hi>do not think to put it off with a jest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I am much mistaken if he do not disarm you presently, as much as has done me. Put on all
your Courage, and hector as much as you please, you must do it to purpose, if you are able to stand
before this Monk. Well,</hi> said he, <hi>that's as time shall try.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I carried him to the Monastery, and Father <hi>Borromaeo</hi> coming into the Garden to
us, <hi>Father,</hi> said I, <hi>I have brought you here a wickeder wretch than my self; though I own
that before God I may have more to answer for than he. Pray try if you can convert him.</hi> And
then I went into another walk, leaving them to talk freely together. <hi>St. Preuil</hi> having
opened his case to the good Father, he took him up so roundly, and gave him so
lively a representation of the horrible wickedness of that crime in particular, and his
whole conversation in general, and the dreadful judgments that threatned him for
them, that as stout as he was he brought him down; and he that came thither with
a design to ridicule the Monk, was confounded above what can be exprest. Insomuch
that after we had taken our leave of the Father, he said to me in our way home; <hi>I
have it up to the hilts. He hath talkt to me at such a rate, that if I would be sure of my
Salvation, I should think the only thing I need do, were to turn Capuchin.</hi> I was astonish'd
to find this Monks discourse had made so deep an impression upon his mind. For,
besides that from that instant he laid aside all thoughts of this Duel, it made some
considerable alteration in him; for till then he had been a rank Atheist, and used his
utmost endeavours to corrupt me. I went several times afterwards to visit Father
<hi>Borromaeo,</hi> and was always very much edified by his conversation. But still both
Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> and I were grievously out of the way, which, as I perceive since,
we ought to have taken, if we would have lived like Christians indeed. And we
shall see presently the tragical end of this unfortunate man, whom I always lookt
upon as my friend, and who falling afterwards into Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s disfavour, as
I was at present, came at last to a most unhappy death.</p>
               <p>V. I formerly took notice of some Horses that I lost, while we were besieging <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras:</hi>
But now, while I was out of favour, I lost a most extraordinary one, which I
call'd <hi>Millefleurs,</hi> because he was curiously spotted, and mark'd with all sorts of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.
The manner how he was lost, and return'd to me again, giving an occasion
to speak of the person that stole him, obliges me to give a small account, which I
dare say will be entertaining enough, concerning the man who had not the fortune to
cheat me, till he had exercis'd his faculty first upon almost all <hi>France.</hi> He was the
Son of one <hi>Regis,</hi> a Minister in the City of <hi>Orange.</hi> He had listed himself in the
Emperours service, against his own natural Prince, the King of <hi>France.</hi> At the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
of <hi>Wolfenbuttel</hi> our men took him Prisoner, and he was to have been beheaded,
which is the punishment used to Subjects that bear arms against their own King. But
this young man, who had abundance of wit, made use of it in this extremity, and
pretended he was a Relation of Monsieur <hi>Lesdiguieres,</hi> calling himself the Baron of
<hi>Champoleon.</hi> The Count <hi>de Guebriant,</hi> hearing he was related to Monsieur <hi>Lesdiguieres,</hi>
said, He was too much obliged to Monsieur <hi>de Lesdiguieres,</hi> not to spare the life of
any Kinsman of his. So he committed him to the care of Monsieur <hi>de Choisy de Caan,</hi>
Chancellour to Monsieur the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and Intendant of the Army at t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at
time, that he might conduct him to <hi>Paris.</hi> When they came to the last Inn near
<hi>Paris,</hi> Monsieur <hi>Choisy de Caen</hi> excus'd himself to the young Gentleman, that he had
no convenience of lodging with him at his quarters, because he had a Family there,
a Wife and Children of his own, and it was the custom of <hi>Paris</hi> for every man to
lodge at his own house; but that he should be glad to see him as often as he pleased;
and so gave him at parting ten Pistoles to supply his present occasions.</p>
               <p>VI. Our young Baron, being a person of a great deal of wit, and a most prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
memory, one that talkt pertinently upon all sorts of subjects, and knew all the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:100923:122"/>
Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and understood all the different Interests of their several Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
resolv'd to put a trick upon the Court of <hi>France,</hi> which he did with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
dexterity and address. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound means, by some friends, that he quickly got at
<hi>Paris,</hi> to gain access to Cardinal <hi>Richelieu:</hi> With him he discoursed over all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
and most private Intrigues of <hi>Germany,</hi> and that with so much ingenuity, such
solidity, and in so taking a manner, that he perfectly imposed upon him: And made
him believe that he was an exceeding fit person for his purpose; that he was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with most of the Princes of the Empire; that he could for a word speaking pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
five or six thousand Horse, that this Duke, that Count, and the other Prince,
were ready to furnish him with. The Cardinal had a mind to be satisfy'd in the truth
of what he said, and to that purpose he conferr'd with some of his Confidents, who
were perfectly well acquainted with all the affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> about it. He read over
besides several Memoirs that he had by him, concerning all these several Princes; and
at last finding all agree with what this young Baron had told him, he grew very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
and secure, and therefore having no manner of jealousy about him, he spoke
thus to a person of his own Court; <hi>This young man hath an exact knowledge of all these
matters, we must employ him, and he may be of great use to us.</hi> To put him into a good
disposition for his service, he gave order to Monsieur <hi>des Noyers</hi> to draw a bill for
four thousand Livres for him. He finding the jest turn to so good account (and being a
most extraordinary dextrous person at every thing) presently counterfeited Monsieur
<hi>des Noyers</hi> his Letter, and instead of four, put in twelve thousand Livres, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
it <hi>Noyers</hi> as well as Monsieur <hi>des Noyers</hi> himself. For in truth he could do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he had a mind to, his wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his fingers, his whole body was entirely at his disposal,
he counterfeited all sorts of hands to a miracle, plaid extreme finely upon all kinds of
Musick; and in short he was out at nothing, but did all with a natural easiness, a
grace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ulness and exactness peculiar to him.</p>
               <p>He was not content to over-reach the K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng's Treasury only, but cheated several
private men at the same rate, under prerence of being sent by the Cardinal to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
some important affairs in <hi>Germany.</hi> Among others he attempted to catch the
Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> but this bout he was caught himself, and fell very pleasantly into
his own Net. He went to wait on Monsieur <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and made him a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and elaborate compliment to incline him to grant his request, which was to
give him a Letter of recommendation to <hi>Sedan,</hi> whither he said the Cardinal sent
him, to take that place in his way to <hi>Germany,</hi> and there negotiate some affairs which
the Court had intrusted him with. The favour he desired of Monsieur <hi>Bouillon</hi> was,
that when he came to <hi>Sedan,</hi> he might have a good Convoy to secure his passage for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
The Duke <hi>de Bouillon</hi> could not refuse him, because of the Cardinal, whom he
durst not offend, and therefore writ to his Lieutenant at <hi>Sedan,</hi> and commanded
him to furnish that Gentleman the Bearer with a good Convoy, because he was sent
into <hi>Germany</hi> upon business of great consequence. Our Baron had no sooner got this
Letter, but he counterfeited another extreme like it, and in that wrote to the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
That the Bearer was a Gentleman of great quality, one for whom the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
had a particular affection and esteem, and was sent by him to dispatch some very
important business in <hi>Germany;</hi> therefore it was his order, that he would furnish him
with what Convoy he should desire himself to secure his passage thither, and deny
him nothing he wanted; for he tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ght it very fortunate, that such an occasion as
this offered it self, whereby he might shew the Cardinal how ready he was to serve
him. But he could not tell how to counterfeit the Seal, so conveniently as the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
and therefore was at the trouble of having one made on purpose, from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon Monsieur <hi>Bouillon</hi>'s original Letter.</p>
               <p>After this was done away he went to <hi>Sedan,</hi> where when he had delivered the
forged Letter to the Lie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tenant, he upon reading it promised to see his Master's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
duely obeyed. The young Baron was in great haste to be gone that night,
but the Lieutenant told him that was impossible, for their best Horsemen were abroad
in the Country, and would not come back till the evening, and besides the remaining
part of that day was time little enough to get all things ready; but he promised him
all should be at his service next morning early, and so should three hundred Pistoles,
which was the summ he desired to be furnished with. The young Baron was very
uneasy under this delay, fearing that before next day his trick might some way or
other happen to be discovered. But there was no remedy, and there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore making a
vertue of necessity, and endeavouring to keep up his character, he went to wait
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100923:122"/>
on the Dutchess of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> who was then at <hi>Sedan,</hi> and received him with great civility and respect.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, as ill luck would have it, the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi>'s Secretary came
that very night from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Sedan,</hi> about some business of his Master's. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
understood, that a Gentleman was come from <hi>Paris</hi> a little before, with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from Monsieur <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and orders in it to his Lieutenant to send a good Convoy
with the Bearer, and supply him with two or three hundred Pistoles, if he desir'd it.
He was much surpriz'd that his Master had mentioned nothing of the matter to him,
and said immediately, that he by no means understood the meaning of this being
made a secret to him, that he knew Monsieur <hi>Bouillon</hi>'s temper pretty well, and that
he did not use to scatter his Pistoles so liberally, and that he had a great mind, for
his own satisfaction, to see this Letter. They shewed it him, and upon sight of it;
<hi>Well,</hi> says he, <hi>I cannot deny this Writing and Seal to be my Master's, but still I am mightily
mistaken if this be not a forged Letter; for though it be my Master's hand, I am sure it is not
his sense.</hi> Then he went to wait on the Dutchess of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and told her his thoughts
freely. But this Lady who was cruelly afraid of the Cardinal, was very urgent,
that the Gentleman might have what he wanted. <hi>We do not stand very well with the
Cardinal already,</hi> says she, <hi>and this unaappy accident will quite ruine us. We had better run
the risque on't, and pray let them give him whatever he would have.</hi> The Secretary answered
very resolutely, that he did not question but the fellow was a Cheat, and he desired
to see him before they parted with any thing.</p>
               <p>Next day, when the Baron came to enquire if all was ready, the Lieutenant told
him, he had given orders for every thing, and that he might be going as soon as he
pleas'd; but Monsieur <hi>Bouillon</hi>'s Secretary came thither the last night, and desired to
speak with him before he went. This news a little disordered him, but setting a good
face upon the matter, he reply'd very briskly, That was very well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
glad to see him. They brought them together, and when the Secretary had viewed
him well, he said before all the Company; <hi>Sir, I came from</hi> Paris <hi>since you did, and am a
little surpriz'd my Master should never take any notice to me of the Letter you have brought. I
am pretty well acquainted with his temper, and must own, I can very hardly believe he would
have kept this from me. And besides, I never saw you at our house, though I were there at that
time.</hi> The young Baron in great wrath to find the trick discovered, answered him,
<hi>What it seems you take me for a Cheat then? I would have you to know I am a Gentleman. I
will complain of this usage to the Cardinal. Sir,</hi> said the Secretary, <hi>I will venture what
you please, that this Letter was never written by my Master, tho both the Seal and the Hand
are very like his. You are very rude to me</hi> (said the Gentleman) <hi>and this affront you shall
pay dearly for. Well, Sir,</hi> (said the Secretary) <hi>though it should cost me my life, you shall
not go till I have first written to my Master, and in the mean while you and I will be Prisoners
together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Still Madam <hi>Bouillon</hi> cry'd, <hi>Pray let him go, give him all he wants; this man will be our undoing:</hi> But the Secretary was so obstinate, that both were put under confinement,
as he desired, till they could hear farther from the Duke of <hi>Bouillon.</hi> Some time after,
there came a Minister to make Madam <hi>Bouillon</hi> a visit, who being in great grief about
this business, communicated to him the occasion of all her fear and trouble; and
begg'd he would take the pains to go see this man that they had secur'd. This Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
was well acquainted with the young Baron's Father at <hi>Orange,</hi> and had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
acquainted with him himself. So when he was come into the room, and had
lookt a little earnestly upon him, he recollected his face, and told him he desir'd a
word with him in private. When they were alone, <hi>Ho Sir</hi> (said he)<hi>are not you such
a mans Son? Are not you asham'd to bring a scandal upon your family, by such a pittiful action?</hi>
The young man was much confounded, and confest the whole matter to him; beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
him to excuse the necessity that had driven him to these courses; and assist him
in his present condition, by getting him free of the ill circumstances he lay under.
He told him too, tho the Letter now under examination was, he must confess, a forg'd
one, yet the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> did really give him one much to the same purpose; and
that Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> did indeed make use of him for some business in <hi>Germany;</hi> the
affairs of which Country he understood perfectly well, and had recieved from the
Cardinal a conside<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>able summ of Money to carry on this design. The Minister pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to get him his liberty. And having informed the Dutchess of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and the
Secretary in the truth of the whole story, it was thought the best way to dismiss him
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:100923:123"/>
quietly, and make as little noise of the thing as they could, for fear of disobliging
the Cardinal.</p>
               <p>VII. Upon this he hired him a place in the Coach to go back for <hi>Paris.</hi> But
growing no wiser by his late misfortune, he cheated the Master of the Coach, as well
as he had done other people. For seeing the Book-keeper much perplexed in telling
the Money, because people had paid in several sorts of coin, and odd pieces, he,
who was exceeding ready at every thing, pretended great civility, and told the man,
the tale of that Money was very easy. He took all the Money, and having sorted it
out into several parcels, according to the several kinds of Money, made all the summ
come right presently. Afterwards taking it all in both his hands, and powring it into
the Bag, he contrived to slip s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me of it up into his sleeves, which was never found
out till they came to <hi>Paris;</hi> and then emptying the Bag, they found a great deal
wanting. But he for his part was got off by another wile in this Journey.</p>
               <p>There was an honest old burly <hi>Swisse</hi> rode by the Coach side, and our Baron in
great civility and compassion told him, he saw that travelling on Horseback was very
inconvenient to him, and if he pleased to accept his place in the Coach they would
ease one another, and ride in the Coach by turns. The <hi>Swisse,</hi> who was a good plain
man, at first excused himself from accepting the offer; but at last the Baron was so
obliging, and so importunately civil, that there was no refusing him. So he alighted
and came into the Coach, and the Baron took his Horse. When they came to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at the Inn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he called to the <hi>Swisse Do not trouble your self, Sir, I will lay down for you,
and we will reckon by and by.</hi> Thus he did several times, till a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> last this honest fellow,
with the true simplicity of a <hi>Swisse,</hi> gave him his Purse, and told him he would have

make off, and so he left the Company, and galloped before quite to <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> was, that he found an opportunity of trapping me, as well as other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
He took lodgings in a Taylor's house, and had a room well furnished, making
his Landlord believe, he was a person of great Significance, that he had or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers from
the Cardinal to go into <hi>Germany,</hi> upon a Commission of consequence; that he was
to have the command of seven or eight thousand Horse there, and if he pleased
would make him his Intendant; he promised him mighty matters, and puff'd him up
with wonderful expectations, till by degrees he had hookt him in to provide him a
noble Equipage, a great many fine Cloathes, and abundance of Plate. This gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Taylor, promis'd himself to raise his fortunes this way, and never thought his
Money in any danger, with a person that past for so great a Favourite and Confident
of the Cardinal's, He had a mind to provide him better Lodgings, and brought him
to a very well furnish'd House, where I then lay, and so plac'd him still more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
for the acting his part. He was of so pleasant a Wit, so happy a Memory,
so well vers'd in History, and had such an excellent faculty of setting off all he had a
mind to say, that all that heard him talk were charm'd with his conversation: Every
body strove who should enjoy him most, his company and friendship was courted, as a
person of the best quality and reputation; and he manag'd himself so well, as always to
be thought such a one. In short, he had an art of bewitching all the world to that
degree, that the most nice and ingenious persons were ready to serve him, and thought
it an honour to do it even with their Purse, as well as any thing else. I was as deep
in as other people, and as absolutely charm'd with his company, and professions of
friendship to me. Then he went constantly to wait upon Cardinal <hi>Rich<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lieu,</hi> and
some other great people at Court, and put upon them as cunningly as upon any of
the little ones.</p>
               <p>At last, when he had got a good quantity of Plate and Cloathes together, and sent
them away before him, and provided a handsome Equipage, he set his heart upon my
Horse <hi>Millefleurs,</hi> which was really one of the best and beautifullest Pads that ever
went upon a Road. He borrowed this Horse to go wait upon his Eminence at
<hi>Ruel,</hi> and had ordered his Equipage to stay for him at a place he had appointed them.
No body could suspect any thing from a man that behav'd himself so genteely, and I,
was as easie as others, never scrupled the lending him my Pad, but thought it an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to oblige him. And I paid for my hono<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r: For, instead of going to <hi>Ruel,</hi> he
made directly for <hi>Flanders,</hi> and troopt off with all that he had borrow'd. But by
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:100923:123"/>
good Fortune the Knave was taken Prisoner by a Party out of <hi>Aire,</hi> or <hi>Bethune,</hi> and
my Horse was afterwards retaken by another Party from <hi>Arras;</hi> and there fell into
the hands of an Officer, for whom I had procur'd the Command of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, hearing no news of my Horse, and knowing how the poor
Taylor, and some others that had been concern'd with him, were left in the lurch, I
began to be satisfy'd that I was robb'd as well as they. I wrote away into <hi>Catalonia,
Provence, Flanders, Germany,</hi> and every place where I had any acquaintance, that if they
could light of my Horse, (for he was very remarkable, and generally known) they
should seize him, and send him back to me, for he had been stolen away from me.
Shortly after Monsieur <hi>Bourgailles,</hi> who succeeded me as Major of the Regiment of
<hi>Brezay,</hi> and to whom I had given my Command of first Captain freely, being then
at <hi>Arras,</hi> wrote me word, that the Officer I had spoke of, had my Horse. I sent
away to him presently, and thought he had more honour, and more friendship for me,
than to keep my Horse, which I valu'd so much, from me. But truly his answer was,
He had swapp'd another for him, and there was no reason he should lose by the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
A little after, this Officer's occasions call'd him to <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Major sent me
word he came upon my Horse. I went strait to his Lodgings, as soon as I had this
notice, and not finding him within, examined the Stable. There I found my own
Horse, and bade the Groom saddle him, and when his Master came in, tell him I
had taken him out to go to such a place, and he would not be angry. So I
went
home with my <hi>Millefleurs,</hi> but never heard any more of my Captain, who did not
think fit to come and make his demands, for what he knew well enough he had no
right to. I lost this fine Horse afterwards, when I was taken Prisoner, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
into <hi>Germany,</hi> an account whereof you will find in the sequel of these <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIII. The particular friendship that had been all along between Monsieur <hi>St.
Preuil</hi> and me, ever since my being Lieutenant in his Company of Guards, obliges
me to give an account of his disgrace, and his death, which happen'd at this time,
while I my self was out of favour. I imagine that a Relation of the whole matter
will not be thought tedious or impertinent, and shall therefore lay down the several
heads of Accusation brought against him, because the great intimacy between us,
gave me an opportunity of knowing the whole truth of the Case, and as well what
might be said in his justification, as what he was really guilty in.</p>
               <p>You must know then, that Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> was grown odious, and at last lost
his Head upon four or five Articles; and all this by the judgment of God, who
thought fit to make an Example of the most obstinate Man that perhaps ever was in
the Army. Though the greatest part of the matters alledg'd against him, and which
brought him to ruine, were not, in truth, so much to his disadvantage, as the World
generally believ'd. The first Article was this: A Monk of the famous Abby of <hi>St.
Vast</hi> at <hi>Arras,</hi> bearing a grudge to his Prior, and resolving to be reveng'd on him,
came to see, or some other way gave information to Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil,</hi> that there
were a great many Arms in that Abby which had lay'n conceal'd there, ever since the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> had been in possession of the Town. To confirm this, he left a Note with
him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that signify'd the several places exactly where these Arms were to be found; and
he assur'd him, that there were a great many more besides, conceal'd in a Nunnery of
the same Town. Upon this News, Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> made a Visit to the Prior
of that Abby, and told him, <hi>He was much surpriz'd at an Information that had been
brought him, concerning some Arms that lay hid in his Monastery; and that he must deliver all
those Arms to him, because they were the King's Right.</hi> The Prior would own nothing of
the matter, and Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> told him at last, <hi>He knew well enough where to find
them,</hi> and went away in a passion. But presently after he came again with his Guards,
and ordering search to be made according to the Monk's instructions, he found, and
carried them away, and gave the Prior very rough and threatning language, telling
him, <hi>That he would lay all the Monks Monasteries in the Town flat to the ground; and that
they were only a Nest of Roguish Monks that were Traytors to the King, and held Correspondence
with the</hi> Spaniard. Still this Prior stood it out, that he knew nothing of the matter,
and possibly he might say true; for it is a very common thing for such Religious
Houses to change their Superiors frequently, and sometimes to keep the new comers
in ignorance of many things done the time of their Predecessors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:100923:124"/>
From this Abby, Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> went to the Lady Abbess of the Nunnery
which the same Monk had told him of, and said, <hi>He was much concerned to hear that
they should offer to conceal a great many Arms that belonged to the King, and that he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ome
in his Majesties Name to demand them.</hi> The Lady answer'd, <hi>That truly she had been but
a Year Abbess, and for her part was privy to nothing of that kind; That she believed her Nuns
knew nothing of it neither, but if he would please to come, and satisfy himself, the Gates should
be opened, and no opposition made there to the Service and Interests of his Majesty.</hi> Monsieur
<hi>St. Preuil</hi> took the liberty they offer'd him, and coming at mid-day with a great deal
of company, he went into the Monastery, and took all the Arms away, which were
found exactly in the place he had been directed to. But this created Monsieur <hi>St.
Preuil</hi> a world of Enemies, and rais'd a mighty Clamor against him. The Nuns
Relations gave out, That he broke into the Monastery by Force; that he abused the
Nuns, and expos'd them to be abused by vile profligate Fellows. There was indeed
one Nun in that Monastery exceeding handsom, and all the Town knew it well
enough; and this was it that gave ground to that part of the Accusation. But I,
who knew Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> throughly, dare engage for him, that he could never have been guilty of so brutish an Action. 'Tis possible he might throw out some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful
words against the Nuns, in the passion he was in, to find Arms conceal'd in their Monastery. But this was excusable in a person of his hasty temper, and upon
such an occasion as the Service of his Majesty was concern'd in; and this was so far
countenanc'd above, that when this business came to be known at Court, the King
immediately sent his Mandate to depose the Prior.</p>
               <p>IX. He was more to blame in the second Article alledg'd against him. There was
a Mealman of <hi>Arras,</hi> who<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under pretence of going to buy up Corn in the Enemy's
Frontier Towns, us'd privately to carry them intelligence concerning the condition of
the Town and the Garrison. Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil,</hi> upon information given of this, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
him, and would have had the Law took its course. But the Man's Wife, who
was one of the prettiest Women in all that Country, fell at his Feet in tears, and
begg'd him, for her sake, to spare her Husband's life. Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil,</hi> vanquisht
with her tears, said, <hi>Look you Mistress, I do pardon your Husband for your sake, but let it
be your care that he be guilty of this no more, for I won't pardon him again.</hi> It was said,
that he was too familiar with this Woman, and that her Husband was sensible of it;
nay more, that he kept on his former correspondence with the Enemies, and was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
by them, to suffer his Wife to be thus abused, and pretend ignorance, that so by
her means he might gain a more perfect understanding of the Governour's designs,
and be more capable of doing them service, for which they promis'd to reward him
abundantly.</p>
               <p>This poor Fellow however was caught a second time, and put in Prison. But for
all Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi>'s brave Resolutions to punish him, if he were found faulty any
more, he pardon'd him then too, not being proof against the entreaties and tears of
his Wife, whom he lov'd. But he threatned him however, <hi>That nothing should save him
from the Gallows, if he did so any more.</hi> Three or four Months after, the Mealman, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
still upon the Governour's kindness for his Wife, set the old Trade on foot
again, and carry'd on the same correspondence as before. But then he found himself
mistaken in his Measures; for he that was content to dispense with his Wife's fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to her Husband, only to secure him in the breach of his own to his King, in hopes
of a great Reward from the Kingdom's Enemies, was at last rewarded with a Halter
for all the good services he had done them. A Spy, that was taken at <hi>Arras,</hi> disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
him, and depos'd that he came thither upon this Rogue's perswasion, and upon
the confronting of them, the Mealman was convicted of Treason against the State,
and as such by the Intendant of Justice and President of the Place, was sentenced to be hang'd.</p>
               <p>The condemnation of this Man, as well as he deserv'd it, yet set People bitterly
against Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil;</hi> and every body said, he had hang'd the Husband, that he
might have a freer enjoyment of the Wife. Which was very far from true: For
though he carry'd himself very ill upon her account, as was notorious from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
he made her, yet he did not hang her Husband for any other reason, than his
own manifest guilt. Nay, in truth, he had no hand in condemning him, for all that
was done by the intendant of Justice, and the President. But Providence brought
on Monsieur St. <hi>Preuil</hi> insensibly to his ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e, because of his impiety, and great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:100923:124"/>
And I must own it as a particular mercy, which I can never be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
thankful for, that having great reason to love him, and being extremely obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by him, I was yet in no degree a partaker in his Follies, notwithstanding the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
intimacy between us. It was not long of him that I was not engag'd in his Faults,
for during my disgrace I stole down to <hi>Arras</hi> to see him, and he then took great pains
to draw me into the same disorderly courses with himself. But my sense of Honour,
and the constant regard I had for Justice, made me abhor the Crime I saw him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
in; and I discourst him with so much earnestness, and gave him so lively a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of the consequence he had reason to apprehend from his viciou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> excesses,
that we had like to have quarrell'd downright. <hi>I have no mind</hi> (said I at last) <hi>to lose
my Head with you. And if you do not take heed, some end will come of this, that cannot turn
either to your Honour, or your Advantage, and really I could find in my heart to have no more
to do with you.</hi> What then, <hi>reply'd he with some concern,</hi> have you a mind in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
to make an eternal Quarrel, and renounce all Friendship with me for the future?
<hi>No,</hi> said I, <hi>it is not possible for me to hate you; and I am so far from doing so, that I should be wanting to one of the greatest duties of a Friend, if I should forbear reproving you
upon these occasions. But then I cannot be so complaisant neither, to shew my friendship, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
in things that I am very fearful will turn to your dishonour. 'Tis strange to me,</hi> said I again, <hi>that you should not consider how every body's mouth is open'd against you. They are
eternally complaining of many things which you ought to redress. All this must be naught at last.</hi>
These words made some impression upon him, but not so much as I could have wisht
for his sake they had done. For if he had consider'd what I said as he ought, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of being angry, and taking it ill from me, he should rather have turned his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
against himself, and have taken care to mend.</p>
               <p>X. The third Article was grounded upon nothing but meerly a misfortune, and <hi>St.
Preuil</hi> was in no fault at all about it. The Mareschal of <hi>Melleray</hi> having taken <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paume</hi>
upon Capitulation, it was agreed, that the Garrison should next morning at
eight of the Clock draw off, and go to <hi>Doway.</hi> There was notice given at the same
time to the Governours of the frontier Towns to stop the Couriers, and send out no
Parties, because this Garrison was to go from <hi>Bapaume</hi> at the hour aforesaid, and
would be at <hi>Doway</hi> by three in the Aftereoon. But some hinderances happening, the
Garrison could not move till three or four in the Afternoon, and so was forc'd to lye
abroad all night about a league short of <hi>Doway.</hi> The Convoy allowed them by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal
<hi>Melleray,</hi> being ordered only to see them safe within a league of <hi>Doway,</hi> was
gone back. That evening a Spy brought Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> word, that four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of the Garrison at <hi>Bethune</hi> were making a Sally upon some design; whereupon
a Council was called, at which I my self was present, being then at <hi>Arras</hi> upon a visit
to the Governour, and we were all of opinion, that they might make some attempt
upon the place, and that it was the safest way to put the men all in a readiness, and
command that they should stand to their arms:</p>
               <p>About midnight came another Spy, and he said there were four hundred men
and some Horse sally'd at the Gate over against <hi>Arras.</hi> So, after calling the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
together, it was resolv'd to go out, and face the Enemy. I went along with
Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil;</hi> and we were about six hundred Foot, and three hundred Horse.
When we were at some distance from the place where the Garrison of <hi>Bapaume</hi> was
encamp'd, Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> and I rid on before with a detachment of Horse, and
when Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> saw the fires of their Camp, he said, <hi>These are certainly Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
we must charge them briskly before they are aware of us.</hi> I was not altogether so eager
as he, and therefore enquir'd of him, whether the Road between <hi>Bapaume</hi> and <hi>Doway</hi>
did not lye thereabouts, for possibly it might (I told him) be the Garriso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paume.</hi>
He said, that was impossible, for his Letters said they march'd out at eight
in the morning, and were to be at <hi>Doway</hi> by three in the afternoon the day before. Then
we joyn'd our Troops again, and made ready for fight.</p>
               <p>The Garrison of <hi>Bapaume</hi> seeing us come on to charge them, put themselves in a
posture to receive us, and march'd forward with an intent to defend themselves; but
however they first sent a Trumpet that belong'd to Mareschal <hi>Melleray.</hi> The Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
seeing our men come on hotly, durst not come up to them, but wheel'd about to
recover the Rear of our Troops. So at first there were several shot made on both
sides. Those of <hi>Bapaume</hi> seeing the action come so warmly on, and suspecting we
did not know who they were, call'd out, <hi>Bapaume, Bapaume.</hi> Assoon as ever Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:100923:125"/>
                  <hi>St. Preuil</hi> heard this word, he sounded a Retreat; but the Souldiers were so ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated,
and hot, that there was no keeping them from plundering the Baggage. At
last, when we began to cool a little, we consulted what was fit to be done in this
case. For my part, I told Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil,</hi> that it lookt to me like a very ugly
business; that Mareschal <hi>Melleray</hi>'s honour was at stake, and the mischievous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of injuring that, ought to be prevented by any sort of satisfaction. Monsieur
<hi>St. Preuil</hi> was much of the same opinion, for he saw the dangerous effects of it as well as I.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He went therefore immediately to wait on the Governour of</hi> Bapaume, <hi>and spoke
to him in these very submissive terms;</hi> Sir, I am extremely concern'd at this misfortune
that hath happen'd: I heartily ask your pardon, but I solemnly protest there was no malicious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
on our side. I had notice sent me yesterday, that you would be at <hi>Doway</hi> yesterday by three
in the afternoon without fail, and it is now six in the morning. Who could have imagin'd that you
should be in the field all this while? Besides, I had intelligence that there was a party sally'd out
of <hi>Bethune.</hi> We thought you had been that party, and the rather, because you drew up against
us, without ever sending a Trumpet. You had all the probability in the world against you. As
for what is past, Sir, I assure you, that neither you nor any of your Souldiers shall be losers by it:
For I will order restitution to be made you immediately. You know your self one cannot govern
men always, when they are in the first heat of action: This put it out of my power to contain mine
now, so soon as I desir'd to have done it.</p>
               <p>The Governour, who was a man of honour, made a very civil return, That he was
very well satisfy'd it was purely a misfortune; that the Trumpet they sent was afraid
and so did not deliver his message; and that he thought himself much oblig'd to him
for his civility. Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> order'd all that was taken from them to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd,
and paid some of the Souldiers out of his own Money for what they had lost;
which the Governour resented so kindly, as publickly to acknowledge his generosity.
Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> however was aware what advantage his Enemies might take of
this unhappy accident, to run him down at Court for it, and therefore he entreated
the Governour of <hi>Bapaume</hi> to give him in writing what he had said by word of mouth,
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ign it with his own hand, that if there should ever be need of any such thing, he
might produce it in justification of himself. Which he immediately did, with great
expressions of kindness; and did not only sign it himself, but took care that all the
Captains with him should subscribe it too.</p>
               <p>But, tho the innocence of Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> was so clear in this particular, yet his
Enemies made use of his misfortune to bring a malicious accusation against him: And,
which happen'd very unluckily for him, he was upon no good terms with Monsieur
<hi>Melleray</hi> before. For the Mareschal going to take a view of a City in <hi>Flanders,</hi> went
through <hi>Arras,</hi> depending upon <hi>St. Preuil,</hi> who was much his friend, for seven or
eight hundred Horse, to attend him to the place whither he was going. But he was
much concern'd at <hi>St. Preuil</hi>'s refusal, who told him, he could not possibly let him
have them; for if the Enemy should attempt the place, when the Garrison was so
much weakned, he might hazard the loss both of the Town, and himself. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal
gall'd the Mareschal much, and the more, because he had told Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>
at his coming away, That as for Horse, he was secure of them from the Garrison
of <hi>Arras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XI. The fourth Article was really the strongest and most considerable of them all;
and I was a witness of that too, being at <hi>Arras</hi> when the thing which gave foundation
to it hapned, upon an occasion that I shall now relate, tho I hinted something toward
it before. I was saying, that Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> and I had no very good understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
between us, and I came almost to downright breaking with him for his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances.
Some little time after my return to <hi>Paris,</hi> Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> writ to
Mareschal <hi>Brezay,</hi> that we had had some little ruffle, and he would be glad to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd
to me, and to make his peace by procuring me the Lieutenancy of <hi>Arras,</hi>
which Monsieur <hi>de Plessis Belliere</hi> was content to lay down for my sake, provided he
might be considered for it, which he would undertake to do; therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
him to dispose me for the accepting of this Command; and knowing what an
absolute power he had over me, there was no question but I would do whatever he
would have me. Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> did me the honour to make the motion, without
taking any notice of Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi>'s having written to him about it: And he
urg'd it so far, that I resolv'd upon a Journey to <hi>Arras</hi> for this purpose. Monsieur
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:100923:125"/>
                  <hi>St. Preuil</hi> receiv'd me as he us'd to do, that is, with great civility and respect, and we
supp'd together in very good company. As we were at Supper he spoke to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Aubay,</hi> Commissary of War, who was at Table with us, and desired him to
muster speedily, because the Captains complain'd mightily; and Monsieur <hi>d'Aubray</hi>
reply'd very civilly, He would do it whenever he pleased.</p>
               <p>Next day very early all the Officers in the Garrison beset Monsieur <hi>Aubray</hi>'s lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
making a clamour, and demanding the Money that was due to them. He, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
in all likelihood to see himself so importun'd, answered them pretty roughly,
That he had his orders, and it was not their business to correct his Commission, that
he would take his own time to prevent false musters, and do it when they least ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
it. The Officers, as much provoked with his answer, as he was with their
demand, came streight to Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil,</hi> and complained to him of Monsieur
<hi>Aubray,</hi> that he would not pay them; that he always cheated them, and put them off,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> went presently to Monsieur <hi>Aubray</hi>'s lodging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and desir'd me
to go along with him, which both I and the Officers did. He told him at first, that
he was come to see if he would please to appoint a muster that day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Monsieur
<hi>Aubray</hi> made answer, that his order was his direction, and he should take his own
time. <hi>How!</hi> said Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil, you gave me your word, it should be done when I
pleased. Sir,</hi> said the Commissary, <hi>I must not depart from the King's orders, I must look
after my own business, and you to yours. I will make you do it,</hi> said <hi>St. Preuil.</hi> So from
compliments they fell to sharp words, and at last from words they fell to blows. For
Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> being extremely passionate, was transported so far as to Cane him;
and if I had not immediately stept between to part them, this scuffle had gone a
great deal further. I was the only man indeed that was for it, or took Monsieur <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi>'s
part at all, for all the Officers were exceeding glad to see him so ill used. I
foreseeing what scurvy consequences this unhappy business might have, and that this
single action was enough to ruine Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil,</hi> did all that ever I could to
make it up, before Monsieur <hi>Aubray,</hi> who was related to Monsieur <hi>Noyers,</hi> writ
any thing of the matter to Court; and I brought Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> so far, as to
agree to make him any satisfaction. But he would accept of none, threatning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
to complain to the Cardinal, and the King. At last, finding it was not in
my power to bring this business to any good conclusion, I went my way back to <hi>Paris,</hi>
without troubling my self any farther about the affair that brought me to <hi>Arras,</hi>
where I could plainly foresee, there would in a little time be great changes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>
               <p>XII. Going one day to wait on Monsieur <hi>des Noyers,</hi> as I was coming in at the
Chamber, I saw him in discourse with the Count <hi>de Charost,</hi> and therefore stood still
at the door. They happened just then to be talking of Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil,</hi> and
Monsieur <hi>Noyers</hi> in a great heat, said so loud that I could hear him, That he made
mad work in the Garrison at <hi>Arras;</hi> that he had raised several imposts upon the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
that he broke into a Monastery by force, and abused some of the Nuns; that
he first debauch'd a Mealman's Wife, and then hang'd her Husband to have her more
absolutely at his command; and that he had abus'd a Commissary of the Army. The
Count <hi>de Charost</hi> seeing me as this discourse past, said, <hi>Yonder is one hears you, who can
inform you of him, for he was his Lieutenant.</hi> Monsieur <hi>des Noyers</hi> answered, <hi>Ho, I know
Monsieur</hi> Pontis <hi>was</hi> St. Preuil<hi>'s Lieutenant, and therefore he will be sure to excuse him.</hi>
Then I went up to them, and said to Monsieur <hi>Noyers, I must confess I had been parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
obliged to Monsieur</hi> St. Preuil, <hi>but yet I should be very far from excusing any thing
he had done ill in, because I was sensible, whatever I was indebted to him, I owed the King a
great deal more. Well then</hi> (said he) <hi>is not it true that he broke into a Monastery, and forc'd
some of the Nuns? Sir,</hi> said I, <hi>I dare give you my Oath, nay I will forfeit my hand if he ever
did. I know very well he went thither to take away some Arms that lay concealed in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery;
but the King himself declared his approbation of that, by the Mandate he sent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the Prior from the Abby of</hi> St. Vast, <hi>and the Abbess from her Nunnery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this Monsieur <hi>Noyers</hi> grew warm, and maintain'd that he said nothing but
what he certainly knew to be true; and he had it from very good hands, that he
hang'd the Mealman on purpose to enjoy his Wife. I answered, he did not hang him,
till he had been caught three times, and plainly convicted of holding correspondence
with the Enemies. I kept my self still to those things I was well assured of, and said
not a word of the rest, to shew him, that I was concern'd to justify the innocence
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:100923:126"/>
only, and not the real faults of Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil.</hi> But Monsieur <hi>Noyers,</hi> who was
violently prejudiced against him, inveigh'd against him still warmly, insomuch that at
our going out the Count <hi>de Charost</hi> told me, It would become me as <hi>St. Preuil</hi>'s friend,
to desire him, that he would take some course to compose this business, and lose no time
in making his peace. I went presently, and told Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> all I had heard
Monsieur <hi>Noyers</hi> say against <hi>St. Preuil.</hi> He told me I had best go to him as fast as I
could, and let him know from him, that it was absolutely necessary he should come
to <hi>Paris,</hi> and reconcile himself with Mareschal <hi>Melleray</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Noyers,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
came on't; that all his friends would use their interest for him, and that if he
himself, that was the Cardinal's Brother-in-law, had those two Enemies, they would
have it in their power to ruine him. I entreated him to write a Note, that Monsieur
<hi>St. Preuil</hi> might be more inclin'd to believe me. But he utterly refused that, and said,
<hi>No, not I; for though I say this to thee now, if thou shouldst tell any one that I said it, I should
give thee the lye.</hi> I told him, I hoped there would be no occasion for that, for I should
be sure to tell no body.</p>
               <p>Immediately then away went I post to <hi>Arras,</hi> and after discoursing Monsieur <hi>St.
Preuil</hi> till three a clock in the morning, I brought him at last to resolve for <hi>Paris</hi> next
day. We took Horse and travelled together accordingly. but after a little while he
changed his mind. For by that time he had gone six or seven leagues, he turn'd his
Horse head all on a sudden, and told me, He would not stir from <hi>Arras,</hi> for when once
they had him at <hi>Paris,</hi> they would take his Government away from him. All that
ever I could say would not perswade him otherwise. For in truth he was struck from
Heaven, and condemned already by a decree of the divine Justice. So we both went
back to <hi>Arras;</hi> and I finding it was impossible for me to prevail with him, or do him
any good, was loth to stay and partake in his misery, and therefore return'd to
<hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIII. In the mean while his Enemies made it their business to possess the King,
and Carninal <hi>Richelieu</hi> against him, especially Mareschal <hi>Melleray</hi> (who was grievously
offended at him, for the accident to the Garrison of <hi>Bapaume;</hi> and still remembred
his being denied the Convoy of Horse he requested of him) gave this Statesman so
ill an opinion of him, that it was an easy matter for Monsieur <hi>Noyers,</hi> when he backt
all the rest with a fresh charge, to ruine him compleatly. The King and Cardinal
being thus displeased with him, Mareschal <hi>Melleray</hi> had orders to secure him as he
went into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to have an eye upon <hi>Lisle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Mareschal was come near <hi>Arras,</hi> he sent to Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> to order
quarters for the Army. Every body then thought him lost, and some of his friends
advised him to shut the Gates, telling him, that since he must dye, he had better
do it with his Sword in his hand, than by the stroke of an Executioner. But he very
bravely reply'd, he would never be guilty of taking up arms against his King; that
he knew Mareschal <hi>Melleray</hi> was a man of generosity, and he would go meet him
himself. Accordingly he did with fourscore or a hundred Horse, and when he
alighted to compliment him, the Mareschal dismounted too; and after those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments
were over, they rode on together. Monsieur <hi>Melleray</hi> told him, he was
order'd to lodge part of the Troops in <hi>Arras,</hi> and ask'd him if he had made any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for it. Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil</hi> answered, that he had taken care for every thing.
He asked him again what Regiments he should bring into the Town. <hi>St. Preuil</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
that his own should lodge there by all means, and that he had drawn all the
Souldiers of the Garrison into a corner of the Town to make room for them.</p>
               <p>When they were come to the <hi>High-street</hi> of <hi>Arras,</hi> the Troops were distributed on
all sides, and when all was secured, Monsieur <hi>Melleray</hi> immediately told Monsieur <hi>St. Preuil,</hi>
that he was sorry his duty obliged him to tell him, that he had the King's order to
secure his person. So poor <hi>St. Preuil</hi> was apprehended, and afterwards carried to <hi>Amiens,</hi>
where he continued Prisoner several months. I would fain have gone to see him in
Prison, and begg'd the King's leave to do it. But his Majesty referr'd me to the
Judges that were to try him, and they denyed me, because no body was suffered to
come at him. It was certainly a great mercy, that he fell thus into disgrace with
men, when his fortune and advancement had made him proud and haughty, and
banish'd all thought of his Souls safety. And such he acknowledg'd it before his death,
telling his Confessor in Prison, that God had suffer'd this misfortune to come upon
him, to awaken his thoughts and remembrance of him, for he had all along forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:100923:126"/>
God, and liv'd in wickedness. All this happen'd while I was in disgrace. For
tho orders were sent me not to stir out of <hi>Paris,</hi> yet I very often took journeys pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately;
but with this caution, that I first gave notice of it to some of my friends,
that had the best interest, as Mareschal <hi>Brezay,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Charost,</hi> that if there
was occasion, they might excuse it to the Cardinal.</p>
               <p>XIV. About the same time Mareschal <hi>Brezay,</hi> who (as I have said before) ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
me with a very particular affection and esteem, would needs undertake one
day to make my peace with the Cardinal, in whom he had a very good interest. He
bad me meet him one morning very early at the Capuchins in <hi>St. Honorius</hi> street, and
he would take me along with him to <hi>Ruel.</hi> This offer was very welcome, because I
was quite tir'd with the pittiful sort of life I then led at <hi>Paris.</hi> I came exactly to
the time and place appointed, and so did he, and away we went both together to <hi>Ruel.</hi>
But we found he had undertaken more than he was able to perform: For as we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
the Cardinal, who was walking in his Garden, after the first address, and a
little discourse, Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> told him, There was one <hi>Pontis</hi> behind his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
who was very desirous to pay his duty to him. The Cardinal, assoon as ever
he turn'd about, and saw me, cry'd <hi>Your humble Servant;</hi> the very compliment with
which he always dismist the people he hated. I understood that language well enough,
and knew he meant by it, that I had nothing to do but to walk off. Which I did
as fast as I could; and taking Horse rode a good round rate back to <hi>Paris,</hi> fancying
I heard the Cardinals <hi>Humble Servant</hi> perpetually sounding in my Ears. Mareschal
<hi>Brezay</hi> told me afterwards, I was to blame in going away so soon; I told him, if the
door had not been open, I would have jumpt over the wall; and that there was no
staying for me after such a Compliment.</p>
               <p>But another worse business with his Eminence happen'd to me shortly after, which
might very well have been my utter ruine, and yet by a strange turn of Fortune turn'd
to my advantage, and brought me into favour again. I confess, whenever I reflect
upon it still, I cannot imagine which way it was possible for me to get clear of such a
miscarriage so luckily; and how a mighty Minister of State, who had sought all
occasions to undo me, should yet, when he found one so much for his purpose, make
no other use of it than to express his kindness, and try afresh to win me over to his
service. The manner of it was thus:</p>
               <p>XV. Monsieur <hi>Cinqmars,</hi> Grand Querry of <hi>France,</hi> was at that time violently bent
against the Cardinal, and was forming a strong Cabal against him, who stood then the
common Mark for all the great Men at Court to aim at. He knowing me to be one
that stuck close to the King's service, and consequently the Cardinal's Enemy, thought
it might be for his purpose to engage me in his design of supplanting this Man, whom
no body was able to endure. And supposing my present disgrace might incline me
yet more, sent a Confident of his, one <hi>Fouquerolles,</hi> Lieutenant of a Troop of Light-Horse,
and told me by him, That since my Misfortunes were owing to Cardinal
<hi>Richelieu,</hi> who intended my utter ruine, I should come in to him, who was able to
support me against this Tyrant, promising me besides a great many fine things, which
there is no need of mentioning now. This was when the King design'd his Journy
to <hi>Perpignan,</hi> and so he pretended to engage me to go thither.</p>
               <p>I was much perplex'd what course to take upon this occasion. For it was easie to
foresee Monsieur <hi>Cinqmars</hi> his ruine, and I made no question but he must at last be
crusht by so formidable an Enemy. But then I was afraid too, that the Grand Querry
after having open'd himself so freely to me, should take some pique if I refused him.
However, till I had time to consider better of the matter, I thought the safest way
would be to shelter my self under the King's command not to stir from <hi>Paris.</hi> So I
told <hi>Fouquerolles,</hi> that Monsieur <hi>le Grand</hi> had done me a greater honour than I could
deserve, in remembring me at a time, when almost all my Friends had forgotten me;
that I should be sensible of it as long as I liv'd, and retain all the gratitude that so
particular a Favour requir'd. But the King having expresly charged me not to go
from <hi>Paris,</hi> I could not then comply with the offer he made me, but I entreated him
to believe, that if I could undertake that Journey without a breach of duty, I should
be entirely at his disposal, and therefore I desir'd he would give me time to ask my
Friends advice about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:100923:127"/>
I then wrote to Monsieur <hi>Vitremont</hi> my particular acquaintance, to desire he would
discourse Monsieur <hi>de Vennes,</hi> another of my Friends, upon the business. I would not
mention Monsieur <hi>Cinqmars,</hi> but only told them in general, That I was at a great loss
what to do upon this juncture of the King's going to <hi>Perpignan,</hi> whether I should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him, notwithstanding the Order that was sent me, and which, I was satisfy'd,
came only from the Cardinal. But the Error I committed was, that writing in a
passion, I inveigh'd bitterly against him, and laid him out in his true colours, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
him in scurrilous terms, as Hat, and Redcap, and the like. I took all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
care that this Letter should be deliver'd into the person's own hand to whom it
was directed; but notwithstanding all my caution, the Cardinal got it, who kept a
strict eye upon me; and though I had given this fresh provocation, yet by a new
and surprizing fetch of Politicks, he turn'd all his Rage to Favour, and an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of persuading me to be a Creature of his, as I shall shew presently.</p>
               <p>XVI. The King was then at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> and intended to set out from thence for
<hi>Perpignan.</hi> He did me the Favour to send his trusty <hi>Archambaut</hi> to me, to bid me
make ready to attend him. I askt <hi>Archambaut</hi> whether he had brought me this Order
in writing, who told me, No. Then speaking freely to him as a Friend, I said, That
having a written Order not to stir from <hi>Paris,</hi> and no written one to go, if the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
should think fit to call me to an account for this, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> I should soon see my self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
by the King himself, and left to the mercy of one who was sure never to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
me, and therefore I could not go from <hi>Paris</hi> without another kind of Order than
that he brought me. But I have thought upon a method (said I) to bring my self
off in this business. I am satisfy'd thou lov'st me, and therefore prithee tell the King
that you found me very ill. And, in truth, I am so much worse than if I had a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and my circumstances were better. And this was my real sense at that time, my
heart was set upon nothing but Favour at Court; and while I was out there, I could
never think my self tollerably well. So little impression had the inconstancy of such
Favour made upon me, though I had great and long experience of it, both in the
case of several great persons, and in my own. The Sieur <hi>d' Archambaut</hi> promis'd to
deliver the King this message, as I desir'd him. So when he came back to <hi>Fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau,</hi>
he told the King he found me very much out of order, and yet that I exprest so
great inclination to wait upon his Majesty, as soon as I receiv'd the message, that it
was very plain I was still the same Man, and as zealous to serve him as ever; but in
all probability if I should venture upon this Journey, in the condition I then was, it
might endanger my life. All this was exactly true, though not in that sense the King
understood it. His Majesty exprest himself very well satisfy'd with my fidelity and
good inclinations. But was loth I should hazard my life to so little purpose, and
therefore commanded <hi>Archambaut</hi> to write to me in his Name, that he charg'd me
not to travel till I was perfectly well again. And this was not till after his return
from <hi>Perpignan;</hi> and then there was an end of my disgrace, just where another Man's
was most likely to begin.</p>
               <p>XVII. The King travelling by way of <hi>Roussillon,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Coliovre</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing
taken from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> there happen'd a Quarrel between Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> and
the Grand Querry, who both desired the Government of this place for one of their
Creatures. Monsieur <hi>le Grand</hi> having made his application first, carried it from the
Cardinal, who was answered afterwards by the King, that he had put it out of his
power, by promising it to another before. The Cardinal knew well enough that the
Grand Querry was that other, and lookt upon himself as extremely affronted, that
one, whom he had raised, and was since become his Enemy, should get this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
out of his hands. He thought himself absolute Master of all, and that it was
a Condescension to ask what was in his own power, and was much enraged at the
King's re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>using him: and concluding, that the malice of his Enemies was at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of all this, he began to apprehend a shock in his Fortunes, for he was very sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that there were strong Cabals against him. For this Reason he resolved shortly
after to withdraw into a place of safety, that if any thing should happen, he might
secure himself by a retreat. These are great Mysteries, and such as I do not pretend
to give an account of here.</p>
               <p>All that is pertinent for me to add is, that before he took that last refuge, he contriv'd,
by a very cunning fetch, to play me against the Grand Querry, and use my name to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:100923:127"/>
carry his point against an Enemy, whom he could not with any patience see gratify'd
before himself. Tho all my disgrace was owing to him, yet knowing that the King
had no aversion to me, and that it was uneasie to him to have me kept thus
from about him, and all by a constraint in which himself had no hand, he thought he
might possibly obtain that in my behalf, which had been deny'd him before: And
would not baulk the doing a kindness to an Officer that he hated, if he could but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
the affront and repulse he was afraid of, upon his chief Enemy. He pretended
therefore to be concern'd for me, and to have me in his thoughts upon this occasion,
and with his usual simplicity, (when the King had refus'd him this Government for
his own friend) said, <hi>But pray Sir, does your Majesty never think upon poor</hi> Pontis? <hi>he hath
nothing, and wants this; and besides, that his services may give him a title to this Government,
for his reward, he will take more care in it, and manage it better than any body else?</hi> The King
saw thro this disguise presently, (as himself did me the honour to tell me afterwards)
for he knew my present misfortunes were all his work; and this was nothing but his
own Interest, under the pretence of compassion, which he put on upon this occasion.
The King had no mind to let him know he smelt the design, and therefore seeming
to relish the proposal very well, he reply'd very readily; That as for the man (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me) he had no objection against him; but he had past his word already, and it
was no longer at his disposal. So the Cardinal, that had with so much artifice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
a kindness for me, and all to serve himself indeed, saw at last this Plot, tho
so well laid, fall through; and was forc'd to take other methods for the suppressing
his Enemy; as he afterwards did, and as our Histories shew; where you find a
long account of the tragical end that the Grand Querry, and his Confident, Monsieur
<hi>de Thou,</hi> came to at last, and what occasioned the fall of those great men.</p>
               <p>XVIII. When the Cardinal had taken care of their Tryal, he return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi>
and went from <hi>Lyons</hi> the very day appointed for their execution. His March from
<hi>Lyons</hi> to <hi>Paris</hi> was one of the most remarkable things that ever was heard. He being
not well, contriv'd to travel without ever stirring out of his Bed, which was, to be
carry'd as he lay, Bed and all, by sixteen men. He went into no House where he
lodg'd at the door, but Monsieur <hi>Noyers,</hi> one of his dearest Servants, performing the
office of a Harbinger, went always before, and took care to break down the sides of
the House, and make a passage by the Windows of the Room where he was to lye.
Then they built a Scaffold too in the Street, and steps to go up to it, that so by this
passage his Eminence and his Bed of State might be brought into his Chamber.</p>
               <p>There were Chains stretcht all along the streets of <hi>Paris,</hi> to hinder the crowd and
clutter of people, who came from all patts to gaze at the triumphal Entry of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
and Minister of State, laid at ease in his Bed, and returning in pomp after the
Conquest of his Enemies. I was there among the rest when he went by, and stood
in <hi>La Verrery-street.</hi> He was not so sick, but he could look round about upon the
crowd, and seeing me among them, he call'd to the Lieutenant of his Guards, who
went close by his Bed; <hi>I saw Monsieur</hi> Pontis <hi>just now, go tell him I would have him come
to the Cardinals Palace, at my alighting.</hi> The Officer came, bawling among the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and enquir'd if I were there. I heard him name me, and shew'd my self, and then
he deliver'd me the Message the Cardinal had commanded him. My friends began
to blame me, for being so unwise to appear, saying, that some mischief was now
coming upon me; That the Cardinal must needs have a bad meaning, that I was
too hot, and ought not to have tempted an unnecessary danger. I, on the contrary,
who had all the confidence of an innocent man, and never suspected my Letter's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
intercepted, told them I was resolved to go, and see what the Cardinal had to
say to me; and accordingly went straight to his Palace, at the very time he came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
There I presented my self among the rest, but there being abundance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
either I was not discern'd in the crowd, or, if I was, he would not speak to me
before so many people, but put it off to some more seasonable time. As he came
in, he said with a seeming satisfaction; <hi>Ah, God be blest, there is no pleasure like being at
one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s own home.</hi> And as the persons, through the midst of whom he past, prostrated
themselves with a very profound respect, he only said to them, <hi>Your humble Servant;</hi>
but it was with an air very distant from that that he said it to me in, when he chas'd
me with this Compliment out of his Garden.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:100923:128"/>
XIX. When I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aw he took no notice of me, I desired the Lieutenant of his Guards
to let his Eminence know, I had been there in obedience to his command. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
he would, and entreated me to come again next day for an answer. I came
several times before I could be admitted to speak with the Cardinal, who for several
days was taken up with visits from persons of quality, that came to make their Court
to him, after so long a Journey. At last, as I was one day with Monsieur President
<hi>Mole</hi> in the Antichamber, word was brought, that his Eminence asked for me; so
being introduced, even before the President himself, as soon as I came in, they that
were near his bed withdrew into a corner of the room, all but two Pages that were
in waiting at the beds feet. I came near and kneeled down, and kist his Robe. The
first question he asked me was, Why I did not go with the King to <hi>Perpignan?</hi> I told
him, that having received an order not to stir from <hi>Paris,</hi> and not any other after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to warrant my going, neither from his Majesty nor his Eminence, I durst
not presume to go. <hi>And is that,</hi> said he, <hi>the true reason why you did not go?</hi> I told him,
I had no other, but my fear of disobeying the King and his Eminence. <hi>But is there
not</hi> (said he again) <hi>some private reason that prevail'd with you to stay behind? For if the Kings
consent was all you wanted, I am sure he is too gracious to have denied you. There must needs be
some secret cause, which you have no mind to discover. Your Eminence knows very well</hi> (said
I) <hi>that it was by no means fit for such a one as I, to desire the King would give me leave to be
about him, when I had been forbid his presence, for some reasons, which it did not become me to
enquire into. I am sure</hi> (reply'd he) <hi>the King would not have taken it ill from you, and you
might easily have found friends, who would have undertook to speak for you, without applying to
the King in your own person. My Lord</hi> (said I) <hi>that's very true, but I beg leave to tell your Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
that I have all along made it my busi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ess, to trouble those that honour me with their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
as little as I could, and seldome to make use of them upon my own account. I am sensible
the King is very gracious to me, and for that reason have received his corrections as well as his
favours thankfully, because the greater his goodness has been to me, the greater I am satisfied is
my fault, when I have offended him. I am very glad</hi> (said the Cardinal) <hi>to find this is your
temper, for no body can have too grateful a sense of the King's favours. But methinks for all
that, a man is to blame, when he does not shew a just value for the happiness of being near his
Majesty; and that it looks too like a slight, when one is so unconcerned, and it is indifferent to him
whether he enjoy his presence or not. And there is a great deal of difference between being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
to ones friends, and desiring them to intercede for him upon such occasions: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I cannot believe but you had some other reason, which you would not have me know; for in
short, no Prince is so far provok'd, but that there may be means found to soften him again.</hi> He
did me the honour to talk after this free manner, and we lookt as if there had been a
sort of friendly contest between us, he still upon the attack, and I upon the defensive
part. At last, finding his questions were so often repeated to no purpose, and that I
stood my ground, he said, Since I would not satisfy his questions, he would not satisfy
me why he sent for me. But bids me go from him to Monsieur <hi>Noyers,</hi> and he should
tell me; commanding one of the Pages of his Chamber, whose name was <hi>la Grise,</hi> to
go with me to Monsieur <hi>Noyers</hi> lodgings.</p>
               <p>XX. This mighty earnestness of the Cardinal's to know what kept me behind at
<hi>Paris,</hi> cost me a great many reflections. I had no intimation yet of my Letter, that I
wrote upon this account, being got into his hands, and I fancied all his uneasiness
might proceed from an accident some time before, which made him very jealous of
me. Being one day with the King, his Majesty beckned me after him into the
Wardrobe. It was a place where I never had been, and so did not presume to follow
him. But he ordered the Gentleman Usher to call me in. Then sitting down very
thoughtful upon a Chest, he began to ask me, What was the meaning, that all the
Captains to whom he had given Commissions had quite forsaken him, and that scarce
any of them gave any attendance about his person? I made the best excuse I could for
them, telling the King in general, that the old Officers were quite wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n out with
hardships and wars, and no longer capable of doing the business of their places;
several had lost their limbs, and were maimed in the service, and some perhaps might
be weary with the fatigue of the Army. The King replyed, and asked me more
particularly, What should be the reason that such a man (naming him) left his service,
and was gone off to the Cardinal's. I said to him freely, and without any hesitation, <hi>He
could be no great gainer by the change, that left the Master, and put himself under the Servant.</hi>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:100923:128"/>
These were my own words, and such as I am sure the King was well<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pleased to hear.
This poor Prince then began to reckon upon his fingers the persons that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
him, lamenting in some measure his own misfortune. And I must needs say,
tho I tryed to excuse them as well as I could, yet I was much affected to see so great
a Monarch abandoned by the greatest part of his own Servants; and could not but
be amazed, (considering the honour and affection I bore him) how any body could
betray so poor a spirit, as to prefer the service of a Subject before his, though that
Subject were never so great. He seem'd to me to be extremely pensive and uneasy,
all the time we were together, turning the discourse perpetually from one subject to
another, sometimes sitting quite mute, and sometimes asking some foreign questions;
so that, knowing that he did not use to talk at this loose rembling rate, I concluded
something lay heavy upon his mind, which he was loth to declare, though he would
have been glad, if I could by degrees have stumbled upon it. For the King having at
that time a great design in agitation against Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> there was reason to
imagine he had a mind to intrust me with some secret relating to that matter.</p>
               <p>But it happened that our discourse was interrupted all on a sudden, by Count
<hi>Nogent,</hi> who peep'd either through a crack in the door, or the Key-hole; which the
King perceiving, asked if any body were there. Then Count <hi>Nogent</hi> scratching at the
door, the King in a surprize rose up so hastily, that he had almost beat me backward,
discove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing by his behaviour, that he was concern'd at our being found together in
that place. As soon as Monsieur <hi>Nogent</hi> was come in, he told the King, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
had sent him to know whither his Majesty intended to stay within, because his
Eminence would wait on him. The King said, the Cardinal should be very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
Afterwards this Count asked me privately, what the King was talking of
with so much vehemence and gesture, giving me to understand, that he suspected
something from our discourse. I confess I had a great mind to check his curiosity, and
tell him he meddled with what did not concern him: But fearing a man of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
with the Cardinal, I only answered, That the King, as he used to do, talked
several things about the Armies, the Souldiers, and the Officers. He suspected this
to be no better than a put off; and replyed, That there was something else in the
wind. And when he came back to the Cardinal, he raised some jealousies of me,
telling him he found me alone with the King in the Wardrobe, and that his Majesty
had committed some secret of consequence to me.</p>
               <p>XXI. This private and familiar conference with the King it was, that I imagined
the Cardinal had a mind by degrees to get out of me, when I waited him upon the
occasion before mentioned. When the Cardinal's Page had brought me to Monsieur
<hi>Noyers</hi> his lodging, his Eminences Livery made me way through all the crowd, that
waited to be admitted. Every one made me room, in respect to the Page that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
me. And going with him directly up to Monsieur <hi>Noyers</hi> his Chamber,
after our first compliments, when he understood the Cardinal had sent me to him, he
took me with him into his Closet. There he began to put the same questions the
Cardinal had done before, asking me over and over again, Why I did not go with
the King to <hi>Perpignan.</hi> I found presently, that this was a thing agreed between the
Cardinal and Monsieur <hi>Noyers,</hi> and that I had reason to think they had some private
intelligence of the business. I thought it the idlest thing in nature to ask me so many
times the reason of a thing, which they knew better than I, and if I durst have been
so bold, could almost have found in my heart to be downright angry: But I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
who I spoke to, and kept within bounds for fear of the Cardinal, and stuck
close to the answer I had made his Eminence; That having been served with an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from the King, signed by Monsieur <hi>Noyers</hi> himself, not to stir out of <hi>Paris,</hi> he
must have been the first that would have condemned me if I had gone. Still he
turn'd and wound me about a hundred several ways, in hopes to make some discovery
from me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But when he saw me proof against all his cross questions, after a great deal
of this discourse, he reacht a File of papers that lay upon his Table, and drew off that
fatal Letter written to Mr. <hi>Vitremont,</hi> concerning the King's Journey, and full of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
upon the Cardinal; and giving it into my hand, said, <hi>Look upon that Letter a
little<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> see if you know your hand and seal again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No tongue can express the confusion I was in, when this Letter was produc'd against
me, which I could not think should ever fall into those hands, without Witchcraft;
for I thought my self secure, both of the person with whom it was entrusted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100923:129"/>
and of him to whom it was sent; but the latter hath protested to me several
times since, that he never receiv'd it. At last, not being able to deny my hand, nor
used to flinch upon these occasions, I rather chose to own the whole thing freely,
and said very bluntly, <hi>'Tis true, Sir, I own this Hand and Seal to be mine: This Letter I
must confess was written by me, and consequently I am oblig'd to own all the contents of it, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
my Head were to pay for it before night.</hi> Monsieur <hi>Noyers</hi> was well enough pleas'd with
this frank acknowledgment, but yet he took me up pretty roundly, and spoke with
all the vehemence imaginable: <hi>This is fine</hi> (said he to me) <hi>here you have had the impudence
to use the Cardinal at this rate, who is the greatest and best Genius in the World; one that does
good to all mankind; and one that raises such as are worthy of his favour, out of the dust, and
advances them to the highest and most honourable posts; one that is ever labouring, and makes
it his whole business to satisfie all the Kings Subjects; and obliges his very Enemies; nay, one
that at the very time when you were reviling him after this scandalous manner, try'd to do you
service, and begg'd the Government of</hi> Coliovre <hi>of the King for you. And is it possible that
little inferiour Officers should fall foul upon the power above them so insolently; and so far forget
themselves, as to reproach and affront those persons, that their Prince thinks fit to trust with the
care and management of his Kingdoms?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer'd him, That I confest my self to blame to use such language of a person,
to whom I ow'd all possible respect; but I begg'd him not to take it ill, if a poor
Prisoner as I was, let fall any indiscreet complaints, and cry'd louder than was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming.
That this was the only liberty left the afflicted, to unload their breasts by
lamenting their misfortunes. That the world does not think any body the more guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
nor at all resent it, if they forget respect a little upon these occasions; because
then it is not so much the person that speaks, as the passion. <hi>This, Sir,</hi> said I, <hi>is the
only ease poor Prisoners have left: Their tongues are not confined, they express themselves free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and no body thinks the worse of their cause for it. Nature, Sir, puts us upon complaining
when we are hurt; and it looks like stupidity to suffer and stand mute all the while. In short, I own
I had not so much temper as I should have had; but I dare say you your self have so much goodness,
as to excuse me in my misfortune, when I was sensible of nothing I had done to deserve it, and
yet saw my self struck to the ground on a sudden, and opprest with a load so heavy, as that of my
disgrace is to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Monsieur <hi>Noyers</hi> was moved with my way of expressing my self, and besides I do
not question had secret instructions to make the best of this occasion to invite me into
the Cardinals service; so he told me, he would speak to the Cardinal in my behalf,
and undertook to make my peace most willingly; to shew me by this instance that
he rerlly lov'd, and was not less my friend now, than he had ever been. So I took
my leave, and told him I should acknowledge my obligations to him. I went home, and
was amazed at the several little fetches, and politick designs of this great Statesman,
who hated me for my fidelity to the King, and had long waited for a fair pretence
to undo me, and yet chose rather to improve this occasion that offer'd it self to him,
into a means of fixing me to himself, than of my utter ruine.</p>
               <p>XXII. I went several times to Monsieur <hi>Noyers,</hi> and always found so many people
waiting upon business that I could never speak with him. At last, one day I met
Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> and Mareschal <hi>Melleray,</hi> who both told me, they could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
what I had done to gain upon the Cardinal, but he was quite another man with
regard to me, and often spoke of me with a great deal of kindness. Monsieur <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zay</hi>
told me, he would introduce me to him; Monsieur <hi>Melleray</hi> said, No, he would
do it. So after a small struggle, they agreed to carry me to wait on him both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
We all went to the Cardinal's Palace, and at our entrance into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
they said to him; <hi>My Lord, here is Monsieur</hi> de Pontis, <hi>we have brought him to your
Eminence, very sorry for having offended you, and ready to make a tender of his service to
you. I will be security for his fidelity,</hi> said Mr. <hi>Brezay. And so will I,</hi> said Mr. <hi>de Melle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray.</hi>
All this while I said not one word, giving them no authority for the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
they were so ready to make in my behalf, nor confirming them no further
than by a respectful silence.</p>
               <p>Then the Cardinal, directing himself to me, said in a jeering insulting tone; <hi>Well,
Monsieur</hi> Pontis, <hi>you have stood in your own light all this while. You thought to get more,
and raise your fortunes more effectually, from another hand, but you had been no loser by the
bargain, if you had applied your self to me.</hi> This compliment, I own, stirr'd a great deal of
indignation in me, to see my constant devotions to the Kings service made a jest of, and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:100923:129"/>
that they thought me a man to be corrupted. But I must keep in my passion, and
therefore answered with all the outward demonstrations of respect, that were due to
him; That I was all astonishment at the honour his Eminence had done me, in having
such a one as me in his thoughts, that I must acknowledge my self very unworthy
his favour; but yet my Conscience did not tax me with having ever been wanting in
my obedience to his commands; and that I had endeavoured to pay his Eminence all
the service in my little power. But indeed I thought my self obliged not to forsake
the King's service, for this would have been the highest ingratitude, since his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
himself could not but blame me for that, as knowing, that both my fortune
and my life depended upon his royal bounty. The Cardinal pretended not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
me, and made answer, that what was past should only serve to make us bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
friends hereafter, and that he would have me come and see him again.</p>
               <p>But I, who did not understand his Court, nor the modes of it, resolved to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
it but very little more for the future, than I had done heretofore. And I
thought it convenient to acquaint the King with the whole matter; who would not
have been well satisfied, to have had me conceal the particulars of an accident, in
which he was so nearly concern'd. Having given him some little hint of it, he took
me into his Closet, and there I gave him a full relation, of all that had past between
the Cardinal, Monsieur <hi>Noyers,</hi> and me; at which he laught heartily to himself.
But when, among other passages, I told him what Monsieur <hi>Noyers</hi> had said concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Governours place of <hi>Coliovre,</hi> which he assur'd me, the Cardinal had begg'd
of his Majesty for me; the King was so full of indignation at this gross dissembling,
that he could not forbearing crying out, <hi>Ah, the Knave!</hi> Then I askt him if he would
give me leave to go wait upon the Cardinal, as he had urg'd me to do; telling him,
that if his Majesty pleased, I would never see his Eminence's face more, except in a
Picture. But the King answered, that I had better not scruple that, but go wait on him
as others did, to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ke off all jealousie of me, and keep my self at least in that degree
of his kindness, which he now profest for me.</p>
               <p>XXIII. From that time, which was about the month of <hi>September 1642,</hi> matters
went very well with me at Court: For I was constantly about the Kings person, who
carry'd me with him several times to Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s, when he went to visit him
near his death; but he did not use to take me into the Chamber where he lay. The
day this great Statesman dy'd, some hours before his death, I was in the Kings Bed-chamber,
Monsieur <hi>Noyers</hi> came in great joy, and told him, the Cardinal was upon
recovery, for he found himself now much better, and had taken a Medicine that did
wonders upon him. The King, who was satisfied the Cardinal's distemper was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
when he heard this news, continued just the same, without any alteration in his
countenance, either of Joy or Grief. Some time after came another, and he told
the King, that his Eminence was dead, and he saw him expire. The King did not
depend upon this first account, but staid for a second, and a third; and when he heard
it confirm'd on all hands, he contented himself with this reflection to some that stood
by him, <hi>Then there is a great Politician dead.</hi> Presently after Mareschal <hi>Melleray,</hi> and
Mareschal <hi>Brezay,</hi> who had been his creatures, came and threw themselves at the
King's feet, and begg'd his protection. The King took them up, and told them, that
he had always had an esteem for them, and would always continue to love them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they would serve him faithfully. In this he shewed a great deal of goodness,
for he never exprest the least resentment of their having been so absolutely at the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's
devotion. And there is no question, but there is a great deal of policy in
managing ones Enemies sometimes, when any extraordinary accident obliges them to
change their measures, and come over to our party.</p>
               <p>XXIV. I was not long happy in the Kings favour after the Cardinal's death. This
Prince scarce ever enjoy'd any health afterwards, but wasted away in a kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
which at last brought him into a most lamentable condition. He stood
one day in the Sun, that shone in at his Chamber Window, to warm himself, and I
coming in to wait on him, not observing that, stood directly between him and the
Window; whereupon the King said, <hi>Ah</hi> Pontis, <hi>do not take that from me, which thou
canst not give me,</hi> I did not understand his Majesty's meaning, and being concern'd I
did not, continu'd still in the same place. Then the Count <hi>de Tresm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> told me, it
was the Sun I took from the King; and I withdrew immediately. This poor Prince
grew so lean, and worn, that he could not forbear bewailing himself; and would
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:100923:130"/>
sometimes uncover his naked bony Arms, and shew them to those of his Court, that
came to visit him.</p>
               <p>When he lay upon his Death-bed, Monsieur <hi>Souvray,</hi> first Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber,
having given the word one day, that all the company should go out, that
the King might take a little rest; and drawing to the Curtain on that side of the Bed
where I stood, to signifie that I was to go with the rest; the King immediately drew
back the Curtain, and commanded me to stay; for he had no inclination to sleep,
but had a mind to be eased of the crowd and clutter of company. Then he began to
talk familiarly with me; and seeing from within his Bed, through his Chamber at
the Castle of <hi>St. Germain,</hi> St. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s Steeple, he askt me what that was? I told him
St. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s Church; he said, looking death already in the face, <hi>Then there is the place
where I must lye.</hi> Then drawing his Arm out of his Bed, he shew'd it me, and said,
<hi>Here</hi> Pontis, <hi>see this Hand, and this Arm, what Arms are here for the King of</hi> France?
I observ'd them, but with unspeakable anguish of mind, for he was just like a Skele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
with skin drawn over the bones, and cover'd with great white spots. After this
he shew'd me his stomach, which was so miserably lean, that you might easily tell
all his bones. And then, being no louger able to contain, I burst out into a violent
passion of sighs and tears; and made his Majesty sensible, at my leaving him, that I
was extremely afflicted to see him in that condition, which gave me more pain, if
that were possible, than he felt himself.</p>
               <p>I say nothing here of the constructions that were put upon his distemper: These
are secrets not easie to be known, nor of any great use if they were known. This
we are sure of, he dy'd when God saw fit, and in his disposal is the life and death of
the greatest, as well as the meanest men. 'Tis to little purpose, that we trouble our
selves to know the true causes of the deaths of Kings, when we know that all those
causes are subordinate to the will of him, who is the King of Kings. He was very
negligently attended in his illness, and scarce ever had any thing given him warm,
and in good order. This, I confess, added much to my trouble, to see a King, with
so many Officers about him, worse lookt after than the meanest Shop-keeper in <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was not in his Chamber when he dy'd, for all company was kept from him: But
I can say with great truth, That death of his afflicted me to such a degree, that for
three months together I was almost senseless: For I lov'd this Prince most tenderly,
and was always passionately fond of his service; and I will presume to say, I should
be exceeding happy, could I bring my self to be so zealously affected for the faithful
service of him, where no man ever loses his labour; and who deserves our love infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more than all the Princes of the Earth. God, no doubt, intended by this most sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
instance of the zealous and disinterested affection I bore to his Image upon Earth,
to teach me how much better I ought to love himself, the great Original. And real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I have often wondred to see what a strange temper I was of toward this Prince: For
tho I valu'd my services so high, as to think all the favour he shew'd me but a poor
re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pmpence for them; yet still I was so thankful for them, that when some have
found fault with him upon my account, I have several times answer'd, <hi>Is it not honour,
and reward enough for such a warm as I, that so great a Monarch will admit me near his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?</hi>
Thus, whatever consideration I had for my services, still I lookt more upon his
accepting them, and always valu'd that most; and thought all I did was but a discharge
of that obligation, which the being born his Subject laid upon me. Thus, without,
ever attending to it, I practic'd that to an Earthly King, which the Gospel hath
taught me since, ought to be practic'd to the Heavenly one; to look upon our selves
as unprofitable servants, and infinitely happy to be thought worthy of fighting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his banners, and performing his divine commands.</p>

               <p>I. I Was not long, after the King's death, out of employment. And though, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so many years spent in the Service to no purpose, I had reason enough to
grow weary of it, yet I was engaged afresh, without any other design, than
leading the remainder of this miserable life as well as I could; thus going
along with the stream of the World, which carried me away with it, as it did so
many other People. Mareschal <hi>Vitry</hi> surprized me one morning before I was up, and
as, I being ashamed to be found so, threw my self out of the farther side of the Bed,
telli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>g him, he put me out of countenance, and what a Jest it would be, if the World
should know how he had caught me, he told me he had a business of moment to
impart to me. Then drawing back the Curtain, and urging me to lie down again, he
promised he would speak to me unseen, that he might not make me uneasie. Then
he told me he came to ask a kindness, and would not stir till I had engaged to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
him. I, who only desired to get quit of him as soon as I could, told him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing the business, that I was his very humble Servant, and would do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he pleased to command me. So, in short, I forced him to be gone, for having
got my word, he went away well satisfied, without explaining himself any farther at
that time.</p>
               <p>Shortly after he told me, that the thing he desired, and that I had blindly engaged for,
was to be first Captain of the Queen's Regiment, of which his Son was to be <hi>Maistre
de Camp.</hi> And conjured me, by all the friendship I had for him, to take upon me
the instructing of his Son, who being unexperienced, would want to be supported
and managed by one well skill'd in the profession. This Proposal, I confess, startled
me, for though I had pass'd my word, yet thinking such kind of employments a little
below me, I did all that ever I could to get off again. But I could not go back from
my promise, and the Mareschal took care, by abundance of civility and kind promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
to oblige me to acquiesce in it. For he assured me, the Regiment should be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at my disposal, that his Son should bear the Name only, and I have the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
that I should dispose of the Companies as I pleased; and that the accepting
this Employment, and instructing his Son, would be the greatest Service I could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
do him. There was at that time a great difference between the Duke of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goulesme</hi>
and him, for having been Governour of <hi>Provence,</hi> and not beloved by the
People of the Country, the Court had taken the Government from him, and put
in Monsieur d' <hi>Angoulesme.</hi> This occasioned ill blood, for the Mareschal of <hi>Vitry</hi> said,
the Duke of <hi>Angoulesme</hi> had done him ill offices at Court. He intended to drive this
Quarrel higher too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but having no great reason to expect Justice would be done him,
the matter by degrees was dropt, and came to nothing.</p>

II. In the mean time, while the Queen's Regiment was raising, I went to divert
my self at a Friend's Country-house, and made a Nephew of my own, Lieutenant
of my Company, who was afterwards kill'd in the King's Service by a Musquet-shot.
While I was in the Country, Orders came from Court, for me to go to <hi>Sens,</hi> and
carry four Regiments, that lay there in Garison, to <hi>Troyes.</hi> I sent the Marquis of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
word of it, that he might bring his Regiment thither too, and, in obedience to my
Order, went to <hi>Sens.</hi> Quartering one day in a Mannor belonging to Monsieur <hi>Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde,</hi>
Father to the present Archbishop of <hi>Sens,</hi> this Lord came, and told me, that
Mannor was his, and he desired I would not quarter upon it. I answered with all
imaginable civility, that these Quarters were assigned us for four days, but upon his
account I would endeavour to get the Order changed, and remove the Regiments
next morning. Nay, if he pleased, I would try to take them off immediately, but
it grew late, and the Men had supped, so that staying that Night could be no great
prejudice. He thought himself much obliged by my Answer, not expecting such a
Compliment from an Officer that had his Orders, and so many Troops under his
Command. For I confess, I have often wondred very much my self at the rough
behaviour of some Officers, who think the having power in their hands, gives them
a priviledge to be rude and bearish, when they might as well sometimes shew some
respect to persons of worth and honour; and, though they cannot go back from
their Orders, yet they might at least execute them in a civil and gentle way.</p>
               <p>III. While we staid at <hi>Troyes,</hi> there happened a great Mutiny among our Men. A
common Souldier of our Regiment, a wicked hardned Rascal, had got drunk, and
stabb'd a Woman big with Child into the Belly, which killed both the Woman and
the Child she went with. This was too horrid an Action to be excused by the
Wine, and so I took the Rogue, and had him tryed at a Council of War. The
greatest part of the Officers, that we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e young and raw, instead of indignation at so
black a Crime, openly appeared in favour of the Fellow that committed it, thinking
(it may be) their honour concerned, to stand by a Souldier, in opposition to the
Townsmen, that demanded Justice upon him. All the Souldiers mutiny'd to save
their Comrade; for my part, I had so great a detestation of such Outrages, and was
by no means of a humour to bend under a mutinous Souldiery, that I urged to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Vitry,</hi> that this was his fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st Campagne; that if he did not assert the King's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
not only the Officers, but the very common Souldiers would despise him;
that he would draw the <hi>Odium</hi> of a whole Town upon his head, who might prefer
their Complaints at Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, if he let such a Fault go unpunished; that this occasion,
in short, was of mighty consequence to him; and that commonly, all one's follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
management depended upon good beginnings. Monsieur <hi>Vitry</hi> was very much
of my mind, and resolved Justice should have its course, notwithstanding all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of the Officers; and that he depended upon me for the compassing this
business.</p>
               <p>This was, in truth, a good generous and bold Resolution for a young Lord, like
him, to undertake the opposing himself against the whole Regiment; but since he
did me the honour to repose great confidence in me, and that his Father had directed
him to do nothing without my advice, he thought I would not engage him in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which did not make for his honour. Accordingly I took the business upon me,
and carry'd it on with so resolute and so high a hand, that I had the Malefactor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to be hanged and strangled, and made all those Captains that appeared in his
favour to sign his Sentence. But seeing these Officers came however to Monsieur
<hi>Vitry</hi> for his Pardon, though they could not deny condemning him neither; fearing
that those importunities might prevail upon his youth and good nature, I conjured him
not to vilifie his Authority upon this occasion, and advised, that he would rather go
divert himself at his house near <hi>Brie-C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mte-Robert,</hi> telling him that possibly there might
be some mischief; that I saw People were heated, that most of the Officers were
new and unexperienced; and therefore I thought it my duty to urge his going, that
if any thing should happen amiss, his Reputation and Authority might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in it, but all the ill consequences might fall upon me. I gave him so many
good Reasons for what I said, that at last I prevailed with him to go, and leave the
whole burden of the thing upon me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:100923:131"/>
Finding my self left in full power, and not fearing any yielding in any body above
me, I set my self to the supporting the King's Authority, as I ought, and mustered up
all the courage and resolution I had, fearing nothing so much, as not to be feared as I
ought. When the time of Execution was come, I drew up all the Regiments, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
to dye, rather than submit to the humour of raw Officers, and mutinous
Souldiers. The Criminal being brought out, they began to make a great Noise, and
the Sedition running high, they made ready for Blows, and putting their Match to
the Pan, cryed all together, <hi>Mercy, Mercy</hi> I stood single against so many Men in
Arms, and ready to give Fire, most of the Officers seeming pleased with the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
Revolt, and openly approving it. But having learnt by long experience, that
Boldness and Resolution is all in all upon such occasions, and that Authority once
exerted presently quells Sedition, seeing one Blade make a greater bustle than the
rest, that opened his throat, <hi>Mercy, Mercy;</hi> I bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> through the Crowd, and going
boldly up to him, seiz'd him by the Collar before them all, and said to him, in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
tone, <hi>Say you so Sir? Do you pretend to mutiny? Have you the impudence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
against the King's Orders? You shall be hanged immediately, without more ado. Prepare
your s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lf to dye.</hi> Then I exalted my voice, and shewing my anger in my eyes, <hi>That
Man</hi> (cryed I) <hi>that dares to stir, and does not behave himself quietly, I will shew him that
I know how to do Justice upon him, and preserve the King's Authority from being slighted.
Who do you think you have to deal with, Gentlemen? It is no less than the King himself that
you oppose.</hi> Immediately I had my Man bound, who in great confusion fell at my feet,
and had no other concern now, but to beg mercy for himself. I pretended to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable,
and leading him toward the Gibbet, told him, there was no mercy to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
for him, and therefore he should recommend his Soul to God, for hanged he
was like to be, and that presently.</p>
               <p>When I had seized this Fellow, all the rest were so daunted, that they presently
grew quiet and silent, no body daring to open his mouth, except the Man that thought
he should be hanged, who begg'd to be spared with tears and cryes. In this interval
the Malefactor, upon whole account all the Sedition had been raised, was just going to
be turned off, and seeing there was no hopes of life, was desirous to disburden his
Conscience, and declared before all the World, That as for the murther upon the big-bellied
Woman, drink was the cause of it; but he thought himself obliged to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
several other Crimes besides, to vindicate the innocence of several persons who
had been falsly charged with them. There he confest publickly several Murthers he
had been guilty of, and then the Executioner did his office.</p>
               <p>When the time came for the other to be hanged too, I, seeing the Mutiny compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
thought it better not to be too hasty, nor carry things too far, for fear of exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
People; besides, that I was really softned with the concern and submission of
this Cadet, who had not yet had time to come to himself. So for the present I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
my self with confining him; and told him, that since no formal Tryal had
pass'd upon him, I pardon'd him, upon condition he should serve a whole year, and
not quit this Regiment; which he most willingly embraced, as a very gentle Pennance
upon him. After <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> so resolute and successful Action, the chief of the City of
<hi>Troyes,</hi> the President, Counsellors, Chamberlains, and several others came to my
Lodging, to thank me for the seeing Justice done upon so wicked a Wretch, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
mighty acknowledgments and gratitude for it; I told them, I had done no
more than my duty, and was obliged to see Justice done, as I then did.</p>
               <p>IV. Monsieur <hi>de Vitry</hi> came afterwards and joined us again at <hi>Bar,</hi> when our
Troops were come thither. And there I told him, That since he had been forbidden
by his Father, for the Reason I hinted before, to join the Duke of <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> I
had best go wait on the Prince at <hi>Longvic,</hi> and receive his Orders. He was of my
opinion, and staid with his Troops at <hi>Bar</hi> till my return. So I waited on Monsieur
the Prince, and told him, I came to acquaint his Highness, that our Troops were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing;
that Monsieur <hi>de Vitry</hi> was at <hi>Bar</hi> with the Queen's Regiment; and that
he was desirous not to command it himself, but to wait upon him, if he pleased to
give him leave. The Prince told me, he should be very glad to see Monsieur <hi>Vitry,</hi>
and think it an honour to have him with him. And then gave me a Ticket for our
Motions and Quarters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:100923:132"/>
V. I was not away above seven or eight days upon this Journey; but yet my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
gave occasion to a new sedition in the Queen's Regiment, against Monsieur <hi>de
Vitry.</hi>
The Officers had a great dispute about precedence, and not satisfied with
standing to Monsieur <hi>Vitry</hi>'s determination, because he was young, and had not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
enough to regulate them; they, without his knowledge, deputed one <hi>Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niere</hi>
a Lieutenant among them, to complain to his Majesty. Monsieur <hi>Vitry</hi> being as yet
unexperienc'd, knew not what course to take, nor how to manage himself to get clear
of this affront, and expected my return with great impatience. In this condition I
found things when I came back, and soon was informed of the quarrel by the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
who had a mind to possess me in their favour, and came immediately to ask me,
if I, who was one of them my self, would not take the part of all the Officers of
the body. At first I suspected some quarrel with Monsieur <hi>Vitry,</hi> and not caring to
engage my self, <hi>Gentlemen</hi> (said I) <hi>I perceive here hath something happened in my absence.
I can give you no positive answer till I have consulted Monsieur</hi> de Vitry. <hi>You would be the
first that should blame me, if I should proceed so rashly. It is strange you can neither give,
nor submit to command; and that being appointed by the King to keep up discipline among the
Souldiers, you your selves break it every day, and refuse obedience to the person who hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to command you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I went then to give the Marquis of <hi>Vitry</hi> an account of my Journey, who was very
well pleased at the Prince's answer. I expected he should mention this matter to me
first, and took no notice of it my self. And so he did, telling me he had met with
some difficulty since I left him; That all the Officers of the Regiment had carried it
so high, as to send a Deputy to complain at Court, without his knowledge. <hi>How,
Sir</hi> said I, <hi>are not you</hi> Maistre de Camp <hi>of the Queen's Regiment? Hath not the Kings
Commission submitted all the Officers to your command? Are not all their fortunes owing to you?
their Commands were in your gift, and it was in your own power, as well to have preferred any
other persons as those: Such an affront therefore, Sir, to your authority, which is indeed the
Kings Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hority, should by no means have been endured. A man must put himself forward, and
exe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t all his power upon such occasions as these. How</hi> (said I) <hi>send a Deputy to Court without
ever consulting you! Oh, Sir, you must not put it up; farewel to all respect and authority, if
this be suffered. If you keep these people under your first Campagne, they will stand in awe of
you hereafter; but if they exceed their duty, and once get the upper hand of you, they will be
continually mutineering, and you will never be able to restrain them. There is no middle state
in these cases, you must either govern them, or they will govern you.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Vitry</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.
<hi>Alas! What would you have me do? I was all alone; no body took my part; and I
waited for your return. Oh, Sir,</hi> (said I) <hi>what does your being alone signify, when you had
your command to bear you out? What is a single Officers in opposition to so many private Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and yet must not he be accountable with his life to the King, for the discipline and good
order of all the men under his command? Are not all the Officers of your Regiment bound to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to you, and have not you the Kings Authority to command them? There is no ground for fear
Sir, when a man hath right on his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ide, and the Kings power to back him in it? Mutineers must
be reduced by methods of prudence and resolution. But since they have put a slight upon your
Youth, I will take a course to make them respect your Person, and repent of their Disobedience.</hi>
Then I desired he would send away a Courier to the Mareschal of <hi>Vitry,</hi> and I would
do my self the honour of writing to him, and representing the whole matter. <hi>Come</hi>
(said I) <hi>for fifty Crowns you shall make these Officers know themselves;</hi> and so Monsieur
<hi>Vitry</hi> agreeing to it, I wrote to his Father the Mareschal to this purpose.</p>

among the Officers of your Sons Regiment: They have shewn themselves
so disrespectful to his Authority, so ungrateful to their Benefactor, and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful
from what hand they enjoy the benefit of their Commands, as, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to him, to depute one <hi>Fortiniere,</hi> a Lieutenant, to make their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints

slight upon your Authority too; for tho they refus'd to be determined by the

               </floatingText>
               <p>Upon the receipt of this Letter the Mareschal of <hi>Vitry</hi> went immediately to the
Queens Court, and there found that <hi>Fortiniere</hi> had been caballing, and made a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
bustle. But the powerful arguments on his side, backt with his Quality, and
Credit at Court, prevail'd so far upon the Queen, as to undo all that <hi>Fortiniere</hi> had
done; and besides that, to obtain leave for confining him, which he did accordingly.
After this he gave me the favour of a most kind obliging Letter; much extolling my
affection for his Son, in standing by him against all the Officers of the Regiment,
and conjur'd me to continue my kindness to him; he told me, there was no danger
now from <hi>Fortiniere;</hi> that he had imprison'd him, and undeceiv'd the Queen in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things, of which she had been prepossest. At the same time he writ to his Son
upon my account, in such a manner as made me rather full of confusion, than proud;
telling him, that till this considerable accident, he did not perfectly understand the
person, to whose care he had committed him. That there are but few such friends
to be found, who will prefer another mans Honour before their own Interest; that
he thought himself more oblig'd to me, than it was possible for him to express; and
that he commanded him above all things, to respect, observe, and be directed by
me. When I had read this exceeding civil Letter, that the Mareschal did me the
honour to send me, I burnt it presently; loving to oblige the persons who do me
the favour to love me, but fearing such commendations, as rather expose a man to
the envy and hatred, than recommend him to the esteem and affection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of people. Some time after, the Mareschal sent back <hi>Fortiniere,</hi> whom I repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
severely; giving him to understand, that he was more to blame than all the
rest of the Officers; first, in that he who was an old Officer was so far from teaching
the new ones their duty, that he joyned himself in the revolt with them; and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in that undertaking to carry the complaints of the rest, he made all their guilt
his own. He excused himself as well as he could, and would sain have been admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into favour again, and have had a Company. But neither Monsieur <hi>Vitry,</hi> nor I,
would ever give him one. For in truth he deserved to be punished, much more
than to be rewarded.</p>
               <p>VI. Monsieur <hi>de Vitry</hi> then went (as I said before) to the Prince, and I followed
him with all the Regiments; and here I cannot forbear taking notice of one thing,
which I saw in my Journey at <hi>Vauderange,</hi> because it is something unusual. This
Town lies upon the confines of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> some fifteen leagues from <hi>Metz.</hi> The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of it are pretty equally mixt of Catholicks and <hi>Hugonots.</hi> The same Church
serves them both. The Curate of one Congregation, and the Minister of the other
live together in very good friendship. On <hi>Sunday</hi> the Catholicks go to Mass from
eight in the morning till ten: And at ten the Catholicks leave the place, and make
room for the <hi>Hugonots;</hi> and salute one another with great civility as they pass. The
Minister preaches to the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in the very same Pulpit which the <hi>Curae</hi> had preach'd
to the Catholicks in before, only they have the Body of the Church and no more for
their use, and the Quire and Altar is used by none but Catholicks. And again,
when the Catholicks have gone to Church at eight a clock one <hi>Sunday,</hi> the next they
do not go till ten; and so constantly they change their hours of devotion by turns.
In a word. there is so great an equality of behaviour among them, that when I had
been entertain'd by the <hi>Curae,</hi> the Minister came, and invited me to dine with him
too; and after this sort of vicissitude every thing is done among them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:100923:133"/>
VII. When we had joyn'd the body of the Army then with the Prince, who was
to leave the Command of it to the Mareschal of <hi>Guebriant,</hi> the Mareschal entertain'd
his Highness, and all the principal Officers of the Army, at <hi>Salbourg,</hi> a Town some
ten or twelve leagues from <hi>Longvic.</hi> He did me the honour to invite me, and would
needs make me perform the Ceremonies of his house. It was one of the most splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
Dinners that ever was made: There were two Tables with the same Services in
two different Rooms. The Prince's Table had about twenty persons at it; for only
his Highness, the Mareschals, the Lieutenant Generals, and Maresch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ls <hi>de Camp</hi> sat
there; the other was the Maistres <hi>de Camp,</hi> where Monsieur <hi>Vitry</hi> sat, and <hi>I</hi> with
him, being appointed as I said to welcom the Guests, and conduct them into the
Dining-room. For as soon as notice was brought me, I immediately left my Napkin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and went to meet and introduce them. In the Princes Dining-room were several
Drums and Trumpets, which all sounded when his Highness drank. And some six
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd twenty or thirty more were placed without, as were also several Instruments,
which answered them within, and all together made a most delightful Musick.</p>
               <p>When they were at the dessert, Monsieur <hi>Rantsau</hi> Lieutenant General came into
the Court. I knew the Prince had no kindness for him, and therefore as soon as they
brought me notice, went and whisper'd Mareschal <hi>Guebriant</hi> in the Ear, that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Rantsau</hi> was below: He was much perplexed, and said, <hi>Let him alone, and make
as if you did not see him.</hi> So I went and sat down again. Monsieur <hi>Rantsau</hi> was much
out of humour, that no body came to receive him. At last he grew weary of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and came briskly up into the room whhre his Highness was. As soon as Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Guebriant</hi> perceived him, he and the rest rose, and put on some surprize, and
every one offering him a Glass, they told him, He was come a little with the latest,
but there was enough left still to dine on. At the same time they set before him
Partridge, Pheasant, and all sorts of Wild Fowl, and being one that lov'd to eat
well, he was taken very good care of.</p>
               <p>VIII. After all this great entertainment all the Troops marched, and when they
were come to the Plain of <hi>Benfelt</hi> near the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the Army was drawn out, and
every one took his leave of the Prince, who was to go back from thence. Several
would have attended him back, but he would suffer none of the Company to do it.
My friends however, understanding we were to go into <hi>Germany,</hi> writ to me very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
to come back, telling me I had seen <hi>Germany</hi> already, and to go thither again
was but loss of time. Monsieur <hi>d'Espenan,</hi> to whom the Prince was very kind, and
who was indeed his particular Favourite, said, he would speak to him for me;
which he did, and with great difficulty got me leave. But upon second thoughts,
considering how ill Mareschal <hi>Vitry</hi> might take it, if I deserted his Son at that rate, I
resolved to continue my Journey, and sore against my inclination, to pass the <hi>Rhine.</hi>
But, by endeavouring to keep the Mareschals favour, I lost the Prince's, who lookt
upon himself to be affronted, and was very much displeased with me. When I
came among the rest, to take my leave of his Highness, and kiss his hand, he not
knowing my design, said in a low voice, <hi>Do not you go with me, I have granted you a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</hi>
I answer'd, His Highness had done me a greater honour than I deserv'd, in
granting a favour to me, which had been deny'd to others: But in consideration that
my return might create great complaints against his Highness, and much envy to my
self I begg'd his leave to stay behind. The Prince, offended, as if I had not a due
sense of so very particular a favour, grew downright angry, and said, <hi>You are an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
man, I did that for you, which I would do for no body besides, and now you do not thank
me for it;</hi> and presently turning away from me, complain'd to Monsieur <hi>Espenan,</hi>
that he had askt a favour for me, which I slighted as soon as it was granted. And
really this prov'd a most unhappy accident to me, tho in truth my fault was not
want of gratitude, so much as excess of generosity: For I did not so properly ask
my self to be dismist, as give way that another should ask it for me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when I
declined the making use of this grant, I did not consult my own choice or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,

Vitry,</hi> by leaving his Son, and breaking my promise. But it must be confest, I made a very
false step, in giving way that his Highness should be apply'd to for a matter of such
importance, before the thing and all its consequences were duly weighed; which I
cannot but say gave the Prince just occasion to find fault with me, and to tax me
with levity at least.</p>

we had spent some little time in this wretched post, Mareschal <hi>Gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

us out, and support us with some fresh Troops; and we made a very brave Retreat in
sight of the Enemy, who pursued us no farther than the Forrest. Thus we came to
the Siege of <hi>Rotheuil,</hi> where nothing considerable was done on the Enemies side, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
one Sally, in which our men were in very great disorder. I had ordered my
Nephew, (whom I mentioned formerly) to go along with me, and view the Guard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ann when we got thither, I found the Regiments that were upon duty, and but new
raised, extremely negligent, and almost as little upon their guard, as if they had been
in a peaceable Country. Observing this, I cry'd out to them, <hi>Why how now Gentlemen,

               <p>Just then my fears came to pass; for six hundred men or thereabouts made a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out of the Town, and came powring in upon that quarter, where I still was; and
having easily forc'd the <hi>Corps de Guard,</hi> advanc'd briskly to charge the gross body. I
and my Nephew saw our selves encompast in a moment: For the disorder was so
great, and every body so unprepar'd, that the Captains, Lieutenants, and private
Souldiers, who were but lately come to that trade, all ran together, without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one word I said to them, or at all regarding the endeavours I made to rally, and
put them into heart again. And really, when I saw so many men quit their post so
easily, who yet at other times made mighty pretensions to Gallantry and Courage, I
could not forbear calling out to them, <hi>Oh rare! Gentlemen, what! I perceive then, the
Officers set the private Souldiers an example for running away.</hi> I and my Nephew not being
capable of sustaining the force of so many Enemies upon us, both retreated; and going
through some winding ways, we found our selves pursu'd, and blockt up by four lusty
Rogues, that lookt as if they would fain be cutting our Throats; and were supported by
some<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> more behind them. Upon this we leapt a hedge just by, and recover'd a foot way,
narrow and rising, from whence we might discourse them from the higher ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And there turning back upon them, we stood our ground. Those that dogg'd us so
close before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did not think it convenient to attack us upon this hill, and so went off
about their business.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, that Quarter being all lost, we hastned to Monsieur <hi>Vitry,</hi> to
give him an account, and putting our Regiment into a posture, made ready to try
for our Trenches again. When necessary orders were given, we brought on our men
to the charge. There was a broad way which we should have gone, but it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
commanded by a Spur-work, planted with eight or nine pieces of Cannon;
upon the very mouths of which we should put our selves, which was not fit for us to
do. For the declining this pass, I wheel'd off the Regiment a half turn, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down a hedge, we went that way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho all the Officers and Souldiers were not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perswaded to it, because we lay all open. The Enemy being forc'd to turn their
Cannon gave us some time to advance in: But however we could not do it so quick,
but that three of their pieces were levell'd at us, and took off three of our hindmost
Ranks. Every one prest forward without ever looking behind him, and scarce any
body perceiv'd it besides me; who went smiling to Monsieur <hi>Vitry,</hi> and told him in
his Ear, <hi>Three of our Ranks are scattered, but pray Sir, make no words of it, for fear the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who know nothing of the matter, be discouraged.</hi> Our passage, tho so much expos'd, was suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful
enough, and we charg'd the Enemies so vigorously, that what we had lost was
quickly recover'd again, and they beaten back into the Town. This was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

X. Mareschal <hi>Guebriant</hi> had a mind one day to go take a view of a post that lay
much expos'd, to place a Battery there, but I conjured him not to go, for fear he
should come back no more. He yielded to my advice, and I went thither in his stead.
Upon observation of the place, I found it very fit for his purpose: But discover'd at
the same time, a sort of Window, with a Culverin planted in it, that threatned me. This
put me to some stand, and I knew not how to get backward or forward, for fear of
meeting death either way. At last I came off without hurt, for it seems that blow
was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eserv'd for a Mareschal of <hi>France,</hi> and not an inferiour Officer. I made my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
to Monsieur <hi>Guebriant,</hi> and he resolv'd to go thither himself. I opposed his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
all I could, and represented the danger to which he expos'd his life; for there
was no way to get under covert of that piece of Ordnance. But he made answer,
That his honour lay at stake for the taking of the Town, and would hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ken to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
I said to him. So go he did, and there met with the death I had given him
warning of: For this Culverin was discharg'd upon him, and broke his Left Arm all
to shatters. When he was brought back to his lodging, and I went to see him, he
said to me with great unconcernedness; <hi>Well, my Friend, my Life is at an end; this place
was destin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d for my Death.</hi> He lived some days after. In the mean while his being hurt
was kept very private, and the Enemies, who heard nothing of it, set a Capitulation
on foot from that very day. He lay in his bed, and signed the Articles before them
with his Right hand, with so great resolution and evenness of temper, that they never
discerned his hurt, but thought only, that he kept his bed for some slight indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
When the Town was surrendred he was carried into it, and there died a little
while after, triumphing in some sort, both over <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> For all the
other Lieutenant Generals were much displeased at his besieging this place, and lookt
upon him with a very jealous eye for it.</p>
               <p>XI. After Mareschal <hi>Guebriant</hi>'s death, Monsieur <hi>R</hi> ... succeeded in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Army, and upon decamping from <hi>Rotheuil,</hi> one part of us went into
quarters near <hi>Tubighen,</hi> with Monsieur <hi>de R</hi> ... and the other, where Monsieur <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
and we were, went to <hi>Meninghen.</hi> In this fatal place it was, that our Army re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a terrible blow, which was owing chiefly to the General's ill conduct, whom
Wine made too negligent of the duty of his command. For, instead of watching
over his Troops, and securing them as he ought to have done, he minded nothing,
but slept as it were continually in the midst of the Enemies; who fell on with a
mighty force in his quarter, cut his Troops to pieces, and took him Prisoner. Our
quarter was some four leagues distant from his; and we came to be informed of this
disaster by the following accident. That very day at four in the morning, I had sent
the Serjeants to his quarter for bread for the Camp, with orders to be back by nine
or ten a clock at farthest: They did not keep their time, and I began to be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy,
the more so indeed, because I had heard the noise of Guns. I went to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Vitry</hi> and told him, without question something ill had happened; that those
Guns we heard could have no good meaning in them, and my advice was, that a
man should be dispatcht away upon one of his fleetest Horses, to bring us word how
matters stood. Monsieur <hi>Vitry</hi> liked the proposal: But all the other Officers both of
ours, and the rest of the Regiments that lay with us, cried, the best way was to make
off, that if the Enemy should attack us there, while we were cut off so from the
main body of the Army, there was no remedy, but we must all be cut to pieces.</p>
               <p>I opposed this advice of theirs stiffly, and told them on the contrary, that having
had orders to continue in their Post, we could not, without some assurance of the
General's being taken, quit it, without incurring the danger of being punished for
Cowards, Traytors and Deserters; that therefore the first thing to be done was to
get a knowledge how matters were with him, that so if the General were assaulted
we might move to his relief; and if he were taken, we might secure an honourable
retreat. At last, whatever they could urge, did not hinder me from carrying my
point; and so I dispatcht a man upon one of Monsieur <hi>Vitry</hi>'s Coursers, with a charge
to make no stay, that we might have speedy notice what was fit for us to do. This
fellow made great haste to the General's quarter, and greater back to us again, and
told us, the Enemy had got all into their hands, and the whole quarter were taken
Prisoners.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:100923:134"/>
XII. Our next care then was for a seedy retreat. It grew late, and would require
good haste to reach the Forrest, which was three leagues from us. So all things were
managed with great hurry; and, there being a narrow Bridge to pass, near the rise
of the <hi>Danube,</hi> the Regiment of <hi>Mazarin,</hi> commanded by <hi>St. Germain,</hi> whose day
it was to march in the Van, made haste to get over the Bridge first, and make room
for the rest who were to support them. I went my self to view the ground, where
it was to be drawn up as soon as it was got over, and came back to them again. But
the Enemies Horse waited for us at the passage, and the Regiment were no sooner
got to the other side, but immediately a thousand Horse charged them, and cut
them to pieces. Since then there was no hope of passing there, we all thought the
best way was to get to <hi>Menighen,</hi> and there barricade our selves up the best we could,
to gain either a fair capitulation, or an honourable death. Monsieur <hi>Vitry</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all these Troops in chief, and having, as I observed, been ordered by his Father,
to do nothing without my intention, I found the Office of a General would devolve
upon me, in this important exigence. And besides, it is very usual in such extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to resign ones Office freely into the hands of a more experienc'd person, and one
in whom the Souldiers repose a greater confidence. I told Monsieur <hi>Vitry</hi> we must
provide for the worst, and manage this occasion dextrously, which might chance to be
the most honourable action of our whole lives. Then calling out aloud to the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
<hi>Come friends, and fellow Souldiers,</hi> said I, <hi>we must dye; but if they will not give us our
lives, we must sell them as dear as we can.</hi> Every one then laying a helping hand, in a
danger where all were equally concern'd, the Gates and Avenues were all barricado'd,
and I went my self, and posted all the Centinels, the Guards, and the Reserves, in
the most advantageous and important places. I endeavour'd to encourage them all,
by my words, my example, and that extraordinary Courage, which I really felt,
and thought it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>enie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t to shew upon this occasion. And to give Monsieur
<hi>Vitry</hi> his due, I must needs say he seconded me in every thing; for tho he was young,
and this the first Campaign he had made, yet he signaliz'd himself above the rest;
and exceeded all the expectation that men could possibly have of him, both by his
bravery, and great presence of mind.</p>
               <p>XIII. After we had made the best provision we could for securing our little body
of the Army, in which there were more sick and wounded than fit for service, for
we were not above sixteen or seventeen hundred fighting men at most; about nine
or ten a clock at night, there came one of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Trumpets, to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
us in his Highness's name, that we should surrender at discretion; and if we
refused, to threaten us, that the Army should come upon us next day, and then no
quarter was to be expected. When I heard them summon us to a surrender at dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
I cryed out in a rage, <hi>Yes, I warrant you, we shall surrender at discretion! What!
shall they dispose of our persons and lives as they please? No, no. We were not born Gentlemen,
and</hi> Frenchmen <hi>to yield like Cowards, and be used like Rascals. No. We will dye, dye with
our Swords in our hands; and a dear bargain they shall have of us. Let them come with their
whole Army as soon as they please: We'll shem them what it is to attack desperate men, they
shall have a taste of our Courage, and perhaps repent that ever they tryed it.</hi> All the Officers
and Souldiers, who relisht this sort of discretion no more than I did, and were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
animated by the warmth I exprest my self with, resolved to dye, rather than
surrender themselves at this rate, without fighting. So the Trumpet went back,
and we put our selves into a posture of defence. Next day three Armies of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
appeared before <hi>Meninghen,</hi> that is the Emperours, the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s, and
the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s, who was Generalissimo; and the day after that, fourteen
piecs of Cannon came up, which were planted against the Village, and beat all the
Walls and Houses about our Ears, in five hours time.</p>
               <p>About two hundred paces from the Village there stood a Chappel, where the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
had set a guard of fourscore men, and they stood very conveniently to do us
mischief. I was not able to endure to see the Enemies insult over us, by coming up
so close, and told Monsieur <hi>Vitry</hi> it was a shame, to suffer a guard of theirs so near the
Town; and dangerous too, to let them continue there, and that threescore stout
Boys must be sent, either to dislodge them, or dye in the attempt. All the Officers
received this advice but coldly, and I suppose every one spoke for himself, fearing
it would be his fortune to be sent, and therefore urged many reasons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o aggravate the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:100923:135"/>
difficulty of the undertaking. I saw presently their opinions were more the result of
fear than judgment; and being desirous to set them a pattern, <hi>well, Gentlemen,</hi> said I,
<hi>I understand the meaning of all this. It seems I must go my self, and I will shew by the success,
that the advice was good.</hi> Immediately I took threescore men, with several Trusses of Straw,
and went in the night, with all the boldness that became a man, who had not only
his Enemies to encounter, but his own men to encourage too; for their spirits began
to sink at the number of their besiegers, and the little hope there appeared to get off
from this difficulty honourably. When I came up near th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Chappel, I found the guard
but carelesly kept, because they were under no apprehension of any sallies out of the
Town: So we fell on briskly, and cut them in pieces. Then I set fire to the bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
of Straw, and burnt the House down; shewing both our enemies and friends at
once, what advantage we had got; above the expectation of either. All my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades
were envy'd for the honour of this action, and they who objected most against
it before, would have been glad to have had a hand in the attempt.</p>
               <p>An action so bold as this, and perform'd by so few, when they were besieged by
three Armies at once, gave the Enemy such a damp, that they immediately retir'd
three hundred paces, for fear of some great Sally, and not knowing what to think of
the valour of men so desperate as we. And indeed in all such cases, where the strength
is so unequal, the want of numbers must be made up with Courage; and the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
one's self to the greatest dangers ought not to be esteemed rashness, because in
those Circumstances, this is the only way left for mens preserving themselves, or consulting the safety and honour of all the rest.</p>
               <p>Next day (as I said) the Cannon came up, and made such a destruction among the
houses of this Village, which were no better than Clay, and Earthen Walls, that
nothing was to be seen, but ruines and rubbish. Yet even from hence I took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to encourage several, telling them, That these ruinous heaps were now as good
to us as so many Ramparts against the Enemy, when they attackt us. Monsieur <hi>Vitry</hi>
desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing me to go up into a little sort of a Turret over one of the Gates, to observe
how the Enemy lay; I, who saw a little better than he did, what danger I should be
expos'd to, said, <hi>Sure Sir, you have no mind I should ever come down again. Well then, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
Sir;</hi> and immediately, that I might encourage others, and shew them this was a
time to venture, and fear nothing, I went up. But I was more fortunate than I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
and receiv'd no hurt; so I plac'd a Centinel there, and then came down
again.</p>
               <p>A little after, the Centinel told us, the Armies came on, that every thing
was ready for the Assault, and the Forlorn-hope already drawn out at the head of
them. We put our selves into a posture for receiving them, and bloody business
it must needs have prov'd, considering how resolv'd we were, not to betray the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of our Prince, nor surrender our selves tamely to our Enemies at discretion. But
before the Assault, they sent a second Ttumpet, to tell Monsieur <hi>Vitry,</hi> that the
Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> entreated him not to drive things to the last push; that he might be
confident his Highness would use him with all the Honour and Civility he could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
expect; and several other things, which went no farther than the security of
Monsieur <hi>Vitry</hi>'s own person. Seeing no terms propos'd, but what concern'd him
alone, and no notice at all taken of the rest of the Troops, I askt the Trumpet, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he brought us the same terms that he brought our General; the Trumpet reply'd,
They would use us all like men of honour. This answer made us resolve upon a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render;
with this Condition, That the Officers should pay their Ransome, and the
private Souldiers should have their Lives.</p>
               <p>The reason why our Enemies chang'd their measures so suddenly, was the mistake
our extraordinary Courage led them into; for they thought by our holding out two
days and two nights against three Armies, that we could not possibly be less than five
or six thousand fighting men; and that the destroying of so many, when reduc'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair,
and entrencht behind timber and rubbish, must needs cost them abundance of
blood. It was agreed then, to confirm our capitulation the better to us, that hostages
should be given on both sides. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> sent us one, and ours being a great
while getting ready, he that came from the Enemy was much dissatisfied, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of the delay that was made in sending ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s in exchange. At last, his patience
was quite tired, and growing jealous perhaps of so long a delay, he would fain have
been going back again. But I, who foresaw what would be the consequence of this,
stopt him, and presented a Pistol to his head with these words: <hi>No, Sir, by your leave,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:100923:135"/>
you shall not go, and you shall stay here upon this very spot. That would be a pretty thing indeed,
for you, after you have made your observations here, to go back like a Spy, and tell the Enemy
our condition. You shall stay, Sir, whether you like it or no.</hi> This put a stop to him, and
but for this we should probably have been all lost; for to be sure, if the Enemy had
known how few we were, they would never have agreed to the Capitulation. So
when our Hostage was sent too, we surrendred. The sick men were left at
<hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninghen,</hi>
and all the rest conducted by some Troops of Horse to the Enemy's quarters,
and all saluted the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> as they past by him. Five or six of us that were
principal Officers were allow'd to ride, and wear our Swords. So we endeavoured in
our present misfortune, to make as good a shew, and march as gracefully as though
we had not been Prisoners.</p>
               <p>XIV. That evening the whole body deputed me to go pay their respects to the
Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and beg that he would see his promise made good to us. His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
answered, That he knew how to observe Articles; but I reply'd, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the word he had engaged, several of our Officers had been very much abused;
that some had been robb'd, some stript, nay, and others kill'd: And therefore I was
come most humbly to beseech his Highness, that such Violences might not be suffer'd,
contrary to the Law of Nations. The Duke seem'd much amaz'd, and answer'd me
in a passion, <hi>What! have they stript them? Have they kill'd them? Do you know who they are
that have done this? Stay here with me, that if you know any of them, I may punish them for it
before your face.</hi> His Highness immediately publish'd a prohibition through all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
charging that our men should not be touch'd upon pain of Death.</p>
               <p>The ill conduct of the Enemy's Generals, and the licentiousness and disorder of
their private Souldiers, produc'd a very great confusion among our men: Some lost
their Cloaks, some their Hat and Feather, some their Coats, and scarce any body
escap'd the outrage of these bruitish men; who thought they had a right to plunder
us because we had surrendred, tho that was not done, but upon an engagement of
being used honourably. The sight of this Injustice provok'd me to undertake the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of my fellows, thinking my self sufficiently secur'd by the fresh assurances his
Highness had given me: So seeing some of them abus'd, I went strait to their relief,
and as if I had been an Officer on the other side, fell to Caneing the Rogues, with
that boldness and authority, that honour and zeal for Justice gave me. Our men too
seconded me in the matter, pretending not to know me, that I might be the more
capable of serving them. But fearing some treachery behind, because I found my
self perpetually encompast with Robbers, I unbuttoned my Cloak for fear of foul
play, and lest any one should suddenly catch at it, and drag me down backward.
This foresight was very serviceable to me: For as I was going between two high and
thick hedges, a Horse-man, that lay conceal'd behind, whipt off my Cloak in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
and rid away with it by the hedge side. I turn'd back in great wrath, and
wish'd I could have leapt the hedge, to correct that Rascal, who had the impudence
to lay hands on me, against the Generals express command to the contrary. But not
being able to do more, I contented my self with giving him hard words, and put it
off as well as I could, with saying, that my Cloak was heavy, and very inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to me.</p>
               <p>Discovering a Captain of ours abused by a Horse-man, who was taking away his
Coat embroider'd with Silver, I ran to him, and after five or six good blows with
my Cane, made him quit his prize, and rescu'd my man that had like to have been
stript. But, being out of all patience with this disorder and ill usage, I went to the
Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> again, and told him, That every body slighted his order; that the
Capitulation was broke every hour, and no promise they made was kept with us;
that I had been robb'd of my Cloak my own self; and that the outrages my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Souldiers endured were such, that I was forc'd to importune his Highness once
more, that we might be us'd like men of Honour, as he had engaged we should.
The Duke seem'd to be exceeding angry, and said, He would hang them every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Son. And in truth, presently after he did justice upon one Trooper, that had
the impudence to take away one of our Officers Cloaks, before his very face; for
riding after him immediately with his Pistol in his hand, some five or six hundred
paces, he got up to him at last, and broke his head; which put a stop to their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
for that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:100923:136"/>
XV. The Enemy resolved to retake <hi>Rotheuil,</hi> and so we were all carried thither.
But we had like to have been quite famished by the way, and had not so much as
one bit of Bread to eat; so that when we met with any Brambles, or Sloe-trees, by
the way, there was sure to be so many Skirmishes of People fighting for Sloes, and
Black-berries. This unwholsom dyet threw me, and a great many others, into a
Flux, which was a great affliction to us in Prison. But what I feared most of all
was, left the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> should find me out to be the person that had banter'd
him formerly, and hindred the making his escape at the Siege of <hi>Nancy,</hi> of which I
gave an account before. For this Reason I took great care to have my Name con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
and had my self called, <hi>The Captain of the Crown.</hi> For the same Reason I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
being his Highness's Prisoner, which was what he did me the honour to make
me a proffer of, when <hi>Rotheuil</hi> was taken; and they came to debate of casting Lots
for the Prisoners, to divide them into three parcels, that the Emperor, the Duke of
<hi>Bavaria,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> might each of them have their share. For though
it had been much better for me to have fallen into the hands of a person, who had
used me with all possible civility; yet fearing I might come to be discover'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and he might resent the ill office I did him at <hi>Nancy;</hi> when he did me the
favour to ask me, If I would be his? I took the liberty to answer, That his Highness
did me too much honour; that I pretended to no Priviledge above my Fellows, and
desired rather to take my chance, as the rest did. So I fell to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s
share. And a young Gentleman, a Relation of mine, who was Lieutenant in our
Regiment, being the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Prisoner, I, thinking he would be near his
person, and consequently in less danger of being plunder'd, gave him two hundred
and fifty Pistoles of mine, and a Jewel worth as much more, desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing he would keep
that Money for me, and take care to be near the Prince, to avoid the danger of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing.</p>
               <p>When he had got my Money, and my Jewel, he compounded with the Colonel,
whose Prisoner he was, telling him, he was a poor Cadet; but if he would promise
him his liberty, he would try to gratifie him with fifty Pistoles, which he would bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of Monsieur <hi>Vitry,</hi> for he had the honour of being known to him. The Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
who desired nothing so much as ready Money, and perhaps never thought he
should find this Man so good a Chapman, promised to carry him safe away, upon
condition he would pay him those fifty Pistoles. It was easie for him to find such a
Sum, and thus he got his liberty. He came back into <hi>France,</hi> and betraying a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference
for him who was left behind Prisoner in a strange Country, minded nothing
but his own pleasure, as if the Money would never have an end. Nay, when that
was gone, he found another method of getting fresh Supplies for his Expences, and
went to the Treasury, and there, in my Name, took up my Pension. And when his
Friends and Relations reproached him, with taking no care to get me my liberty, his
constant Answer was, that I had Friends enough to take care of me; and all he could
do, would signifie nothing. Which I take notice of here, to put those People out of
countenance, who are capable of such dirty actions; and to shew that a true Friend
is often more faithful, and more tenderly concerned in such cases, than our own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
               <p>XVI. After the taking of <hi>Rotheuil</hi> by the Enemy, I and my Companions that fell
to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s share, were carried to <hi>Ausburg.</hi> As we were upon the Road,
though I was almost at death's door my self, yet I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent my fine Horse <hi>Millesfleurs,</hi> to
one of the company, who pretended to be very sick; but instead of restoring him
to me, that we might take our ease by turns, he took no farther care than his own
convenience, though at my expence; and went on a good way before, without ever
staying for me. I was almost quite spent, and proposed to five or six of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades
to go rest and refresh our selves a little, at an Inn hard by. But the refreshment
I went for, cost me very dear. For after we had eat and drank, and came to pay the
Reckoning, I took a Crown in gold out of my Pocket, and threw it down upon the
Table, as we use to do in <hi>France,</hi> and said to the Landlady, <hi>Pay your self out of that,
and give me the rest again;</hi> and afterwards taking the remainder, and putting it in
my Pocket, without ever counting it, five or six <hi>German</hi> Troopers, who were drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the same place, observed the indifference I shew's about Money; and guessing
by this piece of gold, which they saw me throw down upon the Table, that we might
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:100923:136"/>
be some of the <hi>French</hi> Nobility, and had a good many Pistoles, they were resolved
to set upon us, and rob us.</p>
               <p>After we were gone a good way, these <hi>Germans</hi> came galloping up to us; I had staid
a little behind, and happened just then to be all alone. The Troopers as soon as
they came near call'd out, <hi>Your Purse.</hi> I, who was much surprized at so unexpected
a compliment, presently leapt a Ditch, and drawing my Sword, called to my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades,
<hi>Here, To me, Gentlemen, to me,</hi> and then began to defend my self as well as I
could, without ever considering how many were upon me. They shot twice, but
did not hurt me. And for all they could do to get within me, still I kept them off,
with my own motion, and the management of my Sword. All this while my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades,
and that very man among the rest whom I had lately rescued from the Trooper
that would have stript him, instead of making up to my relief, fled into the Marshes,
and left me single to the mercy of five drunken <hi>Germans,</hi> armed with Hangers and Musquetoons, and Pistols. I defended my self after this manner for half a quarter of
an hour, and it may be, at last, they might have been tired as well as I, if one of
them coming behind me, and surprizing me, had not laid at me with his Hanger to
cleave me down the middle: I turned about, and received the blow upon my Sword,
which was broken with the force of it, and that gave them an opportunity of falling
all upon me. They rifled me, and took away seven or eight Pistoles which I had
left, and unbuttoning my Breeches searched me for more, and took from me the
Gold Medal given me by Mareschal <hi>Brezay,</hi> which I spoke of formerly. But still
they left me that which was most valuable, my life; being no doubt particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
by God from killing me, which in all probability they must needs have done
otherwise, considering the resistance I made, and that they were drunk when they
fought with me. I found such heat and resolution in this dispute, that if my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
had not deserted me as they did, I almost fancy, we should have been at least
as likely to dismount these Horsemen, as to have been robbed by them.</p>
               <p>Upon this I went and made my complaints to Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Mirck,</hi> whose
Prisoner I was, and told him how I had been robbed and abused by some Troopers,
who had taken away my money, and among other things a Gold Medal, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hich I
was more concerned for the loss of, than for any thing else. He told me, I was to
blame not to put that into his hand. Search was presently made for the Rogues,
which he ordered more for the sake of the Medal, which he had a mind to, than for
any thing else; and one of them was taken and hang'd for an example, but I never
could get any of my things I had lost any more.</p>
               <p>When we came near <hi>Ausburg,</hi> the Prisoners that were on Horseback had orders to
alight and walk, and so they led us into the Town by four and four, behind our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
who marched thus triumphing over us into the Town. There was no remedy
but this bitter Cup must be drank, as well as all the rest, which I was not at all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
or ever lookt for, when I surrendred my self upon a promise of our being ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
used. Afterwards I presented Collonel <hi>Mirck</hi> with my pretty Horse. They
put us all in Cellars, where we had no Bed but Straw, nor any light but what could
come to us through the Chinks and Grates of the Cellars. That is, in plain terms,
they threw us into Dungeons, to extort from us a higher ransome.</p>
               <p>In this wretched condition did we live three long months, and had nothing to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon, but the Alms we sent to beg about the Town for poor Prisoners. For the
people are generally charitable in that Country, and there were some good women,
that would bring us Bread, and Beer, or Cyder in their Aprons, and let it down to
us through the Grate by Ropes. We sent to ask some Charity of the Monks, who
could do whatever they pleased in that city. But from them we had nothing but
hard-heartedness; and the <hi>Lutherans</hi> shewed themselves much kinder and more
compassionate than those Monks, who value themselves upon acting like
great Politicians in these cases. Which enraged me to that degree, that I and
six or seven more of us were resolved to be revenged on them for it, as you shall
hear shorly.</p>
               <p>XVII. When we had lain in these Dungeons two or three months, and suffered
inconveniencies and miseries greater than can be exprest, and all this while none
of my friends ever thought of me, or ever made application at Court, either that
I might be ransomed, or exchanged; God alone remembred us, and sent me a man
full of Charity, who, as he was visiting the Prisoners, out of a principle of
piety and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:100923:137"/>
Compassion, was moved with the sad condition to which he saw me reduced. He
was a Picture-drawer in <hi>Bretagne,</hi> who came to trade in that Country, and took com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
on me, without the least acquaintance in the world. When he saw in what
a wretched and poor case we lay, he asked me at first, Whether if he should furnish
me with fifty Crowns, I could pay him again at <hi>Paris?</hi> I was surprized, and almost
struck dumb at so charitable a Proposal, from a person whom I had no knowledge of.
But after a little consideration, I told him honestly and frankly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That if I lived to
come back into <hi>France,</hi> I would engage to pay him; but if I should die in this place,
his fifty Crowns would be lost. <hi>I will not deceive you, Sir,</hi> (said I) <hi>nor shall my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
misery and want tempt me to deal unfairly with you.</hi> The good Man, after pausing
with himself a good while, reply'd, <hi>Well, Sir, come, it's no great matter; I am satisfy'd
with your promise to see me duely paid, if you live to go back into</hi> France; <hi>and if you chance
to dye, though I should lose fifty Crowns, I shall not think my self one whit the poorer, when
they are bestowed in Charity upon one, whose Circumstances need them so much</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he ask'd me, if I had any Friends in any of the Cities in <hi>Germany?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
No, not any. He enquired again, if I knew any body at <hi>Amsterdam?</hi> I told
him, I had some acquaintance with one Monsieur <hi>de Cumans,</hi> a very civil Gentleman,
and a Merchant there. <hi>I am very glad of that,</hi> (said he) <hi>for I know him too, and will
write to him about you.</hi> I exprest my thanks for his great Charity as well as I could;
and from that minute lookt upon this Man, as one sent by Providence, to comfort me
in that great extremity. Next day he was as good as his word, and brought me fifty
Crowns, part of which I distributed among my Fellow-Sufferers, thinking my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to them, a proper expression of grtitude for that bestowed upon my self. This
good Man writ away presently to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and told the Merchant, that he had seen
one <hi>Pontis</hi> at <hi>Ausburg,</hi> who gave a great character of his generosity, and spoke of him,
as one of the best and civillest Gentlemen he had ever met with; and who at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
stood in great need of his assistance, being a Prisoner of War, and in a very la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
condition.</p>
               <p>XVIII. And here I will give you an account how the friendship grew between this
Merchant of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and me. When I went with Mareschal <hi>Brezay</hi> into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
(as was before related at large) I observed something exceeding generous and
desirable in this Man's temper, and contracted a particular acquaintance with him.
Little did I think, when I made him my Friend, that I should by so doing, provide
my self with a Deliverer one day; and that seven or eight years after, I should be
indebted to his liberality, for my freedom from such deplorable circumstances, as I
have now been describing. But God, I doubt not, thought of that for me, and gave
me in it such an instance of his Providence and Mercy, as I can never shew my self
sufficiently thankful for. After my return out of <hi>Holland</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> he sent his Son to
me, and desired I would take care to have him taught the Art of dying in Scarlet, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the fashion of the <hi>Gobelins,</hi> conjuring me to have an eye upon him, and to satisfie
for his Board. I undertook this readily, and was a Father to this young Man, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after him as my own Child; and omitted no possible care for improving him in
his profession, and making him an honest Man. I supply'd him with Money for all
his expences, and especially, I attended him like a second self, all the time of a long
and dangerous sickness, which he lay ill of at <hi>Paris,</hi> sparing neither for care, nor
trouble, nor cost upon him. His Father afterwards desiring me to commit him into
the hands of some honest Man, to go along with him to <hi>Calais,</hi> from whence he was
to take Ship to return into his own Country; I did not think my self too good for
this office, but travelled along with him, and never left him, till I saw him set Sail;
and then I writ to his Father, and sent him word, that I thought my self obliged by
the mutual friendship between us, to bear his Son company as far as the Ship. It will
be no such great wonder, if after all this, the honest Merchant behaved himself so
generously, as I am now going to shew you he did, when he understood to what a
deplorable condition I was reduced in <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIX. About six weeks after the Limner of <hi>Bretagne</hi> had been so charitable to give
me the 50 Crowns I mentioned, in Prison, and so brought us out of the Cellars into a
Chamber, under a good Guard; the Merchant's own Nephew came to <hi>Ausburg,</hi> and
desired of the Governor the Count <hi>de Fouques,</hi> that he might have leave to speak
with me. It was granted; and he came in one evening, as we Prisoners were at Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:100923:137"/>
upon a Beef's Head with very scurvy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>awce; of which I could eat none, being
at that time very ill; and coming into the Room with a Torch before him, he askt
whether Monsieur <hi>de Pontis</hi> was not there: I presently went to him, and convinc'd
him I was the person he enquir'd for. After he had saluted me, he told me who he
was; and that his Unkle understanding my misfortune, had sent him on purpose to
make me a proffer of his Credit, his Help, and his Purse. Finding my self extremely
obliged by so unusual a generosity, I answered, That I could in no degree deserve,
that he should take so long a journey upon my account; but indeed I had undergone
so much hardship since my being a Prisoner, that I was not in a capacity to refuse an
offer so much to my advantage; which yet was contrary to my custome, for I had
never used to make use of my friends for my own Interest.</p>
               <p>After a world of complements on both sides, I told him, that the person who had
acquainted his Unkle with my misfortune, had been so charitable to lend me fifty
Crowns, tho unknown, and the first favour I would beg, was to see him paid. He
did so: And then telling the Count <hi>de Fouques,</hi> that he would be responsible for me,
he brought me, and my companions, (whom I f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rnished with some Money) out of
Prison. For upon the credit of Monsieur <hi>Cumans</hi> I received eight or ten thousand
Livres, which I made use of to supply our present occasions, and to pay some part of
my Ransom, that I might be still more at large; being loth to lay down the whole
summ, because I liv'd in continual hopes of being exchang'd for some Prisoner of
Quality; and so was content to wait, tho it were something the longer, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of being set free that way.</p>
               <p>All this while I was much importun'd to give my <hi>Parole,</hi> that so I might be at per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
liberty, to go about without any Guards; which I could have been very well
pleased with, for it was by no means agreeable to my humour, to be always attended,
and under restraint. But I could not prevail with my self to give it a great while,
for not being so secure of the rest as of my self, and not caring to part with my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades
neither, I was afraid, if any of them should afterwards make his escape, for
want of Money to pay his Ranfom, I might be thought to have a hand in it, and
their fault be charged upon me.</p>
               <p>XX. In this interval, when I had my liberty in some degree only, it was that we
laid a design for causing some insurrection in the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Territories, out
of our resentments against the Monks I told you of; who had provoked us exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
by denying that relief which we had reason to expect from Catholicks, and
Priests, and Monks. For they were not satisfied with lending us nothing themselves,
but pretended a mighty zeal for the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Interests, in whose Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their power was in a manner absolute: They gave out, when we were taken out
of the Cellars into a Chamber, that the Count <hi>de Fouques</hi> had done very ill to allow
us any inlargement; and that no methods could be too strict to secure our persons,
considering we were <hi>French,</hi> and might occasion disturbances in the State. Of this
fresh Charity of theirs our host inform'd me, who had himself a great concern for
our miserable condition. And observing with much indignation how far their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
zeal transported them against us, I resolv'd to be reveng'd on them whatever
came on't, and thought I might justly make them smart, for their base and barbarous
behaviour towards Prisoners and Strangers of their own Religion. Tho it must be
confest at the same time, that I had pitcht upon a violent course to bring this about.
But in short, if I was to blame in my measures, my zeal for Justice I thought would
bear me out; and I think I could say, that I was not so much concern'd to vindicate
my own private cause, as that of the publick, of Charity, and of Religion; all which
these Monks by their carriage to us, had made so manifest a breach upon.</p>
               <p>We were allow'd to walk abroad sometimes with some Guards; and one day,
when they happen'd to be at some distance from us, I said to my fellow-prisoners;
<hi>I do not know what you think of it Gentlemen, but for my own part, I am fully resolved to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd
upon these Monks of</hi> Ausburg, <hi>that are a scandal to our Religion, and have not shew'd
us half so much Charity as the</hi> Lutherans. <hi>If you will take my advice, we ought all to combine
together, and try if we can do the King a piece of service, by endeavouring to reduce a Town into
his Majesty's possession, where these Monks exercise so rigid, and so uncontrouled a power. The
greatest mischief that can come upon us is but Death: And Death is an honour in such a cause;
besides that it will be our advantage too, by putting a period to so much misery. Let us then choose
to dye, rather than endure so unjust a Tyranny. Let us vindicate Religion and Piety, and serve
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:100923:138"/>
our King, even in this distant Country, where we are strang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rs, and prisoners for his quarrel.</hi>
I had no sooner said this to them, but they were all of the same mind with me, and
exprest the same inclination for the service of their Prince.</p>
               <p>At the same time we contriv'd together to feel the pulse of some <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and
try to engage them on our side. To this purpose went up to a <hi>German</hi> Captain, who
was walking at some distance from us; and having at first discourst him upon indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
things, we very luckily discover'd, that the man whom we had a mind to engage,
had the same desigu himself, and would fain be sounding us upon the matter. When
therefore when we had gained an opportunity of talking freely with this Officer, and
he had open'd his breast as freely to us, he assur'd us of his resolution to assist us, and
that nothing in his power should be wanting to that purpose. Afterwards I found
means to break the secret to a Master <hi>Echevin,</hi> who was a man of great Gallantry,
and had formerly commanded in the Army: For I, knowing that these imperious
Monks were grown intolerable, and odious to all the world, ventured to speak of it
to him, and finding him no less violently set against them, I imparted our resolution,
which he liked of very well, and promis'd to second me to the best of his ability,
professing himself horribly tir'd with the present Government. So being secure of
some friends in the Town, and pretty sure besides, that all the <hi>French</hi> Souldiers, that
might happen to be then at <hi>Ausburg,</hi> would readily joyn with us, it was agreed, that
our Town-friends should get one of the Gates into their possession; that we Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
who were a good many, should secure another; and that I should first give
the Prince notice of the whole design, that he might move that way to our relief,
and countenance and farther our attempt, by appearing at the time when we were to put it in execution.</p>
               <p>All our measures were exceeding well taken, and having communicated the design
to but few persons, (for fear of some treachery) we had great reason to hope for good
success. In the mean while I contrived a way to send a man privately to the Prince
to acquaint him with the whole matter, and desire that he would second our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.
But his answer was both a surprize and an affliction to us, for he sent us
word; that the King's business would not allow him to come to our assistance;
that his Majesties Armies were otherwise engaged, and harrassed, and but in an ill
condition; that I should consider therefore very well before I attempted any thing,
for fear we should hazard being all lost. And thus our design fell through. And,
tho at that time we were extremely dissatisfied that it did so, yet upon cooler and
more serious reflections upon it since, I cannot but acknowledge there was more heat
and rashness, than wisdom in the attempt; and all this occasioned by passionate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments
at the barbarity of a parcel of hard-hearted Monks: So that the success
would have been uncertain at the best, and our own utter ruine might very probably have been the consequence of it.</p>
               <p>And now, after having refused a long time to engage my <hi>Parole,</hi> for the reason I
mentioned before, I and my Comrades resolved to do it last, not being able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the slavery and constraint of Guards any longer. But before we engaged, I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu'd
with them very earnestly, that they ought rather to dye, than not be true to it;
and that it was a most unbecoming thing, for men of honour, as we pretended to be,
to engage for any thing, except they are fully resolv'd to make it good. One of them
afterwards had a mind to make his escape, and it was in my power to do it as well
as he; but I opposed him in his intentions, and would by no means give way that he
should be guilty of so much baseness: Nay, as a further discouragement, I told him
upon this occasion, a story that I shall always remember; which was, that my Master
the late King cashier'd an Officer, that made his escape after his <hi>Parole</hi> was past;
and declar'd, a man that had been false to his own honour, was not fit for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>Assoon then as our <hi>Parole</hi> was given, and we at liberty, I began to see company,
and frequent the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Court. I got acquainted with several great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and particularly the Count <hi>de Coeurse,</hi> a favourite of the Prince. The Duke
of <hi>Bavaria</hi> himself, to whom I was a little known, receiv'd me very graciously; and
being informed, that I was the man who commanded in the business of <hi>Meninghen,</hi>
he would several times have perswaded me to stay at his Court; telling me often,
<hi>You see no body thinks of you in</hi> France; <hi>I am confident they will let you dye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ere, and never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
you for any Officer of mine. Therefore if you will take my advice, even set up your rest
here. I will put you into such an Employ as shall please you; nay, you your self shall be your own
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:100923:138"/>
chooses.</hi> Nothing could be kinder and more engaging, than my usage from this
Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the importunate offers he made me to enter into his service. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
resentments I either had, or had cause to have against the Court of <hi>France,</hi> where
in truth I was quickly and perfectly forgotten, yet I could not prevail with my self to
stick to a Court life, nor relish any proposal of that nature, how much soever it
might turn to my advantage: Besides I lived in hopes still that my friends would do
something for me. And it is most certain, if Mareschal <hi>Vitry</hi> had not unfortunately
died about the time we were made Prisoners, he would have used his interest very
vigorously for me, and would have taken care, that the action of <hi>Meninghen</hi> should
have had its due character and value. But my misfortune was, that the Mareschal
being dead, Monsieur <hi>R—</hi> who knew not how to answer it to himself, that he
should be so shamefully suprized, when Monsieur <hi>Vitry</hi> and I shewed so much reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
and conduct in holding out against three Armies with a handful of men, did
all he could to diminish and stifle this action; and so by robbing others of the honour
due to them, hoped in some measure to conceal his own shame.</p>
               <p>XXI. At last, finding my self utterly forsaken, and forgotten by all my friends, I
resolved to send away a Courier to <hi>France</hi> at my own charge, and write to Monsieur
<hi>Servien,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>d' Avaux,</hi> to beg that they would speak to the Queen in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
and contrive to have me exchanged for some other Prisoner. Monsieur <hi>Servien,</hi>
I suppose, either because he was taken up with business of greater consequence, or
because he had no good news to send me, never answered my Letter. Monsieur
<hi>d' Avaux</hi> did me the favour to write back to me, and sent me word, he had written
to Court in my favour, but there were so very many Prisoners, and every thing at
present in such confusion, that he very much questioned, whether he should be able
to do me the service he desired, but however he would endeavour it heartily. Still
I lived in expectation, and could not believe it possible, that an Officer who had
spent all his life in the Army, and whose services were well known to all the Court,
(not to say any thing of this last, which I thought might deserve some sort of reward)
should be neglected and forgotten. But the event taught me by sad experience, that
I reckoned without my Host; and as much as I had seen of the world, I was not then
sufficiently convinc'd, that imprisonment or death, for the honour of one's Prince,
and the good of their Countrv, is too often lookt upon as a recompence sufficient for all the services a man hath done them.</p>
               <p>While I lived in hopes of good news from Court, I went to visit several places in
<hi>Germany,</hi> particularly <hi>Munick,</hi> where his Highness of <hi>Bavaria</hi> usually makes his resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
I had the honour to discourse with his Highness pretty often, and very freely
upon several occasions that offered themselves. Monsieur <hi>de Fouques</hi> and I were talking
one day before him of several fine Horses, rare Birds, and many other Curiosities,
which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had presented to the King of <hi>France;</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Fouques</hi>
was saying, that though these two Kings made war upon one another, yet there was
no hatred between them; and adding afterwards, that he could not believe the King
of <hi>France</hi> had any design upon <hi>Germany.</hi> I took him up there, because I thought
such discourse was not for the honour of the Kings pretensions; and answer'd him
boldly before his Highness; <hi>For my part, Sir,</hi> (said I) <hi>it is my opinion, that the King my
Master hath still a great ambition to recover that Throne at one time or other, upon which his
Ancestors have sat heretofore.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> presently turned this into raillery,
and said, He was not at all surpriz'd at my answer, for in truth he expected no other
from me; that I was a true <hi>Frenchman</hi> upon all occasions, and continued so still, tho
driven into <hi>Germany;</hi> and he perceived I had a mind to take some sort of revenge
upon them that had made me Prisoner. And indeed I never stood much upon cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
where the honour of <hi>France,</hi> and the Arms of the King were concerned. For
how just provocation soever I might have at that time, not to speak any thing to the
advantage of the <hi>French</hi> Court, yet I could never devest my self of that natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and tenderness for my Country, which always disposed me to vindicate its honour
upon such occasions, where the character of a good <hi>Frenchman</hi> depends upon having a
less regard to ones own private interests, than those of ones Prince and Nation.</p>
               <p>XXII. At last I grew quite weary of this sort of life in a strange Country, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we were no more any body's care in <hi>France,</hi> than if we had been dead; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
too, that we were to be sent to the lower end of all <hi>Germany</hi> to bear Arms
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:100923:139"/>
there, I resolv'd to come to terms for my Ransome, and perswaded my fellow Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to do the same, having lent seven or eight of them Money, by the help of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Cumans</hi> correspondent, who had orders to deny me nothing I desired of him.
That very day the Collonel invited us to dinner, and when we had din'd, he bad us
take leave of our friends, and come again to his Lodging, telling us we should eat a
Pasty with him in his Garden, and drink a parting Bottle to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and
his Highness of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s health. At the same time he made great excuses for not
using us as we deserved; assuring us, our ill treatment proceeded from no malice or
contempt, but was to be imputed to the Custom of the Country, and the common
right of War, which intitles a man to the getting an honourable Ransome for his
Prisoners: Adding, that if it were his fortune ever to be Prisoner in <hi>France,</hi> he should
not take it ill to be so used, for the enhancing his Ransom. I told him, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any great notice of his complement, That we had been very hardly used indeed,
and I durst promise him, if ever he were so unhappy to be our Prisoner, he would
have reason to commend our usage, and soon discern the difference between the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> But however, since it was the custome to use Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of War thus, I would promise him, we would retain no grudge against the
Country in general, nor himself in particular; nay, that if I met with any opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of serving him, I would do it with all my heart.</p>
               <p>Thus we left him, intending to return again when we had taken leave of our friends:
But as soon as we were got out of his house, there happened a sad misfortune both to
him and us: For as he was leading his Wife down stairs into the Garden, his Spurs
threw him down, and he fell quite from the top of the steps to the bottom, and there
struck his Head violently against a little Pillar, and broke his Skull with the blow. He
was speechless presently, and within four and twenty hours dyed. We came back
presently, and finding the poor man in this lamentable condition, we resolv'd to go
off without delay, for we had our Pass-ports; and were afraid of what happen'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
that they should confine us again. But the Collonels Lady prevail'd upon
us to stay, almost whether we would or no. And the Officers of the Garrison in
the mean time wrote away to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> to desire he would give them
leave to stop us, for now the Collonel was dead, we were going away, without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Ransome,</p>
               <p>His Highness not being informed, from any other hand, how the case really stood,
granted their request; and so, after all the barbarities we had undergone before, we
suffered at last the greatest injustice that could possibly be done us, and were forced to
be ransomed over again. And I am sure I may say, the losses I sustained this year
were greater than my circumstances could possibly bear; for after eighteen Horses
(some of which were very valuable ones) and all my Baggage had been taken from
me, I was constrained to lay down my Ransom twice over. Nor do I put into this
account the Money I lent my Companions, part of which I lost too into the bargain.</p>

               <p>I. WHen my Ransom was paid the second time, I made all the haste I could
out of a Country, that had given me so much reason to dislike it.
So away we went for <hi>France,</hi> one or two of my fellows and I, leaving
Monsieur <hi>Rubentel</hi> who was falling sick, behind us at <hi>Vberlinghen.</hi> I
gave him what Money he was likely to have occasion for, and left my self only just
enough to carry me to <hi>Lyons,</hi> depending upon meeting a fresh supply there. When
we were about a days Journey from <hi>Ausburg,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Souldier that had made his
escape overtook us, and seeing him on foot and bare of Money, I bought him a
H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rse that he might bear us company, and bore his charges the whole Journey.
Which accident, and the loss of one of my Horses that died upon the Road, drain'd
me quite dry by that time I got into <hi>Switzerland.</hi> Not knowing who to apply my
self to, I concluded at last to go wait on Monsieur <hi>Cumartin,</hi> Embassador from the
King in that Country; and told him, Though I had not the honour of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
yet necessity compell'd me to implore his compassion upon poor Prisoners that
came out of <hi>Germany,</hi> and wanted Money to finish our Journey into <hi>France.</hi> After
several other questions had past, he asked how much I wanted; I answered him, we
should have occasion for about five hundred Crowns. Tho he seem'd to boggle a
little at first, because I was not known to him, yet he received me after a very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
manner, and furnished me with a thousand, or twelve hundred Livres, which
serv'd me till I reacht <hi>Paris.</hi> I went presently after to wait upon the Queen, who
asked me a great many particulars about the Country from whence I came, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all that had happened, promised to be mindful of me, and immediately gave me
six hundred Pistoles. But alas! this was but like a drop of Water to the Ocean I
had lost, and that I stood in need of at that very time to equip me out afresh, for going
into the Army once more, which the Queen would needs engage me to do.</p>
               <p>Monsieur <hi>Cumans</hi> in the mean while, who had supplied all my wants of Money in
<hi>Germany,</hi> according to his usual generosity, writ to me, to desire I would not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie,
nor streighten my self upon his account, but bad me pay him when I could;
and if I were not in a condition to do it, he should reckon himself fully paid, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had it in his power to do me service. And here I cannot forbear observing,
what a mighty difference there many times is, between that Friendship which great
men do you the honour to make professions of, and that which plain honest men
really have for you. For at the very same time that I lay deserted, and utterly
forgotten of some Noblemen, who knew very well, that I had frequently done them
service, at the expence of my own life; even then did a Stranger, a <hi>Dutch-man,</hi>
and a Trading man, behave himself to me throughout the whole b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>siness, with a
largeness of Soul more like a Prince, than one of his condition; and all this in grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
for the care I took of his Son. But notwithstanding Monsieur <hi>Cumans</hi> great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
I, who could never endure to be outdone by my friends, in the little emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of generosity and kindness, and was desirous to pay off my debts faithfully, sold
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:100923:140"/>
an Estate which I had in <hi>Beauce,</hi> for fifty thousand Livres, and paid Monsieur <hi>Cumans</hi>
his Correspondent at <hi>Paris,</hi> what Money I ow'd him. At the same time I put two of
my Nieces that were poor, and had been recommended to my charity, into the Habit,
placing one of them in a Convent of <hi>Vrsulines,</hi> and the other in St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
both in <hi>Provence.</hi> Thus when I had most occasion for Money my self, I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to make some acknowledgment for the charity I had lately received from
Strangers, and the eminent protection of God over me.</p>
               <p>At my return from <hi>Germany,</hi> I found that the Relation I had trusted with my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
had made use of it for his own pleasure, and was extremely enraged to see so
base a disposition in him; nor would I ever be reconciled, till he had restored me
my Jewel, and engaged to give two hundred Pistoles to my Nephews. When this
was done, I had a mind to let him see, that this unworthy behaviour had not alter'd
my affection for him; and, as a pattern of generosity for him to copy after, gave him
the first Company of the Queen's Regiment, which had all this while been reserved
for me. For I had no inclination to go abroad with Monsieur <hi>Vitry</hi> the next Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne,
being much offended at what I had heard, that his Mother Madam <hi>de Virty,</hi> had
not spoken so well of me to the Queen, as she might have done; and finding so ill
a return made me for the service I had done her Son, at the hazard of my Liberty,
my Estate, and my Life. But still I continued to love and honour Monsieur <hi>Vitry,</hi>
and he exprest all the Sentiments of a Person of Quality, and a true Friend for
me.</p>
               <p>I forgot to tell you, that when I came back to <hi>Paris,</hi> my honest Picture-Merchant
came to see me, and congratulate my return. I was extremely glad it was in my
power to entertain him, and express'd by all the possible civilities how much I thought
my self obliged by the charity he shew'd me, when in a strange Country, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to him. Afterwards I bought a Case of Pictures, very curious ones, which
cost me four hundred Livres, and made him a Present of them. But this good Man
had a generous Soul, and would by no means accept of them, telling me in his honest
plain way, <hi>Pray, Sir, do not oblige me to take this; Come, I am richer still than you are;
and your occasions for money are greater than mine.</hi> So we contested this point of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity
some time, I carried the cause at last, and engaged him, whether he would or
no, to take what he could not refuse, without putting a slight upon me.</p>
               <p>II. Being to receive one of my Pensions, I went to <hi>Fountainblea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> where the Court
was at that time, to sollicit the Queen for payment. Her Mujesty having given me
assurance that she would remember me, I was in continual expectation of seeing her
promise made good. But after two months stay at <hi>Fountainebleau,</hi> and a great deal of
money spent to no purpose, in hopes of receiving my due, I grew weary at last of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedious
a delay; and thinking I had got a fair convenience of putting her Majesty
decently enough in mind of her promise, I presented the Ticket for my Pension, and
told her, She was graciously pleased to say she would think of me, but since I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a multitude of other business of greater concern, in which her Majesty was
involved, had been the occasion of my being hitherto forgotten; I was come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
the Grant which my Master, the late King, had done me the favour to bestow
upon me, that so she might gratifie some other person with it, of more desert than
I could pretend to. The Queen was a little surprized, and said to me in some heat,
<hi>You are very impatient, wait a little longer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I did so, and was resolved to see what would become of this second promise. But
at last I grew impatient again, and seeing my self so long put off in the getting so
small a sum as five hundred Crowns that were due to me, was resolved to apply my
self a third time to the Queen, and contrary to the advice of my Friends, which I
ought to have followed, rather than my own opinion, went a little too warmly to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
my Grant again. She took it, but in the sudden passion she was in, threw me the
Paper back, and full of indignation, to see me so importunate, said, <hi>Oh! the late King
hath often told me indeed, that you were hasty and passionate. Madam,</hi> said I, <hi>the late King
was my Master, and his taking notice of me, though but to reprove my failings, was an honour
greater than I deserved. But, Madam, I dare assure your Majesty, if he found any fault with
my humour, he never could find any failing in my fidelity.</hi> The Queen said, She did not speak
so with regard to my fidelity, but she blamed my passion. Thus was I paid for my
obstinacy, and taught to my cost, to take my Friend's advice another time. And yet
methinks there was a great deal to be said in my excuse, and some allowance might
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:100923:140"/>
be made for a Man that finds himself driven to extremities, and is mad to see such a
return made for his Services.</p>
               <p>Upon this Reprimand, I kept aloof off; and Monsieur <hi>d' Etampes,</hi> the Master of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
coming into the Room some time after, made up towards me, and began to
enter into discourse with me. I said to him with a smile, <hi>Have a care what you do,
Sir, do you know that you are talking with a Man in disgrace, and one that the Queen hath but
just now been in a great passion against? Say you so?</hi> (reply'd he very pleasantly)<hi>Well, I
would discourse with you for that very reason, that I may convince you my friendship for you
is not the less for all that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. The Queen, who was gone into her Closet, came out in the evening with only
one light before her, and was very intent upon reading a Letter. I took her for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Senecay,</hi> because her Majesty did not use to appear so slenderly attended. I could
be pretty free with that Lady, and came behind her, as if I would look into the Letter
she had in her hand, and said, <hi>Madam, Will not you do me the favour to speak for me to
the Queen?</hi> Her Majesty turn'd short at this Compliment, and I stood much confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and most humbly begg'd her pardon for my insolence; telling her, that seeing her
alone, which was very unusual, I took her for one of the Ladies of her Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The
Queen, who some way or other was grown calm in three or four hours time, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
displeased at her self for having spoken to me in so much passion, said to me in
the most civil and obliging way that possibly could be, <hi>This is a Letter come to me
just now, and brings me word that my Son</hi> Anjou <hi>is well, and began to wear Shoes
this very day.</hi> It was too great a favour for me to expect, that her Majesty should
discourse thus to me after my intemperate heat; but she favour'd me yet farther, and
bade me be in the way when she went to the Play, and she would speak to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
in my behalf.</p>
               <p>I was there exactly at the time, and her Majesty having spoken to the Cardinal as
she promised, his Eminence called me to him, and told me the Queen had remembred
me, and spoke kindly of me to him, and that if I would be at his Levee next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he would give order to have me admitted into his Bed-chamber. When I found
things go so well on my side, I could not forbear rallying my Friends a little, who had
most of them deserted me, telling them briskly, That I perceived their kindness was
of more use to others than me; and instead of employing and depending upon my
Friends, I had always found it the best course to sollicit my own business my self.
Next day I waited upon the Cardinal, who wrote me a Ticket with his own hand,
by vertue of which I had my Pension presently paid me.</p>
               <p>IV. But still I was much dissatisfi'd and out of humor, to see my self continue no
way employed, nor at all considered for my Service, and especially to find that last
action of <hi>Meninghen</hi> quite stifled and disparaged, by an envious General; who had no
other way to cover his own disgrace, but by detracting from our deserts. I foresaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too,
that they intended to engage me in the next Campagne, though my losses by my
imprisonment had put me out of a condition to equip my self for the Service. Then
I was out of all patience I confess, and full of resentment at this hard usage. I went
and made my complaint to a great Minister of State, and with all the strength of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
I could, represented to him the deplorable Circumstances which my Service to the
late King had reduced me to. This person, instead of giving me any satisfaction,
fell foul upon me for ingratitude, and told me, That since the King designed to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
me in this Campagne, I had nothing to do but to obey. Upon this I reply'd
very hotly, and indiscreetly, That all the World took notice how unjustly I had been
dealt with; that an old Officer, as I was, ought not to be used at this rate; and as
for the next Campagne, I was positively resolved not to be concerned in it; that I
had lost all, in losing my Master the late King; and was very little sollicitous now for
any thing that could happen to me.</p>
               <p>This Answer provoked him to that degree, that he procured at Warrant against
me, to clap me up in the <hi>Bastile.</hi> I had notice of the thing, and at first made a Jest
of it, thinking this was meant only to fright me. But being afterwards assured by
one of my Friends, that it was really true, and if I were found at my own lodging, I
should be confined in two hours time, I thought it unreasonable to carry it big any
longer, and went privately to a Lord's house that belonged to the Court, who told
me, he was very much my Friend, but had not interest enough to protect me, and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:100923:141"/>
was afraid I could not be safe with him. Then I went to Monsieur <hi>Harcourt,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
I might take Sanctuary with him, who received me with great kindness and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity,
lodged me in a private Room, sent my Dinner and Supper up constantly into
my Chamber, and did me the honour to come and sit with me every morning and
evening.</p>
               <p>Here I continued to play least in sight for seyeral weeks, till Mareschal <hi>Melleray</hi>
coming one day to the Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi>'s, and I having the honour to discourse him,
he told me he would engage to speak for me, and make my peace with the Queen.
Accordingly he carried me to the <hi>Louvre</hi> in his own Coach, and presented me to her
Majesty, who did me the favour to tell me, that she had given out no special Order
against me in particular, but only a general one, to secure all the Officers that refused
to go with the Army. Thus the passion I fell into, though it gave me great appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of being utterly out of favour, yet gave me some comfort at least, to find
my self in good graces at Court, and perfectly at liberty again.</p>
               <p>V. After this I was order'd to go into <hi>Provence,</hi> and carry over some Troops, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of five or six thousand Men, into <hi>Catalonia.</hi> I cannot, at present, recollect any thing
very remarkable, that happen'd to me upon this occasion. This was during the first
<hi>Paris</hi> War, when every body knows the whole Kingdom was in great disturbance
and confusion. I received a Command besides, to guard the Mountains of <hi>Provence</hi>
and <hi>Dauphine.</hi> For this Service I raised a Regiment of Foot, and a Troop of Horse:
But found a vast difference between these Troops, and those I had commanded under
the late King. For then the strict Discipline he kept up, gave me an absolute Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over my Souldiers, but now I was wearied out with perpetual complaints of these
Fellows, who gave themselves up to Rapine and Licentiousness, and thought they
were priviledged by the disorder these Civil Wars occasioned, to shake off all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of obedience. I could not endure this insolence, nor was in a condition to keep
these Brutes under as formerly, being slenderly supported, and very ill paid, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
chose rather to quit the Employment, which I could not honourably discharge.
So I delivered up my Regiment to another Officer of a temper something more pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
and less nice in point of Discipline than mine. While I was thus employed
in maintaining the King's Rights about <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Dauphine,</hi> I married one of my
Nieces to a Gentleman very well descended of the Family of <hi>Poligny.</hi> This Niece
was Daughter to my eldest Brother's Son. And as I now married the Daughter, so
by an accident much of the same nature, I had married the Father several years
before. There was something so very observable in both these Matches, that I think
they deserve a particular Relation here, and therefore I will give you the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of both, and begin with that of the Father.</p>
               <p>VI. I forgot in these <hi>Memoirs</hi> to tell you, that I had a Brother who was one of the
Knights of <hi>Maltha,</hi> concerning whom I think my self obliged to relate one very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Story here. He was a Person of great Wit and Learning, could speak
several Languages, and among the rest the <hi>Turkish',</hi> as perfectly well as his own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Tongue,
the <hi>French.</hi> This inclined him to make some stay at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where
he applied himself to consider that place and state thoroughly, and with great judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
observed the strong and the weak sides of it. I remember he hath often told
me, and made a report of the same nature, to the great Master of their Order, that
if the Christian Princes would once unite together, it were a very easie matter for
them to make themselves Masters of that famous City; and that he always thought
the support of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire was owing, not so much to any strength of its
own, as to the divisions among its Enemies. He had the reputation at <hi>Maltha,</hi> of a
Man of bravery and courage; and for my own part, I think in my Conscience I was
but a Coward, and a meer Chicken in comparison of him.</p>
               <p>In one of his probational Expeditions aboard a Vessel of their Order, he was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked,
and taken by some <hi>Algerines.</hi> He immediately threw his Cross over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>board,
knowing, that the <hi>Turks</hi> hate the Knights mortally, and either kill them, or set very
extravagant Ransoms upon them. He had some good Fortune with his bad, for he
fell into the hands of a Master much more generous and civil, than the generality of
those barbarous People use to be. The <hi>Turk</hi> asked him, what he could do? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
he had skill in Horses, and could manage them, and teach them all that
would make them valuable; that he could draw too, and design, and do a great many
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:100923:141"/>
such things. The <hi>Turk</hi> who had travell'd and was well accomplished, was very well
satisfied with so dextrous a Slave; and buying up some young Horses, the Knight
managed them to his Master's content, and convinced him he had pretended to no
more than he was able to perform. Thus three years past on, in which the Knight
made several attempts to escape, but could not.</p>
               <p>At the end of this term, the <hi>Turk</hi> highly pleased wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h his Slave's service, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aid to
him, <hi>I am very well satisfied with you, and am ready to give you good proofs of it, if you have
any kindness to ask me.</hi> The Knight answered him, That he was infinitely obliged to
him, and thought a Slave ought to ask nothing more of his Master, than that his
services may be well accepted. <hi>I commend your Modesty</hi> (replyed the <hi>Turk) and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
your meaning, tho you dare not speak it out. Serve me one year more, and then you shall
see what I will do for you.</hi> One may easily imagine what care and pains this Knight
took all that year, to confirm himself in his Master's favour. So when that was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
his Master sent for him into his Chamber, and said to him, <hi>You have served me
not like a Slave, but a man of honour; and now I will use you like such a man, and reward
the care and affection you have shewn in my service. Tell me therefore to what place you desire
to be conveyed, how you would be habited, and what you have occasion for. Ask every thing
freely, and you shall have it as freely of me, as you should from the best friend you have in the
world.</hi> Being told, that he was desirous to go to <hi>Marseilles,</hi> he clothed him according
to his own mind, and found out a Vessel for him, paid his fraight, and gave him
more Money than he asked for. And thus he was sent back, as highly favoured by
this <hi>Turk,</hi> as the <hi>Turk</hi> had been satisfied before with the faithful service of the Knight,
without ever discovering who, or what he was.</p>
               <p>VII. Upon his arrival at <hi>Marseilles,</hi> he writ me word how extremely dissatisfied he
was with my elder Brother, who was not so generous and kind to him as he ought
to have been, and betrayed a great deal of coldness and indifferency for his sufferings,
during the time of his Slavery. The hot disposition which I knew the Knight to be of,
and the angry terms in which he exprest himself in his Letter, made me apprehensive
some mischief might come of this. So I askt the King (for it was in his life time)
that I might take a Journey into <hi>Provence,</hi> and went thither post. When I was once
upon the spot, it was no hard matter for me to compose all quarrels: For I furnished
the Knight with whatever he desired; and when I had equipped him sufficiently for
his return to <hi>Maltha,</hi> I was inclined to oblige my elder Brother too with new proofs
of my affection. I begg'd that when his Son was a little grown up, he would send
him to <hi>Paris,</hi> and promis'd to see him instructed in Philosophy, and all other exercises
of a Gentleman, that were fit to accomplish him for the world. He was very willing
to embrace the proposal, and accordingly sent him to me, when he was about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
or fourteen. I took all imaginable care of him, and spared nothing for him, but
had him educated as my own Son. This happened some months before the Siege of
<hi>Rochelle,</hi> of which you have an account in the first part of this Book.</p>
               <p>VIII. But before I give a relation how this Nephew of mine was marry'd, I must
tell one story more, which tho it be strictly true, yet I am sensible will look some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Romantick; and that is, how my Brother, the Knight of <hi>Maltha,</hi> found an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of making the <hi>Turk</hi> whose Slave he had been, a grateful return, by an act
of generosity, greater than that had been shewn him before. Five or six years after
he had been set at liberty, happening one day to be at <hi>Marseilles,</hi> and walking with
a friend of his upon the Key, he saw a Vessel make into Harbour, and some Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
coming to shore, with several Slaves that they had taken. There was amongst
the rest one <hi>Turk,</hi> who presently a wakened in him the Idea of some face he had seen
before, but he could not suddenly recollect whether he were the very person he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
him to be or not. At last coming up closer, and taking a nicer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>view, he found
it to be his old Master. Upon this, he threw his arms about his neck, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
him in a great rapture of joy, he said; <hi>Providence hath ordered, that you should
meet me at</hi> Marseilles, <hi>because you were so generous to dismiss me from</hi> Algiers, <hi>and used me
with all the kindness and respect of a Friend. And now you shall be convinced that God does not
let good works go unrewarded; and that a</hi> French-man <hi>thinks it a reflection upon him, to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
in civility by any forreigner whatsoever.</hi> Then he enquir'd whose this Slave was, and
what his Ransome; which when he had paid, he gave him a noble Entertainment,
shew'd him all the curiosities of <hi>Marseilles,</hi> and then supply'd all his occasions, gave
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:100923:142"/>
him a great deal more than he had formerly receiv'd from him, and so sent him back
safe to <hi>Algiers</hi> again, according to his own desire. The Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who was then
at <hi>Marseilles,</hi> had a mind to speak with this <hi>Turk</hi> himself; and having several times
heard the story from the Knight, was us'd to say, <hi>Well, now I believe you, because I have
seen your</hi> Turk, <hi>and am an Eye-witness of your kindness, and what you do for him in return; but
otherwise I should have lookt upon your story as no better than a fiction, and a kind of R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mantick
adventure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. The Knight some years after had a considerable Lordship in <hi>Provence,</hi> for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
belonging to the Order lye there; and happen'd to engage himself unfortunately
in the quarrel of a friend of his, to whom he was Second in a Duel; where though
he got the better of his adversary, yet he received a wound, that some days after cost
him his life.</p>
               <p>I confess I cannot sufficiently express my abhorrence of this custom, or rather of this
madness, that puts so many gallant men upon these fatal engagements. I have been
told, that within the time of the late Queen Mother, <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi>'s Regency, there
were reckon'd up nine hundred and thirty Gentlemen, that were kill'd in Duels, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the several Provinces of this Kingdom; and no doubt a great many more there
were, whose deaths were either conceal'd, or else imputed to other causes. Such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men, scattered through the parts of an Army, in several Posts, I fancy were
enough to win a considerable Battel. And really, the wisdom and justice of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. is in this particular highly to be commended, who by a severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
becoming both a Christian and a Prince, hath resolved never to pardon any Duel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists;
and so hath found a way to make these Combats now as uncommon, as they
us'd to be frequent in the reigns of his Predecessors. And for my own part, I cannot
but have an exceeding honour and value, for those many Lords and Gentlemen,
whose Courage is out of all danger of being call'd in question, that have made a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Declaration under their hands, that they could never look upon those men as
persons of Valour, who place their honour in playing of prizes, and by a brutish stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oidity
lavishly throw away those lives that were design'd for the nobler purposes, of
serving the Kingdom, and the defence of their Prince.</p>
               <p>Let us dye in Gods name, at the mouth of a breach, or in a fair Battel, at the head
of a Company, or a Regiment, where our Death is honourable, and our Life a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
paid to God and our Princes, who have a right to it. But who in his senses
would ever expose himself to these bloody encounters, where not only our Life, but
our Fortune and Honour are lost with it too, and in which we cannot lose our lives,
but we must lose Heaven and our Salvation at the same time.</p>
               <p>X. Now I come to speak of the favourable circumstances, which concurred to the
matching first of my Nephew, and afterwards of his Daughter to both their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
and they are such as were likely enough to be thought no less Romantick,
than my account of the Knight of <hi>Maltha,</hi> did not that sincerity and strict regard to
truth, which I have been known to observe all my life long, secure me from any
suspicion of falshood. It happened then, while my elder Brother's Son, who was
sent to me out of <hi>Provence</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> continued under my care, that a Lady of <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinc</hi>
came thither with her Daughter, about a great Suit of Law then depending,
concerning the Guardianship of this young Lady, which was like to be taken away
from her. I had heard some discourse of the thing, and thinking my self obliged to
take their part, as being my Country-women, had a mind first to dive into the true
reason of the Mother's carrying on the cause so zealously. Making a visit one day, I
took the freedom to ask her, if the interest of her Daughter was the only prospect
she had in this Suit; she answered me very frankly, that she sought no advantage of
her own, and valued nothing comparably to her Daughter, and for her sake alone it
was, that she gave herself all this trouble. I believ'd what she said to be true, and
answer'd her with as much ingenuity and openness, that since she proceeded upon so
generous a principle, I would shew as much generosity to her, and serve her both by
my self and my friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as heartily as if her concern were my own.</p>
               <p>Accordingly I began to make my words good, and set all my friends to work in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of this Lady. Her adversaries resolv'd to trouble and tire her out, both by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays
and expences, which are always very great at <hi>Paris,</hi> especially for such as are not
settled inhabitants there; and used all arts to spin out the cause to as great a length as
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:100923:142"/>
they could. The whole Court removing to the Siege of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> as I shewed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
this Lady found it necessary to follow them thither, that she might not seem
to desert her Cause, which then lay before the Council. The extravagant charge of
this business, and at a time when she wanted Money too, forc'd her one day to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to me the great concern she was in to see her estate wasted thus to no purpose, and
her self reduced to want of Money, to supply her present occasions for this Journey. I
encouraged and supported her under it the best I could, assuring her I would do my
utmost to bring this troublesome contest to an honourable conclusion. Then I asked
her what Money she wanted, and upon her desire that I would lend her five hundred
Crowns, I furnished her presently after with two hundred Pistoles. And at last I
made so good interest among my friends, that the Lady carried her point.</p>
               <p>XI. She esteemed her self extremely obliged by the service I had done her, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
upon the most effectual return of my kindness that was possible to be made.
For having seen my Nephew several times, who came to me from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Rochelle,</hi>
and was then about sixteen years old, she would needs marry her Daughter, who was a great fortune, and for whose interest I had been so sollicitous, to this young
Gentleman. The great confidence she had in me made her open her thoughts freely,
and she profest her self highly pleased, that she had this way of making an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
for all the trouble I had been at upon her account, and her Daughters. I

                  </gap>roposal was some surprize to me, for it was what I never lookt for, nor

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. I thought this civility very obliging, and told her, she did me a great deal
of honour; and that the young Lady her Daughter deserved a much better match
than my Nephew, who was but young yet, and no body could tell what sort of man
he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>ake. She took my complemental answer for a refusal, and told me,
She perceived I lookt higher, and thought her Daughter a match not worthy my
Nephew. I presently rectified this mistake, and convinced her I spoke sincerely,
that it was my real opinion her Daughter deserved much better, and all could be said
of my Nephew was, that he was a Youth of good hopes, and one that I durst pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
my self might do very well in time. <hi>But Madam,</hi> said I, <hi>since you have done me
the favour of so generous an offer, I agree to, and accept it with all the gratitude in the world;
and only beg that in consideration how very young both of them are, you would be satisfied with
my Nephews continuing some time longer at</hi> Paris <hi>to perfect himself in his learning; and this,
Madam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without laying any restraint upon you, so that if in the mean while any other person
whom you think better of be proposed, you are at full liberty to entertain him, nor shall I think
my self <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap> except my refusal.</p>
               <p>Some time after her return home she sent me word, that great applications were
made for her Daughter, and she was under some apprehensions of having her stolen;
therefore intreated for the preventing of so great a misfortune, that the Marriage
between her and my Nephew might be concluded. This Letter came to me before
the Siege of <hi>Rochelle</hi> was ended, and I resolved upon sending my Nephew into <hi>Dauphine</hi>
forthwith. To this purpose I provided him a handsome Equipage, and hastened his
Journey all I could, that a match so much for his advantage might not be lost. All
necessary preliminaries were put in good readiness before his arrival, and then no time
was slipt, but the very next day after his coming they were contracted, and some
few days after that were married.</p>
               <p>XII. My Nephew and this Lady of <hi>Dauphine</hi> had a Daughter called <hi>Anne de Pontis,</hi>
who is indeed the occasion of my relating this extraordinary accident of her Father's
Marriage; for now I am to tell you, that as my protection to a Lady in a Suit of
Law brought about the Father's match, during the Siege of <hi>Rochelle;</hi> so the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection

Royalty consisting of fifteen Villages, all inclosed with precipices and natural
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:100923:143"/>
trenches, and no passage into them, except by three several Bridges of Stone. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Poligny</hi> was then some sixty five years old, and had a Son to whom he gave the
name of his Lordship <hi>Vaubonnes;</hi> but there was in the Family besides him, a Natural
Son called <hi>Richard,</hi> whom Monsieur <hi>Poligny</hi> made Steward, or Bailiff of this Mannor,
and who managed his business so, as in a few years to be worth above two hundred
thousand Livres. Monsieur <hi>de Vaubonnes</hi> being yet but very young had a Governour
with him, who took a great deal of care of him, and educated him as was fit for his
quality. When he was grown up to about twelve years old they gave him a Gun,
and his Governour carried him abroad sometimes to teach him to shoor, by practising
upon Thrushes and Black-birds.</p>
               <p>One day as they were out upon this sport, they met Mr. <hi>Richard,</hi> who took the
freedom to come very boldly, and shoot all over their grounds. This young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
provoked at his confidence, asked by whose leave he came a fowling there,
told him he was displeased with it, and bad him take care he did not hear that
he did so any more. <hi>Richard,</hi> who was an insolent fellow, and of a conversation as
scandalous as his birth, replyed very warmly; That this was no new thing, for he
had always used to fowl there, and wondred he should pretend to find fault with it.
Monsieur <hi>de Vaubonnes</hi> replyed, He could not tell whether he had used to do so, or no;
but he advised him to come there no more, for if he did, his Gun should be taken
away from him. <hi>Richard</hi> replyed insolently, That he would break any man's head,
that should offer to take his Gun, let him be who he would. The Governour hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him talk at this sawcy rate, told him, Sure he forgot himself, and did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
he was speaking to his Lord, that he was but Bailiff of <hi>Vaubonnes,</hi> and held all
he had under Monsieur <hi>Poligny,</hi> and owed all his fortunes to him. <hi>I know well enough</hi>
(says <hi>Richard) from whom my fortunes come, and do not intend to be taught by you, and you
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> with that which does not concern you. When young Master is grown up, I shall speak my
mind to him upon this business.</hi> The Governour answered him, That Monsieur <hi>Vaubonnes</hi>
his concerns were his; that if he did not interest himself in them, he did not deserve
to be about him; and he advised him to behave himself as became him, or it would be the worse for him. Upon this they came to hot words, and parted for that time
with much anger on both sides.</p>
               <p>XIII. From that moment <hi>Richard</hi> resolved to be reveng'd upon Monsieur <hi>Vaubonnes</hi>
his Governour, being most enraged at him, because he had heated him; and besides,
he lookt upon the young Gentleman under his care, as no better than a Child. One
day he came with a design to assassinate him, and had the impudence to come up so
far as the very Court before the house, and seeing him with the young Gentleman
at the door, he discharg'd his Gun at him, kill'd him, and fled away. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence
and blackness of this attempt, provok'd Madam <hi>Poligny</hi> extremely. She pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
the fellow by all the ordinary courses of Law, and at last had him sentenc'd
to be hang'd, by the Intendant of the Province. The Murderer saw he was gone,
unless he could remove the Cause out of that Province; and so went to <hi>Fountainebleau,</hi>
there to put in an Appeal before the Council, pretending that Madam <hi>Poligny</hi>'s inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
was so great in the Parliament of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> that he could not expect any fair hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there. This happened a little before the first <hi>Paris</hi> War, and I was then at <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine-bleau.</hi>
But not knowing any thing of this wretch, nor his crime, nor having yet the
honour to be related to Madam <hi>Poligny,</hi> he obtain'd the Kings protection, and leave
to bring it before the Council; and all the while took care never to stir without three
or four lusty Foot-men at his heels, and some friends besides, as wicked and desperate
as himself.</p>
               <p>Shortly after Madam <hi>Poligny</hi> sent me a Letter, giving an account of the baseness
and wickedness of the action, conjuring me to use my interest at Court against this
Murderer, who had been condemn'd to be hanged at home, and remov'd his Cause
to the Council by an Appeal. The assassination was so horrid, and I so affected with
it, that I resolv'd to vindicate this Lady to the utmost of my power. Understanding
that Monsieur <hi>de Gue,</hi> Master of the Requests, had the matter referr'd to his exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and was to be the Reporter of it to the Board, tho every body advis'd me to
object against him, and told me <hi>Richard</hi> had been very powerfully recommended to
his favour, yet I would never do it, for I knew him to be a person of honour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
and a very good Judge. I went to wait on him, and told him, the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he had for justice and honesty, made me very confident he would do Madam
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:100923:143"/>
                  <hi>Poligny</hi> right; that her Adversary was so great a Villain, that he could not pretend to
deserve any favour; and that for my own part, I had no farther concern, than
meerly what the justice of the cause gave me; but after being entreated by that Lady
to give her what assistance I could, I did not decline to become the Accuser of so
base and bold an invasion upon the House of a Lord in the Country, and his own
Feudatory Lord too. <hi>Therefore, Sir,</hi> (said I) <hi>I require justice at your hands, and ask it
against a Villain and a Murderer, that is unworthy of all mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Just as I was pressing the matter thus warmly, <hi>Richard</hi> came into the room where
we were, attended as he used to be with a company of fellows as bad as himself. As
soon as I set my eyes upon the guilty wretch, I took courage afresh, and raising my
voice, <hi>Look you, Sir,</hi> (said I) <hi>I desire you once more to do justice. Here's the very Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,
that hath the confidence to appear before you with a Sword on, after having made no better
use of his arms than basely and cowardly to sacrifice a man of honour to his own revenge. Against
this fellow I require justice, who tho he be the King's Prisoner, and convict of an Invasion, hath
the insolence to go armed still. Pray, Sir, command him to behave himself like a Prisoner, and
keep that respectful distance that is due to his Majesty's Councel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho <hi>Richard</hi> had been (as I said) very strongly recommended to this Master of
Requests, yet so bold an address from one who had no Sword on at that time himself,
made such impression, that both Judge and Criminal stood a while confounded. But
at last, as justice will be heard, and the person to whom I spoke being an honest man,
he could not forbear telling <hi>Richard,</hi> that I was in the right, and therefore he forbad
him the wearing his Sword before him any more. Which made him go away very
much down in the mouth, and highly enraged at me, for getting him to be so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
disarmed.</p>
               <p>The Reporter then promised me justice should be done. But being desirous still
to make more sure of it, I set my friends upon him too, particularly Monsieur <hi>de Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onne</hi>
who was then at Court; and who, after some coldness between the Master of
Requests and him, upon a former quarrel, was reconciled to him, upon this applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that I engaged him in. I made use of Mareschal <hi>Villeroy</hi> too, who honoured me
with his particular friendship, and undertook this business of Madam <hi>Poligny</hi> with
the greatest civility imaginable. For having invited me to meet the Reporter at
dinner next day at his House, when we rose from table to wash, the Mareschal said
to Monsieur <hi>du Gue, Well, Sir, you must needs rid me of the importunate sollicitations of this
man</hi> (meaning me.) <hi>He makes me believe I have some interest in you. Does he say true? And
may I depend upon not being denied by you? You do me honour and justice in thinking so, Sir,</hi> said
the Master of Requests; <hi>I can no more deny any thing you ask, than you can ask any thing
fit for me to deny. Very well, Sir,</hi> said the Mareschal, <hi>all I desire is, that you would for
my sake take care of Madam</hi> Poligny<hi>'s business, and see that she hath Justice done her.
They say the fact she prosecutes for is so horrid, that the Rascal is not fit to have any mercy
shewn him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make my story short, I will only add, that this Reporter, who was a very
good Judge in his own disposition, saw himself so warmly plyed for justice, that <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>'s
appeal was thrown out, and the cause dismist to the Parliament of <hi>Grenoble,</hi>
there to be re-heard, and he to stand and fall by that Tryal. This news confounded
him so, that finding he had no other evasion left, and that he was lost to all intents
and purposes, he resolved to submit himself, and come ask my pardon. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he did, and took all the humblest submissive ways to prevail upon me. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
me not to cast away all pity for him, but to write to Madam <hi>Poligny</hi> in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
assuring her from him, that he was very ready to make her what satisfaction
she pleased; that he acknowledged his fault with great remorse, and confest the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
had put him upon committing it.</p>
               <p>I asked him with some indifference, whether he considered what he said, and if
he spoke heartily, <hi>For</hi> (said I) <hi>if you engage me in any promises for you, and do not see my
word made good, I shall then turn your Adversary my self, and you will make but a bad business
of it.</hi> He protested he spoke sincerely, and was resolved to be true to his promise.
Upon this assurance I proffer'd to write to Madam <hi>Poligny,</hi> being really moved with
compassion at the forlorn condition I saw him in, and desiring to put a good end to a
Tryal of so horrid a nature. Accordingly I acquainted the Lady how I found Mr.
<hi>Richard</hi> disposed, and desired her rather to proceed gently, and think of some accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation,
and do an act of mercy to a wretch that profest a hearty repentance for
his fault, and a great inclination to make her any manner of satisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:100923:144"/>
XIV. Some time after this it was, that the King sent to me to pass some Troops
over into <hi>Gatalonia,</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> In the mean while <hi>Richard</hi> had sent my Letter to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Poligny,</hi> who easily granting his request, said, They would try whether this man
would behave himself any better, and keep the promise he had made to me. To
this purpose they chose four Referees, and the Duke of <hi>Lesdiguieres</hi> for Umpire
over them, to make an end of this difference. But he, thinking the summ in which
they amerced him too great, evaded this arbitration, and found a trick to get an Inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
and appeal, without their knowledge; pretending to the Kings Councel,
that he had since found several Papers for his justication, which never had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in any Court before. And growing insolent upon the success of this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
dealing, he dwelt boldly in his own house, within three Musquet-shot of <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonnes;</hi>
and walk'd every where unconcern'd; but still taking care to be attended
with six or seven of his friends, as fit for a halter as himself.</p>
               <p>The good old Gentleman Monsieur <hi>Poligny,</hi> who was still alive, of a peaceable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
and one that hated Quarrels or Law-suits, was much perplexed; and was
for three days together blockt up as it were in his own house, by this Rascal; who
scowred the Country, and was in perpetual readiness to do mischief. I was then in
<hi>Provence,</hi> near <hi>Marseilles,</hi> taken up in executing the Orders, which I was saying the
King had given me. Madam <hi>Poligny</hi> seeing all <hi>Richard</hi>'s fair promises come to nothing,
and that her self, her Husband, and her Son, were exposed to his insolences and his
outrages perpetually, came to me, and acquainted me how very ill a posture her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
were in; conjuring me, by all the ties of the relation between us, as well as
those of friendship, to assist her all I could in rescuing her from the violences of this Tyrant.</p>
               <p>I told her, She knew me too well to question the zeal, with which I was ready to
serve her as long as I lived, and that her interest was as dear to me as my own, and
therefore I would do all that possibly I could for her upon this occasion; but finding
my self at that time engaged in the Kings business, and indispensably oblig'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
his Majesty's Troops, and be faithful to his Orders; in obedience to which I
had foregone even my own Interest; all I could do at present, was to serve her
with my friends; and do that by writing, which if I were at my own disposal, I
would have done by word of mouth. I told her farther, I durst depend so entirely
upon my friends kindness, as to promise my self, that my sollicitations by way of
Letter, would be as successful to her, and as effectual with them, as if I were there
to move them in person.</p>
               <p>XV. But the Lady I discourst with was too well acquainted with <hi>Richard</hi>'s inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and passionate disposition, and the necessity of my presence, to satisfie herself
with my offer of managing her business by Letter. And tho she could not draw me
off from the Kings Commission, and saw it impossible to gain what she desired just
at that present time; yet she took a course shortly after, to fix me to her family by
closer obligations, and engage me in the defence of all her interests. She came to see
me, and said, She must needs impart to me a design, which I should have no great
cause to dislike: That she considered, her Son at this age was not in a condition to
resist the violence of so furious a man as <hi>Richard;</hi> that she found she wanted such a
one as me, to put a check upon his insolence; that she had thought upon a way to
bring us closer together than ever we were before, and that was to marry her Son to
my Niece <hi>Anne de Pontis,</hi> (Daughter to the Nephew you heard of) that both of them
were much of an age; and this new relation would make the concerns of their family
become mine. I thought the proposal very obliging, and advantageous, and told her, my
Niece did not deserve so great an honour; but if I refused it for her, it was only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I durst not accept it. She presently understood the consent I gave, and seem'd
much pleased with it; so that taking me at my word, she urg'd the concluding of the
match speedily, which we did without any great matter of formality, being very
well satisfy'd in one anothers integrity, and fair dealing. I told her, I hoped she
would not find herself mistaken in the good opinion she had of me; and I durst be
bold to promise, that as soon as ever I had discharg'd my duty to his Majesty's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
I would employ my self heartily in her business, and would rather dye, than not bring her off with honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:100923:144"/>
The Marriage being thus concluded, and all the Ceremonies over, young Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Vaubonnes</hi> and my great Niece, who had about sixty thousand Livres to her por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
were marry'd with a great deal of state of solemnity. And when I had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the Kings commands, in conveying over the Troops, I resolv'd to see my
Nephew and his new Wife put into possession of their Estate. I carry'd him to <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonnes,</hi>
and took ten or twelve of my friends, and all our men, well armed and well
mounted, along with me. Mr. <hi>Richard,</hi> upon the news of our coming, shut himself
and his Bullies up in his own house, and thinking that no time to appear, he went
away privately the night after, to avoid any mischief, that he apprehended might
come to him upon our account.</p>
               <p>But understanding shortly after, that my friends were gone, and I left alone at <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonnes,</hi>
he took courage, and return'd to his house again. Next day he had the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
to desire he might visit me, and that I would give him leave to walk abroad.
I told the man that brought the message, that I would not advise Mr. <hi>Richard</hi> to
come where I was; and that if he took the confidence to do so, he might chance to
repent it. He began to swear at this answer, and rail at me lustily, saying, I was a very
pretty fellow to forbid him stirring abroad; and that, when time should serve, he
would see which of us two was the better man. This however was more boasting
than true Courage; and it appeared afterwards, that he was brisk only then, when
he thought his the stronger side.</p>
               <p>One Holiday, he sent to tell me, he supposed I would not be against his going to
Church at <hi>Vaubonnes;</hi> I answered, it was my advice, that he should go to Mass some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
else, for I would never endure that a Murderer, who had cowardly assassinated a
man of honour in the Castle of <hi>Vaubonnes,</hi> should appear in that Church, to beard the
Lord of the Mannor, whom he had affronted by that violence. I commanded my Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
who were stout fellows, to be upon their good behaviour, and led Madam <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligny</hi>
and my Niece to Church, resolving to dye rather than suffer this Villain to come
there. When I was in the Church, word was brought me, that <hi>Richard</hi> was coming.
I answer'd the fellow that told me, <hi>Go tell him I expect him, and he shall find me here.</hi>
At the same time I dispatcht a bold fellow, and my <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> to a narrow
street, through which <hi>Richard</hi> was to pass, and ordered them to secure that post im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.
<hi>If</hi> Richard <hi>come there</hi> (said I) <hi>tell him I have ordered you to keep that Pass, and
that you desire he would go no farther. If he retire, let him go, and do not pursue him, but if
he pretends to advance forward, or any way abuse or affront you, fall on vigorously, and we will
bear you out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our two Souldiers being gone to their Post, <hi>Richard</hi> got intelligence of it, and durst
not venture forward, for fear of being forc'd to make a shameful retreat. He satisfy'd
himself with railing after his usual way, and giving me a great many hard words;
and I could easily bear what I did not hear. Seeing himself driven to extremity, he
grew raging mad; and that which made him worse was, that some Officers of <hi>Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diguieres</hi>
Regiment, hearing what had past, came to see me, and offer me their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
against this Brute of a fellow. So he was forc'd to hide again, and durst appear
abroad no more.</p>
               <p>XVI. One day they had made an agreement to go all together and breakfast at a
Village about a league off from <hi>Vaubonnes:</hi> I was against it at first, apprehending some
mischievous attempt from so enraged and desperate a man, and being loth to be
drawn into any troublesome brangling business, that might create a suit at Law: At
last I agreed, because I could not stand out against all the rest, who were very eager
upon the frolick. But we trifled away so much time in walking up and down, and
discoursing by the way, that when we came to the place, it was a fitter hour for
dinner than breakfast. Monsieur <hi>Poligny</hi> and I perswaded them to return home, for
we should be sure to meet with better provision there, and immediately we two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
back again. But young Monsieur <hi>Vaubonnes,</hi> concern'd for the loss of his break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast,
without taking any notice of it to us, told the Officers, it was not fair to go
back again without drinking one Glass; that breakfast was ready, and they might
eat a bit while we went on before. So they staid to bait, and let Monsieur <hi>Poligny</hi>
and me go all alone, who imagin'd they would have follow'd us immediately.</p>
               <p>When we came over against <hi>Richard</hi>'s house, which overlooks the high-way, he
got sight of us, and discovering no body else that follow'd for above a quarter of a
league, resolv'd to come and attack us. With this intent he and five or six of his
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:100923:145"/>
friends made a Sally, and stood in the high-way at a turning, where we were to
pass. They were all on foot, but well arm'd with Swords and Pistols, and one of
them had catcht up a Halbert. Seeing the place and posture they had fix'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in, I presently concluded, there would be the Devil to do, for there lay our
way, and I was not of a humour cut out for retreating. Poor Monsieur <hi>Poligny,</hi>
whose years requir'd nothing more than peace and quiet, was much difsatisfy'd that
our friends had forsaken us, and so, to speak the truth, was I too. But this was no
time for consideration, and all we had to do was to make amends for their absence
by our own resolution and courage. When we came up within some forty paces of
<hi>Richard,</hi> the Rogue pull'd his hat down over his face, and then cocking up the brim,
walk'd in the middle of the Road, with an air of more fierceness than was natural
to him, and casting a malicious stare upon me, as if he could have torn me in pieces:
and his inclination I am sure was good to have done it, but I was more than ordinarily
fortify'd upon this occasion. We came on our usual pace strait towards him, and at
last he drew a Pistol all on a sudden, and came up with it to me, swearing and curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
like a mad man. Seeing my self in some extremity, I clapt both my Spurs to
my Horse, who was exceeding nimble, and understanding his Masters pleasure by that
signal, threw himself with incredible force and swiftness into the middle of the arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men, overturning some, frighting away others, and driving them to creep away
as well as they could, and hide themselves under the hedges.</p>
               <p>But I kept close to <hi>Richard,</hi> who was the cause of all this quarrel, and braved it
more than any of the rest; and taking him by the Collar of his Doublet, I gave him
such a turn with all my strength, that his heels went over his head, and flat upon the
ground I laid him; then I rid my Horse over his body several times, and could have
been well enough pleased to have broken a Leg or an Arm of him, but had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
upon his Life. But it was otherwise ordered, for my Horse always leapt over
him, without ever treading upon his body at all. My Cloak was twice shot through,
and my Horse much wounded. I had also one thrust with the Halbert, which had
like to have gone through my Neck, but providence directed the stroke, and it only
pierc'd the top of my Double<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Indeed my Horse was never more serviceable to me
than now, for he turn'd and wheel'd like an Ape; and I manag'd him at will, to run
down first one, then another, before they could recover themselves, just as if he had been a reasonable creature.</p>
               <p>But yet in the midst of all this hurry and danger, there was one thing very Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; which was, to see the good old Gentleman Monsieur <hi>Poligny,</hi> who, as soon as
ever he saw me make up to these fellows, and lay about me with my Sword and my
Horse, regarding the trouble that this action might bring upon him, more than the
present service I did him, cry'd out with all his might to <hi>Richard</hi> and the rest, <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
you see I am no way concern'd in this squabble; Bear witness it is Monsieur</hi> Pontis <hi>that
does all.</hi> And then directing himself to me, <hi>Ah Sir,</hi> (said he) <hi>you spoil all, you have ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
undone me; I had the Law on my side before, and now they will prosecute me.</hi> I answer'd
him without any great disturbance, <hi>Well, well, Sir, be satisfy'd, they see you are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd;
the fault is wholly mine, if it be a fault, I take all upon my self very willingly; I am
the person from whom they are to look for satisfaction, and I am content to answer it all for your sake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At last our friends who had staid behind came up, and ran to the noise, just as the
scuffle was ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and the assassinates got off. They were aftonish'd at our good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and very sorry that they had mist this only occasion, in which they could have
been serviceable to us. But honest Monsieur <hi>Poligny</hi> could not be quiet, nor forbear
telling all the world how much this quarrel went against him, and reproach'd me se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times with having been the ruine of him, for that this fellow would now take
the Law upon him, and be reveng'd for all by a fresh prosecution. Madam <hi>Poligny,</hi>
who was a Lady of a masculine and generous Soul, when she had an account of the
whole action, commended and thankt me very heartily, for having thus represt the
insolence and rage of this Villain.</p>
               <p>XVII. <hi>Richard,</hi> who was very good at taking all advantages of Law, lost no time,
but went away the very next night to <hi>Grenoble.</hi> There he clamoured against me, for
assassinating his person, and put in a Petition to the Parliament, who, without any
farther information, granted him a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> against me, unless I put in my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
for such a day. I had several friends and relations at <hi>Grenoble,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:100923:145"/>
Monsieur <hi>Calignon</hi> a Councellor, who immediately gave me notice of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
and that an Usher (whom he had managed) would come to serve this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
upon me, at such a time. I immediately sent away two or three men some
leagues from <hi>Vaubonnes,</hi> (for so he had advised me to do in his Letter) to pretend the
taking away this Instrument by force from the Usher, that came to serve it. All our
design in this was only to gain time, that so we might not be brought to a hearing,
before the Judges could be informed of the true state of the Case. The Usher, who
was privately in correspondence with us, when the men sent by me met him, cryed
out, that they offered violence to a man in his Office; and, the better to carry on
the jest, very formally made a verbal Summons upon the place. This however de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
the proceedings a while, which was all we propos'd to our selves by it. And
<hi>Richard</hi> fill'd the Country with his noise and railing at this violence, and our being
guilty of so great a tontempt and affront (as he call'd it) to the authority of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>Monsieur <hi>Lesdiguieres</hi> had receiv'd a very partial and false account of our first quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
and writ me word, he was extremely surpriz'd to hear such reports of me; that
the violences I had committed in the Country were in every bodies mouth, and all
the world cry'd shame of them; that he indeed could scarce believe them, because
he had always had a good opinion of me: But if those rumours were true, and I went
on at that rate, he should be forced to make use of that power the King had given him,
as Governour of the Province. It is easie to conceive how much I was astonished to
find so just, so innocent an action, warranted by all the Laws of Nature and Nations,

caballing and unjust sollicitations might bring upon me, I wrote a very respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
but at the same time a very vehement answer in my own defence, acquainting him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That I perceived my Enemies had traduced me to him, and instead of giving him a
true relation of the matter, had disguised it with lyes, and possest him against me by
several false insinuations; That I had the confidence to hope, a person of so much
honour and justice as I knew him to be, would be so far from condemning, that he
would commend me for what I had done, when he was more truly informed. Then
I related the fact with all its circumstances at large, and all that had past between us
before this encounter, and closed my Letter with expressions to this purpose. <hi>And
now, my Lord, I beg your leave to say, that I must have behaved my self just thus upon such
circumstances, and such provocations to the best Nobleman in the Land, and never a man in the
Kingdom could have forced me to take other measures. The King is my Master: And it is my
duty to preserve my honour and my life for his service. If I had acted any otherwise, than as I
did upon this occasion, I should deserve to be used like a Coward and a pitiful Fellow, both by the
King, and by your self (My Lord) to whom I have the honour to be the most humble of all your Servants,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>My Letter was as successful as I could with, for it undeceived Monsieur <hi>Lesdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guieres</hi>
perfectly, so that he sent me a very kind and civil answer, telling me, he was
very well pleased to know the truth of the matter; and, now he did so, he assured
me, that this accident would only contribute to the increasing that regard and good
opinion which he had always had of me and my conduct.</p>
               <p>XVIII. This I thought was my time to drive <hi>Richard</hi> to his last shifts, and take
him down in the midst of all his triumphs, and therefore I entered my action against
him, and knowing he had been guilty of great ravage in the Country, I brought all
them in whom he had oppressed, or any way wronged. After all their complaints
had been attested, and informations publickly given in according to form of Law, I
had them all presented to the Parliament, and the witnesses to them.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Monsieur <hi>Calignon,</hi> Madam <hi>Poligny,</hi> and several other friends of
ours, employed themselves very vigorously and successfully in my behalf, and brought
the Cause into a readiness for being heard. Then the wretch seeing no hopes of elud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the matter, and that all his applications and shifts could not signify any thing in
arrest of judgment, but the Gallows must be the reward of his wickedness,
thought the wisest part he had left to play, was once more to throw himself at my
feet, and ask forgiveness; and submit to any other conditions, though never so hard,
provided I would but spare his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:100923:146"/>
At first I was extremely provoked because of his falshood and baseness, in breaking
his promise to me before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the insupportable insolence of his behaviour since; I
could not prevail with my self to hearken to any terms of accommodation whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
and thought that both a regard to justice, and the quiet of the Country, made
the hanging of such a fellow absolutely necessary. But at last his continued impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities,
and the desperate condition he was in, giving me some little grounds to
hope still, that this would be a warning, and mend him for the future, I began to be
softned, and think of taking some milder course, and shew him some mercy. I told
him therefore, that though he had lost all his credit by the breach of those promises
he made, when he came to me at <hi>Paris,</hi> upon this very account of saving him once
before, I was yet content to grant, what he could have no just pretence to expect;
but in the first place he must resolve upon three things: First, That he would abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
and for ever quit that Country. Secondly, That his Estate should be sold;
and then in the third place, That all the fees, and other charges of the Tryal, should
be paid out of the money that rose upon that sale.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard,</hi> who though he was hard put to it, yet thought however, he had better

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He was resolved to submit, and ready to do all this, upon condition his
life <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And this was the full and final conclusion of all this troublesom
business. His Lands were all sold, the Charges of Suit were paid with part of the
money. He asked Madam <hi>Poligny</hi>'s pardon, left the Country presently, and hath
never been seen there since. And in truth, considering what a wretch I had to deal
with, I stood in need of a great deal of good management, resolution and perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
to bring him to, and get a head over that insolence of his, that nothing was
able to daunt or subdue. His rage, his heat of temper, and his despair working upon
a busy and designing head, made him fit for all sorts of wickedness and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance.
And it was a signal instance of the Divine Justice, that this haughty, this
bloody-minded wretch, should at last be brought to stoop, and glad to submit to the
pleasure of that very man, whom he would have been best pleased to destroy, and
whom of all the world he hated most.</p>

His Death.</head>
               <p>I. AFter all this trouble that I had run through upon occasion of my Neice's
Marriage, I returned to <hi>Paris</hi> again, and carried young Monsieur <hi>Vaubonnes</hi>
thither with me, to learn his exercises. But he fell into a most unhappy
business there, and was very innocently engag'd in an accident, that had
very near cost him his life. There lodged a Gentleman in the same house with him,
that had a great quarrel depending. He desired my Nephew one day to lend him
his Pistols, and without mentioning one word of this quarrel, prevailed with him to
bear him company. My Nephew, who was young, and ignorant of the world, lent
him the Pistols, and thinking no hurt, nor knowing whither he was going, went
along with him, attended by a <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> that I had recommended to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
who was a very stout young fellow. When all three were come to the house,
this Gentleman desired my Nephew would go in with him, because he said, he had
some business there. When they were come in, and unhappily had met the person
against whom the quarrel was, he presently fell into a passion, and talked like a mad
man, in a most provoking manner. From words they came to blows, and he setting
one of his Pistols to his head, shot him stone dead. This was all done in an instant,
but seeing the noise bring in a great deal of company, my Nephew, in great confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at so sudden, and fatal an accident, was for recovering the door. He and his man
drew immediately, and standing close by one another, they made their way out
through all the people, that came crowding in to see what the matter was: They
made the best of their way to my Lodging, and the Gentleman that had done the thing got off, and made his escape another way.</p>
               <p>My Nephew, though he was very little to blame, yet durst not say any thing of the
matter to me: But the dejection and disorder that shewed it self in his countenance,
presently gave me some uneasie suspicions. At length, the <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> seeing the
importance, and the ill consequences of such a business as this, related the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as it past; and then my Nephew discovered his part in it, and vow'd he was in
no fault at all; that he was not in the least acquainted with the Gentlemans design,
who had committed the Murder, till they were come all together, and the very time
of action; and his going along with him was intended for no more than a walk, or
making an indifferent visit. I was much surpriz'd at this ill news, and knew not what
course to take: At last I resolv'd to go wait on the Abbot <hi>Serv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>en,</hi> who was a relation
of my Nephew, and who was the great inducement to us, to bring him out of <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine</hi>
to <hi>Paris.</hi> After I had told him the business, and we had consulted with some
friends what was best to be done, it was thought the safest way for this young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
to make all the haste he could into <hi>Dauphine</hi> again: For tho he were never so
innocent, yet considering how far he had been unhappily engag'd to appear in the
thing, it would have been very difficult for him to justifie himself, and convince the
Judges that he had no share in the crime.</p>

II. Now as this tragical accideut drove my Nephew from <hi>Paris</hi> home again, so
another which, though the death were natural, yet appeared to me more terrible,
prevailed with me shortly after to withdraw wholly from the world. It pleased
God at last to bring me out of the wretched condition in which I had lived so long,
without any other notions of goodness, than what proceeded meerly from hon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ur
and natural generosity, and a virtue meerly moral and humane. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he made use of the surprizing death of a friend, for whom I had a tender affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and particular honour, to put me into some saving terrors, and make me reflect
upon my self. The infinite deaths of my friends, which I had been an Eye-witness
of in the Army all along, made no deeper impression upon my mind, than just what
served to lament the loss of the men I loved; but this pierced me to the very heart,
and made me think of bewailing my self and my own circumstances, and to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
my mind with very serious considerations of what, for ought I knew, was as
likely to be my own fate, as any other man's.</p>
               <p>Going one day to visit this friend at his Country-house, with no other design,
than to enjoy a little diversion and good company, I spent some time with him and
his Lady, as pleasantly as I could. When I design'd to return for <hi>Paris<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> I was provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially
stopt by the very person, who had the chief part in the dismal tragedy I am
going to relate, and by that means became the first instrument of my Conversion.
For fancying me to grow weary, and suspecting I might steal away in the morning
without taking a formal leave, he order'd my Bridles and Saddles to be hid, and used
his utmost endeavour to divert and make me easie. He told me, his Brother was to
draw a Pond the next day, and engag'd me to go along with him, and see them fish.
I had the honour to be intimately acquainted with his Sister-in-law, and as we were
taking a turn together in the Garden, and talking very freely upon several subjects,
she told me all on the sudden, that she observ'd some very odd look about her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Face and Eyes, and askt me if I did not discern it too. I told her, I had but
very small skill in Physiognomy, but I had not discovered any thing unusual in him.
Still she carry'd the discourse on farther, and said, She thought he had death in his
face. I took a more nice view of him when we met again, and told her, that all the
dismal looks she saw, were more in her own imagination, than her Brothers face.</p>
               <p>The event however convinced me, that she was a great deal more critical than I,
whether she spoke thus through some unaccountable natural instinct, or whether
being more used to him, she discovered something extraordinary, which I could not
find out: As we two were going back alone in his Coach after dinner, he was seized
with a kind of convulsion, and a trembling all over his body, which lasted about as
long as a <hi>Miserere.</hi> What his Sister had said came fresh into my mind, but trying
to turn it off with a jest, that I might not fright him, I cryed merrily, <hi>Why how now,
Sir, what's the matter? You mutter and make faces like a Jugler shewing his tricks. Come,
come, let's divert our selves, and do not be melancholly. Let us alight and walk to get us a heat.</hi>
So the thing went off, and made no great impression upon him: But I began to be
under some apprehensions, and had sad presages of this unhappy accident.</p>
               <p>III. Next day, as we were sitting by the fire after dinner, he, his Lady, and I,
having all of us received Letters from <hi>Paris; Come</hi> (says he) <hi>Monsieur</hi> Pontis <hi>shall
read us his news first.</hi> I needed no great entreaty, and read my Letters, which had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of any consequence in them. Then he read his own, where there was no great
matter neither. As his Lady was beginning hers, in which she had all the Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news,
he had a mind to make himself merry, and turning to me, <hi>Look you here</hi> (says
he) <hi>you see how old Age is despised; no body regards us now, we are no sooner out of sight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
out of mind too. There's none of us, but my Wife in favour.</hi> The Lady who was very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
seem'd offended at a discourse that reflected upon her modesty, and clapt her
Letter together again; <hi>Nay, Sir</hi> (said she) <hi>if you talk thus, I will read you no news of mine
I promise you: This to me is very fine.</hi> He seeing her take it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> earnest, turn'd the discourse,
and engaging to hold his tongue, prevail'd with her to read her Letters. Then he
said, he must go write to his Brother, and she having Letters to write too to some
friends of hers, went with me out of his Chamber, and there we left him to write
all alone.</p>
               <p>Thus no doubt Providence order'd it, to save a Lady so very affectionate and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
as she was, the being present at an accident, enough to have kill'd her too. I
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:100923:147"/>
was no sooner gone down stairs, but meeting a Foot-boy, I bad him go into his
Masters Chamber, and see if he wanted any thing. He went up presently, and the
first thing he saw when he came in at the door, was his Master stretcht all along upon
the floor, lying upon his back before the fire, with his hands cross his stomach, and
dead, as if he had lain there four and twenty hours. So surprizing a sight frighted
him extremely, and instead of going in, he ran away, and came to me in a perfect
distraction, crying, <hi>Sir, Sir, my Master is dead. Come quickly, for God's sake, come quickly.
What sayst thou Child?</hi> (cryed I) <hi>How! dead!</hi> And running strait to the Chamber
as fast as I could, I came in, and found the body in the posture described just before.
<hi>Ah Lord God!</hi> (said I) <hi>what a sight's here?</hi> Presently the news flew round the house,
and all the family came running in; nothing but sighs, and groans, and tears to be
seen or heard, and every one almost out of their senses with the suddenness of the
accident.</p>
               <p>But one thing surpriz'd me above all the rest, when I took a particular view of
the body, which was, that exactly upon his two Ancle-bones there was a little burn,
about the bigness of a Half-Crown, and as round as if it had been drawn with a pair
of Compasses: His Shoes and Stockings on both Feet had a hole quite through them
in this place, and the burn went into his Skin as deep as the thickness of a Six-pence. That
which made it still more amazing was, that his Feet lay a great distance from the fire,
and I could not possibly devise how they should come to be burnt that way. You
may imagine what a consternation the whole house was in: They ran about like people
out of their wits: They brought Drugs upon Drugs, Cordial Waters, and all sorts of
Medicines, to make him take them. They heated Napkins, and rubb'd his Stomach
with them, to try if there was any bringing him to himself, as if it had been a
swooning fit. But all they could do was to no manner of purpose, for he was stark
dead, and mov'd no more than a log.</p>
               <p>By this time his Lady, who could not be kept long in ignorance, ran in an extreme
passion into the chamber where the dead body lay. But I put my self between, took
her in my arms, and laid her upon the bed in her own room, with these words: <hi>By your favour, Madam, this is no place for you, you can do no good here now, pray to God for his
soul, he needs that most, and it is the greatest kindness you can shew him.</hi> The very same
day, a little after this, the Chamber where the dead man lay took fire, in a beam
under the Chimney. And the next day, which was that of his Funeral, the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
was on fire again, so that we were perepetually pursued with misfortunes, one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the neck of another. I ordered all matters as well as I could, and so as to express
my respect due to the memory of the deceased person, taking care to bury him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, though without any great solemnity.</p>
               <p>IV. But such an amazing death as this sat close upon my Spirits, and made strange
impressions upon me; it put me upon making very grave reflections upon the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of the present life, and how unstable all things here below are. Thus I used
to argue often with my self: Why! this man was lusty and well but a quarter of an
hour ago, and yet he is dead in an instant. What hinders but I may dye in as little
a time as he? I then who am alive and well just now, perhaps may be gone a quarter
of an hour hence. Ah poor wretch, what will become of thee then! What indeed
can become of thee in this condition, so unprovided, so void of all thoughts of death?
It is high time now to think of it to purpose. Perhaps Almighty God intends this
death as a particular call and warning to thee. One thing I had from his Confessor's
own mouth, which added to my wonder and astonishment still more. For he told
me, that one day as he was confessing, they both heard three loud knocks at the
Chamber door. He rose immediately to see who it was, but opening the door, found
no body. When he was come back, and had put himself in a posture to go on with
his confession, he heard a knocking again, still louder than before. This made him
rise again to see who knockt so very violently, and finding no body the second time,
he cryed to his Confessor, <hi>Ah, Father, this doth not concern you.</hi> And accordingly he
took it as sent to him for a warning, and notice of his dying shortly after.</p>
               <p>V. A very particular friend of his and mine, coming thither some few days after,
I related to him all the circumstances and manner of his death; and he, who was a
person of great piety, took occasion from thence, to discourse me concerning the vanity
of the world, and how perfect a nothing the most flourishing fortunes of it are; he
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:100923:148"/>
represented to me very lively, the frailty of mans life; how very quickly he is changed
from a state of vigour and perfect health, to a dead Carcass, and a cold Grave. To
this purpose he discoursed with me above an hour together, and finding my mind al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
softned and prepared by that surprizing accident, this conference affected me
still a great deal more, and I began to resolve every day more and more, to disengage
my self from the world for all together.</p>
               <p>In order to it, I applied my self to a person of great Piety and Learning for advice;
who told me first of all, that a man who had spent all his days in a Camp and a
Court, as I had done, ought to think very well before he attempt any such thing. I
answered, That my Conversation it was true had been very much to blame, but they
were such old Sinners as I, that stood in greatest need of assistance. He in his great
wisdom replyed, That Jesus Christ was come to call Sinners indeed, but it was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary that I should examine very thoroughly, whether this intention of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
came from God; and whether I did not rather forsake the world in revenge,
or in a peevish humour, because the world had before begun to forsake me. That
besides, one who had taken some liberties, and conversed with people of quality, and
great variety of company, would find it extremely difficult, if not absolutely impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
to undergo so great a change all on the sudden, as that solitude I pretended to
retire into would prove; that the best way would be to try to wean my self by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
first live as privately as I could at my own house, keep home, and break off
the custom of making visits, and going into company, and then spend some months
in the Country, at some friends house. This advice I could not but allow was very
prudent: And though I felt my self very eager and impatient to take my leave of the
world once for all, yet I took other measures, and followed his counsel.</p>
               <p>I began to look back upon my past life, and could not without amazement reflect
upon the six and fifty years which with so much eagerness I had spent in the Camp
and Court, and all this to raise a trifling and transitory fortune, without taking any
manner of care for another life; or having any effectual impressions made upon me by
death, which I was so frequently put in mind of, by instances set before my Eyes in
the Army every hour. I took a view of the many hazards and apparent dangers to
which my life had been exposed in all that time, some of which you have seen in
these <hi>Memoirs;</hi> and then looking up to the infinite mercy of God, which had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
me from death a thousand and a thousand times, to give me an opportunity at
last of working out my salvation, I felt my self perfectly lost in thought, and my
mind opprest with the mighty, the many mercies of God to me, many as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of my life, for each moment I saw plainly might very well have been that of
my death and utter ruine. Then I proceeded very seriously to compute, what bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
I had reaped of all my labours and long hardships, of all that service which with so
much fidelity and diligence I had paid, and especially to my Master the late King.
And here was a goodly account indeed. For I had devoted my self entirely to a
Prince, who I knew must dye, and when he did so, all I had left me was the sorrow
for his death, and the sad consideration of having lost him for ever. This sorrow
then however gave me a clearer sight, how good and merciful a Providence it was,
that I should out-live this Prince, for I am sure the chains that tied me fastest to the
Court, were broken at his death. And I found my self much more at liberty, much
better disposed now to attend to the call of God in that surprizing death of my friend,
which he made use of as a means to disengage me perfectly from the world: The
world which I had loved so passionately before, though it had made me so ill returns
for my kindness.</p>
               <p>VI. Being some months after upon a Journey from <hi>Paris,</hi> to spend some time in the
Countty, there happened an accident at <hi>Melun,</hi> just as I had done Supper, which gave
me very great disorder. I had sent my Servant to look after my Horses, and take care
they wanted nothing, and as soon as he was gone out, a general weakness seized me
all over, and such a sinking of my Spirits, that I thought I should have dy'd immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately:
Not being able to cry out, or call any body, I said to my self, <hi>What! shall I
be so miserable to dye without any help? Perfect, O my God, the mercy thou hast begun in me,
and take me not away in this condition.</hi> I was very strong, considering my age, and so
put my self forth to rise from my Chair, and staggered along to the Bed-side, threw my
Arms round one of the Bed-posts, and there with bustling about, and keeping my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in motion, with the blessing of God, I scattered the Vapours, that rose, and had
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:100923:148"/>
like to have choak'd me. I took no notice of this to my Servant when he came in
again, but only order'd my Bed to be warm'd, and went into it, and next morning
went on my Journey, towards the place I intended for.</p>
               <p>After some months spent in the Countrey, where, by reason of the frequent visits of
my friends, I found my way of living less private than in the Town; I came back to
<hi>Paris,</hi> and addrest my self again to the same person I had consulted before; and begg'd
him to help, and take some care of me; assuring him, that my way of life was as yet
nothing different in effect from what it had been formerly; and that in short I found
it necessary to take up still more strictly, and live after another kind of rate than I had
hitherto done. After some discourse together upon the matter, he advised me to take
more time, and consider of it a little longer still. And thus he put me off from time
to time, till at last the second <hi>Paris</hi> War came on.</p>
               <p>VII. Madam <hi>Saint-Angel</hi> had desired me (being a relation) to go do a little busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for her at her Estate of <hi>Saint-Angel;</hi> and there I presently found my self per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
again with troubles that I never thought to be concerned in any more. For
Mareschal <hi>Turenne</hi>'s Army, who were guilty of very great disorders in their way
from <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> surpriz'd me here so suddenly, that I had scarce any time to provide
for my own defence. All the Court of <hi>Saint-Angel</hi> was immediately full of Cattel,
and the Granaries fill'd with the wealth of all the Inhabitants thereabouts. Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
the House was in danger of being plundered, I went to meet the Troops up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their march, and to try if I could find any of their Generals of my acquaintance at
the head of them. The first I met was Mareschal <hi>Hoquincour,</hi> whom I went and paid
my respects to, and told him, that being accidentally in the Country at Monsieur
<hi>Saint-Ange</hi>'s house, who had the honour to be known to him, having succeeded his
Father in the office of First <hi>Maitre de Hotel</hi> to the Queen; I came most humbly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
the favour of him, to take that house into his protection, and secure it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
plundered. Monsieur <hi>Hoquincour</hi> reply'd with an Oath, <hi>How should I secure Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur</hi>
St. Ange<hi>'s house, when I could not secure one of my own, and above twenty more of my
friends and relations that have been all rifled? There's no such thing as discipline in this Army:
The Souldiers are mad with perfect hunger, and are but so many Robbers. Sir,</hi> said I, <hi>since
they are Robbers, and hungry Wolves, you will not take it ill I hope, if we defend our selves, and
kill as many of them as we can.</hi> He answer'd me, <hi>Do yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r best, in Gods name, defend your
selves from their violence and rapine; and if you can keep them from plundering of</hi> St. Ange <hi>do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I quickly saw what a folly it would be, to pretend to hold out with thirty or
forty Souldiers, against so many Troops that might powr in upon the House, and
therefore resolv'd to try some other way for securing the Castle. I went to Monsieur
<hi>Vaubecourt, Mareschal de Camp,</hi> who was a friend of mine, and desir'd his assistance in
this difficult point; but he gave me no better satisfaction than Monsieur <hi>Hoquincour</hi>
had done before; For he told me, he was very sorry to see me so unluckily engag'd;
and assur'd me, there was never an Officer in the Army could secure me from plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering.
<hi>However</hi> (said he) <hi>I will give you some of my Guards if you please; tho I must tell
you beforehand too, that I gave a Gentleman, who made the same request, two of them yesterday,
and yet his house was pillaged, and both my Guards knockt on the head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Just then Monsieur <hi>Turenne</hi> went by about forty paces off, and knowing me at that
distance, call'd me to him, and askt me what made me there; raillying me for my
paltry equipage, for in truth I had a rascally Horse under me, and not so much as a
Bridle on him, for I could not come at my own, it being lockt up in the Castle,
the Draw-bridge to which I had ordered to be broken down. I answered
Monsieur <hi>Turenne,</hi> that I happen'd to be at Monsieur <hi>St. Ange</hi>'s house, and was much
distressed for the passage of his Army. He had shew'd me great kindness all along,
ever since I had the honour to be acquainted with him, and his Brother Monsieur
<hi>Bouillon,</hi> at the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Court, who was their Unkle, and who (as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
formerly) was exceeding gracious to me. So he offer'd me his service imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
and askt what he could do for me. I told him, if he would favour me with
three Regiments, I would post them at three Mills hard by, and by that means I
should at once save the Castle, and do the Army service, by taking care that they
should have a good quantity of Meal and Bread. Monsieur <hi>Turenne</hi> embraced my
proposal presently, and told me he was very glad of it, for provisions were scar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
with them; and entreated me, that since I was well acquainted with the Country
I would set the Guards of the Army in the most convenient places. I did so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:100923:149"/>
willingly, but first took the Regiments of <hi>Turenne, Vxelles,</hi> and the <hi>Marine,</hi> and set
them about five hundred paces from the Castle, to block up the avenues. I chose
to keep them at this distance, for fear the very men I set to guard the house, should
be the first to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ob it. Then I went to set the <hi>Corps de Garde</hi> for the Army, in the
places where the Enemy might advance; and having appointed five hundred <hi>German</hi>
Horse a very forward post, the Commander began to swear in his own tongue, and
said, They perceived I knew where to set them to be knockt on the head. Tho I
did not understand the language he spoke, yet I easily guest his meaning, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
taking any notice, ordered a thousand Foot to sustain those five hundred Horse,
and three hundred Horse more to support them again, with the same number upon
both Wings; which presently won me the Collonels favour, insomuch that he came
and gave me his hand, and proffer'd to do me any service.</p>
               <p>VIII. When I had discharged my trust, and set all the Guards and Centinels up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a little River just by, I went back to the Castle with an Officer, whom with some
others I invited to supper. But was told to my great surprize, that the Souldiers
were come on the backside of the house, and had made a breach already in the Wall
of the Base-C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, which they were upon entring at. I was enraged to see that all
my measures were broken, and all my care to no purpose, and that the three Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
had not begirt the Castle quite round, as I gave order they should. In this
passion, not knowing what to resolve, I took this course at last. I told the Officer
with me, it was to no purpose to undertake the beating off those men, with a few
Firelocks in the Castle; and therefore if any thing could, Authority, and not Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
must do the work. <hi>I know a little back door</hi> (said I) <hi>which we must go through,
and so go strait into the breach. Pray be so kind to follow me, and be pleased to do as you see
me do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So through this door we went, and directly to the place where the Souldiers had
made a large passage, and running upon them with my Cane in my hand; <hi>How Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals</hi>
(cryed I) <hi>what do you think to play the Rogue here, while the Enemy are forcing the
Quarter?</hi> And so laying on as hard as I could about their pates, and then pushing
them with the flat of my Sword, we alarm'd them so effectually, that they never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to defend themselves, but to make their escape, and recover their Quarter.
This was the only way that could have been taken to manage these Rake-hells; and
while their principal Officers acknowledged their own selves, that they could not
master them; and by their want of Authority suffered the greatest disorders, and
outrages to pass without controul; I found out a means to shew them by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
how they ought to preserve their Authority upon such like occasions. Some
of them telling me, they wondred how I durst use such an arbitrary method over
Troops which were not under my command; I told them again very freely, That I
had commanded long enough to make Souldiers obey me; and had at any time rather
quit my Commission, than endure to see my self mastered by those that ought to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to me. That seeing no other way to get clear of the difficulty I was in, I had
without any great consideration pitch'd upon this; and that at such times a man must
venture all, and reduce all that experience hath taught him into practice. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
I sent Monsieur <hi>Turenne</hi> nine Veals for his own Table, and made him some
other presents in acknowledgment of his civility to me. I took care likewise to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Army with Meal and Bread, according to my promise. And the Troops
decamping from thence two days after, I went back to <hi>Paris</hi> shortly after, not caring to
engage any more in troubles of this kind, but pursuing my design of retiring from the
world.</p>
               <p>IX. This was in the time of the second <hi>Paris</hi> War, when it was reported that the
Prince intended to attack it with his Army, and to come in at one of the Suburbs.
Being then at a house in that part of the Suburbs, I saw every body in a terrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation.
I told them, provided they would keep close in their own houses, there
could be no danger; for the Gates were too strong to be easily forced, and all they
had to do was to defend their own dwellings. But when the Enemy should enter the
place, they should satisfy themselves as the Souldiers made any hole in the Gates to
clap in a Plank, as their way is at Sea, when a Gun hath made a breach in a Ship.
For as there, all their care is to keep out the water, and prevent the Vessels sinking;
so, when an Army powrs in upon any place, the main business is to hinder the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:100923:149"/>
from getting into their houses, for so long as they are in the streets, the Officers
allow them no leisure to do mischief, because it is necessary to advance as fast as they
can.</p>
               <p>At last, after a great many hindrances, I was happy in an opportunity of shaking
off business and the world, and withdrawing into a religious solitude; where I recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
all the accidents of my life, the hazards and dangers I have got over, and bless
and thank God every day, for the signal and unusual favour of preserving these little
remains of life, for the bewailing and atoning for my former miscarriages. One of
the greatest advantages of my retreat was, the more free enjoyment of Monsieur
<hi>d' Andilly</hi>'s conversation, and the particular friendship he honoured me with. He was
the fittest person that could be to take off all relish of worldly pleasure from me, for
no body better knew the vanity of it. He was there at the same time, but after a
very different manner. For in the midst of all that vast esteem due to his great worth,
he had kept a mind lifted above ambition, such as would never suffer him to devote
himself to any Master less than God, and always shewed a generous contempt of the
world, even when most loved and courted by it. But for my part, I must own, I
had been a Slave to it all along, had undergone real evils in hopes of an imaginary
happiness; had pursued a false and treacherous fortune that always fled from me, and
the vain satisfaction which I sought, would have made me but more unhappy still in
the possession of it.</p>
               <p>This single pattern of Monsieur <hi>Andilly</hi>'s life both past and present was a continual
lesson to me. I often admired his management of himself at Court; and knew, that
having several times discoursed the King in private upon very nice points, and once
particularly concerning Duels, he delivered his opinion to him with so much freedom,
and at the same time with so much prudence and caution too; that his Majesty heard
him with great satisfaction. And, after telling him that he did so, commanded,
that when ever he had any advice of that kind to offer, he should desire a private and
particular audience, and should be sure to have it.</p>
               <p>It is with great pleasure that I call to mind so wise and good a temper in my Master,
the late King, which though very necessary, is not yet very common in Princes. For
they are beset with a company of people, who generally make it their business only to
please and flatter them. And if some one by chance, out of a sincere zeal and respect,
hath the boldness to tell honest truth, it is very seldom that this advantage is made use
of, or the person esteemed, as he really deserves.</p>
               <p>I have frequently discoursed Monsieur <hi>Andilly,</hi> about the excellent qualities of this
Prince, which he was a witness of as well as I, and among others, of one piece of
good nature peculiar to him; and that was, when any Mother applyed to him in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of her Son, or any Wife for her Husband, though their passion sometimes
shewed it self in their expressions, and carryed them beyond the respect due to him,
he never took notice of it, but received all they said with great sweetness and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.
And if any of those about him were offended at such disrespectful beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
he would presently say, <hi>Alas! You must consider, it is a Mother or a Wife that
speaks, and the concern of a Husband or a Child is so tender, that if we cannot relieve them,
yet the least we can do, is to hear and to pity them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am obliged to Monsieur <hi>Andilly</hi> for one thing particularly, which I cannot omit
mentioning in this place, and I value it the more, because I hope to find it a great
comfort at my last hour, and an earnest of Gods mercy to me in another world.</p>
               <p>I had the Government of a small place in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> which I had a mind to quit,
and could get but a very small consideration for it. But a <hi>Hugonot</hi> Gentleman having
advised with some of his own perswasion, and considering, that in case of any Civil
War, if they were Masters of this Town, they might by vertue of that, command
all the Valley in which it stood, (which would be of great consequence too, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of all the Country thereabouts) he desired me to part with this Government to
no body but him, promising to give me my own price for it. I should have thought
seven or eight thousand Livres a pretty good bargain, but upon discourse he told me
at last<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that rather than go without it, he would give fifty thousand.</p>
               <p>I confess this was some temptation to me: The remembrance of my past losses,
the years I was now grown into; an age, when a man is always too fond of what
he hath, and too fearful of losing it, and too greedy of what one hath not, made me
of opinion, that nothing could be more natural, than to accept such a proposal, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when it offered it self without my seeking, and was so very convenient for me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:100923:150"/>
As to any case of Conscience in it, I was satisfy'd, that if I were disposed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
those who give rules in such matters, I should find enough who would determine it
in favour of my own opinion; and tell me, that as long as there was no present visible
inconvenience in the Sale, and that I lookt at nothing farther than a good valuable
consideration, which was freely offer'd to me, I need only take care of the Money,
and leave the event to God, without troubling my self with scruples about things,
which perhaps might never come to pass.</p>
               <p>But upon conferring with Monsieur <hi>Andilly</hi> upon the matter, I was so affected with
the generous and Christian notions, that his pious discourse infused into me, as to make
me inflexible by any other considerations. For he convinced me plainly, that the
chief rule for deciding Cases of Conscience, is to consult the integrity of a mans own
heart above any thing else, and do nothing but what one can fairly answer to ones
own Conscience. And if I aim'd at this only, I should easily see, that since the <hi>Hugonots</hi>
proffer'd more for this place by forty thousand Livres than it was really worth, this
must be done upon a prospect, that at one time or other it might be of some service
to them against the Catholick party; and then it was plain, I could not put it into
their hands, without betraying the interest of my Religion, and the Crown, for the
sake of my own private advantage. And that, if I would shew my self as true to
God, as I had done to the late King, I should express my fidelity upon this occasion,
and take a pleasure in preferring his glory before any thing else.</p>
               <p>I yielded presently to these reasons, which I found agreeable to the sense of several
very learned persons besides: Possibly the infinite mercy of God may remember me
one day for this action. Tho I look upon it as meer chaff and nothing, in comparison of
the misdemeanours of six and fifty years spent in the Wars, and at Court, which I ought
to dread, as vast Mountains capable of overwhelming me at the day of Judgment;
and should do so, if he had not given us his own word, that when we have sincerely
endeavoured to give him satisfaction in this Life, his Mercy shall set us above his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he next.</p>
               <p>In this solitude I feel daily the pleasure of living in a holy quiet, and remote from
the clutter and vanity of the world, without any other business than to prepare for
death, to make satisfaction to God for my sins, and in some measure make up the
loss of so many past years. Now my own experience hath taught me, how much
more easie and gentle the yoke of my Saviour is, than that of the World; how many
charms Retirement hath more than Business; and how much even that bitterness and
hardship undergone by me, in the different employments of a laborious life, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
to the recommending the several exercises of a solitary and religious life. And
now, when I compare the service I have paid to several Kings, with that which I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to pay at present to the King of Kings; and consider the infinite distance
between Him and the greatest Princes; and the inestimable happiness, which beyond all
humane appearance, I have attained, to know the greatness and Glory of God, I could
employ my self continually in repeating that Hymn in the daily Prayers of the Church;
<hi>Now to the King Eternal, the immortal, invisible, and only wise God, be honour and glory for
ever and ever, Amen.</hi> And since (as I said) the thoughts of death at present wholly
entertain my thoughts, I have taken for my Motto in this retirement, the following
Verses, given me by a friend of mine.</p>
               <l>From Courts and Camps, to peaceful shades retire,</l>
               <l>My Soul; scorn vain, and to true Joys aspire:</l>
               <l>Hence to thy Heaven, wing'd with devotion, fly;</l>
               <l>Who would for ever live, must learn betimes to dye.</l>
               <p>This gallant Souldier after his retirement liv'd with wonderful simplicity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
all the notions of his own judgment, tho that were very great; submitting
himself entirely to the directions of a person, whom he chose to guide him in the
methods of this new life, upon which he had now entred. He was sensible what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
there is between God and the World; and wisely concluded, that his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of the one might be a prejudice and hinderance to him in the service of the
other. Therefore looking upon himself as one that stood in need of a Governour, he
shew'd himself so easie and so tractable, as plainly proved, he had brought his mind
into a perfect and absolute subjection to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:100923:150"/>
After his retreat, he had several tryals, and particularly in point of losses, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hinted, which did but teach him better to disengage his affections from the riches
of this world. Particularly the loss of fourscore thousand Livres at once, by the
breaking of one, who had his Money in his hands. This must needs be the more
sensible affliction, because it was the greatest part of what he had drudged for six and
fifty years together: And all the world values that more, that is of their own getting,
than that which cost them no pains, or descends to them by inheritance. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
his generous nature always made him dread the being burdensome to his friends,
(as several pass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ges in his <hi>Memoirs</hi> shew) and this very temper it was, that kept him
back from the highest preferments. But, which is a further commendation of his worth
in this respect, this very fear, which this loss, and some others that threatned him,
gave so just occasion for, could not prevail with him to accept a considerable summ
for his Government in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> when he was told it could not be taken without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring
his Conscience. From whence we may well conclude, that tho he exprest
some dissatisfaction upon occasions concerning his Estate, and the wants he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to, yet he at last submitted all that worldly Wisdom, to the strictest rules of
Religion, and disinterested Piety.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of his retreat, he happen'd into a very dangerous business; by
which Providence sure intended to shew what he was, to such as did not yet know
him throughly; that after having been Eye-witnesses of his great courage, presence of
mind, and wise conduct, they might be the more edified by that great change, which
they saw had brought down so great a Soul, and prevailed with so much Wisdom to
be govern'd by the directions of another. A person of quality being upon a Journey
into the Country, in the time of the second <hi>Paris</hi> War, desir'd him and some other
friends to bear him company, because the Countrey was full of Troops, and parties of
Souldiers. One of the company, with more heat than discretion, and utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful
in all matters relating to War, seeing some Horse-men upon the Road a good
way off, spu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r'd on, and without saying one word to any of his own company, rode
full speed up to them, crying, <hi>Who are you for? Who are you for?</hi> A Cornet of Horse
that was there, who understood the trade a great deal better, presented his Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toon,
and cry'd, <hi>Nay, who are you for? Come on, alight, and down with your arms.</hi> The
Gentleman, much confounded, that he had advanc'd too far, and left those at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
that should have born him out, and not used to fire and fighting, was lighting
from his Horse; but both being in a passion, the quarrel grew so hot, that the Cornet
was just going to let fly his Musquetoon at him.</p>
               <p>The Sieur <hi>de Pontis,</hi> who assoon as ever he saw this Gentleman ride off from his
company so madly, guest what would happen, and said to a person of quality that
rode near him, <hi>Yonder is one going to make both us and himself more trouble than he is aware of.</hi>
And immediately he, and the person to whom he spoke spurred on. He found the
Cornet just ready to shoot, and bore up so briskly to him, that before he could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
him, or defend himself, with fire in his eyes he cryed out all on the sudden,
<hi>Down with your arms, you Sir.</hi> This Cornet, as much surprized then, as the Gentleman
was before, presently lower'd his Musquetoon, and said, <hi>Ay Sir, with all my heart; I see
you understand your business; but this Gentleman thinks to swagger, and knows nothing of the
matter.</hi> All this was over in an instant, by reason of the mighty haste the Sieur <hi>de
Pontis</hi> made, who by this means sav'd the lives of several persons; for if the Cornet
had shot, no doubt a great deal of mischief had follow'd; whereas now, all the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
was quieted, and presently the Sieur <hi>de Pontis</hi> found a friend of his, among those
that were in company with the Cornet, and went and embrac'd him, asking a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pardons for the Gentleman, that had begun the quarrel so indiscreetly. And
the two acquaintance, after several compliments and expressions of kindness on both
sides, drew off their company, and went each his own way; and had after this a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
quiet and prosperous Journey.</p>
               <p>From this single action, when he was threescore and ten or twelve years old, worn
with the hardships of War, and full of wounds and scars, one may make a judgment
how vigorous he was in the youth and flower of his age; and what reason Cardinal
<hi>Richelieu</hi> had to court so gallant a man over to his party, considering the continual fears
he had of his Enemies, which all the world knows were very many, and very
powerful.</p>
               <p>Besides, the Sieur <hi>de Pontis</hi> had so great a reputation in the world, not only for
Courage, but for Wisdom and Experience in all matters, and punctilio's relating to
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:100923:151"/>
War, that several years after his retirement, there happening a great quarrel to arise
in the Regiment of Guards, between the Lieutenants and the Captains, upon some
dispute concerning their particular Commands, the former came in a body, and begg'd
Monsieur <hi>Pontis,</hi> as a man whose great knowledge and experience they were content
to abide by, to mediate, and decide the Controversie between them. And tho the
retired life he had now engaged in, made him a stranger at present to all business of
this nature, yet the posture of their affairs would not allow him to refuse it, and he
applyed himself to this accommodation with so much greater success, in regard that
his integrity, and religious life, and his great age and experience, added weight to all
his determinarions, and procured him more authority and esteem. So after a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
management of this dispute, and frequent conferences with the Officers princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
concerned, he inclined both sides to agree upon reasonable terms, and settled a
very good correspondence between them all again.</p>
               <p>Whoever hath read these <hi>Memoirs,</hi> no doubt will be very well satisfied, that the
Sieur <hi>de Pontis</hi> was not only a person of great valour and conduct, and capable of
taking up quarrels by his prudence, but also of fitting young Gentlemen for the world,
and giving them good instructions for the behaving themselves wisely and honourably,
which people of quality commonly learn too late, at their own cost, and after having
made abundance of false steps. Nor can it seem strange, if after a long experience
of the hardships and pleasures of the world, and both by his own, and a great many
other peoples example, having discerned the excellencies and the defects of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ages of man, the vices most peculiar to their several conditions, and the dangers
incident to their several stations both in Courts and Camps, he was able to teach
others, who had seen less of the world than himself had done. This induced a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of his acquaintance, who had the care of two young Noblemen at Court, to
consult him in his retirement, and beg the assistance of his advice for the discharge of
that employment. And though his modesty made him think himself less qualified to
graitfy this request, especially when he was now in a manner quite out of the world,
and above fourscore years old, and being a man, that had made arms more his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
than writing or study; yet there appear several excellent strokes in his answer,
many very useful and wise observations, which I suppose the Reader would be well
pleased to see in his own words, and therefore I have thought fit here to insert this
Letter at large, as he wrote it to his Friend.</p>

Noblemen at Court.</head>
                     <opener>
                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>IF I were in any degree less your Servant, than I really am, it were very
easy to have excused my self, from that proof of being so, which you now
desire of me; for I should have made no scruple to own to so good a friend as
you, that my great age hath put it out of my power to give you satisfaction,
since even my Experience is almost quite lost and gone, and all that is left of
that, is only the few Ideas of what hath past over most frequently, and made
the deepest impression upon my memory. This is all I am able to present you
with, and shall think my self very happy, if any part of it may be of use to
you; Tho it were too great a presumption to hope this, in me, who knows with
what wisdom and discretion you educate the young Gentlemen committed to
your care; and therefore I have great reason to look upon your desires of my
advice, rather as a complement, and an effect of your great civility to me, than
any argument that you really stand in need of any such thing.</p>
                     <p>However, in obedience to your commands, I shall take my usual freedom in
declaring my opinion sincerely, since you profess some want of directions,
how to carry your self to these Gentlemen, with regard to the age they are
growing into, in an easy and gentle way, according as you find their temper
and inclinations; to moderate their passions and desires, without rigorous and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:100923:151"/>
rough methods; so as that you may keep up a fair character and continue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,
both with them, and my Lord their Father, and all their Relations of
quality, that are but too fond, and seem to adore them. In good earnest, I
do not only lam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nt, but bear a part my self in your difficulty and trouble; for
indeed you have a great many people to satisfy, a great many faults and defects
to amend, and a great many different parts to act, in order to the discharging
this trust with credit and success.</p>
                     <p>And first of all, I must freely confess to you, that I never could approve the
opinion of those people, that are against their Childrens having any more Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
than just so much as is necessary for a Gentleman (as they are pleased to
express it) For since Knowledge is the best finisher of humane nature, that
which teaches men to reason right, and to speak gracefully in publick; what
can be necessary, if this be not, to those persons whose Birth and Employments,
and Station in the world put them in such circumstances, as have most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
occasions to exert these accomplishments?</p>
                     <p>I know some are of opinion too, that the conversation of vertuous and witty
Ladies, pollishes the mind of a young Gentlemau, and gives it a finer turn,
than the company of a Man of Learning. But I must beg leave to dissent in
this particular too, and dare not advise to such conversation, for fear of the
many mischievous consequences that often attend it, and that Youth finds it
self insensibly engaged in.</p>
                     <p>Not but that there ought a great difference to be made, betwixt one who is
designed to make the Gown his profession, and one that is to be educated to make
a Gentleman and a Souldier. The former ought to make study the business of
his whole Life; the other need only follow it, till some fifteen or sixteen years
old, so as to get some knowledge of Philosophy, of ancient and modern History,
and the main rules of Politicks, and so as to manage himself regularly, and
converse with people of several qualities, as becomes him.</p>
                     <p>When this is over, it were fit he went into the Academy to learn to ride,
and shoot, and vault, and dance; these exercises will give him a gente<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l and
good behaviour, they will teach him to carry his body straight, to walk grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
with a manly and noble mein; to hold up his head, have a steady look
a pleasing countenance, full of civility, always obliging, but without any affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
or constraint. There too he will learn Mathematicks, so far as may
serve to qualify him for Fortification, the attacking or defending of Towns,
the discovering where Works are defective, and how they may be amended;
all which (with the addition of your help) may be learnt sufficiently in two
or three years time. In my opinion, their failings in these exercises that are
of less consequence, should be left to the correction of the Master, whose busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
it is to teach them. But if they contract any ill habit besides, you will do
well to make them sensible of it in private. For by dealing thus tenderly with
them, their love and respect for you will be the better preserved and increased.</p>
                     <p>After they leave the Academy, I should advise their going abroad into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Kingdoms to learn their Languages, observe their different Customs and
Governments, and entertain themselves with a sight of the most remarkable
Curiosities to be met with abroad; and, as a help to their memory in all these
things, it were fit they made a Diary of their Travels. But pray be sure you
never entertain them with any thing, but what is becoming a man of honour
and a Christian; that you may excite in them strong desires to practice and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
such actions as these, and may create an irreconcileable aversion to every
thing that is base and low, and dishonourable. But the main point of all, is
to make them sensible, that the truest and best way of securing honour to one's
self, is the paying Almighty God the honour d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e to him; who always distributes
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:100923:152"/>
his mercies largely, to those that live in his fear and love. To preserve this
opinion in them, you must use great dexterity, in keeping them from all kinds
of bad company, but especially from the conversation of lewd and profane
wretch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, who are the bane of young men, that are setting up for some credit
in the world. But this is a very nice and tender, and will require a great
deal of good management, so as at once to gain your point, and yet to lose no
ground in their kindness and esteem for you.</p>
                     <p>You must take special care never to check their passions by authority, and too
magisterial a way, nor by correcting them too sharply; but be sure to shew the
reasons why you reprove them, chide them with modesty and civility, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
your self with soft methods to bring them into temper. For you are to
consider, that some passions are not faulty, nay some are convenient for a man
of Quality; such is Ambition in particular, when it puts them forward to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Example of my Lord Marcschal their Grand-father; a person that sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized
himself upon so many eminent occasions and brave exploits, while he
was General to the Kings Armies for many years both at home and abroad; that
the King had so high a value for him, and the world so great an opinian of his
Courage, that he hath at this very time among most forreigners, the general
reputation of one of the greatest and best Commanders of this age.</p>
                     <p>Some other passions there are so furious and violent, that it is impossible to
compose them in a trice, as we see in the case of Anger, and sudden sallies of
the Soul. But these are a sort of madness for the time, too strong to last long;
and all that can be done in such cases, is to calm and cool them by degrees:
For oppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>mptory and restiff; which by degrees would lessen your credit with them,
and lose all the regard they have for you.</p>
                     <p>You must find a mean for them between a bold indifference, and a timorous

                        </gap>fulness; and teach them the just differences both between persons and things;
what respects are due to persons of quality, and worth, and how they ought to
be addressed to; a formal excessive Complement being no less ridiculous an
extreme on the one hand, than a Clownish roughness is offensive on the other.</p>
                     <p>If any sudden misfortune bring them into the inconveniences and hazards so
common to Gentlemen now adays, your wisdom must shew it self in taking up
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uarrel speedily, by endeavouring to reconcile them through the mediation of
Friends, and fetching them honourably off from the ill consequences that attend
such quarrels. Your care and good management upon such occasions as these,
will above any thing in the world secure you a great deal of honour and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
both from my Lord their Father, and all the Families to whom they are
related.</p>
                     <p>Sir, I could enlarge yet more, were I not sensible, that by this time I must
needs have convinced you, by what I have taken the liberty to say already, that
it is not possible for me to advise any thing, which you do not know much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
your self. However, I beg you would look upon this Letter, as a proof of
the inclination I have to serve you; and my wishes, that I were capable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it; and of my readiness to express to you, that I am most sincerely</p>

               <p>I do not pretend here to any Encomium of the Sieur <hi>de Pontis</hi> his piety, who was
so modest after his leaving the world, as never to account himself any better than an
old sinner, to whom silence, and solitude, and a life that shut him up from Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
were given as his portion; and therefore I shall so far comply with his disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in this p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rticular, as to add only one thing, which he would often say to an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
friend of his; That the thing he most dreaded in the service he endeavoured to
pay Almighty God, was lest he should insensibly grow fond, and take up with this
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:100923:152"/>
life, and not sufficiently contemplate the greatness of Him he had the honour to
serve. And these apprehensions were the more reasonable in him, because upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
remembrances of that extraordinary zeal, shewn in all his long hard service to
his Master the late King, he might find some ground to suspect himself less zealous,
where yet the service was infinitely better, and the Master incomparably greater. He
lived about eighteen or twenty years after his Retirement, and at last fell into a very
weak and languishing condition; and Nature was so far decayed, that after his first
voluntary retreat from the Court and company, he fell into a more strict one the
two last years of his life, being lost to all conversation with men, by his extreme deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and so finding himself under some necessity of entertaining himself chiefly with
Almighty God.</p>
               <p>He dyed in the year of our Lord 1670, and of his own age the ninety second;
when Nature could last no longer, but was forced to sink under so many years, and
so many hardships and shocks, which he had undergone in several Wars, for a long
time together. I cannot suffer my self to doubt, but upon the perusal of these <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs,</hi>
and considering the many dangers, the cross accidents, and uncommon events,
which he was exercised with, every body will be of opinion, that there are some
things very surprizing and wonderful, and the marks of a particular providence with
regard to him; and that the publishing this account may be of great use, since so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things are contained in it, capable of doing good to those that are about engaging
in the affairs of the world, to them that are already engaged, and to them too who
have disengaged themselves from it. For all these may learn from this Example of a
Souldier, one that had long experience of all the different conditions that could hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to him, both in the Court, and in the Camp, that nothing was ever more true
than that observation of the wisest Prince that ever lived; <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
except the fear of God, and the keeping of his Commandments.</hi>
