            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>And the King doth see that they daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide ships to vex our Merchants, and grieve our Kingdome, unlesse speedy remedy bee provided therein: And considering the perils which in these times of war are every where imminent.</p>
                  <p>The King for the defence of the Sea, the security of his Subjects, the safe conduct of the Ships, and merchandizes, being willing (by Gods assistance) to provide, the rather for that he and his progenitors, Kings of England, have beene Lords of the Sea.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1.</note>First, it hath beene objected, that the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <hi>de Tallagio non concedendo</hi> was not a Statute.

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2.</note>The second objection was; That the words, Aides, Tax, and Tallages, doe not

extend to this provision of Ships of Warre, and men for defence, and that there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the aides which are due to the Kings Majesty, for making his eldest sonne Knight, nor aides for mariage, nor other aids by tenures.</p>
               <p>The answer is easie:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Resp.</hi> 2.</note> for the words of the Statute of the fourteenth year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, are, That they shall not from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be charged or grieved, to make any aide or to sustaine any charge.</p>
               <p>These are words so generall, that all is comprehended which charges all; And for the aides of making the eldest sonne Knight, and the other aides, they are not generall to charge all, but particular, such as are charged by tenure, and neede no exception.</p>
               <p>And yet in the Statute of 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. there is an exception (of other then those which hold by such tenure) which exception was needlesse, because no charge of any in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is within any of the acts of Parliament; but such as are generall, and extend to charge all the Subjects of the Realme, as this doth.</p>
               <p>There hath beene another objection made<note place="margin">

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59856:14"/>
it should be of no force, doth not stand with any reason to impeach the Statute, nor many others that are not there enumerated.</p>
               <p>The last and greatest Objection that hath beene made,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 4.</note> first by my Brother <hi>Crawley,</hi> and after by others, and insisted upon by my Brother <hi>Iones,</hi> is; That this is a Prerogative, or power Royall, so incident to the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, that it cannot be taken away by any act of Parliament; And, as it was said, it is <hi>proprium quarto modo</hi>: And in proofe thereof it was affirmed, that when there was in the beginning of King <hi>Iames</hi> his raigne a purpose to have taken away all tenures by an act of Parliament, and to have shut up the Court of Wards; It was resolved by the Judges, that such a Statute had beene void.</p>
               <p>First, I doe agree, that there are many things so incident in power to a King, as are not in the power of any Parliament to take away, as appeares by the case of 1. <hi>H.</hi> 7. of the disposing of the right of the Kingdome, power of making Warre and Leagues, The power of the coine, and the value of coines, and many other Monarchicall powers and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59856:15"/>
prerogatives, which to be taken away, were against naturall reason, and are incidents so inseparable that they cannot be taken away by Parliament.</p>
               <p>And yet I will shew you, and prove, that Acts of Parliament have bounded, limited, and qualified the Kings ancient and inherent Prerogatives of like nature, and of as great importance as this is.</p>

               <p>This Tribute continued after the Danes, for in the time of the Normans, it became to be called a tallage, or taxe; King <hi>Henry</hi> the first granted to the Citizens of London to be quit, and free from Danegelt: And the same King about the thirtieth yeare of his raigne, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of his sinne, did grant that <hi>Danicum Tributum</hi> should be totally released for seaven yeares,<note place="margin">Spelman. fo. 200.</note> as it appeares in S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Henry Spelmans</hi> booke intituled <hi>Glossarium, fol.</hi> 200.</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59856:19"/>
these acts of Parliament, it might have beene put in use: For no man will maintaine, that this tribute of Danegelt, can now be imposed at this day by the Kings Writ, under the great Seale, which it might be if these Statutes had not taken it away.</p>
               <p>And for this purpose,<note place="margin">34. Ed. 1. cap. 8.</note> in the Statutes made in the foure and thirtieth yeare of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.

                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:59856:22"/>This is very true, for this is a thing which the King is bound to doe for the good of his Subjects.</p>
               <p>For as it is agreed in 34. <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>fo.</hi> 14.<note place="margin">34. H. 6. fo. 14.</note> The Kings Majesty is bound to keepe his Courts of Chancery, and all his other Courts at his own charge; And 39. <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>fo.</hi> 40. The King is bound to doe Law and right to all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; which without these powers and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives could not be performed.</p>
               <p>Out of these and the like of murage and pontage, there can no sound argument bee drawne, to warrant this provision of Ships, and men, and furniture for warre, when the King will so appoint.</p>
               <p>But I conceive that it hath beene generally agreed by all the Judges (<hi>nullo contradicente</hi>) that if this Writ of 4. <hi>Augusti,</hi> which is for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of a Ship, and furniture, and men, had beene for to have authorized the Sheriffes to have levied monies of the Subjects for that purpose; That then the Writ could not have given power to have done it, because that would have beene expresly against the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes; And if that be granted, then considering
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59856:23"/>
that these Writs to the Sheriffes, are accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with instructions, commanding and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the levying of money, and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning what summe is to be raised in every County for that service; As in the County of Yorke, and in the County of the Citie of Yorke, the summe of twelve thousand pounds, and the summe of eight thousand pounds for the County of Lincolne: And so a proportion of money for every County for that purpose: The consequence thereof may be this, that this levy, which hath obtained the name of Ship-money, and wherein no indeavour hath ever beene made for prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any such Ship, or furniture, or men, as the Writ in it selfe purports, is not pursued, or warranted by this generall levy of ship, money: for it is a rule, <hi>Id quod non fieri potest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recte, ex obliquo fieri non debet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confesse that divers of the Kings of this Realm, have upon some pretended occasions, taken upon them by perswasion of some Great men in their time, and assumed a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and Monarchicall power, to levy monies by Commissions, and have extended that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59856:23"/>
power very farre, whereof you may read, That in the seaventeenth yeare of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight;<note place="margin">17. H. 8. Anno Dom. 1525.</note> Cardinall <hi>Woolsie</hi> was charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have beene the cause of directing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions into all Countries, for the levying of the sixt part of all mens goods, and the sixt part of their Plate, for that the King was then determined to make warre with France, and to passe the Sea himselfe: This being attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by inforcing some, and sending others to prison, it grew to be so generally misliked, that the people rose up in divers Countries, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King disclaimed that it was done without his Privity: The Cardinall charged it to be done; first by the consent of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell; which they denied; then he charged the Judges to be consenting, which being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, the Cardinall tooke it to himselfe; And all the Commissions were recalled, you may see it at large set downe in divers Chronicles: And in the latter times of our gracious Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> upon pretence of want, for expeditions in Ireland, There was a generall Benevolence required, and it went on for a time, and so farre as it came to be voluntarily
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59856:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
levied in the Innes of Court; And I can speake it of my own knowledge, I paid a sum, I think but twenty shillings,<note place="margin">The attempt to have a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence for Queene Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth.</note> &amp; others paid likewise: But not long after (as it was said) when the Queene was informed, that this Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was expresly against the Statute of <hi>Richard</hi> the third, and against the Laws, and distastfull; All the monies levied was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be restored and repaied, and mine was, and the rest was so to others, as I heard, and doe verily believe; and this was attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by so gracious a Queen.</p>
               <p>And to speak nothing of the Commission dated the thirteenth day of <hi>October,</hi> in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond yeare of our gracious Soveraigne Lord the Kings Majesty, for the Loan and levying of the five Subsidies, which was effected, and acknowledged after not to be warranted by the Laws and Statutes: This point is apparent, That in time of necessities these Legall or Monarchicall Powers have been assumed in the times of other Kings.</p>
               <p>And hereupon I conclude these points, That the Statutes have taken away this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of charging the Subjects of this Realme
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59856:24"/>
with any generall and publique Charge, Aide or Tallages, or burthens for any businesse, but onely by their consent in Parliament, and no Usage, Precedent, or Custome, if any such have been, can by Law take away the force of these Acts of Parliament, so long as they stand in force.</p>
               <p>And I doe absolutely beleeve, that if the Kings Majesty had not been perswaded by some opinions, that this course was warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Law, and Custome of the Realme, that he would not have attempted the same.</p>
               <p>NOw I proceed to the fifth part;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The fifth part.</hi>
                  </note> That the matter which is contained in the Writ of 4. <hi>Augusti, Anno</hi> 11. <hi>Car.</hi> doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain sufficient matter to warrant this levy.</p>
               <p>First, the words of the Writ are not any affirmance directly of any danger, for they are but <hi>Quia datum est nobis intelligi;</hi> this is but of information, and not <hi>ex certa scientia,</hi> which are of more force: The other words are but of information or suggestion.</p>
               <p>Then for the matter; It containes onely these points, That there are many Pirats and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59856:25"/>
Sea-robbers, congregated upon the Sea, to take away some of our Subjects into misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Captivity, and to hinder our Merchants to bring in their merchandizes and goods, and the goods and Merchandizes of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our friends comming and traffiquing hither; and spoyling of our Merchants: And for that the Sea hath bin, and ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by <hi>Gentem Anglicanam,</hi> And they inttending to trouble the Kingdome;</p>
               <p>And we considering the danger every where now imminent, and desiring the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Realme, the safe-gard of the Sea, the security of our Subjects, the safe conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ships of our Merchants, &amp; of their merchandizes, to come into our Realme, and to goe forth of the Realme, and willing to provide for their aid, doe therefore direct this Writ.</p>
               <p>Here is no matter of any publique danger to all the Subjects, no intended comming upon the Land, but to robbe and spoile as Pirates by Sea, and conspirators to molest Merchants, to hinder traffique, to take some prisoners, as have bin done heretofore, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59856:25"/>
by the Dunkirks, and many times by the Pirats to Argiers.</p>
               <p>All this is but such a defence as doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire but the ordinary defence, to the which the Kings Majesty is solely bound for to see performed, for the ordinary benefits, that he hath of Customes, and Subsidies of Wines, and other profits, besides the Tunnage and Poundage; And the Ships which are provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Cinque ports, for which they have many priviledges.</p>
               <p>This matter contained in the Writ, by all the particulars, doth not comprize any gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall assault or attempt to be made for taking any Townes, as hath beene beforetime.</p>
               <p>Another reason to prove that the Writ doth not containe sufficient matter to induce a generall charge (is to be collected,) That this being perceived, it is contained more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and laboured to be aided and supplied by the words put into the <hi>Mittimus,</hi> which are of more efficacie; For therein is contained, which is not in the Writ of 4. <hi>Augusti: Quod pro defensione Regni, &amp; tuitione maris</hi>; And for that, <hi>Salus Regni nostri Angliae &amp; populi nostri peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitabatur</hi>:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59856:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And the recitall of [<hi>Datum est nobis intelligi</hi>] is omitted, but hereby affirmed posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</p>
               <p>And where my Brother <hi>Berkley</hi> insisted; That the matter contained in the <hi>Mittimus</hi> was sufficient to supply the Writ of 4. <hi>Augusti,</hi> if it were not so fully expressed as it should have beene.</p>
               <p>Thereunto I make this answer, <hi>Quod in initio non valet, tractatu temporis non convalescet</hi>: Besides the date of the Writ of <hi>Mittimus</hi> is the fift of <hi>May Anno</hi> 13. <hi>Car. Regis,</hi> which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most two years after the Writ of 4. <hi>Augusti</hi> did issue; And this is a very late supply: And therefore that Case was vouched by my Brother <hi>Berkley</hi> which was <hi>Dowmans</hi> Case <hi>An.</hi> 25. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and reported by my Lord <hi>Cooke</hi> in his ninth booke,<note place="margin">25. &amp; 26.

It is resolved upon the Statute of Wills, that the estate contained in a Will in writing, which is the foundation and ground, must be such as is expressed in the written originall Will, and that no averment or subsequent proofe of intention, or explanation can adde or supply any thing to that Originall.</p>
               <p>And as in these cases the originall founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be supplied by subsequent addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; So the Writ of 4. <hi>Augusti</hi> being the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, cannot be supplied by subsequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation.</p>

                  <hi>ut accepimus le Roy</hi> command to the Sheriffe, <hi>De attach</hi> the body of the said <hi>Robert,</hi> and he was attached, and did appeare: And by his Counsell alledged, that upon this suggestion the King being not otherwise apprised by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment or otherwise, this suit did not lie for the King, and the parties grieved may have their suits.</p>
               <p>And thereupon the Court was advised, and took time to speak with the Chancellor, to see if he had any matter, out of which the said Writ was awarded: And afterwards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this Writ was grounded upon a sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion against the Common Law, therefore the said <hi>Robert</hi> was discharged, which is a stronger Case then ours. And for these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons I conclude this Part, that no <hi>Scire facias</hi> ought to be awarded in this case.</p>

                  </note> that the Judges had before given their opinions to warrant the legality of this charge, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed their names.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:59856:29"/>First, I doe affirme, and it doth appear by my Argument, that this Case now in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth not concern nor contradict the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Subscription; for the matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Subscription was made, is, That when the good and safety of the Kingdome in generall is concerned, and the whole Kingdome in danger, That then for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Kingdome from such danger, the King may by Writ impose the provision of Ships with furniture and men.</p>
               <p>But if onely there be Pirats and Robbers of the Sea assembled together by Sea to rob, spoile, and take the goods and marchandises that are to be brought into the Kingdome, and safe conducting of the Merchants from spoile, as no other particular thing is alledged in the Writ of 4. <hi>Augusti,</hi> I think it will be granted that this doth not by our opinions inable the King to make such a generall charge upon that occasion.</p>
               <p>But if there were an intended Invasion, &amp; that known to the Kings Majesty whom it concernes most, and upon such an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in such a case of necessity, which is and

               <p>To this it is answered,<note place="margin">

                  </note> that a Demurrer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth the matters of fact which are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently alledged; but such matters in fact as are not sufficiently alledged, those are not confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but left to the judgement of the Court.</p>
               <p>See these Cases so adjudged and resolved in these Books,<note place="margin">Lib. 4. fo. 43. in <hi>Hudsons</hi> Case.</note>

               <p>The very expresse Case is that of <hi>Birton</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Usury, which was, <hi>Anno</hi> 33. &amp; 34. <hi>Eliz.</hi> where it is adjudged that a Demurrer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth nothing that is insufficiently alledged; as where a matter of usury is alledged, and is not so sufficiently alledged, that it appeares to be Usurie, the Demurrer doth not confesse that to be Usurie, as is pretended.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:59856:31"/>So likewise in this case, the Demurrer ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral doth not nor can supply the defect of the matter which should have been comprised in the Writ of 4. <hi>Augusti.</hi> The Demurrer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that there was such a Writ, but doth neither confesse the lawfulnesse thereof, nor the defect of the insufficient alledging of any matter which should have beene contained therein.</p>
               <p>And thus with as much brevity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity as want of memory and other infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which attend upon my age would suffer me, and without either preamble or protestation, I conclude with that, which my brother <hi>Berkley</hi> used in the beginning of his speech, That the people of this Realme are Subjects, and not slaves; Free-men, and not villeins; and therefore not to be taxed <hi>De alto &amp; basso,</hi> and at will, but according to the Laws of this Kingdome.</p>
               <p>And therefore I conclude, that neither for the matter, nor for the manner, this Writ of <hi>Scire facias</hi> brought in this Court of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, upon the tenour thereof, can be
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59856:31"/>
maintained. And therefore in my opinion I advise the Barons to give judgement accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly for the Defendant.</p>

                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:59856:33"/>I shall onely deliver these two Reasons for maintaining of my Argument.</p>
               <p>THe first is, That His Majesty is <hi>Sola &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> suprema Iustitia regni</hi>: And the rule of the Law is, and hath alwayes been, That his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty can doe no wrong. And thereupon ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth another Rule in our Law, (which I give for my second Reason) That the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> (being of an incorporate capacity) can neither take any lands or goods from any of his Subjects, but by and upon a Judgement of Record, which according to our daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the Exchequer, there must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede some Judgement in that or some other Court of Record, whereby His Majesty may be entituled either to the Lands, or goods of a Subject: As namely, where seisures of goods of a Subject is made for His Majesty, either upon Outlawries, Attainders, or matters of the like nature, as in Cases of Seisure in the Court of Exchequer, where Seisures are given by the Statute: yet without a Judgement in that Court, upon a tryall for the King, the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59856:34"/>
goods are not to be recovered to the use of the King, as forfeited.</p>
               <p>Upon consideration whereof, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the same with His Majesties Royall Writ, I find no Judgement thereupon had or given, which were the chiefest reasons of my opinion for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

annexed is sent unto the Exchequer, with a command there to doe for the levying of the summes so assessed and unpaid (<hi>Prout de jure, et secundùm legem regni nostri Angliae fuerit faciend.</hi>) Whereupon a <hi>Scire facias</hi> issued out of the Exchequer, reciting the said Writs, to warn Master <hi>Hampden</hi> amongst others, to shew cause why hee should not bee charged with this money. Upon this, he being summoned, appeareth, and demands the hearing of those Writs and Schedule, which being entred, thereupon he demurreth in law.</p>
            <p>And whether judgement upon this whole Record be to be given against <hi>Iohn Hampden,</hi> that he is to be charged or no, that is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: for hee is the onely party in this Case: And there is no cause, why any man should say, that the question is, Whether judgement should bee given for the King, or for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant; for, as this case is, the King is no party to the Record, but onely it is a judiciall process out of the Exchequer, grounded upon those former Records for the Defendant, to shew cause why hee should not bee charged, which hath been very elaborately argued by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59856:37"/>
the Defendants Councell (who demurred) that hee should not be charged; and by the Kings Councell very learnedly and elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately argued, that he should be charged.</p>
            <p>This Case is a Case of great weight, and the greatest Case of weight that ever wee reade argued by Judges in this place; and therefore adjourned into this place, for advice of all the Judges: For of the one side it is alledged, that it concerneth the King in his Prerogative and power Royall: And on the other side, that it concerneth all the Kings Subjects in their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, their persons, and their estates: For which cause, it hath made some of us to wish and move among our selves, that it might have been (by his Majesties favour) heard and determined in another place by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, and his great Councell of his Realme: Where all conveniencies and inconveniencies might have been considered of, provided for, and prevented for present and future times, and not to bee argued onely by us, who are accompted his Majesties Councell at law; wherein if any thing be done amisse, the fault must light upon us, as mis-advising the King
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59856:38"/>
therein: But seeing that it hath pleased his Majesty, that the same should be argued and determined in this place, whose pleasure we must obey, I must give my best advice upon my oath to the best of my skill; wherein, I hope not to trench upon his Highnesse Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, which wee are all bound by our oaths to the best of our skills to maintain, and not to suffer to be diminished; nor upon his Royall power: but truly to deliver what I conceive the law to bee concerning the Case in question.</p>
            <p>Wherein I must confesse, I have been much distracted, having heard so learned Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on both sides at the Barre; and so many Records and Presidents cited on either side: But they did not so much move mee; for the Councell have of either side pressed such rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and arguments, and cited such Records, as they thought convenient for the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their opinions; and perhaps with a prejudicate opinion, as I my selfe, by mine owne experience, when I was at the Barre, have argued confidently: And as I then thought the law to be of that side for whom
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59856:38"/>
I argued; but after, being at the Bench, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indifferently all reasons and authorities, have been of a contrary opinion: And so the law hath been adjudged contrary to that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which I first confidently conceived; but that which hath moved mee most, and maketh me most mistrust mine owne judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Case, is, That all my Brothers (who have all argued upon their oaths, and I presume, have seene the Records and Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents cited on either side) have all argued one way, with whose opinions I should wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have concurred, if I could have satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied mine owne judgement with their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; but not being satisfied, I have learned, that I must not runne with a multitude against mine owne conscience: for, I must stand or fall unto mine owne Master; and therefore I shall shew mine owne reasons, and leave my selfe to the judgements of my Lords, and others my Brethren: And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever shall be adjudged, I must submit unto, and so doe wish all others; and doe now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare mine opinion to be, That, as this Case is,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59856:39"/>
judgement ought to bee given for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed to the Argument, I desire to remove two difficulties: First, that by the Demurrer the danger of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is confessed, and so to be a Case of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, that the Demurrer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth not matters in fact, but where the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is legally set down; but if it be not a legall proceeding, then the Demurrer is no confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the matter in fact.</p>
            <p>This appeares in the Book Case of 5. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>fol.</hi> 1. and <hi>Cook, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>fol.</hi> 69. in <hi>Burtons</hi> Case, that a Demurrer is no confessing in matters of fact; but where the matter precedent is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently pleaded and laid downe, and so it is holden in all our Bookes.</p>
            <p>The second difficulty is, that this Case is so resolved by all our opinions under our hands, That this Writ was legall, which was much pressed by Master Solicitor.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, that it is true I have set downe mine opinion under mine hand unto
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59856:39"/>
a Case in February 1636. which is, that when the good and safety of the Kingdome in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall is concerned, and the whole Kingdome in danger, his Majesty may, by Writ under the great Seale of England, command all his Subjects of this Kingdome, at their charges to provide and furnish such number of ships with men, victualls, and munition; and for such time as his Majesty shall thinke fit for the defence and safeguard of the Kingdome from such danger: And that his Majesty may compell the doing thereof (in case of refusall and refractorinesse) and that in such case his Majesty is the sole Judge of the danger, and when, and how the same is to bee prevented and avoided.</p>
            <p>To this opinion, I confesse, I then with the rest of the Judges subscribed my hand: But I then dis-assented to that opinion, and then signified mine opinion to bee, that such a charge could not bee laid by any such Writ, but by Parliament; and so absolutely in that point one other did agree with mee, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from that opinion which was after sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, and some others in some other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59856:40"/>
from that which was subscribed: But, the greater part seeming to bee absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved upon that opinion, some of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that they had seene divers Records and Presidents of such Writs, satisfying them to be of that judgement, I was pressed to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe with them: for that the greater opinion must involve the rest, as it was said to bee usuall in Cases of references. And that the lesser number must submit to the opinion of the more, although they varied in opinion; as it is in our Courts, if three Judges agree in opinion against one or two, where there is five Judges, judgement is to be entred <hi>per Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam,</hi> if the <hi>major</hi> part agree, and the others are to submit unto it.</p>
            <p>So in Cases of conference and certificate of their opinions, if the greater part did agree and subscribe, the rest were to submit their opinions: And this (by more ancient Judges then my selfe) was affirmed to bee the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall practice; and that it was not fit, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a Case of this nature so much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the service of the King, for some to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, and some to forbeare their subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59856:40"/>
And that although wee did subscribe, yet it did not bind any, but that in point of judgement, if the Case came in question ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially before us, we should give our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as wee should see cause, after the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Arguments on both sides, and not to be bound by this sudden resolution.</p>
            <p>Hereupon I consented to subscribe; but I then said, in the meane time the King might be mis-informed by our Certificate under our hands, conceiving us all to agree together, and give him this advice under our hands, and not know that there was any that dissented, or was doubtfull: But it was then said, the King should bee truly informed thereof. And thereupon, we that did dissent, did subscribe our hands with such protestations as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, onely for conformity, although contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the opinion I then conceived.</p>
            <p>But this being before Arguments heard of either side, or any Presidents seen, I hold that none is bound by that opinion: And if I had been of that opinion as was subscribed, yet now having heard all the Arguments of both sides, and the Reasons of the Kings
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59856:41"/>
Councell to maintain this Writ, and why the Defendant is to bee charged, and the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Defendants Councel against the Writ, and their Reasons why the Defendant should not bee charged to pay the mony as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed upon them: And having duly conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Records and Presidents cited and shewed unto mee, especially those of the Kings side, I am now of an absolute opinion, that this Writ is illegal, &amp; declare my opinion contrary to that which is subscribed by us all. And if I had been of the same opinion as was subscribed, yet upon better advisement, being absolutely settled in my judgement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, in a contrary opinion I thinke it no shame to declare, that I doe retract that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: for, <hi>Humanum est errare,</hi> rather then to argue against mine owne conscience: And therefore now having (as I conceived) remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved these difficulties, I proceed to my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and shall shew the Reasons of mine opinion, and leave the same, as I have said, to my Lords and Brethren.</p>
            <p>My reasons and grounds that I shall insist upon are these:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59856:41"/>That the command, by this Writ of 4. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusti,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 11. <hi>Caroli,</hi> to make ships at the charge of the inhabitants of the County (being the ground of this suit, and cause of this charge) is illegall, and contrary to the Common law, not being by authority of Parliament.</p>
            <p>That if at the Common law it had been <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> doubtfull, yet now this Writ is illegall, being expresly contrary to divers Statutes prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any generall charge to bee laid upon the Commons in generall, without consent in Parliament.</p>
            <p>That it is not to bee maintained by any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Prerogative, or power Royall, nor allegation of necessity or danger.</p>
            <p>That admitting it were legall, to lay such a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> charge upon Maritine parts; yet to charge an Inland County, as the County of Bucks is, with making ships, and furnishing them with Masters, Mariners, and Souldiers at their charge, which are farre remote from the Seas, is illegall, and not warranted by any former President, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I shall examine the Presidents and Records <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> cited to warrant this Writ, which have been
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59856:42"/>
all the principall grounds of the Arguments to maintaine the same. And I conceive, there is not one President nor Record in any prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent time, that hath beene produced and shewed unto mee, that doth maintaine any Writ to lay such a charge upon any County, Inland, or Maritine.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> I will examine this particular Writ, and the severall parts thereof, and doe conceive that it is illegall, and not sufficient to ground this charge upon the Defendant.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The motives of this Writ are not sufficient to cause such a Writ to be sent.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The command of the Writ, to prepare a ship at the charge of the inhabitants with munition and men, is against the Common law, and Statutes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> That to lay a charge of finding victuals, and wages of Souldiers and Mariners, is ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, and contrary to the Common law, and divers Statutes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The power of assessment given to the Sheriffe alone, and to distraine for this, is ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, and not warranted by any President.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The power of imprisoning is illegall, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59856:42"/>
contrary to divers Statutes, and not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the Presidents.</p>
            <p>That the perclose of the Writ, &amp; the practice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> of it is contrary to it self, and <hi>oppositu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in objecto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this Writ were legall, yet the manner of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> assessment by the Sheriffe, as it is certified, is not warranted by the Writ: So consequently this summe cannot bee demanded of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant by vertue of this Writ.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Certiorari,</hi> and <hi>Scire facias,</hi> issued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> not out legally; and so consequently no judgement can bee given against the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant thereupon.</p>
            <p>For the first point, that this Writ of 4. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusti,</hi> 11. <hi>Car.</hi> is against the Common law, my Reasons are these:</p>
            <p>Because, that this is the first Writ, since the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Conquest, that went to any Inland County, to prepare a ship with men and munition, for ought appeareth by any Record that hath been shewed; and where there was never any President before, by the rule of Master <hi>Littleton, fol.</hi> 23. the Law is not conceived to beare any such Writ. And Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> in his Commentary upon <hi>Littleton, fol.</hi> 81. saith,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59856:43"/>
that where there is no example, it is a great intendment, that the law will not beare it.</p>
            <p>So I conceive here, there never having bin a President before of any such Writ to the Sheriffe and Inhabitants of a County, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a ship with men and munition, upon any occasion whatsoever, that it is against the Common law to award such Writs.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For that the common law of England set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth a freedome in the Subjects, in respect of their persons, and giveth them a true property in their goods and estates, so that without their consent (that is, their actuall consent, or implicite, by a common ordinance, which they consented unto by a common assent in Parliament) it cannot bee taken from them, nor their estate charged: And for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the law distinguisheth between bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whose estates are at their Lords will and disposition; and freemen, whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty none may invade, charge, nor take away, but by their owne free consent: But here in this Case is a charge laid upon the Subjects, without their consent; and therefore not warranted by law; which is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59856:43"/>
proved by these authorities:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coke</hi> in his Reports, <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>fol.</hi> 92. in <hi>Francis</hi> Case, setteth downe this Rule, <hi>Quod no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Master <hi>Lambert, fol.</hi> 24. setting downe the lawes of England, which were confirmed by <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, hath these words: <hi>Inter alia, volumus &amp; concedimus, quod omnes liberi homines Monarchiae Regni sui praedict', habeant &amp; teneant terras suas bene &amp; in pace liberas ab omni exactione injusta, &amp; ab omni Tallagio</hi> (not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning there <hi>injusta</hi>) <hi>Ita quòd nihil ab eis exiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur praeter servitium justè debitum</hi>: Hereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, there is an absolute freedome from all Tallage. 17. King <hi>Iohn</hi> in <hi>Matt. Paris, fol.</hi> 246. The King doth grant and confirme unto his Barons and Commons <hi>inter alia,</hi> these liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties following: <hi>Nullum Scutagium vel auxilium ponamus in Regno nostro, nisi per Commune Concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Regni nostri, nisi ad redimendum corpus nostrum, filium nostrum primogenitum mill' faciend', vel ad primogenitam filiam nostram maritand'.</hi> By this it appeares, what was then conceived to be, amongst others, their liberties, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59856:44"/>
which was, that no aide should bee put upon them, but by Parliament; for the Parliament was then called <hi>Commune Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the law is so, appeareth by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise written by <hi>Fortescue,</hi> who had been chiefe Justice of England, and then Chancellour of England in King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth his time, when he wrote the booke intituled, <hi>De laudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Legum Angliae</hi>: For, <hi>fol.</hi> 25. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. hee saith thus, That the King of England cannot alter nor change the Lawes of England at his pleasure.</p>

            <p>So it appeareth by the Booke case, 13. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 14. that the grant of the King which tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the charge and prejudice of his people in generall, is not good, unlesse by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But it is agreed there, that grants of Tolls, of Faires, of Pontage, of Pikage, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Ferrying, or such like, which are for the profit, good, and ease of them that will take benefit thereof, and not compulsory to any to pay, but to them that will take the benefit of such Faires, &amp;c. and being very small and reasonable summes, the Law doth give al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance unto them: but if they were great summes, that tend to the charge of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59856:45"/>
the Law will judge them void.</p>
            <p>This appears in Sir <hi>Edw. Cokes</hi> Reports, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>fol.</hi> 63. in the Case of the Chamberlain of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, That an ordinance made by the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Councell of London, where they have a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome by the said Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Councell, to make reasonable ordinances to bind all within the City concerning Clothes to bee brought to Blackwell Hall, there alwaies to be viewed, &amp; measured, &amp; searched before they were sold, &amp; a penny appointed for the Officer that did that service; That such a charge was reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for that it was for the publick benefit of the City and Common-wealth: And a pecuniary penalty laid for not performance of that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was allowed. <hi>Ibid. fol.</hi> 64. in <hi>Clarkes</hi> Case is resolved, That an ordinance made by the assent of the Plaintiffe himselfe, and other Burgesses for the Towne of Saint Albons, of a small taxe upon the inhabitants of the Town, towards the erection of the Courts, &amp; other necessaries for the Terme to bee kept there, It was allowed to bee good, and did bind the Plaintiffe, being by the Plaintiffes own consent, and for the publick good of the Town.</p>

            <p>And as by grant the King cannot charge his people, so neither can hee by Writ lay any charge upon his people, but by their consent, or where they have apparent benefit thereby: And that is the reason of the Writ in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister, <hi>fol.</hi> 127. <hi>Fitzh. nat. brev. fol.</hi> 113. where, by breach of the Sea walls, any inundation is of the Country, the King, who is <hi>Pater patriae,</hi> and taketh care for the good and safety of his people, sendeth out his Commissioners to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire by whose default any such breach hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and to cause all that had lands and commons neere adjoyning, which may have benefit of inclosed marshes, or losse by such inundation, to be contributory to the making up of the Sea walls; and this is done by a Jury: But this charge cannot bee laid upon a County or Towne in generall, but particular men that have benefit or losse, or may have

               </note> When eminent danger and cause of defence is, there must bee defence made by every man (when the King shall command) with his person; and in such a case every man, as it is said in the Presidents, is bound <hi>per se &amp; sua</hi> to defend the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: And I thinke no man will bee so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, but that he will <hi>exponere se &amp; sua</hi> for the defence of the Kingdome, when there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for otherwise hee is in danger to lose <hi>se &amp; sua</hi>: But to lay a charge in generall upon a Kingdome, either for making or preparing of ships, or money in lieu thereof, is not to bee done but by Parliament, when the charge is to be borne in generall of all the Subjects.</p>
            <p>To prove further, that no man may have his goods taken from him but by his consent, appeareth by a Record in <hi>Mich.</hi> 14. <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. <hi>Rot.</hi> 60. in the Kings Bench in a Writ of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, brought upon a Judgement given in Durham, where, in an action of trespasse by <hi>William Heyborne</hi> against <hi>William Keylow,</hi> for
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59856:47"/>
entring his house, and breaking his Chest, and taking away 70. pounds in money, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant pleading not guilty, the Jury found a speciall verdict, That the Scots having entred the Bishoprick with an Army into Durham, and making great burning and spoiles, the Comminalty of Durham met together at Durham, whereof the Plaintiffe was one, and agreed to send some to compound with them for mony to depart, and were all sworn to performe what composition should bee made, and to performe what ordinance they should make in that behalfe: And thereupon they compounded with the Scots for 1600. Markes. But because that was to bee paid immediately, they all consented, that <hi>William K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ylow</hi> the Defendant, and others, should goe into every mans house to search what ready money was there, and to take it for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of that summe, and that it should bee repaid by the Comminalty of Durham: And thereupon the Defendant did enter into the Plaintiffes house, and did breake open the Chest, and tooke the 70. pounds, which was paid accordingly towards that fine. The
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59856:47"/>
Jury were demanded whether the Plaintiffe was present, and did consent to the taking of the money; they said, No: Whereupon the Plaintiffe had judgement to recover the said 70. pounds, &amp; dammages; for that otherwise hee had no remedy for his money so taken, and the Defendant committed in execution for the same: And thereupon the Defendant <hi>Keylow</hi> brought a Writ of errour in the Kings Bench, and assigned his errours in point of judgement, and there the judgement was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed:</p>
            <p>Because the Plaintiffe <hi>Heyborne</hi> had his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> remedy against the Comminalty of Durham for his money.</p>
            <p>Because hee himselfe had agreed to this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and was sworn to performe it; and that the Defendant did nothing but that hee assented unto by his oath: and therefore is accompted to do nothing but by his consent, and as a servant unto him; therefore hee was no trespasser: And therefore the judgement given in Durham was reversed, because hee had assented to that ordinance; though hee was afterwards unwilling, yet having once
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59856:48"/>
consented, his goods were lawfully taken: By which it appeareth, that if hee had not particularly consented, such an ordinance could not have been good to bind him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this was in a case of great danger, and for defence.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>pars</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">2</hi>. the Parliament Roll proved this directly: although it be no Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet the Record is much to be regarded; for it sheweth what the Law was then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be: For, <hi>Scroope</hi> the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour then shewed to all the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons assembled in Parliament, that all the Lords and Sages had met together since the last Parliament, and having considered of the great danger the Kingdome was in, and how money might be raised in a case of eminent danger, which could not stay the delay of a Parliament, and the Kings Coffers had not sufficient therein; the Record is, That they all agreed, that money sufficient could not bee had without laying a charge upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minalty; which (say they) cannot bee done without a Parliament: And the Lords them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for the time did supply the said neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59856:48"/>
with mony they lent: which Record pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved directly, that this charge, without an Act of Parliament, is illegall.</p>
            <p>So upon this reason I conclude, That this Writ compulsarily to charge the Subjects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their wills, is not warranted by any Bookes, and therefore illegall.</p>
            <p>If this Writ should bee allowed, great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> would ensue, which the Law alwaies will avoid, and not permit any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences.</p>
            <p>That if such a charge may be laid upon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Counties by Writ, without assent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then no man knoweth what his charge may bee; for they may bee charged as often as the King pleaseth, and with making as many ships, and of what burthen, and with what charge of munition, victualls, and men, as shall be set downe: Wherein I doubt not, but if the Law were so, the King, being a very pious and just King, would use his power very moderately; but Judges in their judgements are not to looke to present times, but to all future times, what may follow upon their judgements.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:59856:49"/>That this inconvenience may bee, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the Dane-geld, first appointed in time of necessity to redeeme them from the cruelty of the Danes, which often changed, and still increased: for <hi>in Anno Dom.</hi> 991. when it began, it was 10000. pounds, <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 994. it was increased to 16000. pounds; and <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1002. it was increased to 24000. pounds; and <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1007. it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased to 36000. pounds; and <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1012. it was increased to 48000. pounds: So if this Writ bee well awarded, it may bee at pleasure what bounds it shall have.</p>
            <p>Also there were never but one single Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidy, and two Fifteenes used to be granted in Parliament, untill 31. <hi>Elis.</hi> and then a double Subsidy and foure Fifteenes were granted, Sir <hi>Walter Mildmay</hi> then Chancellour of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer moving for it, and saying, his heart did quake to move it, not knowing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences that should grow upon it; but shewed great reasons for so moving of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediatly after the Spanish invasion: &amp; so it was granted. Afterwards <hi>in</hi> 35. <hi>Elis.</hi> tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Subsidies, and sixe Fifteenes were granted:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59856:49"/>
and <hi>in</hi> 43. <hi>Elis.</hi> foure Subsidies and eight Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenes; and yet these were not accompted grievous, neither would it have been, if it had been 10. Subsidies, because in Parliament, and convenient times and meanes appointed for the levying of them.</p>
            <p>Tonnage and Poundage were granted to this end, 13. <hi>R.</hi> 2. (and have continued ever since by severall grants) that the King might have monies in his purse against time of need for extraordinary occasions; especially for the defence of the Realme, and for guarding the Seas, as it is especially declared by the Statute of 1. <hi>Iac.</hi> and former Statutes.</p>
            <p>But it is said,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note> that Tonnage and Poundage is not granted now to the King; Therefore the King is inforced to take these extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courses.</p>
            <p>Though it be not granted,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sol.</hi>
               </note> yet I thinke it is taken; and I doubt not but to the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and for the same purpose for which it was first granted, which was for the defence of the Kingdome, and the guard of the Seas.</p>
            <p>Therefore in case of danger and necessity, every Subject, for defence of the Kingdome,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59856:50"/>
is bound <hi>Ligeanciae debito,</hi> as some Records say; and <hi>Ligeanciae suae vinculo astricti,</hi> as others speake: <hi>Se &amp; sua totis viribus et potestate expone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, &amp;c.</hi> And in such a case the King may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the persons of his Subjects, and arrest their ships to wait on his, to defend the Sea; Yet this also (when they goe out of their Counties) at the Kings charges; But to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Subjects by Writ to build new ships, or to prepare ships at their charges, or to lay a common charge on the Subjects in generall, for matter of defence or avoidance of danger, is not warrantable by the Common Law.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Another inconvenience is, That it is left in the power of the Sheriffe to charge any mans estate at his pleasure, taxing some, and sparing others, as his affection leadeth him. And sometimes by colour thereof, levying more then he need, and enriching himselfe; which power the Law never alloweth him, although it were in lesse matters; as to make an assesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the breach of the Sea walls, but to doe it by a Jury, and not himselfe alone.</p>
            <p>So for these reasons I conclude this Writ is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59856:50"/>
against the Common law, and so illegall.</p>
            <p>For the second point, I conceive, if the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Common law were doubtfull in this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such a charge might be imposed by Writ, yet now it is made cleare by divers expresse Statutes, that the King is not to lay any charge upon his Subjects, but by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in Parliament: and that is by many Acts of Parliament in force, and not repealed. And there is no doubt but the Kings by Statute may bind them and their Successours not to lay any such charge, every King being bound by oath to performe the Statu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

set &amp; dispended upon the maintenance of the safeguard of this Realme of England, and of our warres of Scotland, France, and Gascoin, and in no place elsewhere during our said warres.</p>
            <p>By this statute it appeareth, that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly provided, That the subjects should not be from thenceforth charged nor grieved to make any aide, nor sustaine any charge, but by common assent, and that in Parliament; which is as expresse as may be, and exclusive to any charge otherwise; which I conceive was made against the appointment of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or preparing, and sending of ships at the charges of the Townes whence they were, or sending men out of their Counties at the charges of the County.</p>
            <p>Now, where it is alledged by my brother <hi>Weston,</hi> and my brother <hi>Berkley,</hi> that this was but a temporary statute, and ended when his warres ended, which appeareth by the last clause, for employment of those profits of his Wards, &amp;c. towards those warres: I conceive it appeareth to bee an absolute and perpetuall statute; for, it is granted for him and his

That none shall be compelled to make any loanes to the King, because such loanes were against reason, and the franchise of the land: And by another statute, That none shall be charged by any impositions, called a <hi>Benevolence</hi>: By which statutes, and other the statutes of this Realme, your Subjects have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited this freedome, That they shall not bee compelled to contribute to any taxe, tallage, aide, nor other like charge not set by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And then they pray, that none hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bee compelled to make or yeeld any gift, loane, benevolence, taxe, or such like charge, without common consent by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

            <p>By reason of all which statutes, especially of those of 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. 34. <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. and 14. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. being in the negative and in force, I conceive that those Writs, to lay such a charge, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law, and so the assessement by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour thereof not lawfull.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note> whereas the precedent Arguments have been, that the Kingdome being in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, therefore these Writs went forth for the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59856:59"/>
making of ships, because there could not bee so suddenly any Parliament called: And the Parliament is a slow body; and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may be lost, whilest there is consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And the danger is conceived to bee very great, because the first Writ of 4. <hi>Augusti</hi> so mentioneth, that the Pirates provide a great Navie to infest the Kingdome, and it is fit with speed to provide a remedy; and that the Writ of <hi>mittimus</hi> mentioneth, that <hi>Salus Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicae periclitabatur</hi>: And wee must beleeve these suggestions to bee true; for the Kings Certificate by this Writ is, <hi>Recordum superlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum,</hi> as Master Sollicitor and my brother <hi>Berkley</hi> termed it; and we must leave it upon the Kings conscience (if it be not true) to lay such a charge upon an untrue suggestion: and the Defendant also by his Demurrer hath confessed all the suggestions in the Writ to be true; therefore it must bee conceived, that the Kingdome was in great danger, and present remedy must be had by making these ships, and may be commanded by those Writs, and not to stay for a Parliament: And my brother <hi>Crawley</hi> said, It may bee, that if a Parliament
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59856:59"/>
were called, they will not yeeld to the going forth of such Writs, although the Kingdome were never so much in danger: And this charge, in respect of the making of defence, is not within the intention of these statutes; and if it had bin expresly mentioned within a sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, that such a charge should not bee impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, it had been a void statute, and contrary to the Law, that the Kingdome should not bee defended.</p>
            <p>To all these I answer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1.</note> That the matter now in question is upon the Writ of 4. <hi>Augusti,</hi> whether that bee legall, or not; and the sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions therein bee sufficient or not for the Writ of <hi>Mittimus,</hi> mentioning, that <hi>Salue Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicae periclitabatur,</hi> at the day of issuing forth of the Writ of 4. <hi>Augusti</hi> (which is a year and a halfe after the first Writ) doth not help it. And this is not notified to the Sheriffe and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the County, to make them the more carefull, and in the greater contempt, if a ship were not provided: but it is onely a notifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Barons of the Exchequer, that the same was the reason why the same Writ issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> That the suggestions are not absolute, that any such danger was, or such Navie was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by the Pirates, but onely mentioneth, <hi>Quia datum est nobis intelligi,</hi> that the Pirates had done such mischiefe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> If such suggestions had been absolutely set downe, yet wee are not alwaies bound abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to beleeve them, because many times untrue suggestions are made in Writs and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; and yet it doth not lye upon the Kings conscience, neither doth the Law impute any fault to the King, if any such be; for the Law doth alwaies conceive honourably of the King, that hee cannot, nor will not signifie any untruth under his great Seale; but is abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed therein, and the Law imputeth it to them that so mis-informed the King, and thrust in such suggestions into the Writ: and therefore all Patents grounded upon untrue suggestions are accounted void.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> That the Demurrer confesseth nothing but that which is legally and well set downe; but if it bee illegall, the Demurrer confesseth it not, but is well offered for that cause.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> If the Kingdome were in danger, yet a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59856:60"/>
charge must not bee laid in generall upon the Subjects, without their consent in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for either the danger is neere, and then present provision must be made by mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and the present ships of the Kingdome, which the King may command from all parts of his Kingdome, as need shall require; but cannot command money out of mens purses, by distraining their goods, or impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning their persons: But if the danger bee further off, by reason of any forraine combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations (as it is conceived it may be here) then provision must bee made of ships by all the Kingdome for defence; then (as <hi>Philip de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> saith, <hi>fol.</hi> 179.) that cloud is seene afarre off, before that the tempest fall, especially by a forraine war; and such invasions cannot fall so soone, but that the King may call his Sages together, and by consent make provision for such defence.</p>
            <p>So I say here, if there be time to make ships, or prepare ships at the charges of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; then is there time enough for his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie (if hee please) to call his Parliament, to charge his Commons by consent in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59856:61"/>
to have a subsidiary aide, as alwaies hath been done in such cases; and they are not so long coming or meeting, when they come but to make provision for defence, being for all their safeties.</p>

               <hi>fol.</hi> 8. setting downe, that the Law doth vest the absolute property of every mans goods in himselfe, and that they cannot be taken from him, but by his consent, saith, That is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, if they be taken from him, the party shall answer the full value thereof in dammages: And sure I conceive, that the party that doth this wrong to another, shall, besides the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages to the party, bee imprisoned, and pay a fine to the King, which in the Kings Bench is the tenth part of as much as hee payeth to the party: So then, if the King will punish the wrong of taking of goods without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent betweene party and party, much more will hee not by any Prerogative take away
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59856:65"/>
any mans goods without his assent, particular or generall.</p>
            <p>So I conclude, that I conceive there is not any such Prerogative, to award such Writs, to command men to sustaine such charge, or to be contributory to it, and to bee distrained or imprisoned for not payment thereof.</p>
            <p>Also I conceive, that this is not an Act of Royall power; for if it bee illegall to impose such a charge, then is it not accounted as a matter of Royall power, but as a matter done upon an untrue suggestion, and a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of wrong done; and wrong is not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the King, for hee can doe no wrong, but it is imputed unto them who advised him to this course.</p>
            <p>Royall power, I account, is to bee used in cases of necessity and imminent danger, when ordinary courses will not availe; for it is a Rule, <hi>Non recurrendum est ad extraordinaria, quando fieri potest per ordinaria</hi>; as in cases of Rebellion, sudden Invasion, and in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther case, where Martiall Law may bee used, and may not stay for legall proceedings; but

            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1588. when the great invasion was by the Navie termed the Invincible Navie, which was fore-seene long before, this course of preparing ships by every County of the Kingdome was not taken or appointed; yet in all these times, when there appeared such danger of invasions, there never went any such Writs into any the Counties of England to provide ships, but the Navie of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the Army of England was alwaies accounted sufficient for the defence of the Kingdome: So I conclude this point, that I conceive this course cannot bee taken by any Prerogative or Royall power, nor any allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of necessity or danger.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> For the fourth point, I conceive, that if it

were legall to lay such a charge upon mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine parts, yet to charge any Inland County with making of ships, and furnishing them with Masters, Mariners, and Souldiers at their charge, which are farre remote from the Seas, is not legall, nor warranted by any former President; for it commandeth an unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and impossible thing: and then the Writ commanding such a thing as is unreasonable and not possible for the parties commanded of themselves to performe, without help of other Counties, is alwaies illegall; for it is a Rule, That <hi>Lex non cogit ad impossibilia</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if one by Covenant bind himselfe to doe a thing impossible, the Covenant is void. This appears by the Book case in 40. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>fo.</hi> 6. where the Case is expresly, That if a man do covenant to doe a thing that is impossible, the Covenant is void, and the deed is void in that respect: Also the Book in 2. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 2. If a feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bee made upon condition to bee void if the feoffee do not a thing which is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, this feoffment is good and the condition void, for it was the fault of the feoffor to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexe such a condition; &amp; this appeareth by the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59856:69"/>
case of an Arbitrement, If the Arbitrator a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that one shall enter into bond with such a one as his surety to pay a summe of money, or to doe any other act, it is void as to the finding of a surety at the least; for it is not in his power to compell him to bee his surety, therefore the Law accounteth it unreasonable, and so void; and this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the Booke Case, 17. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 5. wherein it is so resolved.</p>
            <p>So this Writ commanding the Sheriffe and Inhabitants of an Inland County to find a ship furnished with Masters and Mariners, whereas there is not any Shipwright that hath skill to make ships, nor any Masters or Mariners ever there inhabiting to guide a ship; (for they are still conversant about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Plough, and feeding Cattell, and Husbandry, and are trained up by musters for skill of Armes to defend the Countries, and not with Sea affaires; for most of the County never saw a ship, nor know what belongeth to Masters or Mariners of ships; and the Country is not bound to seeke men out of the County for such men, and perhaps

if they should, they cannot know where to hire them:) Therefore when such Writs to Inland Counties have been awarded to find a ship with Masters and Mariners, it being conceived by mis-information that they were maritine Townes, and had Ships and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners dwelling with them, the truth thereof being made to appeare to the contrary, they have been discharged, as appeares by a Record in 13. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>pars</hi> 2. <hi>m.</hi> 14. where a Writ went to the Admirall of the Fleet, Those parts upon complaint to the King, by the men of Bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min in the County of Cornwall, that they were unjustly charged to find a ship with Masters and Mariners, whereas that Towne was no Port Towne, nor adjoyning to the Sea, but farre within the Land, nor ever had ships lying there, nor Mariners, nor Sea-men, nor ever used to find any such for Sea service; and that their Maior and Officers were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned for not finding such a ship; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the King appointed to have it enquired, whether their allegations were true, and if it were true, signified that hee would not have them so unjustly charged, but that they
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59856:70"/>
should bee discharged thereof: which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that it was then accounted unjust to lay such a charge upon a Towne that was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Town, and had no Mariners inhabiting in it, much more when such a charge is upon an Inland County, which is much further remote from the Sea, and cannot performe by themselves that which the Writ comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</p>

               </note>But this Record being objected by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants Councell, Master Sollicitor gave an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that the same was because the Admirall of his owne authority had charged them, which was not according to his Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for he was onely to charge the Ports and Sea Townes; but that the same may not bee done by the Kings Writ, the Record doth not prove.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sol.</hi>
               </note>But to this I answer, That I conceive it is all one when such a charge is laid upon a Towne by Writ, which is an Inland Town; for so it appeareth by another Record of the same yeare, <hi>viz.</hi> 13. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>pars</hi> 1. <hi>m.</hi> 14. where a Writ was directed to the Admirall of the Fleet, <hi>Ab ore Thamesiae versus partes Occidentales,</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:59856:70"/>
reciting where the King by his Writ to the Towne of Chichester had commanded the Maior and Comminalty there, that they should make <hi>unam Navem, &amp; duos Escularios de guerra parari,</hi> with Mariners and men at armes to bee at Portsmouth such a day, to goe with the Kings ships; and that they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that they had not, nor ever had any ships arriving in that Towne, nor had any Sea-men or Mariners dwelling there; and that it appeared unto the King by Inquisition of a Jury returned into his Chancery, this allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bee true; therefore because the King would not have them <hi>indebitè praegravari</hi> (for so bee the words of the Record) the King commandeth the Admirall, that they shall not be troubled nor distrained for not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of such service; whereby it appeareth, that if they, being within few miles of the Sea, should not bee charged to find such a ship, much more Inland Counties, which are much further remote from the Seas, are not justly to bee charged with finding any Ships and Mariners: Therefore I conclude this point, That I conceive this Writ, in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59856:71"/>
is not legall not warranted by any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer President.</p>
            <p>The fifth and great point hath beene (and indeed the chiefe Argument hath been a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Records and Presidents which have been cited, that should warrant these Writs, and) that the King hath done nothing, but what his former Progenitors have done, and have lawfully done; and that hee doth now but <hi>more Majorum,</hi> and that which alwaies in ancient times hath beene done and allowed: and therefore ought now to be allowed.</p>
            <p>I confesse this allegation much troubled mee, when I heard those Records cited, and so learnedly and earnestly pressed by Master Sollicitor, and after by Master Atturney, to bee so cleare, that they might not bee gain-said, but that they proved a cleare Prerogative, or at least a Royall power, that the King might do so, especially when my brother <hi>Weston</hi> and my brother <hi>Berkley,</hi> who had seene the Records, pressed them, and relyed upon them for the reasons of their judgements, I say, I was much doubtfull thereupon, untill I had perused all those Records sent me by the Kings Councel,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59856:71"/>
and satisfied my judgement therein.</p>
            <p>But now I answer, That if there were any such Presidents (as I shall shew that there is not one shewed to mee to prove this Writ to be usuall) yet it were not materiall, for now we are not to argue what hath beene done <hi>de facto,</hi> for many things have been done which were never allowed; but our question is, What hath beene done and may bee done <hi>de jure</hi>: And then, as it is said in <hi>Cok. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 33. in <hi>Mittons</hi> Case, <hi>Iudicand' est legibus, non exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plis</hi>: and <hi>lib.</hi> 11. <hi>fol.</hi> 75. in Magdalen Colledge Case it is said, <hi>Multitudo errantium non parit errori patrocinium:</hi> and <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 94. in <hi>Slades</hi> Case, Multitude of Presidents, unlesse they bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Judiciall proceedings in Courts of Record are not to be regarded; and none of these were ever confirmed by Judiciall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, but complained of.</p>
            <p>But to give a more cleare answer unto them, I say, That in my opinion, upon view and serious reading of all the Records that have beene sent mee on the Kings part (for I have read them all over <hi>verbatim</hi>) and I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume they sent all that were conceived to bee
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59856:72"/>
materiall, and I having taken notes of every one of them, and diligently considered of them, I conceive there is not any President or Record of any Writ which maintaines this Case; for there is not any President or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of any such Writ sent to any Sheriffe of any Inland County, or Maritine County, to command the making of ships at the charge of the County, but this is the first President that ever was since the Conquest that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in this kind; but it is true, that before 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. there have been some Writs to Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Townes and Ports, and other Townes, as London, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Where they have had ships, and Mariners to provide and prepare ships, and to send them to places where the King pleased to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point upon any just cause of feare of any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for defence; and great reason that they having ships, and Masters of ships, and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, should bee at the Kings command to bring all, or as many as hee pleaseth, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Sea and Kingdome, being those that had the most benefit of the Seas, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have the losse, if the Seas and Coasts
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59856:72"/>
were not duely guarded, and those were most commonly appointed to bee at the Kings charge; but sometimes, upon some necessity, they were appointed to be at the charge of the townes and parts adjoyning, which I thinke was the true cause of the complaint in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in 25. <hi>E.</hi> 1. and the making of that statute for staying that course; for there is no Record afterwards of any such Writ in King <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. his time, after that statute to Maritine townes, to prepare or send ships at the charge of the townes, and none after, untill the time of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the third, and then the warres being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and the French King, <hi>in Annis</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. were the most Writs awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Maritine townes, to send ships at their charge sufficiently furnished; and those I thinke were the principall cause of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the statute of 14. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. and after that statute no such Writs, nor any Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions for that purpose were awarded to make any ships at the charge of Maritine townes, untill 1. <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. <hi>m.</hi> 18. when Writs were awarded to many Maritine townes, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land townes, for the making of ships, which
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59856:73"/>
Record was much pressed by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Atturny, &amp; afterwards by my brother <hi>Weston,</hi> &amp; my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Berkley</hi> to prove that this course was and might be practised after the stat. of 14. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. for sending forth such Writs, &amp; allowed; but that Record is fully satisfied: for it was grounded upon an ordinance in Parliament, in 1. <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. <hi>m.</hi> 52. that all ancient Cities, Burroughes, and Townes, that would have their liberties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, should have them confirmed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any charge of fine, save onely to make a ship of warre for defence of the Realme; so this was not compulsary to any, but volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to those that would have their liberties confirmed: And afterwards in 1. <hi>H.</hi> 4. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions were awarded for the making of such Vessels for warre; but those issuing forth, without any ordinance in Parliament, were complained of in Parliament, 2. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>m.</hi> 22. as to be against the liberty of the Subject, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the Statute before recited, and the Commissions expresly repealed: And since that time of 2. <hi>Henr.</hi> 4. no such Writs issued forth in any age to any Maritine Towne, to cause ships, or prepare ships at their owne
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59856:73"/>
charge for the Kings service, untill these late Writs.</p>
            <p>And now I shall take a short view of all the Records that have been cited, and sent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee; and leave them to the judgement of my Lords and others, if any of them prove these Writs to be usuall and legall.</p>

Sollicitor and M.

               <p>All which Records and Statutes do prove, that the souldiers should be at the Kings wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; therefore this command for souldiers wages for 26. weekes when they goe from Portsmouth, is illegall, and expresly against the said Statutes: and so the assessment being entire, as well for the wages as the other charges, I hold to bee clearly illegall, and not to be demanded.</p>

Sheriffe to assesse men at his owne discretion, is not legall, nor warranted by the Presidents; for the Presidents are commonly that assesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for contribution for making or setting out of ships, have been by Commissioners, which by presumption had knowledge of such matters as commonly Sheriffes have not. Also this leaveth to the Sheriffe too great a power to value mens estates, as to inhaunce whom he will, &amp; to favour whom he will.</p>
               <p>That the power to the Sheriffes &amp; Maiors <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of townes, &amp;c. to imprison, especially as it is used for <hi>non</hi>-payment of the mony, is illegall, and expresly against divers Statutes; for it is provided by <hi>Magna Charta, c.</hi> 29. <hi>Quòd nullus ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatur vel imprisonetur, nec super eum ibimus nisi per judicium Parium suor' vel per legem terrae.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The last clause of this Writ is, That by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of this Writ more should not be gathered then will be sufficient for the necessary expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the premisses; and that none that levie any mony towards these contributions, shall detaine the same with them, or imploy the same to other uses: and that if more then did suffice were collected, it should bee paid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those that paid, after a rateable propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59856:87"/>
These are reasonable clauses; but as the course is taken, it is not to be performed: for no ship, nor tackling, nor munition, nor men, nor wages, nor victuals being provided, it is not to be known whether more be gathered or lesse then would suffice; and there being mony gathered, it is of necessity either detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Collector or Sheriffe, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to other uses then are appointed by the Writ, so the writ is not performed; and the money assessed and collected, is not duely made nor collected, and the mony assessed and unpaid, cannot be duely demanded.</p>
               <p>Admitting that the Writ were legall, &amp; the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> commands therein legall, yet the assessment, as it is certified, is not sufficient to charge the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant; for it is not certified that any ship with munition &amp; men, and wages for men, and victuals, were prepared, and this is a yeare after the time that it should have beene prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red &amp; sent to Portsmouth; and if it were not prepared, there is no cause to charge the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant: and that not appearing to be done, it shal be conceived not to be done; for if a man be charged with mony in consideration of a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59856:88"/>
thing to be done before a certaine time, if the thing be not performed according to the time, none can bee charged for not being contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to it after the time is past; for it is in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a condition precedent, to have a duty or summe of mony to be paid after the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion performed, and there he that will have the duty, must shew that the condition is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: This appeareth in the case of 15. <hi>H.</hi> 7.1. <hi>&amp; Cok l.</hi> 7. <hi>fo.</hi> 9. <hi>Ughtrees</hi> case. And if the ship be not prepared according to the Writ, nor mony imployed for preparing a ship, for and in the name of the county, then every one that paid any mony, either voluntarily, as in obedience to the Writ, or compulsorily upon distresse, may demand their mony again of the Sheriffe, or of them that received it; for as they paid their mony, so it must be disposed of, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be disposed of otherwise by any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand whatsoever, although it be under the great Seale; for the command being under the great S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59856:89"/>
and the other was found that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the mony, and went not to doe the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, nor restored the armes nor mony; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was committed to the prison, &amp; paid to the King a fine, and found sureties to pay the mony to the Hundred again, from whom he had received it.</p>
               <p>The other was Hill. 20. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>rot.</hi> 57. in the Kings Bench, where two high Constables were indicted for that they 8. <hi>E.</hi> 3. had received 6.
