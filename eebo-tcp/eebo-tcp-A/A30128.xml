            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving formerly writ some
small matter, touching the
<hi>Doctrine of Faith;</hi> as
<hi>Justification by Grace
through the Faith of Christs Blood,</hi>
&amp;c. I do here, as the second to that
Doctrine, present thee with a few lines,
touching <hi>Good Works,</hi> that I might,
as at first I shewed thee the <hi>Good</hi> and
<hi>Glory</hi> of the one, so now shew thee the
<hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Excellency</hi> of the other:


<pb facs="tcp:41368:4"/>
For though we are justified, <hi>Rom. 3.
24,</hi> &amp;c. freely by Grace through Christ
before God; <hi>yet</hi> we are justified before
Men, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 18. by our Works: Nay,
a life of Holiness flowing from Faith
in us that are saved by Grace, it doth
justifie that Grace before the World
that justifies us before God, 2 <hi>Cor. 6.
1, 3. 2 Cor. 9. 12, 13, 1 Pet. 2.
11,</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>I have not here only in general trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of this Doctrine of <hi>Good Works,</hi>
but particularly (after some discourse
about Works flowing from Faith, and
what makes it truly and gospelly Good)
I discourse of them as we stand under
our several relations in this World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As first,</hi> The Duty of the Master
of a Family: Of the Husband to
his Wife; and of hers to him: Of
the Duty of Parents to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;


<pb facs="tcp:41368:4"/>
and of Children to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents:
Of Masters also to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
and of the Servant again to
his Master; <hi>with a brief touch upon</hi>
Good Neighbourhood; <hi>and a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of</hi> Covetousness, Pride and
Uncleanness, <hi>which are great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
to a truly Gospel-Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know there are many that have
treated of <hi>Good Works</hi> in large
and learned Discourses, but, I doubt,
all have not so <hi>Gospelized</hi> their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
as become them, and as the
<hi>Doctrine of the Grace of God</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
for. However, I thoughtit my
duty to add this discourse to all that
are past; and that for these Reasons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> to take away those Aspersions
that the Adversaries cast upon our
Doctrine <hi>(Rom.</hi> 3. 8. as also in the
dayes of <hi>Paul)</hi> that because we preach


<pb facs="tcp:41368:5"/>
               <hi>Justification</hi> without the Works of the
Law; therefore they pretend we plead
for loosness of life, <hi>whose damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
just.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because though there be
much discourse about Works in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
yet a particular Discourse of
them, as afore is touched, is too much
neglected, and by this means every
one too much left at uncertainties (as
from them) of their several works un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their particular Relations, which
I think is one reason of that disorder
in Families and Places, where God's
People live, to their shame, and the
dishonour of their God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Because these few Books
that do particularly treat thus of
<hi>Good Works,</hi> are, I think, now so
scarce, or so big, that but few have them,
and few buy them, if they may be had,
especially our new Converts; for whose


<pb facs="tcp:41368:5"/>
sakes principally this short Discourse
is intended: and indeed this is one
reason of my brevity, that the price
might neither be burdensome, nor the
reading long and tedious: <hi>Multitude
of words drown the Memory;</hi> and
an Exhortation <hi>in few words,</hi> may
yet be so full, that the Reader may find
that in the side of a sheet, which some
are forced to hunt for in a whole Quire,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Lord teach us this Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I have written this
Book, to shew that I bear a fellow-Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
and Witness (with all that know
God) of the Operation that Grace
hath, and will have in the heart that
hath savingly received it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> I have thus written, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is amiable, <hi>and pleasant to
God, when Christians</hi> keep their
<hi>Rank, Relation</hi> and <hi>Station,</hi> doing


<pb facs="tcp:41368:6"/>
all as become their Quality &amp; Calling.
When Christians stand every <hi>one in</hi>
their places, and do the work of their
<hi>Relations,</hi> then they are like the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in the Garden, <hi>that stand and</hi> grow
where the Gardner hath <hi>planted them,</hi>
and then they shall both honour the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in which they are planted, and the
Gardner that hath so disposed of them:
From the Hysop on the Wall, to the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar
in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> their <hi>Fruit</hi> is their
glory. And seeing the stock into which
we are planted, is the fruitfullest stock;
the sap conveyed thereout the fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
sap, and the dresser of our souls,
the wisest Husbandman, <hi>John</hi> 15. 1.
How contrary to nature, to example,
and expectation should we be, if we
should not be <hi>rich</hi> in <hi>Good Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore take heed of being paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
fire, wherein is no warmth, and
painted flowers, which retain no smell,

of the Spirit) to shew them the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their being by Grace made Heirs of
<hi>Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Scripture therefore I do ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these things observable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That Good Works do flow from
Faith. <hi>Yea,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That every one that believeth
should be careful that their Works be Good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That every Believer should not
only be careful that their Works be good, and
for the present do them, but should also be
careful to maintain them; that is, They
should carefully study to keep in a constant
course of Good Works.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And lastly,</hi> That the best way to provoke
both our selves and others to this Work. It
is to be often affirming to others, the Doctrine
of Justification by Grace, and to believe it
our selves. <hi>This is a faithful Saying; and
these things I will,</hi> saith Paul, <hi>that thou
affirm constantly, that they who have
believed in God, might be careful to
maintain Good Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the first.</p>
            <p>That Good Works do flow from Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:41368:8"/>
This is evident divers wayes. First,
from the impossibility of their flowing
from any other thing; they must either
flow from Faith, or not at all: <hi>For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is not of Faith, is sin.</hi> And again;
<hi>without Faith it is impossible to please Him,</hi>
(Rom. 14. 23. Heb. 11. 6.) Every
man by nature, before Faith, is an evil
and a corrupt tree: <hi>And a corrupt tree
cannot bring forth good fruit. Do men ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</hi>
(Mat. 7. 16, 17.) Now a man is made
good by Faith, and by that bringeth forth
the Fruits that are acceptable to God,
<hi>(Heb. 11. 4. Col. 1. 4, 5, 6.)</hi> Wherefore
sinners before faith, are compared to the
Wilderness, whose fruits are briers and
thornes; and whose hearts are the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
of Dragons; that is, of Devils,
<hi>(Isa. 35. 6, 7. Heb. 6. 7, 8.)</hi> And hence
again it is, that they are said to be <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
Christless, Spiritless, Faithless, Hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less;</hi>
without the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Strength;</hi> enemies in their minds by
wicked works, and possessed by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of wickedness, as a Castle by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41368:9"/>
               <hi>Ephes. 2. 12. Jude 19. 2 Thes.
3. 2. Col. 1. 21. Luke</hi> 11. 21.</p>
            <p>Now these things being thus, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that all the men under heaven,
that are unconverted, should be able to
bring forth one work rightly good; even
as impossible, as for all the Briers and
Thrones under Heaven, to bring forth
one cluster of Grapes, or one bunch of
Figs; for indeed they want the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
A Thorn bringeth not forth Figs,
because it wanteth the nature of the Fig-tree;
and so doth the Bramble the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Vine. <hi>Good Works</hi> must come
from a good heart.</p>
            <p>Now, this the unbeliever wanteth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he wanteth <hi>Faith; For 'tis that
which purifieth the heart</hi> (Luk. 6. 45. Acts
15. 9.) <hi>Good Works</hi> must come from
love to the Lord Jesus; but this
the unbeliever wanteth also; <hi>Because he
wanteth Faith: for Faith worketh by love,
and by that means doth good,</hi> as Gal. 5. 6.</p>
            <p>And hence again it is, That though
the carnal man doth never so much which
he calleth good, yet it is rejected, sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41368:9"/>
and turned as dirt in his face again;
his prayers are abominable, his plowing
is sin, and all his righteousness as
menstruous rags <hi>(Prov. 15. 8. Prov. 21.
4. Isa. 60. 4.)</hi> Thus you see, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Faith there is no <hi>Good Works.</hi> Now
then to shew you that they flow from
Faith. And that,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For that Faith is a principle of Life by
which a Christian lives</hi> (Gal. 2. 20, 21.)
<hi>a principle of Motion by which it walks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Heaven in the Way of Holiness,</hi>
(Rom. 4. 12. 2 Cor. 5. 7.) It is also a
principle of <hi>strength,</hi> by which the soul
opposeth its lust, the Devil and this
World, and over-comes them; <hi>This is
your victory, even your Faith,</hi> (1 John 5.
4, 5.) Faith in the heart of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
is like the Salt that was thrown into
the corrupt Fountain, that made the
naughty waters good, and the Land fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>(2 Kings 2. 19, 20, 21.)</hi> Faith,
when it is wrought in the heart, it is like
leaven hid in the meal, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 33. or
like perfume, that lighteth upon stinking
leather, turning the smell of the leather


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41368:10"/>
the savour of the perfume; it being the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

inclination to holiness. Hence it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
that there followeth an alteration of the
life and conversation, and so bringeth
forth fruit accordingly. <hi>A good man ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth
forth good fruit,</hi> Luk. 6. 45. Which trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
I say, is this Faith <hi>(Jam. 2. 5. 1 Pet.
1. 7.)</hi> And therefore it is, that Faith is
called, <hi>The Faith according to Godliness,
and the most holy Faith, Tit. 1. 1. Jude
20.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Good Works <hi>must needs flow from</hi>
Faith, <hi>or no way; Because,</hi> that alone
carrieth in it an argument sufficiently preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to win upon our natures, to make them
comply with holiness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith</hi> sheweth us that God loveth us,
that he forgiveth us our sins, that he
counteth us for his Children, having free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
justified us through the Blood of his
Son, <hi>Rom. 3. 24, 25. Rom. 4. Heb. 11. 13.
1 Pet.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith</hi> receiveth the Promise, imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
it, and comforteth the Soul unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41368:10"/>
with it. <hi>Faith</hi> is so great an Artist
in arguing and reasoning with the soul,
that it will bring over the hardest heart
that it hath to deal with: It will bring to
my remembrance at once, both my vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
against God, and his goodness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me; it will shew me, that though
I deserve not to breath in the Air, yet
that God will have me an Heir of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>Now, there is no argument greater
than this: this will make a man run tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
ten thousand difficulties to answer
God (though it never can) for the Grace
that he hath bestowed on it.</p>
            <p>Further, <hi>Faith</hi> will shew me how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishingly
this Love of God hath set
it self upon me: It will shew me, that
though <hi>Esan</hi> was <hi>Jacobs</hi> Brother, yet he
loved <hi>Jacob,</hi> Mal. 1. 2. that though there
were thousands more besids me that were
as good as me, yet I must be the man
that must be chosen.</p>
            <p>Now this, I say, is a marvellous argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and unspeakably prevaileth with
the sinner, as saith the Apostle, <hi>For the</hi>


               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:41368:11"/>
Love of Christ constrains us, because we th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

judge, That if one dyed for all, then are all
dead, and that he died for all, that they
which live (that is by Faith) should not
henceforth live unto themselves, but to Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
that died for them, and rose again, 2 <hi>Cor.
5.</hi> 14. Love, <hi>saith the Wise man,</hi> is
strong as Death; many waters cannot quench
Love, neither can the floods drown it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
If a man would give all the substance of his
house for Love, it would be utterly contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
<hi>Song. 8.</hi> 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Oh! when the broken dying condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
sinner, can but see, by Faith, the
Love of a tender-hearted Saviour;
and also see what he underwent to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it from under that Death, Guilt and
Hell that now he feels and fears, which
also it knoweth it hath most justly and
highly deserved: Then bless the Lord,
O my soul; and what shall I render unto

            <p>Thus is Faith a prevailing argument
to the sinner, whereby he is fetched off

            <p>And hence it is, that Gospel-obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is called the <hi>Obedience of Faith,</hi> as

to bring forth weeds, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 19.</p>
            <p>Now, to have a good Crop from such
ground, doth argue the fruitfulness of
the Seed: wherefore I conclude upon
these three things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That the Seed of Faith is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fruitful Seed, in that it will be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in so barren a soil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Faith is not beholding
to the heart, but the heart to it, for all
its fruitfulness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That therefore the way to be
a more fruitful Christian, it is to be
stronger in believing.</p>
            <p>Now for the second thing, to wit,
<hi>That every one that believeth should be
careful that their Works be Good.</hi> This
followeth from what went just before;
to wit, That the heart of a Christian is a
heart subject to bring forth weeds.</p>
            <p>There is Flesh as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> well as Spirit in the
best of Saints: and as the Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Grace
will be alwayes putting forth something
that is good, so the Flesh will be putting
forth continually that which is evil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:41368:15"/>
For the Flesh lusteth against the Spirit
as the Spirit against the Flesh, <hi>Gal. 5. 17.
Now, this considered, is the cause why
you find so often in the Scriptures so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
items &amp; cautions to the Christians to
look to their lives and conversations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
As,</hi> Keep thy heart with all diligence, <hi>Prov<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>All works are not good that seem to
be so: It is one thing for a mans wayes
to be right in his own eye; and another,
for them to be right in God's. Often
that which is in high estimation with
men, is abomination in the sight of God,

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It must be done, <hi>Willingly,
chearfully,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1. It must have the Word for its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>Zeal without knowledge, is like a met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Horse without eyes, or like a sword
in a mad-man's hand: and there is no
knowledge where there is not the Word;
<hi>For if they reject the Word of the Lord, and</hi>
act not by that, <hi>What Wisdom is in them?</hi>
saith the Prophet, <hi>Jer. 8. 9. Isa.</hi> 8. 20.
Wherefore see thou have the Word for
what thou dost.</p>
            <p>2. As there must be the Word for the
authorizing of what thou dost, so there
must be Faith, from which it must flow,
as I shewed you before: <hi>For whatever
is not of faith is sin: and without faith, it is
impossible to please God.</hi> Now I say, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Word there is no Faith; <hi>Rom.</hi>


               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:41368:17"/>
10. 17. As without Faith there is no
good, let mens pretences be what they
will.</p>
            <p>3. As it must have these two afore-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
so also it must have, first, right
Time, and secondly, right Place.</p>
            <p>1. It must be rightly timed: Every
work is not to be done at the same time,
every time not being convenient for
such a work: <hi>There is a time for all things;
and every thing is beautiful in its time, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
31.</hi> 11. There is a <hi>time</hi> to pray, a
<hi>time</hi> to hear; a <hi>time</hi> to read, a <hi>time</hi> to
confer; a <hi>time</hi> to meditate; a <hi>time</hi> to
do, and a <hi>time</hi> to suffer. Now, to be
hearing when we should be preaching,
and doing, that is, yeelding active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to that under which we ought to
suffer, is not good. Christ was very wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that both his doings and sufferings
were rightly timed, <hi>John 2.</hi> 3, 4. &amp; 13. 1,
2. and herein we ought to follow his
steps: To be at plow in the field, when I
should be hearing the Word, is not good;
and to be talking abroad, when I should
be instructing my family at home, is as


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41368:18"/>
bad. <hi>Who so keepeth the Commandment,
shall feel no evil thing: and a wise mans
heart discerneth both time and judgement,</hi>
Eccles. 8. 5. Good things mis-timed, are
fruitless, unprofitable, and vain.</p>
            <p>2. As things must have their right
time, so they must be rightly placed;
for the misplacing of any work, is as bad
as the mis-timing of it.</p>
            <p>When I say, things, if good, must be
rightly placed, I mean, we should not
give to any work more than the Word of
God alloweth it; neither should we give
it less: Mint, Anise, and Cummin, are
not so weighty matters, as <hi>Faith</hi> and the
<hi>Love</hi> of God, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 23. For a
Pastor to be exercising the office of a
Deacon instead of the office of a Pastor,
it is misplacing of works, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 2.
For <hi>Martha</hi> to be making outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for Christ, when she should have
sate at his feet to hear his Word, was
the mis-placing a work; and for her
sister to have done it at her request,
(though the thing in it self was good) had
been her sin also, <hi>Luke 10. 39, 40, 41,
42.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:41368:18"/>
Now, to prevent the misplacing of
<hi>Good Works,</hi> observe,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> They misplace them that set
them in the room of Christ, <hi>Rom. 10.
1,</hi> 2, 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They also misplace them
that make them co-partners with Him,
<hi>Rom. 9. 31, 32. Acts</hi> 15. 1.</p>
            <p>This is, <hi>setting up our posts by God's posts;
and man's righteousness by the righteousness
of Christ,</hi> Ezek. 43. 7, 8. these are said
to be teachers of the Law, not knowing
what they say, nor whereof they affirm,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They also misplace works,
who ascribe to a work of less moment,
that honour that belongeth to a work
more noble: and such are, 1. Those who
count the ceremonial part of an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
as good as the doctrine and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of it.</p>
            <p>2. Such who count the dictates and
impulses of a meer natural conscience,
as good, as high, and divine, as the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and movings of the Spirit of Christ.</p>
            <p>3. Those also who count it enough to

            <p>Further, There are three things that a
man should have in his eye in every work
he doth.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The honour of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 20.</p>
            <p>2. The edification of his Neighbour,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The expediency or inexpediency of
what I am to do,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 12. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
observe it, that the honour of God
is wrapped up in the edification of thy
neighbour; and the edification of thy
neighbour, in the expediency of what
thou dost.</p>
            <p>Again, if thou wouldst walk to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification
of thy neighbour, and so to
God's honour, in the midst of thy obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
Beware, 1. That thou in thy
words and carriages, dost so demean thy
self, that Christ in his precious benefits
may be with clearness spoken forth by
thee: and take heed, that thou dost not
enter into doubtful points with them that
are weak, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 1. but deal chiefly,
lovingly, and wisely with their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41368:20"/>
about those matters that tend to
their better establishment in the Faith of
their Justification, and deliverance from
Death and Hell. <hi>Comfort the feeble-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
confirm the weak,</hi> 1 Thes. 5. 14.</p>
            <p>2. If thou be stronger than thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
take heed that thou do not that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, that may offend his weak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
I mean, things that in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
may be lawful: <hi>All that is lawful
is not expedient; all that is lawful edifieth
not,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 12. Wherefore here is
thy wisdom and love, that thou in some
things deny thy self for thy brothers sake:
1 Cor. 8. 13. <hi>I will not eat meat while the
world standeth,</hi> saith Paul, <hi>lest I make my
Brother to offend.</hi> Wherefore have this
Faith to thy self before God, <hi>Rom. 14.
22.</hi> but if thou walk otherwise, know,
thou walkest not charitably, and so not
to edification, and so not to Christ's
honour, but dost sin against Christ, and
wound thy weak brother, for whom Christ
died, <hi>Rom. 14. 15. 1 Cor.</hi> 8. 12.</p>
            <p>But I say, all this while keep thy eye
upon the Word; take heed of going con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41368:20"/>
to that under any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

for without the Word, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

to God's glory, nor thy brothers
edification. Wherefore, <hi>walk wisely in a

you what are works <hi>rightly Good,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you in the Name of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus

as those that must be together with him
in Eternal happiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Thou oughtest so to carry thy
self to, and before her, as doth Christ,
to, and before his Church; as saith the
Apostle, <hi>So ought men to love their wives,
even as Christ loved the Church, and gave
himself for it,</hi> Ephes. 5. 25. When hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
behave themselves like husbands
indeed, then will they be not only hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
but such an Ordinance of God
to the wife, as will preach to her the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of Christ to his Spouse. <hi>There is
a sweet scent wrapped up in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of husbands and wives</hi> (Ephes. 5.
32.) <hi>that believe.</hi> The wife, I say, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
the Church, and the husband the
head and saviour thereof; Ephes. 5. 23.
<hi>For the husband is the head of the wife, even
a Christ is the head of the Church; and He
is the Saviour of the body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is one of God's chief ends in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting
Marriage, that Christ and his
Church, under a figure, might be where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
there is a couple that believe
through Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:41368:28"/>
Wherefore that husband that carrieth
it undiscreetly toward his wife, he doth
not only behave himself contrary to the
Rule, but also maketh his Wife lose the
benefit of such an Ordinance, and cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the mystery of this Relation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I say, <hi>So ought men to love their
Wives as their own bodies: He that loveth
his Wife, loveth himself; for no man ever
yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and
cherisheth it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Christ laid out his life for his Church; covereth her infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; communicates to her his Wisdom, protecteth her, and helpeth he in her imployments in this world: and so ought men to do for their Wives.</note> 
                  <hi>even as
the Lord the Church,</hi>
Ephes. 5. 28, 29.</p>

                  <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s

the art of thus doing,
as you may see in the
Book of <hi>Canticles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore bear with
their weaknesses, help
their infirmities, and honor them as the
weaker vessels, and as being of a frailer
constitution, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In a word, be such a Husband to thy
believing Wife, that she may say,</hi> God
hath not only given me a husband, but such


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41368:28"/>
a Husband, as preacheth to me every day the
Carriage of Christ to his Church.</p>
               <p>2. If thy Wife be unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
or carnal,<note place="margin">The duty of Husbands to unbelieving Wives.</note> then thou hast
also a <hi>duty</hi> lying before thee,
which thou art ingaged to
perform under a double ingagement. 1.
For that she lyeth liable every moment to
eternal Damnation. 2. That she is thy
Wife that is in this evil case.</p>
               <p>Oh! how little sense of the worth of
Souls is there in the hearts of some Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
as is manifest by their unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
carriage, to, and before their Wives.</p>
               <p>Now, to qualifie thee for a Carriage
suitable,</p>
               <p>1. Labour seriously after a sense of her
miserable state, that thy bowels may
yearn towards her soul.</p>
               <p>2. Beware that she take no occasion
from any unseemly carriage of thine, to
proceed in evil; and here thou hast
need to double thy diligence, for she li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in thy bosome, and therefore is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of espying the least miscarriage in
thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:41368:29"/>
3. If she behave her self unseemly
and unruly, as she is subject to do, being
Christless &amp; Graceless, then labour thou
to overcome her Evil with thy Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
her Frowardness with thy Patience
and Meekness: it is a shame for thee
who hast an other principle, to do as she.</p>
               <p>4. Take fit opportunities to convince
her; observe her disposition, and when
she is most likely to bear, then speak to
her very heart.</p>
               <p>5. When thou speakest, speak to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
'tis no matter for many words, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they be pertinent. <hi>Job</hi> in a few
words answers his Wife, and takes her
off from her foolish talking; <hi>Thou speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,</hi>
saith he, <hi>like one of the foolish women;
shall we receive good at the hands of God,
and shall we not receive evil?</hi> Job 2. 10.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Let all be done without rancor, or
the least appearance of anger;</hi> With
meekness instruct those that oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
if peradventure they may recover
themselves out of the snare of the Devil,
who are taken captive by him at his will,

               <p>IF thou art a Parent, a Father or a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then thou art to consider thy
Calling under this Relation.</p>
               <p>Thy Children have souls, and they must
be begotten of God as well as of thee,
or they perish.</p>
               <p>And know also, that unless thou be

and before them, they may perish through
thee: the thoughts of which should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
thee, both to instruct, and also to
correct them.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>To instruct them as the Scripture
saith, and to</hi> bring them up in the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and admonition of the Lord; and to
do this diligently when thou sittest in thy
house, when thou liest down, and when thou
risest up, <hi>Ephes. 6. 4. Deut.</hi> 6. 7.</p>
               <p>Now to do this to purpose.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Do it in terms and words, easie to


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41368:30"/>
be understood:</hi> affect not high expressions,
they will drown your Children. Thus
God spake to his Children, and <hi>Paul</hi> to
his, <hi>Hos. 12. 10. 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Take heed of filling their heads
with Whimzies, and unprofitable Notions;</hi>
for this will sooner learn them to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepert
and proud, than sober and humble.
Open therefore to them the state of man
by nature: discourse with them of Sin,
of Death, and Hell; of a crucified Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and the Promise of Life through
Faith. <hi>Train up a Child in the Way he
should go; and when he is old, he will not
depart from it,</hi> Prov. 22. 6.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There must be much Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness
and Patience in all thy instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>lest they be discouraged,</hi> Col. 3. 21.</p>
               <p>And fourthly, Labour to convince
them by a Conversation answerable, that
the things of which thou instructest them,
are not febles, but Realities, yea, and
Realities so far above what can be here
enjoyed, that all things, were they a
thousand times better than they are, are
not worthy to be compared with the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

and Worthyness of these things.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Ah! when Children can think of their

them, this is not only profitable for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,

               <p>

crying out to them, as God did of old

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let all this be mixed with

               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> If thou art driven to the
Rod, then, 1. Strike advisedly in cool
blood; and soberly shew them, 1. Their
fault; 2. How much it is against thy
heart thus do deal with them; 3. And
that what thou dost, thou dost it in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science

it, will be a means to afflict their <hi>hearts</hi>
as well as their bodies; and it being the
way that God deals with his, it is the most
likely to accomplish its end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Follow all this with prayer
to God for them, and leave the issue to
Him.</p>

                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> Observe these Cautions.</p>
               <p>1. Take heed that the mis-deeds for
which thou corectest thy Children be not
learn'd them by thee. Many Children
learn that wickedness of their Parents,
for which they beat and chastise them.</p>

               <p>3. Take heed thou use not unsavory

               <p>And besides, seeing the believing wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

               <p>There lyeth also a <hi>Duty</hi> upon Children

spirit among some Children; and that is,
they are apt to look over their Parents,

of them; this is worse than heathenish:
such a one hath got just the heart of a

great esteem. <hi>The eye that mocketh at his
Father, and that despiseth to obey his mother,
the Ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and
the young Eagles shall eat it,</hi> Prov. 30. 17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Thou oughtest to shew thy
honour to thy Parents, by a willingness
to help them with such necessaries and
accommodations which they need.</hi> If
any have Nephews or Children, let them
learn to shew pitty at home, and to requite
their parents, <hi>saith Paul,</hi> for that is good
and acceptable before God, 1 Tim. 5. 4.</p>
               <p>And this rule <hi>Joseph</hi> observed to his
poor Father, though he himself was next
the King in <hi>Egypt, Gen. 47. 12. Gen.</hi> 41.
39, 40, 41, 42, 43.</p>
               <p>But mark; Let them requite their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
               <p>There are three things, for which, as
long as thou livest, thou wilt be a debter
to thy Parents.</p>
               <p>1. For thy Being in this World: they
are they, from whom immediately under
God thou didst receive it.</p>
               <p>2. For their care to preserve thee when
thou wast helpless, and couldst neither


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41368:41"/>
care for, nor regard thy self.</p>
               <p>3. For the pains they have taken with
thee to bring thee up. Until thou hast
Children of thy own, thou wilt not be
sensible of the pains, watchings, fears,
sorrow and affliction, that they have gone
under to bring thee up; and when thou
knowest it, thou wilt not easily yeeld,
that thou hast recompenced them for
their favour to thee: How often have
they sustained thy hunger, cloathed thy
nakedness? what care have they taken
that thou mightest have wherewith to
live and do well when they were dead
and gone; they possibly have spared it
from their own belly &amp; back for thee, and
have also impoverished themselves that
thou mightest live like a man. All these
things ought duly, and like a man, to be
considered by thee, and care ought to be
taken on thy part to requite them; the
Scripture saith so; Reason saith so; and
there be none but Dogs and Beasts deny
it. <hi>It is the duty of Parents to lay up for
their Children; and the duty of Children to
requite their Parents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:41368:41"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Therefore shew by all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and son-like carriage, that thou dost
to this day, with thy heart, remember the
love of thy Parents.</p>
               <p>Thus much for obedience to Parents
in general.</p>
               <p>Again, if thy Parents be godly, and
thou wicked (as thou art if thou hast not
a second work or birth from God upon
thee) then thou art to consider, that
thou art more strongly ingaged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and honour thy Parents, not now
only as a father in the flesh, but as godly
Parents: thy Father and Mother is now
made of God thy teachers and instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in the Way of righteousness: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to alude to that of <hi>Solomon, O Son
hearken to the law of thy Father, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
not the law of thy Mother; bind them
continually upon thy heart, and ty them about
thy neck,</hi> Prov. 6. 20, 21.</p>
               <p>Now to provoke thee here to consider,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That this hath been the practice
alwayes of those that are, and have been
obedient Children; yea, of Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> though he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41368:42"/>
was God blessed for ever, <hi>Luke,
2.</hi> 51.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thou hast also the severe
Judgements of God upon those that have
been disobedient to awe thee. As 1.
<hi>Ishmael,</hi> for but mocking at one good car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of his Father and Mother, was both
thrust out of his Fathers Inheritance, and
the Kingdom of Heaven, and that with
God's approbation, <hi>Gen. 21. 8, 9, 10, 11,
12. Gal.</hi> 4. 30.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hinehas,</hi> for refusing
the good counsel of their Father, provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
the great God to be their enemy.
<hi>They hearkened not to the voice of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because the Lord would slay them,</hi>
1 Sam. 2. 23, 24, 25.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Absolom</hi> was hanged, as I may say by
God himself, for rebelling against his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 9.</p>
               <p>Besides, little dost thou know how
heart-aking a consideration it is to thy
Parents, when they do but suppose <hi>thou
mayest be damned:</hi> how many prayers,
sighs &amp; tears are there wrung from their
hearts upon this account?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:41368:42"/>
Every miscarriage of thine goeth to
their heart, for fear God should take an
occasion thereat to shut thee up in hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for ever.</p>
               <p>How did <hi>Abraham</hi> groan for <hi>Ishmael?
O,</hi> saith he to God, <hi>That</hi> Ishmael <hi>might
live before thee,</hi> Gen. 17. 18.</p>
               <p>How was <hi>Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ac</hi> and <hi>Rebekah</hi> grieved
for the miscarriage of <hi>Esau, Gen. 26. 34,
35.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And how bitterly did <hi>David</hi> mourn for
his Son, who died in his wickedness,
2 <hi>Sam. 18.</hi> 32, 33.</p>
               <p>Lastly, And can any imagin, but that
all these carriages of thy godly Parents,
will be to thee the increase of thy tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in Hell, if thou die in thy sins, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding?</p>
               <p>Again, if thy Parents and thou also be
godly, how happy a thing is this? how
shouldst thou rejoyce that the same Faith
should dwell both in thy Parents and
thee? thy conversion, possibly, is the
fruits of thy Parents groans and prayers
for thy soul, and they cannot chose but
rejoyce; do thou rejoyce with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:41368:43"/>
                  <hi>'Tis true, in the Salvation of a natural
Son which is mentioned in the Parable;</hi>
This my Son was dead, and is alive again;
was lost, and is found; and they began to be
merry, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 24.</p>
               <p>Let therefore the consideration of
this, that thy Parents have Grace aswell
as thee, ingage thy heart so much the
more to honour, reverence, and obey
them.</p>
               <p>Thou art better able now to consider
the pains and care that thy friends have
been at, both for thy body and soul; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
strive to requite them: Thou hast
strength to answer in some measure the
Command; wherefore do not neglect
it.</p>
               <p>It is a double Sin in a gracious Son not
to remember the Commandment, yea,
the first Commandment, with promise,
<hi>Ephes. 6.</hi> 1, 2.</p>
               <p>Take heed of giving thy sweet Parents
one snappish word, or one unseemly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
Love them because they are thy
Parents; because they are godly; and
because thou must be in Glory with
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:41368:43"/>
Again, if thou be godly, and thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
wicked, as often it sadly falls out:</p>
               <p>Then, <hi>first,</hi> let thy bowels yearn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them; 'tis thy parents that are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As I said before to the wife
touching her unbelieving husband, so
now I say to thee, Take heed of a parrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tongue; speak to them wisely, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and humbly; do for them faithfully
without repining; and bear with all
child-like modesty, their reproaches,
their railing, and evil speaking. Watch
fit opportunities to lay their condition
before them. <hi>O! how happy a thing would
it be, if God should use a Child to beget his
Father to the Faith? Then indeed might
the Father say, With the fruit of my own
bowels hath God converted my soul.</hi> The
Lord, if it be his will, convert our poor
Parents, that they, with us, may be the
Children of God.</p>

                  <hi>Servants</hi> also, they have a work to do


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41368:44"/>
for God, in their place and station among
men.</p>
               <p>The Apostles assert <hi>Masters</hi> under a
threefold consideration.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The believing Master.</item>
                  <item>2. The unbelieving Master.</item>
                  <item>3. The froward Master.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For all which, Servants are furnished
with counsel and advice in the Word, for
the demeaning of themselves under each
of them.</p>
               <p>But before I speak in particular to any
of these, I will in general shew you
the duty of Servants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Thou art to look upon thy self
as thou art; that is, as a Servant, not a
Child, nor a Wife, thou art inferior to
these; wherefore count thy self under
them, and be content with that station.
<hi>For three things the Earth is disquieted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and for four which it cannot bear: one is a
Servant when he reigneth,</hi> Prov. 30. 21, 22.</p>
               <p>It is out of thy place, either to talk or
do, as one that reigneth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Consider, that thou being a
Servant, what is under thy hand, is not


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41368:44"/>
thy own, but thy Masters: Now, because
it is not thy own, thou oughtest not to
dispose of it; but because it is thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
thou oughtest to be faithful. Thus
it was with <hi>Joseph, Gen. 39.</hi> 7, 8, 9. but
if thou do otherwise, know that thou shalt
receive of God for the wrong that thou
doest; and there is with God no respect
of persons, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 25. Wherefore,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Touching thy work and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
thou art to do it as unto the
Lord, and not for man; and indeed then
servants do their business as becomes
them, when they do all in obedience to
the Lord, as knowing, that the place in
which they now are, it is the place where
Christ hath put them, and in which he
expecteth they should be faithful.</p>
               <p>Servants, <hi>saith</hi> Paul, be obedient to them
that are your Masters—with fear &amp; trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
in singleness of heart, as unto Christ;
not with eye service, as men-pleasers, but
as the Servants of Christ, doing the Will of
God from the heart, <hi>Ephes. 6.</hi> 5, 6.</p>
               <p>Observe a little the Word of God to

saith, I had not known lust, except the

the Scripture affirms, where it saith,

will meddle with any thing.</p>
               <p>Now there are in my mind at present,
these eight notes of <hi>covetousness,</hi> which
hinder <hi>Good Works,</hi> and a Christian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
among men, wherever they are
harboured.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>When men, to whom God hath
given a comfortable livelyhood, are yet
not content therewith: This is against
the Apostle, where he saith,</hi> Let your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation
be without covetousness, and be
content with such things as you have; for he
hath said, I will never leave thee, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
thee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is <hi>covetousness</hi> in the Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
that puts him to say of his traffick, it
is better than it is, that he may heighten
the price of it: and <hi>covetousness</hi> in the
Buyer, that prompts him to say worse of


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41368:51"/>
a thing, than he thinks in his Conscience
it is, and that for an abatement of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
price.</p>
               <p>This is that which the Apostle forbids,
under the name of defraud, 1 <hi>Cor. 6.</hi> 7, 8.
and that which <hi>Solomon</hi> condemns, <hi>Prov.
20.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is thorow <hi>covetousness,</hi> that
men think much of that which goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
their own mouth, though possibly,
it goeth to those that have more need
than themselves, and also that better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it than they.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It argueth <hi>covetousness</hi> when
men will deprive themselves, and those
under them, of the priviledges of the
Gospel, for more of this world, and is
condemned by Christ, <hi>Luk. 14.</hi> 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It argueth <hi>covetousness,</hi> when
men that have it, can go by, or hear of
the poor, and shut up their bowels and
compassions from them, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Also when men are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
it is their duty to communicate to
such and such that have need, yet they
defer it, and if not quite forget it


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41368:51"/>
yet linger away the time, as being
loth to distribute to the necessities
of those in want. This is forbidden by
the holy Ghost; <hi>Withhold not good from
them to whom it is due, when it is in the
power of thy hand to do it.</hi> Now, it is due
from thee to the poor by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God; if they want, and thou hast
it, <hi>Say not then to thy Neighbour, Go, and
come again to morrow, and I will give, when
thou hast it by thee,</hi> Prov. 3. 27, 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> It argueth a greedy mind
also, when after men have cast in their
minds at the first what to give, they then
from that will be pinching, and cliping,
and taking away; whereas the holy Ghost
saith, <hi>Every one, as he purposeth in his
heart, so let him give, not grudgingly, nor of
necessity; for God loveth a chearful giver,</hi>
2 Cor. 9. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> It argueth a filthy greedy heart
also, when a man, after he hath done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good, then in his heart to repent, and
secretly wish that he had not so done, or
at least, that he had not done so much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
this is to be weary of well-doing (I spe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>


                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:41368:52"/>
now of communicating) and carrieth
in it two evils. <hi>First,</hi> It spoileth the
work done; And secondly, It (if enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained)
spoileth the heart for doing any
more so. <hi>The vile person shall be no more
called liberal, nor the Churle said to be
bountiful; for the liberal deviseth liberal
things, and by liberal things he shall stand,</hi>
Isa. 32. 6, 8.</p>
               <p>Now then, to diswade all from this
poisonous Sin, observe that above all
<hi>sins,</hi> in the New Testament, <hi>this</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Idolatry, Ephes. 5. 5. Col.</hi> 3. 5. And
therefore God's People should be so far
from being taken with it, that they should
be much afraid of the naming of it one
among another, lest it should, as adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
thoughts, infect the heart by the
talking of it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But why is Covetousness called
Idolatry?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Because it ingageth the
very heart of a man in it, to mind earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things: it gets our love which should
be set on God, and sets it upon poor emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
creatures: it puts our affections out


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41368:52"/>
of Heaven, where they should be, and
sets them on Earth, where they should
not be, <hi>Ezek. 33. 31. Phil. 3. 18, 19. Col.
3.</hi> 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Thus it changeth the object on which
the heart should be set, and setteth it on
that on which it should not: it makes a
man forfake God, <hi>The Fountain of living
water, and causeth him to hew to himself
cisterns, broken cisterns, which can hold no
water,</hi> Jer. 2. 11, 12, 13. For,</p>
               <p>2. It rejecteth the care, government,
and providence of God towards us, and
causeth us to make of our own care and
industry, a <hi>god;</hi> to whom, instead of
God, we fly continually, both for the
keeping that we have, and for getting
more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This was</hi> Israels <hi>Idolatry of old, and
the original of all her idolatrous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,</hi>
Hos. 2. 5. For their Mother hath
played the Harlot <hi>(that is, committed
idolatry)</hi> she that conceived them, hath
done shamefully: for she said, I will go af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my lovers that gave me my bread, and my
waters, my wool, and my flax, my oyl, and
my drink.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:41368:53"/>
3. It disalloweth of God's way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
his Creatures, and would have
them ordered and disposed of otherwise
then his heavenly Wisdom seeth meet:
and hence ariseth all those discontents
about God's dealing with us. <hi>Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
never yet said, <hi>It is the lord, let him
do what he pleaseth;</hi> but is ever objecting,
like God, against every thing that goeth
against it; and it is that which, like a
god, draweth away the heart and soul
from the true God, and his Son Jesus
Christ: <hi>And he went away sorrowful, for
he had great possessions,</hi> Mat. 19. 16, 17,
18, 19, 20, 21, 22.</p>
               <p>Now then, that which engageth the
heart, that rejecteth the providence of
God, and that is for ordering and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of things contrary to God; and for
breaking with God upon these terms, is
<hi>Idolatry:</hi> and all these do <hi>Covetousness.
The wicked boasteth of his hearts desire, and
blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth,</hi>
Psal. 10. 3.</p>
               <p>Now the way to remedy this disease, it
is to learn the lesson which <hi>Paul</hi> had got


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41368:53"/>
by heart; to wit, <hi>In whatsoever state you are,
therewith to be content,</hi> Phil. 4. 11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>I come in the second place to speak a
word of Pride, and loftiness of heart and
life.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Of Pride.</head>
               <p>1. Pride <hi>in general, it is,</hi> That which
causeth a man to think of man, and his
things, above what is written, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
               <p>2. It hath its seat in the heart among
these inormities, <hi>Fornications, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Lasciviousness, Murders, Deceit,</hi>
&amp;c. Mark 7. 21, 22, 23. and sheweth it
self in these following particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> When you slight this or that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
though gracious; that is, look over
them, and shun them for their poverty
in this world, and chuse rather to have
converse with others, that possibly are
less gracious, because of their greatness
in this World.</p>
               <p>This the Apostle <hi>James</hi> writes against,
<hi>Jam. 2.</hi> 1, 2, 3. under the name of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality;
for indeed the fruits of a puffed-up
heart, is to deal in this manner with
Christians, 1 <hi>Cor. 4.</hi> 6, 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:41368:54"/>
Now this branch of <hi>Pride</hi> floweth from
ignorance of the vanity of the creature,
and of the worth of a gracious heart:
Wherefore get more of the knowledge of
these two, and this sprig will be nipt in
the head, and you will learn to <hi>condescend
to men of low degree,</hi> Rom. 12. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It argueth <hi>pride of heart,</hi> when
men will not deny themselves in things
that they may, for the good and profit of
their Neighbours. And it argueth now,
that pride is got so much up into self-love,
and self-pleasing, that they little
care who they grieve or offend, so they
may have their way, <hi>Obad. 12. 13, 14,
15.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It argueth <hi>pride of heart,</hi> when
<hi>sober reproofs</hi> for sin, and unbeseeming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
carriages, will not down with thee, but
that rather thou snuffest, and givest way
to thy spirit to be peevish, and to retain
prejudice against those that thus reprove
thee. Saith the Prophet, <hi>hear ye, and give
ear, be not proud; for the Lord hath spoken;</hi>
that is, hear the reproofs of God for your
sins, and break them off by repentance:


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41368:54"/>
                  <hi>But if ye will not hear, my soul shall weep in
secret for your Pride,</hi> &amp;c. Jer. 13. 15, 16,
17. So also in <hi>Hosea, They will not frame
their doing to turn unto their God; for the
spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them;
they have not known the Lord; and the
pride of Israel doth testifie to his face,</hi> &amp;c.
Hos. 5. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>This argueth great senslesness of God,
and a heart greatly out of frame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It argueth <hi>Pride</hi> also, when
a reproof or admonition will not down
aswell from the poorest Saint, as from the
greatest Doctor; and it argueth a glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21. and that they
would, that <hi>their faith should stand in their
wisdom, and not in the Power of God,</hi> that
is, of naked Truth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It argueth <hi>pride of heart,</hi> when
a man that hath this or that in his heart
to do, in reference to God, but yet will
slight a sober asking counsel and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God in this matter. <hi>The wicked,
through the pride of his countenance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will not
seek after God,</hi> saith David, Psal. 10. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It argueth <hi>pride of heart,</hi> when


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41368:55"/>
persons are tickled with the thoughts of
their own praise, and that secretly lust af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it; that think of themselves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
above what is written; which those
do, who do not acknowledge that man in
his best estate is altogether vanity: But
such kind of people have forgot the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation;
<hi>Be not high minded, but fear,</hi>
Rom. 11. 20. And also, <hi>that there is a
knowledge that puffeth up, and edifieth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
themselves nor others,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore, to such the Apostle saith,</hi>
Be not desirous of vain glory, but in holiness
of mind, <hi>let each esteem others better than
themselves,</hi> Phil. 2. 3. Gal. 5. 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pride</hi> also there is in the outward <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
behaviour</hi> and <hi>Gesture,</hi> which is
odious for Christians to be tainted with;
and this pride is discovered by mincing
words, a made carriage, and an affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the toyes and baubles that Satan and
every light-headed fool bringeth into the
world. As God speaketh of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Zion, They walk with stretched-out
necks, wanton eyes, mincing as they go, and
making a tinckling with their feet,</hi> Isa. 3.


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41368:55"/>
16. A very unhansome carriage for a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that profess Godliness, and that use
to come before God to confess their sins,
and to bemove themselves for what they
have done: How can a sence of thy own
baseness of the vileness of thy heart, and
of the holiness of God, stand with such a
carriage? dost thou see the vileness of
thy heart, the fruit of sin? and art thou
afflicted with that disagreement that is
between God and thy heart, that layest
the reins on the neck of thy lusts, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
them run whither they will? Be not
deceived; <hi>Pride ariseth from ignorance of
these things,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 3, 4. A sense of
my vileness, of what I have deserved,
and of what continually in my heart op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
God, cannot stand with a foolish,
light and wanton carriage: thou wilt
then see, there is other things to mind
than to imitate the <hi>Butter-fly:</hi> alas, all
these kind of things, are but a <hi>painting
the Devil,</hi> and a setting a carnal gloss up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Castle of his; thou art but making
gay the spider; is thy heart ever the soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for thy fine gate, thy mincing words,


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41368:56"/>
and thy lofty looks? nay, doth not this
argue, that thy heart is a rotten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> canke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and besotted heart? Oh! that God
would but let thee see a little of thy own
inside, as thou hast others to behold thy
outside: thou painted Sepulchre; thou
whited Wall, will these things be found
vertues in the day of God? or, is this
the way that thou takest to mortifie sin?
<hi>A high look, a proud heart, and the plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the wicked, is sin,</hi> Prov. 21. 4. <hi>Pride
is the ring-leader of the seven abominations
that the Wise man nameth,</hi> Prov. 6. 16, 17.
and is that above all, that causeth to fall
into the condemnation of the Devil,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Of Adultery or Uncleanness.</head>
               <p>Now I come in the last place to touch
a word or two of <hi>Adultery,</hi> and then to
draw towards a conclusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adultery,</hi> it hath its place in the heart
among the rest of those filthinesses, I
mentioned before <hi>Mark 7.</hi> 21, 22. of
which sin I observe two things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:41368:56"/>
First, <hi>That almost, in every place
where the Apostle layeth down a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of wickednesses, he layeth down</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,
Fornication, <hi>and</hi> Uncleanness <hi>in
the front; as that in</hi> Mark 7. 21. Rom.
1. 29. 1 Cor. 6. 9. Gal. 5. 19. Ephes. 5. 3
1 Thes. 4. 3, 4, 5. Heb. 12. 16. Jam. 2. 11.
1 Pet. 2. 11. 2 Pet. 2. 10.</p>
               <p>From this I gather, that the <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness</hi>
is a very predominant and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Sin,</hi> easie to overtake the sinner, as
being one of the first that is ready to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it self at all occasions, to break the
Law of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>I observe, that this</hi> sin <hi>is
committed unawares to many, even so
soon as a man hath but looked upon a
woman.</hi> I say unto you, <hi>saith Christ,</hi> that
whosoever looketh on a woman to lust, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
after her, he hath already committed
Adultery with her in his heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 28.</p>
               <p>This sin of uncleanness, I say, is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
taking <hi>sin,</hi> it is natural above all sins
to mankind; and as it is most natural, so
it wanteth not tempting occasions, having
objects for to look on in every corner:


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41368:57"/>
wherefore there is need of a double and
trible watchfulness in the soul against it.
It is better here to make a covenant with
our eyes, like <hi>Job, (Job 31. 1.)</hi> than to let
them wander to God's dishonour, and
our own discomfort.</p>
               <p>There are these three things which
discover a man or woman too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining

               <p>The first is a wanton eye, or an eye
that doth secretly effect it self with such
objects as are tickling of the heart with
the thoughts of immodesty and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
<hi>Isaiah</hi> calls this <hi>a wanton eye;</hi> and
<hi>Peter, an eye full of adultery, that cannot
cease from sin, 2 Pet. 2. 14. Isa.</hi> 3. 16.
This is that also which Christ calleth,
<hi>an evil eye;</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> the <hi>lust of the flesh,</hi>
and <hi>of the eyes,</hi> and doth defile those who
are not very watchful over their own
hearts, <hi>Mark 7. 22. 1 John</hi> 2. 16.</p>
               <p>This <hi>wanton eye,</hi> is that which the most
holy Saints should take heed of, because
it is apt to seize upon them also. When
