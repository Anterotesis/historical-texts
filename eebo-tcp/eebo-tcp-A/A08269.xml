            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

rather to forsake them, and gyue oure selues to the knowledge of Heauenly and eternall things, whence all true happinesse and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie doth procede. And for as much as the matter of it selfe is very good (deseruyng in dede to be handeled by men of farre better skil tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I) I could not deuise how any things whatsoeuer, of lykenesse and conueniencie mighte more properly bee resembled one to the other, than this boke for the aptnesse &amp; conueniencie of the argument might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to your Maiestie, a most blessed and happie prince. Happy I say, not so much for that youre grace is lineally descended by the most high, puissaunt, mightie &amp; victorious prince Henry the eight of famous memorie, from so many myghtie and puissant princes of this Realme, your Maiesties moste noble progenitours: which haue long agone, most valiantly &amp; victoriously co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered al <hi>France,</hi> and by dint of sword daunted their enimies, so that youre highnesse beareth in Armes as right inheritour thereunto, the royall scepter and Croune imperiall, most triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phantly, and the titles of <hi>Englande, Fraunce,</hi> and <hi>Irelande</hi> ioyntely in youre maiesties stile.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and goodnesse hath shewed suche grace and speciall fauour toward you, by enduing youre grace moste plentyfully with infinite graces and vertues more abundantly than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Prince or Princesse in the worlde, so that it might serue me for a sufficient ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to fill large volumes, only to stande in commendation of your maiestie, not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing therto any deuise of myne owne, of fained Emblemes or Poetical fables, and that without vsing flatterie or glosing, as they do most comonly, that ambitiously seeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prefermentes and honoure, disguise ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than describe noble and honorable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages, whome they sette oute many tymes beyonde al truth, yea sometime aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and with as great inconueniencie as yf they should paynt an Asse tuning of a harp.

these alonely (thoughe many and singular) giftes and graces, which your grace enioyeth in great plentie and abundance, consideryng they bee transitorie, and can not make any man or woman happie (albeit they seme di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and supernaturall,) excepte they be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied wyth the loue and feare of God, according to the saying of King <hi>Lamuell,</hi> in the thirde of the Prouerbes: <hi>Fauour is decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable, and Beautie a mere vanitie, but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that feareth the Lorde, is to be beloued.</hi> But chiefly and principally when I consider that God intendyng to bestowe an excellent benefit peculiarly vpon your Maiestie more than vpon any other Prince or Princesse in the worlde, hath besides al the other forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his manifolde giftes and graces, lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned your vnderstanding with his holy spirit, and hath vouchesafed (by enclinyng youre graces heart, spirite and minde to humilitie, peace, mildenesse, and all kinde of louable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) to chose your maiestie, especially to be his champion to defend his beloued church. And in this respect, (like as all faithfull and true Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> princes throughout all <hi>Europe</hi> do esteme and repute you) do I also, and that
<pb facs="tcp:10687:6"/>
of good right call your grace a moste happie and blessed Prince. Consider I beseche you, how God hath blessed your maiestie in thys worlde more than he hath done any of your progenitours. For neuer was it seene in any age or time heretofore, that this your realme of <hi>England</hi> hath flourished as it dothe at this present vnder your Maiesties moste happie gouernement. Firste in all kinde of liberall Artes and sciences. Secondarily in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of treasure, as well golde and siluer, as all sortes of riche and precious iewels and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namentes. Thirdely, in the free passage and trafike of all kinde of marchandise: Besides this, in good and politike lawes and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, namely in the due execution of iustice, according to law and equitie. The worde of God is purely preached here in six or seuen languages. The Sacraments of Baptisme, and the holy Supper, sincerely ministred accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Christes institution. Christian disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in due force in many places. Finally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery countrey and nation that will liue here according to his holy worde, is receiued, and findeth good entertainement. O how happy and blessed is that King or kingdome, where
<pb facs="tcp:10687:6"/>
these things are in force Contrarywise most vnhappie are those princes, that banishyng and reiecting Christ, receiue that Antechrist, the sonne of the Diuell, and forsakyng the truth, embrace errour: To be short, that do al things ouerthwartly &amp; clean against the hair For it is moste certaine and sure, that sodaine ruine and destruction shall fall vpon all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vngodly persons, as well nowe as in tyme paste, as experience hath well proued heretofore: Namely vpon <hi>Pharao,</hi> and hys kingdome of <hi>Egypt,</hi> vpon <hi>Ieroboam, Achab, Iezabell,</hi> and infinite other mo. Wher on the other part, the good kings &amp; princes which feare the Lord, shal haue peace and comfort bothe in this worlde, and in the worlde to come: Like as had <hi>Iosua, Iuda, Gedeon, Dauid</hi> and diuers other in those days, and is also to be seene at this day most euidently in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>almes and countreyes vnder youre Maiesties dominion, whiche God hath blessed in suche sort, that it may truly be sayd, that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Saturne,</hi> and the Golden worlde is come againe, and the Virgin <hi>Astrea</hi> is des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from heauen to builde hir a seate in this your moste happie countrey of <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</hi>

For here is peace and quietnesse, where as the moste parte of foraine countreyes are full of great tumultes, and that (more is the pitie) with the sheding of much christian bloude.

As it is to be seene in their owne Histories. And as they procéeded in all wickednesse, abhomination, superstition, and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie from time to time, euen so after that <hi>CHRIST</hi> our Sauioure, and King of

And forasmuch as that auncient <hi>Rome</hi> would not amend it selfe, and renounce their enorme vices, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and superstition, and conuerte vnto the Lorde Iesu Christe, to imbrace the true worshippyng of God, and the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Gospel, they haue bene iustly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, receyuing according to their deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, such measure as they had measured to others.

For they may euidently sée and perceiue here, that the holy Ghost doth commaund vs to search out, to trie, and to make an accompte, to know whom to hold for the right and wicked Antechrist: him name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which (hauing dismissed and put down three Kings,) is of nothing come vp and exalted aboue all, and especially to the subuersion and throwing downe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes true religion, hath begon to raigne and rule.</p>

We sée héere of a truthe, that this godly teacher being full of the spirit of god hath not failed to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel the true mening of the holy Ghost in this behalf. For it is euident that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish church, is called the Latine church,

and the Pope soueraigne and supreame head of the same. Wé sée also y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all things in this Church, are done in Latine. And in their spirituall courtes, (as they call them) nothing but Latin is vsed and spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: no man may serue in this church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be a Latinist. Moreouer they call Hebrue to be <hi>Iudaike</hi> or Iewishe, and the Greeke erronious or heretiquish: yea they holde the Hebrue and Greeke Bible to be suspected, and straightly charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund their Latine (falsly called <hi>Ieromes</hi> translation) to be of euery one imbraced and holden for the best. Which thing is so manifestly known, that it hath no néed of any further exposition. This number of 666. is signified by some <hi>Greeke</hi> wordes, (for this Prophesie was written first in the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue) as <hi>Anthemos,</hi> that is: against the glory of god.

and all thys may be made agreable and approued by scripture and reason. For he that is not with Christe, is agaynst him.
