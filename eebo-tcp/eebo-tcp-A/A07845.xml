         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But what will yee more? The Pope in Lent said Masse in the Church, <hi>Sanctae crucis,</hi> which they call in Ierusalem, my self know the place. Yet the Pope as it seemeth, infatuated with pride, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue desire of honor, had quite forgot the name.

While he was at Masse (O holy sacrifice) he heard a great noyse of Deuils, and so remembred not the place onely,<note place="margin">The Pope in his Pontifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the name of his churches</note> but also his death to bee at hand.

                     <p>Many Popish decrees tell vs, that Popes may be deposed,<note place="margin">Grat. dist. 40. cap. si Papa.</note> when and so often as they swarue from the Christian faith, and become heretiques in deed. Which Decrees perforce must presuppose that the Popes may be heretiques; otherwise they should be frustrate, and to no ende at all. These are the words; <hi>Cunctos ipse (Papa) iudicaturus, à nemine est iudican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, nisi deprehendatur a fide deuius.</hi> The Pope iudgeth all, and must be iudged of none; vnlesse hee swarue from the faith, and bee an heretique. Lo the Popes owne Decrees doe plainely graunt, that the Pope may be an heretique; and then God be thanked, he hath a superiour and iudge vpon earth. So he may lawfully be controlled, yea condemned; vnlesse hee keepe the Christian fayth better, then many popes haue done.</p>

                        <hi>Papa haereticus aut apostata, ab vniuersali concilio deponi potest; &amp; ratio est, quia sicut nullus potest esse alicuius reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionis praelatus, qui non sit in illa religione prosessus, ita neque potest esse Papa, si fide Ecclesiae careat.</hi> The Pope being an heretique or apostata, may bee deposed by a generall Concell; and the reason is, because as none can be a Prelate of any Religion, which is not professed in that religion: so neither can he be Pope, that holdeth not the faith of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Thus it is cleare, euen by popish Doctors and Decrees, that the Pope as a priuate person, may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the Christian fayth, teach false doctrine, and become a flat Apostata. The Pope therefore in his priuate person, can not be a competent iudge.</p>

                     <p>DOctor <hi>Gerson,</hi> a famous Papist and Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour of Paris, teacheth so plainely, that Popes may erre in their publique doctrine of faith and maners, as none can doubt there of that ponder well his words;<note place="margin">Gers. in serm. de paschat. part. 3.</note> thus therefore doth he write: <hi>Hos fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit latroni, qui veri similiter nondum compleuerat poene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pro omnibus peccatis suis, qui fuit illa hora propria beatisicatus, &amp; vidit Deum facie ad faciem, sicut sancti in Paradiso: propter quod insuper apparet falsitas doctrinae Papae Iohannes</hi> 22. <hi>quae damnata fuit cum sono buccina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, coram rege Philippo per Theologos Parisienses, &amp; credidit potius Theologis Parisiensibus, quam curiae.</hi>

This did he to the theefe (which by likelihood had not yet accomplished pennance for all his sinnes,) who was blessed in that verie houre, and saw God face to face, as do the Saints in Paradise; by reason whereof appeareth further the falshoode of the doctrine of Pope <hi>Iohn,</hi> which was condemned by the sound of Trumpets, before King <hi>Philip</hi> by the diuines of Paris, and the king beleeued rather the diuines, then the court (of Rome.)</p>
                     <p>Out of these wordes, the indifferent Reader wil easily note with me these important poynts. First,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that the theefe crucified with Christ, did see God face to face in that verie houre, and so was blessed. Secondly, that hee reprooueth the false doctrine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of Pope <hi>Iohn.</hi> Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that his doctrine was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> with the sound of trumpets, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the King of France. Fourthly, that the king <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> gaue more credite to the Diuines of Paris, then to the iudgement of the Court of Rome; that is, then to the Pope and his Cardinals. A poynt well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to bee noted. Fiftly, that neither the king, nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the learned Papists, did in those dayes graunt such authoritie to the Pope, as now a dayes the Pope chalengeth to himselfe. Whereupon it followeth consequently, that the Pope taught false doctrine, euen in a weightie matter of faith. To which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sectarie, that his doctrine was publique; as which was publiquely condemned at Paris, in the presence of the king.</p>
                     <p>Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> testifieth the same truth, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth the zealous Papist <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> in these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse

                     <p>Thus writeth <hi>Adrian,</hi> who was himselfe Pope of Rome.

                     <p>Here the simple Reader must note well, that hee may the better vnderstande this verity,<note place="margin">Bellarmin de-Rom. pontif. lib. 4. cap. 14.</note> and not bee seduced with the colourable Glosse of the Iesuite <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who seeing the force of this testimonie to ouerthrowe the highest poynt in poperie, bestirreth himselfe more then a little in defence of popish faith. He telleth vs forsooth, if we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21633:14"/>
wil beleeue him, that Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> (with all obeysance to his holines bee it spoken,) erred in deede, as is here said: but he did that as a priuate man,<note place="margin">A subtle, but falsely coyned distinction.</note> (sayeth our Iesuite) not as Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> Which distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction doubles, wanteth not onely a good founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereupon it should be built: but also it flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destroyeth the playne Text. The reason is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident to euery child. First, because pope <hi>Adrian</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> faith, <hi>Docuit,</hi> hee taught. Secondly, because hee faith, <hi>Publicè,</hi> publikely. Thirdly, because he say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                        <hi>Mandauit,</hi> he commanded all to hold it. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> because none could be made Graduats in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> schooles, which held not this opinion. Fiftly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> euery Graduate was sworn to defend it, and to hold it for euer. So then, the pope may erre, and hath erred <hi>de facto</hi>; euen in his publike decree of faith, as well as an other man. And that euen by the consent of <hi>Adrian,</hi> who was pope himselfe: yea, who for learning and knowledge, was one of the rarest popes that euer were at <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     <p>pope <hi>Celestine</hi> the third of that name, erred as pope and publike person, in his iudiciall sentence,<note place="margin">Alphonsus. lib. 1. cap. 4. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. haeres.</note> and publicke decree. This to be so, <hi>Alphonsus</hi> aboue named, is a constant witnes in these expresse words; <hi>Celestinum Papam errasse circa matrimonium fidelium, quorum alter labitur in haerisin, res est omnibus manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta,

                     </p>
                     <p>That Pope <hi>Celestine</hi> erred about Matrimonie of the faithful,<note place="margin">Loe the Pope erred publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate person.</note> wherof the one is fallen into heresie, is a thing so manifest, as all men know the same: neither was this error of Pope <hi>Celestine</hi> such, that it can bee imputed to sole negligence, so as we may think him to haue erred as a priuate man, &amp; not as Pope, who ought in the decree of euery serious matter, to aske counsel of learned men. For that definition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of <hi>Celestine,</hi> was in the old Decretall Epistles, in the Chapter <hi>Laudabilem,</hi> which I my selfe haue seene and read.</p>
                     <p>Out of these wordes of <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> who was a man highly renowned among the papistes, I note <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> many worthy obseruations. First, that Pope <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine</hi> erred, and that not as a priuate man, but euen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as Pope and publike person. Secondly, that hee erred in a verie serious matter, euen in a matter of faith: to wit, that Matrimonie was so dissolued by reason of heresie, that the faithfull man or woman might marry againe, the hereticall partie liuing. which thing sayeth <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> was manifest to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man to be an heresie. And the late Councel <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of Trent hath defined it to be so. Thirdly, that this decree and definition of Pope <hi>Celestine,</hi> was in those
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21633:15"/>
dayes enrolled in the Popes Decretals. Fourthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that <hi>Alphonsus</hi> saw and read the same Decree. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that the said decree cannot this day be found, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Popes Decretall Epistles.<note place="margin">Note this wel, it is a point of weight.</note> Where I wish the Reader to note by the way, that the Decrees of our holy Fathers the Popes, haue been such and so much against late Poperie, that they are ashamed to bring them now to light. If any man desire to know the Popes errors more fully, let him read my book of Motiues. But now it remaineth, that I aunswere to sundrie important obiections, whereupon the Papistes would build the supposed Priuiledges of their Popes, as that their Faith can not faile, and such like.

<pb facs="tcp:21633:16"/>
Christ, swearing that hee knew not the man. For these twaine are the chiefe fruites of faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. v. 10.</note> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue with the heart, &amp; to confesse with the mouth. And where eyther of these two is wanting, there cannot be a right faith. For he that putteth away a good conscience,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1. v. 19.</note> maketh shipwracke of his faith.</p>
                     <p>I say secondly, that Christ prayed aswell for all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the elect, as he did for <hi>Peter.</hi> I pray not sayth Christ, for the world,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17. v. 9.</note> but for them which thou hast giuen me, for they are thine.

And consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, seeing Christ directed not his wordes to <hi>Peter,</hi> as to one priuate man, but as to one representing the whole Church: it must needs follow, that what soeuer Christ did or saide touching <hi>Peters</hi> faith, must perforce bee vnderstoode of the faith of the whole Church. Which faith, as I haue copiously proued in my Booke of Suruay, shall neuer fayle indeed. This my aunswere is confirmed, in these wordes of S. <hi>Austen:</hi>

                     <p>To these I must needes adde, that all the doctors of the famous Vniuersity of Paris,<note place="margin">Bellarm. lib 4. cap. 3. de.

And therefore our Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite doth easily reiect their exposition, without all time and reason. And hee telleth vs forsooth, that Christ in his prayer obtayned two Priuiledges to <hi>Peter:</hi> the one, that his faith should neuer faile: the other, that neyther <hi>Peter,</hi> neyther any in <hi>Peters</hi> seat, should euer teach false doctrine. But wise men I hope, will belieue <hi>Bellarmines</hi> wordes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when hee shall bring good proofes for the same. For first, my selfe haue proued most euidently, euen by manifest Popish Testimonies; that many Bishops of Rome haue taught false doctrine, and become flat Apostataes. Secondly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21633:17"/>
confesseth freely, that <hi>Peters</hi> Successors perhaps wanted the former prerogatiue, and sometime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Heretikes; but the latter saith hee, they had vndoubtedly. Which Exposition is easily retorted against himselfe: because the former may as well if not better, bee gathered out of the text, as the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> presumeth to much vpon his owne credite, when hee will without all reason, enforce vs to expound Christes Gospell, as hee listeth.</p>

I note secondly, that <hi>Nicho. de Lyra</hi> a great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> papist, (whose authority is a mighty argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the papists,) doth here expresly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne the grosse error of the Hebrew doctors, &amp; in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent error of all Iesuits, &amp; Romish parisites: who
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21633:22"/>
to satisfie the humor of their Pope,<note place="margin">Note well gentle Reader.</note> and to vpholde his Antichristian tyranny, doe wrest the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the manifest truth thereof. I note third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that we must neyther belieue Bishop nor Pope, nor any other liuing man of what authority soeuer, if hee teach vs contrarie to the manifest truth of Gods word. I note fourthly, that <hi>Lyra</hi> doth gather <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> out of the Text it selfe,<note place="margin">The hie priest of the old law erred.</note> that the High Priest might erre, and teach false doctrine. And consequently, that the Iesuite <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth but flatter the popes Holinesse, when he be stirreth himself to proue out of this place, that the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot erre, because the Iewish Bishoppes had the like priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and could not teach against the truth.</p>
                     <p>I note fiftly, out of <hi>Lyra, Carthusianus,</hi> and <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Canus,</hi> whose words are already set down, that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Priestes of the old law erred grossely, and taught false doctrine. And that all the world may see the falshood of Romish Popery, I will adde a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and most execrable error of the High Priest himselfe. <hi>Caiphas</hi> the High Priest pronounced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a great multitude, that Christ blasphemed, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he thus spoke.<note place="margin">Mat. 26. v. 64. 65. 66. 67.</note> Hereafter shall ye see the Sonne of man, sitting at the right hand of the power of God, and come in the cloudes of heauen. Now I ween neither the Iesuite, nor any other papist in the world will or dare call this blasphemie, which Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus spoke of himselfe. If they dare so say, the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a plaine testimonie against them, and all the world will crie, fie vpon them.<note place="margin">Note well this Dilemma.</note> If they neyther wil nor can so say, then is the controuersie at an end:
<pb facs="tcp:21633:23"/>
then hath the High Priest erred iudicially: then may their Pope also erre, as he hath done indeed: then was not Christ Iesus guilty of deat,<note place="margin">Leu. 24. v. 14</note> has the hie Priest and the people affirmed him to be. Marke the answere, to the next obiection.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I say first, that when the Priestes commaund the people, to doe against Gods law: then may not the people doe thereafter,<note place="margin">Act. 5. v. 29. Act. 4. v. 19.</note> but remember the doctrine and Apostolike rule: that they must rather obey <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God, then man. I say secondly, that though the Priestes be appointed to teach, and the people to heare: the Priestes in Gods name to commaund, and the people to obey: yet must all this be done, <hi>Iuxta legem Dei,</hi> according to Gods law. Neither shall the people, for all that contemne the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Priestes, but with humility admonish the priestes, and tell them why they cannot so doe. This lesson if the Papistes cannot be content to learne of me, yet I hope, they will not disdayne to learne it of S. <hi>Hierome:</hi> seeing their Pope in their Collect v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his festiuity, termeth him <hi>Doctorem maximum,</hi> their greatest Doctor. His wordes are these: <hi>Si Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdos

For the Priestes office is to know the law, and to aunswere to questions of the Law. Let the Priestes learne Gods law, that they may teach that which they haue learned: and let them encrease knowledge, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then riches: and let them not be ashamed to learne of the Lay people, which know those things that pertaine to the Priestes office.</p>
                     <p>Out of these wordes of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> I note first, that many Popes are no Priestes,<note place="margin">The Popes now a days do not preach at al</note> and consequently <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> no Popes indeede, though falsely supposed so to be. S. <hi>Ieromes</hi> reason is plaine to euery child, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many Popes are very vnlearned, and know not the law of God, neither preach his word, which is the chiefest office of a Priest.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. v. 17.</note> And who wil or can think, that Christ Iesus, if he had appointed the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Rome,</hi> to rule his whole Church through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world: and all nations to hang their Faith vpon the popes faith: woulde in these dangerous times suffer them to liue dissolutely, to be as dumbe dogs that barke not, and neuer to preach and teach his word? none doubtles, that haue any wit, sense,<note place="margin">Esa. 56. v. 10.</note> or reason. I note secondly, that Priests must know <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21633:24"/>
the law of God, to this end that they may teach the same. And consequently, that the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> who neuer preach the word of God, cannot be the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> true Priests of God. I note thirdly, that the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> if they were true Priests indeed, both shold and would encrease their knowledge in the law of God, rather then their wealth and possessions. I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> note fourthly, that the true Priestes of God, must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> not disdayne to learne of the Laicall sorte, which are better learned then themselues. I note fiftly, that sheepe so called Metaphorically, such as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian people are, who haue sence, reason, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10. v. 4. 1.

For wise sheepe will not eate that meat, which they know to be deadly poison to them. For this cause doe the Popes owne Canons graunt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to the sheepe, to reproue and accuse their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor: yea though he be the Pope himselfe. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse wordes of the Canon are these: <hi>Oues quae suo Pastori commissae sunt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Caus. 2. q. 7. Cap. oues.</note>

                     <p>The sheepe which are committed to their Pastor, may neyther rebuke him,<note place="margin">Loe, the sheep may rebuke &amp; accuse the shepheard.</note> nor in any wise accuse him, vnlesse hee forsake the faith.

so erre, the sheepe may then reproue him, and also accuse him.

                     <p>I say first, that when <hi>Constantinus</hi> the Emperour departed from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the Pope then beganne to put out his Hornes, and to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the Emperiall authority in the west partes of the world.<note place="margin">Dist. 96. cap.

<pb facs="tcp:21633:25"/>
aswell in the Citty of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in <hi>Italie,</hi> in all the west partes of the world.

This I say, was the originall of Poperie, though it bee a very fable, and voide of all credite. For <hi>Eusebius, Theodori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Socrates, Sozomenus, Eutropius, Ruffinus, Victor,</hi> and other approued Writers, (who all haue wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Actes of <hi>Constantine</hi> most diligently,) do not only make no mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that gift, but withal say plainely, that the whole Empire was diuided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the three Sonnes of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and that one of them had all <hi>Italie</hi> for his parte. And <hi>Ammia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Marcellinus</hi> writeth,<note place="margin">Ammianus. lib. 15.</note> that <hi>Constantius</hi> had the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Citty of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that <hi>Leontius</hi> was his Lieutenant there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laurentius Valla</hi> hath written both learnedly &amp; largely, against the false Donation of <hi>Constantine,</hi> wherewith a great part of the world hath beene se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. To this I could adde many argumentes, but that the Reader may find them, in my motiues and Booke of Suruey.</p>
                     <p>I say secondly, that the Maiestie of the Romane <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Empire, and that liberality which the Romanes exhibited to the Martyres in Exile, and otherwise afflicted, gaue no small honour to the Cittie and church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For the Councels had euer great respect to the dignity and excellency of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in the distribution of Episcopall and Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kall seates.</p>

                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:21633:25"/>I say thirdly, that the church of <hi>Rome</hi> kept &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> a long time, the pure and sincere doctrine of Christ Iesus. For Saint <hi>Paule</hi> was beheaded there: Saint <hi>Peter</hi> crucified there: and many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Rome</hi> there put to death, for confessing &amp; defending the Christian faith. And hereupon it partly came, I will it not deny, that the West and Occidentall Churches did so greatly reuerence the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and many times to appease controuersies and dissentions, had recourse to it,<note place="margin">The Church of Rome, was once the true nurse of the faith.</note> as to the Mother Churche and auncient Nurse of the Faith.

This to bee so, one onely testimonie will suffice. For S. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> an auncient Father, a very learned Bishoppe, and blessed Martyr, although hee greatly honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Church of Rome, and the Bishoppes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for respectes aboue mentioned: yet was he so farre, from acknowledging the supposed prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue of the Bishoppe of <hi>Rome,</hi> that his faith could not faile: or that hee was the sole and only iudge,<note place="margin">Vide epist.

For of Christ bodie, no partes are made. Loe, the Popish glosse saith plainly, (which is the truth in deed,) that Christ bodie cannot bee broken, or diuided into partes. And for all that, the Pope with his popish Councell, enforced <hi>Berengarius</hi> to beleeue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse the same. The Apostles words are these:<note place="margin">Rom. 6. v. 9</note> Christ being raysed from the dead, dieth no more: death hath no more dominion ouer him. But certes, if the true bodie of Christ Iesus be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in deede, and torne in peeces with mans teeth: then doubtlesse must it bee corrupted, and Christ himselfe must die againe. This veritie doth so gall the Papists, that the Iesuite <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> (who is the mouth of all the Papists,) is inforced will he, nill he, to confesse the truth vnawares.<note place="margin">Bellarmin de concil. lib. 2. cap. 8. in fine.

I note thirdly, that Christes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> bodie is truly said to be broken, (as our Iesuite affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,) because the signe of his bodie is truly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Out of whose wordes and graunt,<note place="margin">O reader, mark this point wel, for the loue of God.</note> this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is inferred of necessity: to wit, that Christ bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is truly said to be present to the faithfull, and to be truly eaten of them; when the signe of Christes bodie is truly present, and truly eaten of them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it must needs follow vpon the Iesuites grant, and exposition of the Romish faith, (which is a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to bee heard;) that when Christ vttered these wordes to his Apostles, (this is my bodie;) his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the true sense of the wordes, was this. This is my bodie, that is to say, this is the signe and
<pb facs="tcp:21633:28"/>
Sacrament of my bodie. The reason hereof is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, because, Christes naturall and true body, can no more be truely eaten, then it can be truely bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. And co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequently, as we are enforced to grant, that when we say Christes bodie is broken, then is but the signe of his bodie broken: euen so likewise are we enforced to graunt, that when Christ saide: This is my body, hee gaue onely the signe and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of his bodie. The reason is euident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his bodie can no otherwise be eaten, then it is broken; that is to say, sacramentally, or in a signe; or if you will so say, figuratiuely or spiritually, which is all one. Here then is no certaintie of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be found.</p>

                  <p>In the great and generall Councell of the Iewes, in which were present, (as Christes Gospel telleth vs,<note place="margin">Mar. 14. v. 53.</note>) all the Priests, the Scribes &amp; the Elders, togither with the hie Priest: Christ Iesus was condemned to death, because he named himself the sonne of God. Yea, <hi>Caiphas</hi> the high Priest with the consent and assent of the whole Councell, pronounced openly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21633:28"/>
that Christ blasphemed,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. v. 65.</note> when he called himselfe the sonne of God. And yet is it euident to all Christian people, and all Papists will and must confesse the same; that the hie Priest <hi>Caiphas</hi> erred perniciously, and vttered most execrable blasphemie: when hee denied Christ to be the sonne of God, and true Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias of the world.</p>
                  <p>The great and famous Councell of Lateran, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vnder <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, in which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the Patriarkes of Hierusalem and Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople: Metropolitanes, 70: Bishops, 400: Abbots, 12: Priors Conuentuals, 800: the Legates of the Greeke and Romane Empire: the Orators of the Kinges of Hierusalem, France, Spaine, Englande, and Cypres: either erred notoriously aboute the creation of Angels, or at least made it euident to all the worlde, that the decree of generall Councels, is not an infallible rule of faith. I proue this to bee so, by two important reasons. First, because the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Councell hath these wordes: <hi>Firmiter credimus &amp; simpliciter confitemur, quod vnus est solus Deus verus, creator omnium, visibilium &amp; inuisilium, spiritualium &amp; corporalium;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Concil. Later. 1. cap. de fide Cath. 1.</note>

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:21633:29"/>Secondly, because great learned men and most renowmed fathers,<note place="margin">Basil. hexa. hom. 1. Ambr. hexamer. lib. 1. cap. 5. tom. 4. August. lib. 11 de ciuitate, ca. 32. Aquinas, 1. p. q. <hi>61.</hi> art. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Gregorius Nazianzenus, Basilius Magnus, Ambrosius, Hieronimus, Damascenus,</hi> doe all holde constantly, that albeit the Angels had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, yet were they before the world was made. And this their opinion is deemed probable, both to Saint <hi>Austen,</hi> and to the great School-doctor <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas.</hi> Which <hi>Aquinas</hi> liued after the said Councell of Lateran, and had read the same, &amp; had also written Commentaries vpon this very Canon; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, he did not repute the decree of the sayde Councell, to be an infallible rule of fayth. Loe, the generall Councell held constantly, and firmely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, that the Angels were created at one and the same time with the world. But the holy fathers and the great Papist <hi>Aquinas,</hi> thought the contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to be probable, notwithstanding the decree of the Councell. Whervpon it followeth of necessity, that that is not alway the vndoubted truth, which is decreed by a generall Councell. For which end and purpose, <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> a lerned popish bishop hath written most excellently in these wordes: <hi>Non satis est, vt Conciliorum &amp; Pontificum iudicia firma esse cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantur,</hi>

                     <hi>in diuino officio publicè à tota etiam Ecclesia ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrari.</hi> It is not enough, to make the iudgements of Councels and Popes firme, so as wee may safely beleeue them, to celebrate the same publiquely in diuine seruice, throughout the whole Church of God. These are golden wordes, they may not bee passed ouer rawly and negligently, but we must firmely imprint them in our hearts. And in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21633:29"/>
wee doubtlesse shall reape commoditie more then a little. For, if we cannot safely giue credite to the Popish seruice, which is publiquely done in their Churches: how can they, or how dare they auouch their doctrine, to bee agreeable to Gods worde? Nay, it is a worlde to heare, that the Pope is not ashamed to enforce the worlde, as much as in him lyeth: to embrace and beleeue that new no Religion, lately start vp Popish doctrine; whereof the best Popish writers, can giue no better reasons.</p>
                  <p>The generall Councell of Constance decreed firmely,<note place="margin">Concil. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant. sess. 13.</note> that it was lawfull to debarre the lay-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the one part of the Eucharist: to wit, the cuppe.<note place="margin">Concil. Basil. sess. 30.</note> And the generall Councell of Basill affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth constantly, that so to holde and doe, is not agaynst the holy institution. And yet is it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true, that the lay-people ought by Christes institution, to receyue both the kindes. Saint <hi>Paule</hi> writing to the vnpriested Corinthians,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. v. 25</note> may bee a sufficient proofe hereof. For hee tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them, that they ought according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement which hee receyued of the Lord, to drinke of the cuppe, as well as to eate of the bread. The matter is so plaine, as I deeme it a thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, to stand long vpon the same.</p>
                  <p>The Councel of Trent, (a famous general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell by Popish iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,) hath flatly decreed that to bee no matrimonie, which was euer approued ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie in the Catholique Church, and is this day perfect matrimonie by Christes institution. The
<pb facs="tcp:21633:30"/>
wordes of the Councell are these:<note place="margin">Conc. Trident sess. 8. de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>format.</note> 
                     <hi>Dubitandum non est, clandestina matrimonia libero consensu facta, rata &amp; vera esse matrimonia, quamdiu ecclesia ea irrita non fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit.</hi> There is no doubt, but clandestine and secrete matrimonies made with free consent, were perfect and true matrimonies, so long as the Church did not disanull the same.

                  <p>That generall Councels may erre, the sole and onely testimony of <hi>Panormitanus,</hi> is sufficient and of force enough against all papists:<note place="margin">Panormit. de elect. cap.

And it skilleth not if one say, that a Councell cannot erre, because Christ prayed for his church, that it should not fayle. For I say, that although a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell represent the whole vniuersall Church, yet in truth there is not truely the vniuersall Church, but representatiuely.<note place="margin">Note this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine well.</note> For the vniuersall Church consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth, of the collection of all the faithful. Whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon all the faithfull in the worlde, make this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall church, (which cannot erre,) wherof Christ himselfe is the head. The Pope is the Vicar of Christ, but not truely the heade of the church, as noteth the Glosse vpon the <hi>Clementines,</hi> which saith very well, that when the Pope is dead, the church wanteth not then an head, and this is that Church which cannot erre.</p>
                  <p>Out of these wordes I note first, that by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the great Papist <hi>Panormitan,</hi> a meere laye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> mans iudgement euen in matters of faith, ought to bee accepted and receyued before the Popes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, if that Lay-man bring better reasons, then doth the Pope.</p>
                  <p>I note secondly, that through the wonderfull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> prouidence of God, euen the enemies of the truth (the Papists I meane,) are enforced to testifie the truth against themselues, in their owne printed bookes.

is the foundation of that doctrine, which is this day established in the church of England, and in all other reformed churches throughout the Christian world.</p>
                  <p>I note thirdly, that a generall councell may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> erre, because it is not the Catholike or vniuersall church indeed. A generall councell therfore, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not any infallible iudgement.</p>

And as the great Popish Doctor <hi>Aquinas</hi> writeth:<note place="margin">Aquinas, 2.2 q. 1. art. 1. &amp; 3.</note> the former obiect of our faith, or that which wee formally belieue, is God himselfe, or that which God hath reuealed to vs: and not that which man telleth vs. For sayeth hee, faith doth not yeelde assent to any thing, but because it is reuealed of God. The publike examination of doctrine, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth to the common consent of the Church, for the peaceable gouernance thereof. For GOD is not the Author of confusion,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. v. 33.</note> but of peace.</p>

Wherefore a Bishop in Greeke, is Superintendent in Latin.

But now there remayneth a great and most important question: to wit, what remedie must bee sought to appease controuersies, when a free, godly, and lawfull generall Councell can not bee had. To which question aunswere shall bee made, in the Paragraph next following.</p>

                     <p>I haue proued at large in my booke of Motiues, that the decrees of generall Councels in these lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dayes, are nothing else but a meere mockerie and sophisticall subtiltie, to deceyue and delude the Worlde. To which booke I referre the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that shall expect a larger discourse in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. I say now for the present, that seeing generall Councels cannot be gathered togither, in such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and with such freedome, as they haue beene
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21633:39"/>
in former times of antiquity; and seeing withall, that some iudges must be designed of meere neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, to appease, end, and decide, doubts, difficulties, and controuersies in religion, least the Church should be vexed, turmoiled, and swallowed vp, with schismes, heresies, and variety of opinions: euerie Emperour and Empresse, euery King and Queen, and euery other ciuill Magistrate independent, by what title or name soeuer he be called, must before all things haue a vigilant, Christian, and religious care, to settle, establish, and plant, within their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, Realmes, Precinctes, common weales, territories, and dominions, where they haue the chiefe and independent soueraignty immediately vnder God, the pure and sincere religion of Iesus Christ, and to abandon, extirpate, and vtterly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish all schismes, heresies, errors, and superstitions whatsoeuer. This hath euer beene the religious care of all godly and zealous Princes, aswell before Christ in time of the olde testament, as since Christ in time of the new testament. Holy <hi>Moses</hi> tooke the molten Calfe, which <hi>Aaron</hi> the High Priest to please the people had made, burnt it in the fire,<note place="margin">Exod. 32. v. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20.21.22.23.</note> bet it to powder, strowed it in the water, and made the people to drinke thereof.

                     <p>King <hi>David</hi> ordered, disposed, and reformed the Priestes and Leuits, in their offices and functions ecclesiasticall.

                     <p>King <hi>Iosaphat</hi> appointed in Ierusalem Priestes and Leuits,<note place="margin">2. par. 19.</note> and Princes of the Families of Israell, that they might iudge the iudgement and cause of the Lord, to the inhabitantes of the land.

And (which is to bee noted,<note place="margin">2. Par. 29. v. 11.</note>) he called the Priestes and Leuites his sonnes, in regard of his royall power and estate, in which respect hee was the Father of all his people: for otherwise, hee was but a Child, and for yeares might haue had many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue bin his father.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Iosias</hi> brake the Altars of <hi>Baalim,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Par. 34.</note> destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Groues, burnt the bones of the idolatrous Priestes vpon their altars, and purged <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> from idolatrie.</p>
                     <p>This religious care had the noble Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, who, (as reporteth <hi>Eusebius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eusebius Caesariens: de vita Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tini.</note>) thought nothing to pertaine more to his royall charge, then to plant true religion throughout his realmes and dominions. S. <hi>Austen</hi> proueth the facts and examples of the Kinges of the old Testament,<note place="margin">August. epist. 48. ad vincent.</note> to haue beene figures of the new Testament; and consequently, that it is the duty of all kinges in this time of grace, to haue speciall regard to the seruice and true worship of God; to abandon all false wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe, idolatrie, errors, heresies, and superstition; and to plant the Gospell of Christ Iesus in all the partes of their realmes and dominions.</p>
                     <p>The same S. <hi>Austen</hi> in an other place, among
<pb facs="tcp:21633:41"/>
many golden sentences,<note place="margin">August. epist. 50. ad Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac.</note> (which I now omit in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of breuitie,) hath these expresse words; <hi>In hoc ergo reges seruiunt Domino, in quantum reges sunt, cum ea faciunt ad seruiendum illi, quae non possunt facere, nisi reges.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this therefore do kinges serue God, as they are kings, when they do hold those things, which none can doe but onelie kinges. Where me must seriou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly obserue this reduplication of S. <hi>Austen,</hi> (kings as kings,) as a point of great importance. For kinges (as the same father teleth vs,) serue God two waies: as they be men, and as they be kings. As men, they serue God in liuing a Christian and godly life: but as king, they serue God in making godly lawes, for the punishment of blasphemers, idolaters, heretiks, and all kind of malefactors. And this is that, which S. <hi>Austen</hi> saith, none can doe but kinges, as rhey are kinges.</p>
                     <p>Yea, this is that, which the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> telleth vs,<note place="margin">Esa. 49. v. 23.</note> when he saith, That kinges shall bee the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Fathers of the Church, and Queenes her nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For albeit the Ministery of feeding, of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the worde, and administration of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts pertaine onely to the ministers, neyther may the meere ciuill Magistrate in any wise meddle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: yet for all that, it is most true, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision for the foode, the ouersight that the children of God bee duely fed, and that the Ministers doe exercise their functions in vigilant &amp; dutifull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, belongeth to the ciuill, independent, and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Princes. For this respect is it, that kinges and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21633:41"/>
Queenes haue the name of Nurses, not to nourish their children in ciuill matters and corporall foode onely; but as in ciuill, so also in spirituall, that is, <hi>In lacte verbi Dei,</hi> in the milke of the worde of God. For though the execution pertain to the ministers, yet the prouision, direction, appointment, care, and ouersight (which is the sepreme gouernment,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth onely, soly, and wholy to the Prince, as is already proued.</p>
                     <p>Now to the question proposed in the former Paragraffe, vz. What remedie is to be had,<note place="margin">The aunswere to the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proposed in the third Paragraffe.</note> when a free and lawfull general Councell cannot be had. To this question I answere, that when any contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies shall arise to the disturbance of the Peace of the church, then euery absolute and independent ciuill Magistrate, must commaund his Archbishop, Bishoppe, and other learned Ministers within his territories and dominions, to come together, and to celebrate a Nationall Councell or Synode, and then and there to debate, discusse, and decide the controuersie in religion. And he must charge them, (as did the religious kinges, <hi>Dauid, Salomon, Iosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat, Ezechias, Iosias,</hi> and the rest, of whom menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is already made:) to haue the fear of God before their eyes, and carefully to examine all doubts, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, contentions, and controuersies in religion, according to the infallible rule of the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This done, the same ciuill independent magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, must call together his wife and graue Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers, and after mature deliberation had with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, confirme whatsoeuer shal tend to the aduancement
<pb facs="tcp:21633:42"/>
of Gods glory, and the peace of his church. And withall, he must publish sharpe penall statutes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all such, as shal with disloyall contumacy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate and transgresse the same. Thus did the good kings <hi>Reccaredus,</hi> and <hi>Constantinus,</hi> and this is this day most prudently and christianly obserued, in the church of <hi>England,</hi> God be thanked for it. For first, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Archbishops, Byshops, and other learned Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, come all together in the Conuocation-house, and there dispute, discusse, determine, &amp; set down, what they finde conuenient for the Peace of the Church, and correspondent to the infallible rule of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Gods word. Secondly, this done, they present the same to her most excellent Maiesty, most humbly crauing her royall assent for the confirmation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Thirdly, her Maiesty after consultation had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> with her graue Counsellers, doth confirme and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorise by vertue of her royall and princely prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue, whatsoeuer seemeth expedient for the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gouernment of her louing subiectes, and withall enacteth necessary penall lawes, against the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent contumacy of seditious and disloyall peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                     <p>This godly and most christian maner, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in religious causes: is so liuely set downe before our eyes, in the honourable fact of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spanish king <hi>Reccaredus,</hi> as it is able to penetrate the very heart, and throughly to perswade euery one, that shall ponder the same seriously, and in the feare of God. This religious king <hi>Reccaredus</hi> in the year of our Lord, 585. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded al the Bishops with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21633:42"/>
in his dominions of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Galicia,</hi> to come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in his royall Citie of <hi>Toledo,</hi> to confute and condemne the Arrian heresie. When they were come thether,<note place="margin">In ipso initio concilii tolet. tertii.</note> the king sate downe in the middest of them, and declared the cause that moued him to call them together. After that hee enacted a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Edict, for the inuiolable obseruation of all the decrees of the counsell, straitely charging aswell the Clergie as the Laitie, to obeye and keepe the same. Lastly, hee subscribed his owne name, and that before all the Bishoppes, who in their due places subscribed after the king. These are the expresse wordes of the king, set down in the end of the said Edict: <hi>Flauius Reccaredus rex,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Habentur in a Tomo conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorum.</note> 
                        <hi>hanc deliberationem quam cum sancta definiuimus Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, confirmans, subscripsi.</hi> I <hi>Flauius Reccaredus</hi> the king, confirming this consultation, which wee haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined with the holy Synode, haue subscribed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. The next that subscribed after the king, was <hi>Mausona</hi> the Metropolitane Bishoppe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of <hi>Lusitania.</hi> After him subscribed <hi>Euphemius,</hi> the Archbishoppe of <hi>Toledo.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ecclesiae Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritensis Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politanus.</note> The residue followed in order, as in the Councell is to be seen. These par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular subscriptions I note, as a matter of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against the Papistes: who will grant no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue, or royall place to kinges, in time of eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Synodes.</p>
                     <p>Out of these wordes contayned in the kinges subscription, I note first, that the king confirmed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the councell. Secondly, that the king subscribed to the Decrees of the Councel. Thirdly, that the king <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21633:43"/>
subscribed before all the Bishops. Fourthly, that the king decreed and defined the controuersies, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Bishops. To which I adde for the complement in the fift place, that the councell was called, and the Bishoppes assembled, at the kinges commaundement. For so saith the Councell. <hi>Cum pro fidei suae synceritate idem gloriosissimus princeps, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes regiminis sui Pontifices in vnum conuenire mandas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>When the same most glorious prince for the sincerity of his faith, had commaunded all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops within his dominions, do come together to <hi>Toledo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This was the practise of godly Princes, aboue a thousand yeares ago; when royall Prerogatiues were not brought into thraldome, by popish ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</p>

                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:21633:43"/>I say thirdly, that the great popish Archbishops <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                        <hi>Panormitanus</hi> telleth vs, (as is alreadie proued,<note place="margin">Gerson. prim. parte, de exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat. doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar. consider. 5</note>) that a priuate mans iudgement is better then the Popes. To which I must needes add the wordes of doctor <hi>Gerson</hi> the Chancellor of Paris, and a renowmed popish writer, which are these: <hi>Quilibet homo doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus potest &amp; debet toti concilio risistere, si videat illud ex malitia, vel ignorantia errare.</hi> Euerie one that is lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, may and ought to resist and stand against a whole Councell, if hee perceiue that the Councell erreth, either of ignorance, or of malice. Lo, all that I say is true, euen by the popish doctrine. And so no Papist can with reason, denie or gain-say the same. For first, you see by <hi>Gersons</hi> doctrine, that a generall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Councell may erre. Secondly, that a priuate man,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> both may and ought to withstand the Councell, when the generall Councell would decree agaynst the truth. Thirdly, that lay-men haue euer beene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> present in Councels, and there deliuered freely their opinions. Which freedome by late popish tyrannie, is this day banished out of the Church. I say fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> a famous Schoole-doctor and popish Bishop, shall conclude and knit vp this discourse. These are his expresse words; <hi>Praestanti quod in se est, Deus fidem ad salutem necessariam non ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat. Sequitur; no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. n. vnctio quemcunque simpliciter docet de omnibus, sed quemque de his quae sunt ei propria, &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaria.

Sicut. n. gustus bene affectus, differentias saporum facile discernit, sic ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi
<pb facs="tcp:21633:44"/>
optima affectio facit, vt homo doctrinam Dei ad salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem necessariam discernat, ab errore contrario qui ex Deo non est.</hi> To the man that doeth what in him lieth, God neuer denieth faith necessarie to saluation. For the vnction doth not simply teach euerie one euerie thing, but it teacheth euerie one so much, as is proper and necessarie for him. And we grant free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that doctrine necessarie for euery mans life and state, is sufficiently knowne to him, that doth the will of God. For like as the well affected taste, doth easily discerne the differences of sauours or tastes; so doth the good affection of the minde bring to passe, that a man may discerne the doctrine of God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to saluation, from contrarie error which is not of God.</p>
                     <p>Thus writeth the grauest and rarest Papist for learning, in the vniuersall worlde; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, it is and must be of great force against the Papist, whatsoeuer hath passed from his penne. And I protest vnto thee gentle Reader, that nothing hath more estraunged me from poperie, and set me at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance with it; then the cleare and perspicuous doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, of the best learned and most renowmed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists. For whosoeuer will seriously peruse, the bookes that I haue published to the view of the world: shall therein find confirmed by the doctrine of the best approued Papists, euery poynt of setled doctrine in the Church of England.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Out of these wordes of this learned Papist, I note first, that when S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, the vnction teacheth vs all things,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 2. v. 27</note> he meaneth not the difficult questions in
<pb n="04" facs="tcp:21633:44"/>
Religion, but all such poyntes as are necessarie for euerie mans saluation.</p>
                     <p>In note secondly, that no man wanteth this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and iudgement of doctrine, but he that is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ignorant, and will not applie himselfe to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the said knowledge.</p>
                     <p>I note thirdly, that euerie priuate man, is able to-iudge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and discerne true doctrine from falsehoode and error, so farre forth as is requisite for his salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as well as a sound and good taste, is able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the differences of tastes. Hereupon I inferre this necessarie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequent of popish doctrine, against the Pope himselfe. vz. that many wise, godly, and learned Bishops with other ministers of the church, assembled in a nationall Synode, at the command of their naturall Soueraigne; are able to discerne so much truth from falshoode and error, as is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ether for their owne soules health, or for the publique peace of the Church. God graunt, that this doctrine may take deepe roote in the hearts of the readers: to his glorie, the good of their soules, and the peace of the Church. Amen.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE swaggering diuine, and hote spurmate, <hi>E. O.</hi> telleth the Reader in his Preface, that hee was once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to haue adioyned me poor soule, to the vertuous, graue, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Writers, M. D. <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> and M. <hi>Willet:</hi> but he altered his purpose, (if wee may beleeue him,) for these two respectes. First, for certaine conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to himselfe well knowne, (as yee must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,) but may not in any wise be disclosed to the world. Secondly, because the confutation of my worthy workes, (as hee scoffingly termeth them,)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is already vndertaken, and must bee published, if it shall be thought necessary. Thus discourseth this
<pb facs="tcp:21633:50"/>
counterfeit companion, remember well his words. Concerning this determination, I thinke it very expedient to notifie to the Reader, these fiue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> adiuncts. First, that I published in Print to the view of the world, my booke of Motiues, in the yeare, 1593. my suruey of Popery in the yeare, 1596. and my hunting of the Romish Foxe, in the yeare 1598.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">In my Motiues lib. 2. cap. 1.</note>In the first of these Bookes, I offered publike dispute with what Seminarie in <hi>England</hi> soeuer, no one or other excepted whosoeuer: protesting in the same worke to proceed so sincerely, as if I could by the aduersarie be conuinced, eyther to alledge any Writer corruptly, or to quote any place guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, or to charge any author falsly: I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer require credite at the Readers handes, neither in that booke, nor in any other.</p>
                  <p>I protested likewise in the saide book, that if any Papist in <hi>England,</hi> or else where in <hi>Europe,</hi> coulde truely and substantially confute the same: I would once again embrace the late Romish religion, thogh I did then, and still do hate and detest the same, as the mortall poyson of my soule.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that about two yeares after the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of my Motiues, I did essoones in my Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey of Popery, challenge all English Iesuites and Seminaries, to aunswere my said Bookes: promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vnfainedlie vnder my hand, that if any of them could yeeld a sufficient answere in their defence, I would doubtles subscribe vnto his doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that all Iesuites and Seminaries, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21633:50"/>
all the former challenges, haue beene si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent aboue eight whole years, and neuer yet durst aduenture to frame any aunswere, to any one of the saide bookes, and to publish the same to the view of the world.</p>
                  <p>At the last, in the end of the yeare, 1602. a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Pamphlet, and scurrilous libell is published, by an odde masked companion, who naming himselfe <hi>E.O.</hi> hath set a broach, a rude lying hotch-potch of Omnigitherum, I know not well how to tearme it, or what to make of it. But I hope in God to turn it topsie toruie, ere I make an end.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that if the Iesuites or Seminaries, could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> haue framed any true and sincere answere: nay, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny likely or colourable answere, to all, or to any one of the said Bookes: they would haue done it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, and that many yeares ago.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, that when the said counterfaite <hi>E O.</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the world in hand, that now at the last in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> yeare 1603. the confutation of the said books is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken: he doth but bestirre himselfe with might and maine, to dazell the eyes of the simple Readers and of others, that shall heare thereof: that they may still bee seduced with Popish Legerdemain from time to time, and not behold the Sunne shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at noone tide. Who all must receyue in the end, the iust reward of their folly: euen the flappe of a Foxe tayle. I proue it, by these euident and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluble reasons. First, because he saith, the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation must be published, if it shalbe thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. For I pray you, is not this a merry iest? The
<pb facs="tcp:21633:51"/>
Iesuites and Seminarie Priests, haue consulted now for the space of eight yeares fully complete and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and haue all that time deuised how to frame some colourable answere at the least, to all or some of the saide bookes: and in the end of the yeare, 1602. haue vndertaken the confutation thereof: but for all that cannot yet tell, whether it bee expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to publish the said confutation, or no. Oh sweet Iesus? are these men the great Statists of the world? are these men the skilfull Polititians, that must ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage all Europe? are these men our learned diuines? are these men they indeed, vppon whose doctrine and guiding all Lay-Papistes doe depend, and on their shoulders doe hang their soules and their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation? doubtles, they may preach this goodly ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Wisemen, and repute themselues for very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> noddie and starke fooles. Secondly, because af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>E. O.</hi> and his complices haue tossed and turned, volued and reuolued, all the parts of all my books, and played all their trickes, and fetched all their friscoles: their crestes are fallen, their spirites ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant are become couchant, and all that they can deuise to obiect against mee, is nothing else in the world, but one silly falsly so supposed contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For can any Wiseman thinke, if they had any better stuffe, which could better serue their turne, or giue more credite to their cause, or be more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to satisfie the peoples long expectation: that they would conceale it for my sake, and the loue they beare to me? No, no, (my dearest,) they meane no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse. They will neuer while I liue, publish
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21633:51"/>
any such confutation. Their own consciences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them, they know they are not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it. I would most gladly, (I protest before God and the world,) once see any such confutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> during my life: &amp; therfore here once again, I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> that trayterous Iesuite, (whom I take to be this masked <hi>E. O.) George Blackwell</hi> that seditious Arch-priest, as the seculars tearme him: and all other English Iesuites and Seminaries, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer and wheresoeuer: daring them all to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the confutation of my saide bookes. They are many in number, and they busie themselues with publishing other needles bookes, Pamphlets, and libels: and consequently, they must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, and will vndoubtedly, accept of this chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, now after so many yeares, and after so long consultation, and mature deliberation: aswell for their owne credites sake, as for the consolation of their silly seduced Popelinges, if they dare take the matter in hand. But alas they haue said all they can, and done what they were able possibly to performe.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Ope <hi>Siricius</hi> (as <hi>Thomas Bell</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,<note place="margin">Preface, p. 10.</note>) was seduced by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, published wicked doctrine, and taught the flat doctrine of the diuell. These are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse wordes of <hi>E. O.</hi> whom (as it seemeth) the Diuell did euen then possesse, when hee vttered them. For not one of these words, (taught the flat doctrine of the Deuill,) can bee found in my Suruey, in the place which <hi>E. O.</hi> hath quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but these wordes, which he of purpose did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: (prohibited marriage as an vnlawfull thing.) This therefore is a notorious, and a most malitious lye.<note place="margin">The first lie of E. O.</note> It is a lye in graine, and that a knocker, (to vse his owne words else where:) adorned with the name of the Diuell, to giue the more grace vnto it. And that worthily, because the Deuill is the Architect and chiefe workeman, in that arte and occupation. Where I wish the Reader to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue seriously, that my proceeding in all my books hath beene such and so sincere, as the aduersaries for the space of eight whole yeares, can but espie one onelie (falsly so supposed) contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: neyther that, but by belying mee,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21633:52"/>
and by falsifying my wordes. So then, it is hereby most apparant to all the worlde; that if they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny iust matter agaynst me, they woulde load my backe till my bones should cracke. This is <hi>E. O.</hi> his first lie.</p>
                  <p>The second lie of <hi>E. O.</hi> is contained in these his wordes;<note place="margin">P 37. The second lie of E.O.</note> both <hi>Bell</hi> and <hi>Gough</hi> giue the lie to maister <hi>Sutcliffe,</hi> denying prayer to Saints to bee auncient; and <hi>Gough</hi> to <hi>Bell,</hi> affirming that it was not knowne, till the yeare of our Lord, 370. For both <hi>Origen</hi> and Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> liued before that time. This is an other notorious lie, as shall bee cleared by an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent demonstration.</p>
                  <p>I therefore say first, that <hi>Vitium Scriptoris,</hi> the negligence, ignorance, and ouersight of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hath beene &amp; often is the cause of many faults extant in my bookes, which I note here once for al, wishing the reader euer to haue the same in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. This is apparant two wayes: first, because this number of 370. should haue beene 350. as is euident by the sixt Canon. Secondly,<note place="margin">Suruey. p. 338.</note> for that the number of 274. in my suruey, is otherwise in my booke intituled (the hunting of the Romish Foxe:) viz. 1215. and so the indifferent Reader may easily perceyue, that the calumniation and cauill of <hi>E. O.</hi> proceedeth of meere malice against the truth.</p>
                  <p>I say secondly, that the famous popish writer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>Aquinas,</hi> surnamed the Angelicall doctor; will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse with me against <hi>E. O.</hi> to his euerlasting shame in this combat. These are his expresse wordes:<note place="margin">Aquinas. 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Againe in an other place, the same Author hath these words:<note place="margin">Aquinas 2.2. q. 110. art. 1.</note>

vtter falshood; then there is falshood materially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause falshood is auouched; and there is falshoode formally, because there is a will to speake falsly; and there is also falshood effectiuely, for that there is a will to imprint falshoode, (in the hearts of others.)

Whatsoeuer therfore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from this fountaine, the Papists must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force receiue it, as pure and wholsome water. And for this end I haue imployed my labors, to set down his wordes at large.</p>
                  <p>Out of these golden wordes and sound doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of this graue Writer, a verie learned man in deed, (though elsewhere in sundrie points he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mans imperfections,) I note first, that a man may speake the truth, and yet bee a lier; to wit, when hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> thinketh that truth which he vttereth, to be a lie.</p>
                  <p>I note secondly, that a man may speake falsely,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and vtter an vntruth, and yet be no lyer at all. The
<pb facs="tcp:21633:54"/>
reason of both the assertions is euident, by the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of this famous Papist; (whose doctrine herein is also the constant doctrine of Saint <hi>Austen,</hi> as shortly shall be proued,) Because forsooth, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malitie of a lie doth precisely and properly consist, in the intention of the speaker. This point is yet more apparant, by these wordes of the selfe same Writer: <hi>Si vero aliquis formaliter falsum dicat, habens voluntatem falsum dicendi; licet sit verum id quod dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, in quantum tamen buiusmodi actus est voluntarius &amp; moralis, habet per se falsitatem, &amp; per accidens veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem. Vnde ad speciem mendatii pertingit.</hi> If a man shall vtter a falshoode formally, being minded to speake falsly, then although it be true which he sayth, yet seeing such an action is voluntarie and morall, it implyeth falshood <hi>per se</hi> and of it owne nature, and truth but onely accidentally. And so it reacheth, to the nature of a lie.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine is confirmed by the testimonie of Saint <hi>Austen,</hi> that worthie Father and mightie piller of Christes Church. These are his words: <hi>Non omnis qui falsum dicit,</hi>

Wherevpon it commeth, that one may vtter a falshood, and bee no lier, if he thinketh it be as he sayth, though it bee not so in deed. And likewise that one may speake the truth, and be a lier, if he thinke it be false, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth it for a truth, though in very deed it be as hee saith. For one must be iudged a liar, or not a liar, of his owne mind and meaning, not of the veritie or falsehoode of the things in themselues.

                  <p>I note thirdly, that it is impossible for mee to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> haue giuen the lie, to the reuerend, worthie, and godly learned man, maister Doctor <hi>Sutcliffe</hi>; as <hi>E. O.</hi> that shamelesse calumniator, doeth most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently affirme. The reason is euident, if the foundation which Saint <hi>Austen</hi> and <hi>Aquinas</hi> haue laide, bee well remembred; because forsooth, I published my Suruey manie yeares before maister Doctor <hi>Sutcliffes</hi> newe chalenge, whereof <hi>E. O.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:21633:55"/>
speaketh in his Detection. And consequently, I could not haue any intention (as the world know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,) once to thinke of that future challenge, which then was not in <hi>esse</hi>; much lesse coulde I haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to giue the lie, to that reuerende and woorthie man, for anie thing conteyned in the same.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> I note fourthly, that the foule-mouthed swagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Diuine <hi>E. O.</hi> is both materially and formally an impudent liar in verie deede. I proue the same ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, because he doth not onely auouch a fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, but also hath a minde and intention so to do; wherein consisteth the formalitie of a lie, and without which none can be a liar, as is already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. But this sillie Diuine <hi>E. O.</hi> who so bestirreth himselfe to giue the lie to others, seemeth not to vnderstand or know what a lie is in verie deed: but hath neede to goe againe to the Schoole, to learne the true nature and essence thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, because I affirme the verie selfe same thing in effect, which maister <hi>Gough</hi> doth affirme; who for all that, (as this impudent lyar <hi>E. O.</hi> auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, but with a brazen face,) doth giue the lie to me. For I proue and shew by degrees, how late po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish inuocation of Saintes crept into the Church, and I haue put downe seuen Canons with six con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions to that effect. In the fourth Canon, I proue that in the dayes of <hi>Origen,</hi> the first seede of inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints began to be sowne. In the fift Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, I proue that about twentie years after <hi>Origen,</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:21633:55"/>
it became a setled doctrine, which in the dayes of <hi>Origen</hi> was but opinatiue and disputable. In the sixt Canon, I proue that about an hundred yeares after Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> some of the Fathers by Rhetoricall apostrophees, did applie their Orations to the dead, as if they had beene liuing. Who though they did but inuocate the Saints figuratiuely, and of a certaine excessiue zeale; yet did such their inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions minister occasion to the Papists, of all their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition in that behalfe. And in my aunswere to an obiection of the seuenth Canon, I say plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that late Popish inuocation had in the yeare 400. after Christ, gotten deepe roote in the hearts of the vulgar sort. Whereupon it is most appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to all indifferent Readers, that the swaggering Diuine <hi>E. O.</hi> is condemned in his owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when he affirmeth maister <hi>Gough</hi> to be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to mee, touching my doctrine of inuocation of Saints. For I doe affirme vniformely with maister <hi>Gough,</hi> that inuocation of Saints was in some degree, euen in the dayes of Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and of <hi>Origen</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. Albeit I truly say withall, that it tooke not deepe roote in the peoples hearts, for many yeares after them.</p>
                  <p>I note fiftly, that maister Doctor <hi>Sutcliffe,</hi> (if I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> bee not deceyued,) doth by the auncient Church vnderstande the primatiue Church, which is most truly and properly called the ancient Church. VVhich Church doubtlesse, knewe no Popish inuocation of Saintes, as I haue proued in my Suruey. For aunswere to which booke, or to any
<pb facs="tcp:21633:56"/>
of the rest, published now many yeares ago, neither this hote-spurre mate <hi>E. O.</hi> nor any other English Iesuite, or Iesuited Seminarie, dare for their lugges encounter with mee. So then, there is a sweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, but no discord at all: in the writings of mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Sutcliffe,</hi> of maister <hi>Gough,</hi> and of my selfe.</p>

                  <p>In the said second booke of Motiues, in the ninth Chapter and fift conclusion, the Reader shall finde these expresse wordes: Albeit popish auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession be so magnified with Papists, that euerie one is commaunded vnder paine of damnation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the same, as instituted by Christ himselfe; yet was it not an article of popish fayth, for the space of one thousand and fiue hundred yeares after Christ.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21633:56"/>
These are my expresse wordes in that place.</p>
                  <p>Here I heartily desire all people that are careful of their saluation, especially such as are deuoted to the Iesuites: and I craue it for the tender mercy of God in the bowels of Christ Iesus, to marke at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuely what I shall sincerely deliuer, as I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere God at the dreadfull day of generall doome.</p>
                  <p>I therefore say first, that the author of this lewde Pamphlet, and scurrilous libell, intituled the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of vntruthes, who concealeth his name not daring to auouch it to the world, (but seemeth to be <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> the Iesuite, <hi>alias</hi> Bastard <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucke,</hi> expelled out of <hi>Baliol</hi> Colledge in Oxford, for his illegitimation, libelling, and factious dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, who will affirme or denie anie thing, as his owne deare brothers the secular Priestes write of him,) hath incurred the censures of their church, and is become an excommunicate person, for publishing this lewde libell and slaunderous Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet. I proue it, because the generall councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> celebrated in the yeare 1515. prohibiteth vnder the paine of excommunication, to print or cause to be printed, any booke or scripture whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, in any Cittie or Diocesse wheresoeuer, vnles the same be first diligently examined by the Bishop of the same Diocesse, or by his Deputie, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by their owne hand. And it will not serue the Iesuites turne, to say or pretend for his excuse, that the pope hath dispenced with their sect, to print bookes and libels at their pleasure. For a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall councell hath power to make constitutions,
<pb facs="tcp:21633:57"/>
which the Pope is bound to obey: but the Pope hath no such power ouer the councell, to which he is and must be subiect. This doctrine is flatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, in two famous popish generall Councels, <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basill.</hi> Yet to this day was it neuer heard of in the world, that an inferiour could make lawes to tie his superior, or by his owne power exempt himselfe or others, from the obedience hee oweth to the lawes of his superior.</p>
                  <p>I say secondly, that this shameles Iesuite must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of necessitie, condemne himselfe in his own consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when he sayeth, that I affirme auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, to haue been established in the yeare 254. and l proue it by an euident demonstration. For, though I made mention of the time in three seueral bookes: to witte, in my Motiues, in my Suruey, and in my hunting of the Romish Foxe: yet did I that but <hi>obiter</hi> in the two latter bookes, referring the Reader to my first Booke, that is, to my Booke of Motiues. In which booke I handled the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on indeede, and decided it by popish approbation: there affirming in expresse wordes, that Popish au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular confession was not an article of Popish faith, for the space of one thousand &amp; fiue hundred yeares after Christ. Which number is set down without figures in that place, and so lesse subiect to falshood, or corruption. But in the other bookes the number is put downe in figures, and so more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily subiect to alteration: especially, seeing my self was distant from the Presse, well neare two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles.</p>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I say thirdly, that all the difficultie in vntying this knot, consisteth precisely, and specially in this: because<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> forsooth, I say in my Suruey, that the Bishops of Rome were godly men till S. <hi>Austens</hi> time, and long after him; and yet withall, I doe charge Pope <hi>Siricius</hi> to haue published wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked doctrine, and Pope <hi>Sozomene</hi> to haue falsifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the councell of Nice. This is the knot, that as our Iesuite <hi>E. O.</hi> thinketh, cannot bee vntied. If I can find out the endes of this knot, a more large subiect (saith he,) must be prouided for my learning to worke vpon. A worthy reward of so mighty a Personage, for the vnfolding of one silly knot. Well, I vndertake in Gods name, to find out the ends of this knot: expecting that <hi>E. O.</hi> will for his credites sake, performe his promise made here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For the clearing of which difficultie, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding of which knot, I desire the gentle Reader <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to obserue these pointes with me. First, that it is one thing to publish wicked doctrine; an other thing, to teach wicked doctrine publikely. The case is cleare and euident.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Sccondly, that Ministers of the Church may be called godly men, either in respect of their publike doctrine and preaching, or in regard of their good life, and holy conuersation. For this cause did our Sauiour Christ commaund the people to obserue and doe,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. v. 3.</note> whatsoeuer the Scribes and Pharisies did preach vnto them, but not to doe after their
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21633:58"/>
works. And he added the reason thereof, because saith Christ, they say &amp; do not. Lo, Christ reputeth the Scribes and Pharisies, both godly and wicked men. Godly, in respect of their publike doctrine: wicked, in regard of their sinful liues. For doubtles, Christ did not commaund the people to obey wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, as they are wicked, but as they are god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: that is to say, as they deliuered godly doctrine to them. Euen so do I say of Pope <hi>Siricius</hi> and Pope <hi>Sozimus,</hi> that they were godly Bishoppes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their publike doctrine, as who neyther taught nor decreed publikely, any materiall point of doctrine, contrarie to the doctrine of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> This aunswere is confirmed, by the vsuall practise of all Papistes euery where. For they terme euery Bishop of Rome, their holy Father the Pope. And this notwithstanding, they freely graunt, as I haue proued in my booke of Motiues: that one Pope entered into the Popedome, as a Foxe: raigned in it, as a Wolfe: and died out of it, as a dogge. That an other Pope gaue himselfe to the Diuell, that so the diuell might effect his designements. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so graunt, that euery Pope may erre in his priuate person, and become an Heretike, an Idolater, an Atheist, and whatsoeuer els. And so they cannot all be termed holy Fathers, in respect of their liues, or personall doctrine taught priuate lie. They must therefore terme them holy, in regard of their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like doctrine, agreeable to the doctrine of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors: though they be very often wicked, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their liues and conuersations. So were <hi>Siri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:21633:59"/>
and <hi>Sozimus</hi> good Popes, <hi>secundum quid,</hi> but not <hi>simpliciter.</hi> Thirdly, it is the vsuall course of holy Scripture, to speake of many, as of all: to terme all wicked, when the greater part is wicked: and all godly, when the greater part is godly. This is the constant doctrine both of <hi>S. Austen,</hi>

                  <p>I say fiftly, that 18. Bishops at the Nicene councel <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> were of a different opinion from the rest, &amp; yet are the decrees termed the decrees of the Bishops in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generall.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> I say sixtly, that the Iesuites and Seminaries are at their wits end, and know not in the world what
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21633:59"/>
to aunswere to my bookes. The reason is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to euery childe: for that now after many yeares, they can finde out nothing at all in any of my Bookes, sauing one onely contradiction falsly so supposed.

contradiction indeed, but as they falsly or rather malitiously pretend vnto the Reader. Where the Reader, (if he be wise and indifferent,) must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force condemne them and their religion, in that they dare not aduenture to encounter with my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which doth touch them and their holy father the Pope so narrowly, that many perceyuing it, haue renounced both him, them, and their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And I nothing doubt, but these silly euasions and poore shiftes, which they are driuen vnto: will be a meane vnder God, to cause many moe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all Popish faction, euery day more then other.</p>
                  <p>To shew the insufficiency of the Iesuites and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries, and that they know not possibly what to say, or how to deale concerning the aunswering of my bookes: I haue thought good to insert in this place, the wordes of a letter, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciall of the Iesuites in England <hi>Henry Garnet</hi> by name, addressed to his fellowes being then in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation, how to frame some kind of answere to my bookes. These are the expresse wordes of his letter, which by a friend of mine came very lately to my hands.</p>

Whereby he will be moued to vtter, not only al imperfections which he knoweth of our fellowes, but also those things which ought to be most surely sealed vp, the man being past all grace and shame. Neuerthelesse for this matter, as you shal al agree, for I doubt not, but so many and such will see what is best.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I answere secondly, that though the Papists be greatly troubled about my bookes, and doe often consult among themselues, how to frame some aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere therevnto: yet can they not this day tell, what is expedient for them to doe in that behalfe.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21633:61"/>
be done in that matter. Whereupon it followeth of necessitie, that it is a matter of great moment, and of no smal importance. For otherwise, a man of rare wisedome, and deepe iudgement, (such as our Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites vsually be, especially those Iesuites, who are elected to be prouincials, and rulers of all others within a whole Prouince,) could not but know in much lesse time, then 8: or 9. yeares: what were fit, meete, &amp; expedient to be done, concerning the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering of my bookes.

Secondly, that if the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites be guiltie in their own consciences, of greater crimes &amp; offences, then the secular Priests haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered to the world; then certes, they are so farre from being Saints, that they are more like the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of hell.

But as he truly sayth, they see what is the best to be done. As if he should haue said; the best is, to passe ouer the matter with silence, as wee haue done heretofore. For his doctrine is sound, grounded vpon the Scriptures, Councels, Fathers, and the practise of the ancient Church: and we are not able to gainsay the same.
