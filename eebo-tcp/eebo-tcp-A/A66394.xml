            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> To this I ſhall add for a concluſion, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the late Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Seventh, in a Brief he ſent to the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> about a Tranſlation of the Miſſal into that Language, at that time newly publiſhed; in which he ſaith, that <q>Some Sons of Perdition had arrived to that mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as to Tranſlate and Publiſh it, &amp;c. A No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty we abhor and deteſt as the Seed-plot of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, raſhneſs, ſedition, and ſchiſm, and of many other evils, and therefore that French Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, or what ſhall hereafter be publiſhed in any other manner, we condemn, reprobate and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From all which we may perceive, what an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent repugnancy there is betwixt the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that of <hi>Rome</hi> in the matter before us: And therefore for the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the Caſe and diſcerning which is in the Right, and which in the Wrong, I ſhall diſcourſe of it in the following order.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhall conſider the Phraſe, <hi>an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown Tongue.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:62571:5"/>
Secondly, I ſhall enquire into the lawfulneſs and expediency of celebrating Divine Service in a Tongue not underſtood by the People. For ſo much is affirmed by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ſhall enquire, whether the celebrating Service in a Tongue not underſtood by the people, hath been the antient cuſtome of every Church? For ſo much alſo is affirmed by that Council, and denyed by the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, I ſhall conſider, whether the Proviſion made by the foreſaid Council, of having <hi>Some part of the Maſs expounded,</hi> be ſufficient to countervail the miſchief of having the whole in a Tongue not underſtood by the people, and to excuſe that Church in their injunction of it?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I ſhall enquire whether upon the whole, the publick Service of God ought not to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a Tongue vulgarly underſtood? Which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition whoſoever holds, is anathematized by the foreſaid Council: And yet is owned by the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>The uſe of all this niceneſs, is partly to clear the ſtate of the Queſtion, and partly to prevent many of the Objections which the caſe is cumbred with: And without the obſerving of which, the Diſpute will be turned from the point that is controverted, to that which is not.

For ſometimes they oppoſe the Dialects of a Tongue to that Tongue of which they are the Dialects: At other times they oppoſe the common Tongue to the Vulgar: Sometimes they confound the Learned Tongue with the common: And then again oppoſe the learned and utterly unknown, as if theſe two were of as different kinds as known and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.</p>

Would they farther ſhew that the Divine Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp;c. were not of old ſo tranſlated? they attempt to prove it from their not having been tranſlated into different Dialects. As if the Dialects of a Tongue differed as much from each other, and all
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62571:7"/>
from the main Tongue of a Nation, as a learned Tongue differs from the Vulgar. Which is (to ſpeak charitably) for want of obſerving, that the Dialects are but ſeveral modes of ſpeaking the ſame Tongue; and that ordinarily there is ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Standard, which (as I have ſaid) over-rules the reſt, and is a guide common to all: As here in <hi>England,</hi> notwithſtanding there be ſeveral Dialects, and that there is one in <hi>Scotland</hi> differs much from them all; yet there is but one Tranſlation of the Bible, and one Service for the uſe of the whole, and that is fully if not equally underſtood by all.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, would they prove, that anciently <note place="margin">Ledeſma, c. <hi>9.</hi> n. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note>the Chriſtian Churches uſed not a Vulgar Tongue in Divine Service? they preſently multiply Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities to ſhew, that in many places they uſed <hi>Greek</hi>

As if the <hi>common Tongue</hi> (for ſuch were thoſe <hi>two</hi> in elder times, where they were not the Vulgar) was oppoſed to the Vulgar, as much as unknown is to known; and each was inconſiſtent <note place="margin">Bellarm. de ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo, l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>15.</hi>
                  </note>with the other. Thus they tell us from S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> 
                  <q>That the Vulgar Tongue in <hi>Galatia</hi> was in effect the ſame with that of the <hi>Treviri</hi> in <hi>Germany:</hi> And yet there, and in the neighbouring Countries, they had the Scriptures, if not their Divine Service in <hi>Greek.</hi>
                  </q> Not obſerving that <hi>Greek</hi> was the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Tongue</hi> of thoſe parts, and that both that and a Vulgar were there freely and generally ſpoken; as <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> as well as the <hi>Gallick</hi> Tongues were ſo frequent in <hi>Maſſilia,</hi> that it was called <hi>Trilinguis,</hi> as S. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſhews in the ſame Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

of his. So that theſe two, the Common and Vulgar, are ſo far from being inconſiſtent, that (notwithſtanding the bold ſaying of our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Sanders, That the common people underſtand</hi>

                  </note>prove that both that and the <hi>Greek</hi> were antiently uſed therein.

               <p>Now in all this they ſay little or nothing to the purpoſe. For if they plead for their <hi>Latin</hi> Service, as <hi>Greek</hi> was in <hi>Galatia,</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> who is their Adverſary? For theſe Tongues were (as I have ſhewed) in thoſe and the like places as well or little leſs ſpoken and underſtood than the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62571:8"/>
and Mother Tongues. And the Proteſtants do not think it unlawful to have the common Service in a Tongue which is commonly underſtood (though it be not the Vulgar Tongue of the Nation) eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Maritim and Provincial Countries, where there is a concourſe of diverſe Nations, and where either theſe ſeveral Languages are underſtood, or there is a compound Language that ſerves for all, as the <hi>Lingua Franca</hi> before ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>But if they plead for <hi>Latin,</hi> as it is now (when a Dead and Learned Tongue) that is where it is not known at all, as in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> (where yet it is as much uſed by thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in Maſs, as in <hi>Europe)</hi> or where it is not known to the Vulgar people, as it is with us, and every where elſe, then they ſpeak to the purpoſe, (for that the Reformed do oppoſe) but then the way of arguing hitherto taken notice of is of no uſe to them in the World; and is no more to the purpoſe than if they would undertake to prove that there is at this day a famous Univerſity at <hi>Athens,</hi> and that <hi>Latin</hi> is the Vulgar Tongue now at <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe were ſo formerly.</p>
               <p>So that if we will know where the Controverſie lies, and what is contended for and againſt, we muſt reſtore things to their proper places; and I think all may be brought to an Iſſue, by putting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving this plain Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi>

If we would be ſatisfied about their Expedience, we muſt conſider the Nature, Ends, and Uſe of what we enquire about. This therefore is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per method for the Reſolution of the foregoing Queſtion: But becauſe the Apoſtle (in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon this Subject, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.) doth argue from the ends and uſe of the ſeveral Offices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Divine Worſhip, and becauſe the like Order may give ſome light and force to what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; I ſhall firſt of all,</p>

               <p n="1">1. That Divine Worſhip in its firſt notion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects God as its Object; and ſo the end of it in general, is the giving Honour to him by ſuitable Thoughts, Words and Actions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he hath appointed ſeveral wayes and Offices by which he will be ſo honoured; and in which, as the Honour doth terminate in him, ſo there redounds from thence benefit to the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Benefits redound to the Church according to the nature of thoſe Offices, and the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62571:10"/>
ſpecial Ends they were deſigned unto; As the Word of God is for our inſtruction and comfort, &amp;c. The Lord's Supper for the encreaſe of Faith in God, and love to him through Jeſus Chriſt.

               <p n="4">4. That thoſe Offices are to be performed ſo as may effectually anſwer thoſe Ends, and as we may receive the benefits they were appointed for: From whence it follows,</p>
               <p n="5">5. That if the Offices of Divine Worſhip are to be performed by Words, thoſe Words and that Tongue (in which they are adminiſtred) muſt be ſuch as will not obſtruct but promote, and in their nature are qualified to attain thoſe Ends. And if thoſe Ends cannot be attained without the Tongue, in which the Service is performed, be underſtood: It makes that means as neceſſary in its kind as the End; and it is as neceſſary that the Tongue uſed for thoſe Ends in Divine Worſhip, be underſtood, as that thoſe Ends ſhould be reſpected, or that there ſhould be a Tongue uſed at all. For it is not God but Man that is immediately reſpected in the Words (ſince there is no more need of Words to God, than of Words that are vulgarly underſtood) and ſo it is not for him but Man, that this Tongue or that, or indeed that any Tongue at all is uſed.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62571:10"/>
And if it be requiſite that there be a Tongue and Words uſed in publick Worſhip, and which all perſons preſent are ſuppoſed to joyn in, and receive benefit by; then it is as neceſſary for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to uſe Words ſignificant and underſtood, as to uſe any Words at all. <q>For, ſaith S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid, we may be able to vindicate ſuch Arguments of the Proteſtants for Divine Service in a known and vulgar Tongue, as were taken from the Ends of Worſhip, againſt the replyes made to them by their Adverſaries of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Proteſtants argue in general, that the End of Divine Offices is for the Edification, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Conſolation of the people; but theſe Ends cannot be attained in a Tongue not underſtood by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Bellarm. de verbo, l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>16.</hi> Sect. Obj. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> To this it is replyed, <q>That the Propoſition is falſe, becauſe the chief end of Divine Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is not the Inſtruction or Conſolation of the people, but a Worſhip or Honour due to God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>An Anſwer that became not ſo great a Man. For (1.) He argues as if thoſe Ends were oppoſed, which are not only conſiſtent, as Principal and Subordinate, but alſo inſeparable in the Caſe; ſuch are the Honour of God, and the Edification of the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:62571:11"/>
(2.) The Anſwer is not to the purpoſe, unleſs it could be proved, That either the Edification of the People, is no End of the Divine Offices; or that the Worſhip is compleat, though that End be not reſpected or attained in them. But if it be an End, and the Service defective without that End be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; then it is not, that this is a ſubordinate End, and the other a Principal, that will deſtroy the force of the Argument, and juſtify the uſe of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue, when perſons are not edified by it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Proteſtants argue in particular that there can no profit proceed to the Church from Prayers not underſtood.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Bellarm. ibid. Sect. Obj. <hi>2.</hi> Ledeſma, c. <hi>13.</hi> n. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> To this it is anſwered, <q>That it is falſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Prayer of the Church is not made to the people, but to God for the people. And ſo there is no need that the people underſtand, and it is ſufficient if God underſtands.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But (1.) if this Argument hold, it will prove that which they do decline, and be a Reaſon as well for Private as Publick Prayers in an Unknown Tongue. For Private Prayer is alſo made to God, and by this way of reaſoning it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, That it is ſufficient that God underſtands it, though it is not underſtood by him that uſeth it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>(2.) Grant we to them what is not to be denied, That</hi> Prayer is not made to the people, but to God for the people: <hi>Yet grant they muſt and do to us, that,</hi> It is the offering up our Hearts, Wants and <note place="margin">ut ſupra.</note>Deſires to God, and is to excite us to the Love and Adoration of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62571:11"/>
But if we cannot offer up our Hearts, Wants and Deſires to God, nor be excited to the Love and Adoration of him, by what we do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; then it is as neceſſary for us to underſtand, as it is to have thoſe Qualifications when we pray. For both are ſuppoſed; for that we pray, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects God, but that we ſpeak in publick Prayer reſpects the Church. And though the principal End (as they call it) be regarded, and it be an Honour and Worſhip given to God: Yet if the leſs principal be neglected, and the Service is not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to the encreaſe of Faith, Love and Devotion in thoſe that offer it (as it cannot be where the Words, and ſo the things prayed for in thoſe Words, are not underſtood) it makes the Honour, ſaid to be given to God, next to none: And it is much at one, whether there was no end at all propounded in Worſhip, or ſuch an End, as through a defect in it ſhall render the ſervice no better in it ſelf, and no more acceptable to God, than if there were none. But of this more anon.</p>
               <p n="2">II. I ſhall conſider whether theſe Ends for which Divine Service is appointed, can be attained, when it is performed in a Tongue that is not underſtood? The Apoſtle ſaith, That the Offices of Divine Worſhip are intended and ſhould be ordered <hi>for the Edification of the Church,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 4, 5. That is, ſay the Rhemiſts, (explaining that Phraſe) <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 461.</note>
                  <hi>For increaſe of Faith, true Knowledge, and a good Life.</hi> But when this comes to be applyed to the Caſe of Divine Service adminiſtred in an unknown Tongue, they ſet aſide <hi>the increaſe of Knowledge</hi> and Inſtruction, as if it were not concerned in it. So doth <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who ſaith, <q>Though the Minds <note place="margin">De verbo, l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>16.</hi> Sect. Obj. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:62571:12"/>
of common people be not inſtructed by Service in an Unknown Tongue; yet their affections are not without the benefit of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If this Argument ſignifies any thing, it muſt be either becauſe Divine Service is not a means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for our Inſtruction, and then he muſt thwart not only the Apoſtle (who ſaith it is <hi>for Edification,</hi> and conſequently for Inſtruction, a Branch of it) but alſo their own Church in the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 22 <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note>Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which ſaith, <hi>That the Maſs doth contain great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Inſtruction for the faithful.</hi> Or elſe he muſt ſay that the means of Inſtruction may be rendred ineffectual at the pleaſure of the Church, (as it is granted it is by being in an unknown Tongue) and yet neither the Church be blamed, nor the Inſtitution of ſuch Means for ſuch an End be diſparaged, nor the Souls of Men receive any damage by the want of that Inſtruction, and the Means appointed for it. So that as far as Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an end, and the Divine Service is a means for that End, it is granted that the keeping it in an Unknown Tongue doth defeat that end: For he ſaith, <hi>That the Minds of common people are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by Service in an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown Tongue.</hi> And now what an uſurpation is this upon God, to withhold that Means that he has appointed, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the Means of that End that he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it for? What an injury to the Souls of Men? And how much acceſſary muſt that Church be to the Miſcarriage and Damnation of ſuch as periſh for want of that Knowledge and Inſtruction the Service and Offices of the Church do contain, and they might receive from it?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:62571:12"/>
But ſuppoſe that end be loſt, <hi>and the peoples Minds be not inſtructed, yet their Affections are not without the benefit of it.</hi> This is ſpoken with a Caution and Reſervation becoming one that ſaw farther into the conſequences of what he ſaid, than he cared to own. He ſaith at large, <hi>their Affections are not without the benefit of it:</hi> But how the Affections could be benefited, without the Mind is inſtructed; or what the Benefit is which the Affections are not without, he is ſparing to tell us. But however the Rhemiſts advance a little farther; for they with no little confidence do <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Annotat. in</hi> 1 Cor. 14. <hi>p.</hi> 462.</note>determine, <q>It is plain that ſuch as pray in <hi>Latin,</hi> though they underſtand not what they ſay, do pray with as little tediouſneſs, with as great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Devotion, and oftentimes more than others, that pray in a Tongue they underſtand.</q> The Cardinal told us, That the Affections are not without benefit, though the Mind be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed: But now it is to a Demonſtration plain (in theſe Men's account) that not only the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is as great, as if people do underſtand, but oftentimes greater than if they did underſtand. So that what more ſelf evident, than that <hi>Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion?</hi> But yet as plain as it is, the Saying is ſo downright a Contradiction to the common ſenſe of Mankind, that I think a Man may venture as roundly to aſſert, that <hi>it is plain,</hi> a Man may ſee without Light, as that he may pray with Affection and Devotion, though he do not underſtand, and with as great as if he did: And he may with as good a Grace main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, That the beſt way to ſee, is to put out the Light, as affirm with them, That ſuch as pray
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62571:13"/>
in <hi>Latin,</hi> though they do not underſtand, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pray with more Affection and Devotion than they that do underſtand.</p>
               <p>But becauſe this is aſſerted with ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, <note place="margin">Ledeſma, c. <hi>13.</hi> n. <hi>13.</hi> Cenſura propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit. Eraſmi, prop <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note>and that, <hi>To ſay that people are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited without they underſtand,</hi> is condemned not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as <hi>an erroneous, but wicked aſſertion;</hi> I ſhall look back, and (leaving the extravagancy of the latter as ſelf-expoſed) conſider whether the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not without benefit, and that the Soul can be devout and affected, where the Underſtanding is not inſtructed, nor the Mind is concerned in the Service we are converſant in? The reſolution of which depends upon the conſideration of the Soul of Man, and the ſeveral faculties of it.</p>
               <p>Concerning which it ſhall ſuffice to obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in all reaſonable and deliberate Acts, there is more or leſs ſo neceſſary a concurrence of the prime faculties of the Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, Will and Affections, that none of them can be ſaid to be excluded. 2. That in all ſuch Acts if the Underſtanding be not the leading fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and of ſuch influence, that the others can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not act without it (which muſt be ſuppoſed, for how can a perſon affect or chooſe what he doth not know?) Yet without that, the Acts cannot be <note place="margin">In Pſalm. <hi>46.</hi>
                  </note>termed reaſonable. So <hi>Caſſiodore, No body doth any thing wiſely which he doth not underſtand.</hi> 3. That in the Acts of Religion, the preſence of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is as much required as in any other rational Acts whatſoever; <hi>The renewing of the Mind</hi> being there the Spring of all ſpiritual Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1, 2.</note>and the whole called from thence <hi>a reaſonable
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62571:13"/>
Service.</hi> And therefore if in other Caſes the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections cannot move or be profited without the help of the Underſtanding, then as little can it be ſuppoſed in Religion, and the Offices belonging to it, where the Underſtanding is <hi>Sonus Cordis,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In Geneſ. Lit. L. c. <hi>8.</hi> &amp; in Pſ. <hi>99.</hi>
                  </note>(as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls it, applying it to our purpoſe) <hi>The note of the Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to ſay, <hi>That the Affections are not without profit, though the Mind be not inſtructed; and that they that do not underſtand, do pray with as little tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and as great Affection and Devotion as they that do underſtand</hi> (not to repeat the reſt of the ſtuff before cited) is to ſay that the Affections have no dependance in Nature upon the Underſtanding; or that Religion requires leſs of us than any other reaſonable Acts whatſoever; and that what we cannot do without being Lunaticks or Ideots in other matters, we may there creditably do, and ſpeak, and act, as abſurdly as we will, with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance.</p>
               <p>But this kind of Doctrine is only to ſerve a turn, being fitted to thoſe that are fitted for it, and to whom nothing can be abſurd, which ſome Men ſay: For there are thoſe amongſt them cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt it; and do determine otherwiſe. So <hi>Salmeron</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In</hi> 1 Cor. 14.</note>the Jeſuit, <hi>If any one prayes privately, and the things prayed for are not underſtood by him, he waſts his time: So he that ſpeaketh publickly in an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown Tongue, which others do not underſtand, he doth yield no Fruit;</hi> and then certainly others receive none. This the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> doth acknowledge, when it declares (as aboveſaid) <hi>It ſeems not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to the Fathers, That the Maſs be celebrated in the Vulgar Tongue:</hi> And preſently adds, <hi>Leſt the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62571:14"/>
Sheep of Chriſt ſhould hunger, and when the little ones ask bread, there is none to break to them; The Holy Synod commands all that have the care of Souls, frequently, &amp;c. to expound ſomewhat of it.</hi> So that they grant without ſuch Explication, the Faithful may hunger and be without profit; for what need would there be of Expoſition, if the people may be as devout without it as with it? I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <note place="margin">Expoſit. in Pſalm. <hi>18.</hi>
                  </note>this with that of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> 
                  <q>We ought to underſtand, that we may ſing with humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not as it were with the Voice of Birds. For both Parrots, and Crows, and Pies, and the like, are often taught by Men to pronounce what they do not know—But to ſing with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is granted by the Divine Will to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</q> So that according to him, if we ſet aſide <note place="margin">Rhodiginus, l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>32.</hi>
                  </note>the Underſtanding, the Parrot of the Cardinal <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canius,</hi> had it been taught the Lord's Prayer, or other Forms of Devotion, as well as the Creed, might have contended in competition with thoſe that hear, and ſing, and pray, with Words, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out underſtanding. Since whatever Affection and Devotion is pretended to without Knowledge, is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23. 16.</note>like <hi>a Viſion of a Man's own Heart,</hi> and not of Divine Illumination, that doth either proceed from Imagination or Impoſture.</p>
               <p>But that we may not think this Aſſertion of theirs [that <hi>there may be profit without underſtanding, and Devotion without knowledge]</hi> to be unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, they both produce Experience, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour alſo to give a rational account of it.

a few Years hath given all the World a full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, whether our Fore-Fathers were not, &amp;c as devout, as we are in all our Tongues, tranſlations and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prayers.</q>

                  </note> And we are told, <q>That the people know what is done in the general, to wit, That God is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped and honoured; That the Prieſt prays to him; That good things are asked of him for the people; and thanks given to him, that the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt and his Paſſion are celebrated, and the Sacrifice offered to God. This no Clown is ignorant of; and this is enough.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is ſomewhat like the courſe taken by <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes,</hi> that ſaid, He only pray'd in general, becauſe what particular things were good for him, the Gods knew better than himſelf. But whether this be done among them, with as much reaſon; and whether with any reſpect to our Religion, and the ſeveral Offices of it, is now to be conſider'd.</p>
               <p>For our ſatisfaction herein we may obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">I. They grant, That the people can and do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand no more by their Service than the general intent, and Points of it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That the people cannot apply theſe Generals to the particular Points of it. So the Rhemiſts; <note place="margin">P. 463.</note>
                  <q>The ſimple people are not bound to know to what Petition their part pertaineth, &amp;c. It is enough that the people can tell this holy Oraiſon [the <hi>Pater noſter]</hi> to be appointed to call upon God, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. That no more is neceſſary; and though they are to ask ſpecial things of God, yet it-is not needful to underſtand what, or how, or when, or if at all they are ſpecially prayed for. For then
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62571:15"/>
they would underſtand the ſpecials.</p>
               <p>But now this ſtate of the Caſe will not ſolve the Point. For,</p>
               <p n="1">I. This is contrary to the Apoſtle, who doth maintain, That as the publick Service of God is to be ordered ſo, as to be for the edification of the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 7, 8, 9, 16.</note>Church; ſo the Church cannot be edified, without the Offices are adminiſtred in a Tongue that ſhall as diſtinctly and particularly ſignifie and point to the thing thereby to be expreſſed, as a Trumpet or the like Inſtrument doth give notice by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Sounds, when to advance or retreat, when to fight and when to forbear. And that every perſon, the unlearned as well as the learned, may know how to apply his <hi>Amen</hi> thereunto; but which he can no more do without underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tongue, than He can know what motion or poſture he is to obſerve that hath the Trumpet ſounding to him without any diſtinction, and whoſe Sounds and Notes being confounded, give no direction to thoſe that are to be guided by it. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In</hi> 1 Cor. 14.</note>So <hi>Aquinas,</hi> 
                  <q>How ſhall he ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> when he knows not what is pray'd for; becauſe he cannot underſtand, <hi>Quid boni dicas, niſi quod benedicas;</hi> What good thou ſayeſt, except that thou doſt bleſs?</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. The nature of the thing is againſt it. For as the Offices are various, and diſtinguiſhed by their Ends and Uſes; and we cannot attain thoſe Ends, nor make uſe of thoſe Offices, without the underſtanding of thoſe Ends and Uſes: So there are particular things reſpected in thoſe Offices, which unleſs we alſo reſpect, we loſe the benefit of them; but that we cannot do without a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62571:15"/>
knowledge of them. As for example, the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catechiſm faith, <q>That Prayer is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter <note place="margin">

That therein Men do confeſs their ſins, and pray for the pardon of them; that they beg for others and themſelves things Temporal, Spiritual and Eternal; that therein alſo they give Thanks for whatever good they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and do enjoy.</q> Now as theſe things are of different kinds, ſo according to their kind they require different diſpoſitions, and ſo what are ſuitable to the one will not be ſuitable to the other. But if the knowledge be only general, that cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſpecial diſpoſitions; and he that ventures to be particular therein, may rejoyce and give Thanks when he is to mourn and confeſs; may mind Earthly things when the Prayer is for Heavenly; may imprecate when he ſhould bleſs; and inſtead <note place="margin">Catechiſ. c. <hi>6.</hi> Sect. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note>of <hi>Ora pro nobis,</hi> may ſay <hi>Miſerere nobis,</hi> that is, make a Saint to be God, and apply that to the Officer of the Court of Heaven, which he ſhould addreſs only to the Judge. He may be all the while in a poſture of contradiction to the Church, and have his diſpoſitions ſo little ſuited to the ſolemnities of it, that the Prieſts may ſay to ſuch, with ſome little variation, in the Words of the Goſpel, <hi>We have piped unto you, and ye have mourned; we have mourned unto you, and ye have danced.</hi> So that unleſs they will ſay, There are no need of particular diſpoſitions, according to the kinds, and ſpecial uſes of the Offices of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, they muſt ſay, That Service in an Unknown Tongue, is not for the edification of the Church. So <hi>Aquinas</hi> again, <q>He who doth hear and not underſtand, <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:62571:16"/>
is not edified as far as he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not, although he undeſtand it <hi>in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. If this were true, That a confuſed gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral knowledge is ſufficient, yet this will not help them, or juſtifie them in the uſe of an Unknown Tongue: For even the general knowledge they pretend to, doth not proceed from the Tongue (for that they underſtand not) but is obtained ſome other way, that is by ſome actions and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, ſome particular Words and Phraſes, ſome Ceremonies and Signals given in the adminiſtration of their Service: And which would ſignifie as much for the moſt part without the Tongue and Words, as with the Tongue that is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. I ſhall add, That whereas they pretend experience in the caſe, and which for the preſent we ſhall not ſo far queſtion, as utterly to deny, but that there may be, and is ſome Devotion amongſt the ignorant ſort of them; yet ſo far as this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of theirs is real, it muſt be becauſe of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what underſtood, but ſo far as it is without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, ſo far unqueſtionably it proceeds only from the imagination; and if it riſes from no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or higher a cauſe, whatſoever ſemblance it may have of Devotion, yet it hath no right to that Character. I ſhall make this clear by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or two. Not many years ſince, in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain City of <hi>Brabant,</hi> there was for ornament a large Statue erected at a Conduit near the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, to which the Country people as they paſſed to and fro, did often pay their Devotions (not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any difference betwixt that and an image
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62571:16"/>
of a Saint) ſo much to the publick ſcandal, that (to prevent any ſuch miſtake for the future) it was by command transformed into a little Boy, with a change alſo of the poſture. Now if we would enquire into this Devotion, it is much what the ſame we are diſcourſing of. There wanted not an inward diſpoſition, that inclined the people to it; there wanted not outward expreſſions, for they bowed before it, kiſſed the Feet of it, ſaid their <hi>Pater noſters,</hi> &amp;c. before it, and all with as much Devotion, as if it had been the Image of S. <hi>Roch,</hi> or S. <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> or S. <hi>Michael</hi> himſelf (the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and Patron of the place). And yet all this being applyed to a common, and not a religious Object, and being only the Fruit of Imagination and not of Inſtruction, it deſerved another name than Devotion, and was not ſo accounted by themſelves. And now, why what is given, ſuppoſe to a right Object, but without knowledge, ſhould not be equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to the other, that was intended to a right, but was addreſſed, by miſtake, to a wrong, is not eaſie to diſcern? Furthermore, Let us ſuppoſe a Caſe, A perſon being beforehand poſſeſſed with a report of certain perſons met together upon a deſign of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration, comes to the place, and finds the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany there aſſembled; and hearing all that they ſay, performed in a Language he underſtands not, he preſently is ſeized with a pannick fear, and is every moment in expectation of the foul Fiend's appearance at their Summons, but is all this while abuſed, and under a miſtake, for the perſons were there met for Religious Worſhip, and ſo the ground of his fear imaginary. On the other hand, a perſon comes into a place, where he finds ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62571:17"/>
met together, who uſing much the like poſtures as if they were at their Devotions, and alſo Words he underſtands not, but what for ought he knows, are the ſame that are uſed in the Church Service, he falls upon his Knees, pulls out his Beads, ſays an <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> or <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> or what he has been uſed to in that kind. And now can there be any reaſon after all to conclude, That this Mans De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion aroſe from any other cauſe than the others Fear, and that both did not proceed from the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination? And can there be any reaſon to think, that what proceeds from ſuch a cauſe, is fit to be Sainted, and be entitled to the name of true Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Devotion? So that to talk of Devotion without Inſtruction, or Inſtruction ſufficient to create it, is to talk againſt the ſenſe of Mankind, in which there may be, for ought I ſee, as much of myſtery, but no more ſenſe than in the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">De verbo, l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>16.</hi> Sect. Obj. <hi>2.</hi> praeterea.</note>ſaying of <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Padua,</hi> produced by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> on this occaſion, <hi>That is a perfect Prayer, in which the mind is ſo ſwallowed up into God, that it doth not underſtand its own Words.</hi> In this they agree, that in both Caſes the Words and the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding are ſeparated, but in this they differ, That His Underſtanding was (as it ſeems) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Words; but in our Caſe the Words are beyond the Underſtanding. In both there is no need of Words, and where they are uſed, they cannot be the means of Devotion; which is no more to be found without the underſtanding, than the Underſtanding can be, can attend, or be moved by Words that it hath no knowledge of.</p>
               <p>So that let them either take away the Words altogether, and uſe no Tongue in their Service,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62571:17"/>
and turn all into mummery and pageantry: Or elſe let them uſe ſuch Words as will <hi>ſtir up reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi>

               <p>But to proceed to another Queſtion.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Let us conſider, Whether the worſhip ſo performed, as to leave thoſe Ends unattainable, will be accepted by God? Divine Worſhip reſpects God as its Object, and ſo the End of it is the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Honour to him by ſuitable Thoughts, Words and Actions (as has been before obſerved) but how that honour is to be given, as the nature of the thing, and Divine Inſtitution are the Rule; ſo when that Honour is given to him, the Ends, for which the Worſhip it ſelf is appointed and the Offices of it do ſerve, muſt determine. And if theſe Ends are not reſpected, nor can be attained in the way of its miniſtration, we may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, That as the Worſhip is not then worthy of God, ſo it is not accepted by him. Now,</p>
               <p>As it has been already ſhewed what thoſe Ends are, ſo it has been proved, that thoſe Ends are not to be attained, where the Service is not in a Tongue known to the people, and ſo conſequently will not be accepted by God. And for this we have the judgment of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, when they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62571:18"/>
diſcourſe practically upon this Argument, and without reſpect to the controverſie before us. Of this I ſhall give an inſtance in Prayer, (a point moſt of all inſiſted upon) of which it is ſaid in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Part</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</note>general in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catechiſm, <q>That it is of ſpecial concernment after what manner we pray; for although Prayer be a ſaving good, yet unleſs it be rightly performed, it doth not profit.</q> And <note place="margin">Ibid. c. <hi>2.</hi> Sect. <hi>4</hi>
                  </note>elſewhere they inſiſt upon ſeveral things that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Prayers ineffectual, as the ignorance of what we pray for; and the want of attention or aſſent to what we pray, &amp;c. And certainly if the Prayer without theſe Ends be not acceptable to God, then ſuch a miniſtration of it, as renders thoſe Ends unattainable, cannot be lawful to us, or be thought approved by him.</p>
               <p>But how well and truly ſoever they ſpeak in a caſe remote from Controverſie, yet when they come to controvert the Point in hand, they do in effect unſay all that they have ſaid; and then the Prayers uſed in the Church, though not at all underſtood by the people, are magnified for their uſe and benefit to Man, and for their acceptance with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Annot in <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>14.</hi> p. <hi>462.</hi> Et Annot. in Mat. <hi>21. 16.</hi>
                  </note> Thus the Rhemiſts, <q>We doubt not but it is acceptable to God, and available to all neceſſities, and more agreeable to the uſe of all Chriſtian people to pray in <hi>Latin</hi> than in the Vulgar, though every one in particular, underſtandeth not what he ſaith.</q> And (ſaith Cardinal <hi>Hoſius,)</hi> 
                  <q>When <note place="margin">De ling. vernac. p. <hi>9.</hi>
                     </note>done to give honour to God, it is acceptable to him, and no underſtanding of Words can be compared to it.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:62571:18"/>
To ſay that our <hi>Prayers are hindred of their vertue through ignorance or want of attention,</hi> &amp;c. And that <hi>they be acceptable to God, though we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not what we ſay,</hi> are things irreconcileable. But ſetting aſide the contradiction in it, they are not without ſome pretences to prove that the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the Divine Offices doth not depend upon the peoples underſtanding them. Now I might eaſe my ſelf of theſe kind of Pleas, becauſe they ſuppoſe that which has been already diſproved, <hi>viz.</hi> That the affections can be benefited without the underſtanding. But yet becauſe they are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produced to prove as well the no neceſſity of Service in a Vulgar Tongue, and the lawfulneſs of having it in an Unknown Tongue, as that a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of that kind is acceptable to God, and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the people, I ſhall before I conclude this Head (to which they more peculiarly belong) take them into conſideration.</p>
               <p>Now their Arguments are taken partly from Scripture, and partly from ſome caſes ſuppoſed to be parallel to this.</p>

It is more probable that they did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, than that they did not: <hi>Hoſannah</hi> being a form of ſolemn acclamation; and as eaſie to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by them in the ſignification; ſo alſo in the application of it to Chriſt upon this occaſion; which, ſaith S. <hi>John</hi> 12. 17, 18. was, <hi>Becauſe the people

had heard that he raiſed</hi> Lazarus. And whereas our Saviour applyes that of <hi>Babes and Sucklings</hi> to the caſe, that was not becauſe theſe that cryed <hi>Hoſannah</hi> were ſuch, but that becauſe God never wanted Inſtruments of his Glory, but could make uſe of ſuch as were mean and unfit in themſelves for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Suppoſing they did not underſtand, where is the conſequence, that becauſe <hi>young Childrens Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers proceeding from the inſtinct of God's Spirit be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God,</hi> therefore <hi>the voices of other ſimple</hi>

                  <hi>folk, now in the Church, though they themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not what they ſay, be marvellous grateful to God,</hi> as the Rhemiſts ſay. As if an extraordinary caſe ſhould be a Rule for us in an ordinary; and that Prayers <hi>proceeding from Children, by the inſtinct of God's Spirit,</hi> and who were little leſs miraculouſly empowered to do it, than the Aſs of <hi>Balaam</hi> (if they were <hi>Sucklings, and ſuch as could ſcarcely ſpeak,</hi> as <hi>Ledeſma</hi> would have it) ſhould teach us to chooſe what we do not underſtand. Or as if what was grateful to God from Children, who were in no capacity of doing better than fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of others, though they did not underſtand, ſhould excuſe, nay recommend the Service of thoſe that are in a capacity of underſtanding, and yet underſtand no more of what they offer to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God in particular, than if they were <hi>Babes and Sucklings,</hi> and ſuch as had no underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 20. doth upon this occaſion exhort, <hi>Be not Children in underſtanding,</hi> ſo as to think God pleaſed with that which doth not benefit us; or ſo as to think, That he who is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62571:19"/>
ſo merciful as to <hi>accept according to what a Man hath,</hi> ſhould alſo be ſo remiſs as to accept him that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not what he hath. That when God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us a Tongue and Underſtanding, we ſhould be debarred of the uſe of both in his Worſhip and Service, and yet our Service and our ſelves be as well accepted, as if both were employed therein. Certainly what will avail, where there is no capacity, will not avail when there is a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; and therefore it is a mean way of arguing, and will receive the ſame anſwer, <hi>That they that</hi>

               <p n="2">2. How is this a proof that they had their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in an Unknown Tongue? Or if they were to

have it in a Known Tongue, how can they infer, That the High Prieſt might have uſed an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue, when praying with the people, and that this ſhould have been as acceptable to God, and as beneficial to them, as if it had been underſtood?</p>

And therefore it's as neceſſary the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould underſtand as the Prieſt, and if he do otherwiſe, he can no more juſtifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, than if he did celebrate the Service in a Tongue he himſelf knew nothing of, and which neither the one nor the other did underſtand.

               <p n="4">IV. Whether from the Apoſtle's Diſcourſe upon this Argument, it can be reaſonably concluded, That Divine Service ſo adminiſtred, as not to be underſtood of the people, is unlawful?</p>
               <p>In the Apoſtle's Diſcourſe upon this Argument, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. there are two things agreed in betwixt the contending parties.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:62571:21"/>
I. That the Service of God is ſo to be ordered, as may be for the edification of the Church, v. 4, 5, 12. And that what is inconſiſtent with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, much more the univerſal Edification of it, is not to be allowed.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That an Unknown Tongue in ſuch Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies and Offices as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with, and cannot be for the publick Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, v. 2, 6, 9, 11, 14, 16.</p>
               <p>But though it be thus far agreed, yet they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards divide upon it from the Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do ſay, That it is evident from this place of Scripture, that a Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and Known Tongue was not uſed in thoſe days in Publick Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That if ſo be ſuch was then uſed, yet the Apoſtle doth not forbid the uſe of an Unknown Tongue in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt do wholly found what they have to ſay, upon Verſe 16.</hi> How ſhall he that occupieth the room of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned <hi>[or Idiot]</hi> ſay Amen, at thy giving of Thanks?</p>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. As to the firſt.</p>
               <p>They ſay, That the Tongues condemned were miraculous and extraordinarily infuſed, but what they plead for is acquired and learnt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> But ſuppoſing the Tongues were miraculous; yet what is this to the caſe in Hand, when they were not condemned for being miraculous (for as ſuch they were Gifts from God and Signs to Men)
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62571:22"/>
but as they were abuſed, and uſed neither to the Glory of God, nor the Edification of the Church. And by parity of reaſon, every Unknown Tongue, as well what is acquired as infuſed, is condemned alſo. The Miraculous Tongue was forbidden, when it did not profit, when it was a ſpeaking to the air, when he that ſpoke was a Barbarian to him that heard, and when he that heard could not ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to him that ſpoke, Verſe 2, 9, 11, 16. And if a Tongue acquired be as much unknown as a Tongue infuſed, the Reaſons being common to both, the one is as much prohibited in thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances as the other.</p>
               <p>Nay, according to their way of arguing, it will follow, That if Tongues miraculouſly infuſed, which were <hi>a ſign to them that believed not,</hi> might not be uſed in the Caſes aboveſaid, then much leſs may ſuch as are acquired, by Education and other humane wayes.</p>

                  </note> But they ſay farther, <q>That the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a Tongue which no one underſtands in the whole Church, but not of that which is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by ſome, at leaſt by him that officiates.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But for this they offer no manner of proof, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any. For (1.) the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſuch a Tongue as is not for the Edification of the Church; but if ſome only underſtand it, thoſe that do not underſtand, are no more edified by the underſtanding of the reſt, than if none under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it. (2.) There are two ſorts of perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, one that can ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> and another that cannot, whom the Apoſtle calls <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned.</hi> But the Unlearned are as well (as he ſaith) to be reſpected as the Learned; and the Unlearned being
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62571:22"/>
ordinarily more than the Learned; it muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently be ſuch a Tongue which all or the moſt did underſtand that he pleads for; and ſuch a Tongue, which none or the feweſt did underſtand, that he pleads againſt.</p>

               <p>And we are further told, <q>That all Tongues are Barbarous, except thoſe three.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But all this is ſpoken very precariouſly. For the Apoſtle excepts no Tongue, as a Tongue, from being barbarous. For that is barbarous with him that is not underſtood, whether it be <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Arabick, Greek</hi> or <hi>Scythian, Latin</hi> or <hi>Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</hi> In this Sence <hi>Ovid</hi> took it, ſpeaking of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Exile, amongſt the <hi>Getae,</hi>
                  <q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And in this ſenſe it is here taken by ancient Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors. Thus S. <hi>Jerom, Every Speech which is</hi>

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. What are the Aſſemblies in which the Apoſtle condemns the uſe of an Unknown Tongue?</p>
               <p>The Champions of this Cauſe in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do alledge, <q>That much of the Chapter refers to Spiritual Conferences and collocutory Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes then uſed in leſſer Aſſemblies, which they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove more eſpecially from the Directions given by the Apoſtle, Verſe 27, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If we ſhould grant that part of the Apoſtle's Diſcourſe refers to ſuch Conferences, yet what is this to that part of it that treats of Publick Worſhip? Or indeed what is it to the purpoſe at all, when there were moſtly the ſame Offices uſed in one as the other, and the ſame End preſcribed to the uſe of them in both? Thoſe that do thus diſtinguiſh, have not ventured to tell us where the Apoſtle doth treat of the one, and where of the other: And it is evident that he applies his Argument of Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to the whole, and then proceeds from one Office to another, from Propheſying to Praying, and Singing, if not alſo to the Lords Supper. Now where the End is common to all, without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the means conducing to that End are in all alike to be obſerved. And if in thoſe leſſer Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies (when they expounded, prayed or ſung) they were to uſe a Tongue known to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, becauſe without ſo doing, the Ends of their ſo aſſembling would have been defeated, then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was, if not more, yet at leaſt as neceſſary, that the ſame order be obſerved when the whole Church came together into one place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What was the Service uſed in thoſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, and that was forbidden to be celebrated in an Unknown Tongue?</p>

                  </note> Some of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will underſtand it only of preaching; and thoſe that do grant it to reſpect Prayers, yet will have it underſtood of ſuch Prayers as were inſpired. But what though the Prayers were inſpired, when they were to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in a Tongue known to the Church, and were not to be uſed if they were not for the Edification of the Church; as they were not if not underſtood? And is not the Reaſon as full againſt Prayers not inſpired, when they are not underſtood? The Queſtion is not about Prayers, inſpired or not inſpired; but known and unknown; according to which all the Offices of the Church are to be tryed, as to their lawfulneſs and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Suppoſing this ſo to be, yet that is not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for the Queſtion is not whether the Apoſtle, treats ſo expreſly of Prayer as of propheſying; as whether the prohibition of an Unknown Tongue, and the Argument taken from the End of Divine Offices lie not as expreſly againſt praying as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying in that way? And whether the Words, <hi>If I pray in an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown Tongue, my Spirit prayeth, but my underſtanding remaineth unfruitful,</hi> &amp;c. v. 14, 16. are not as plain as <hi>he that ſpeaketh [or propheſyeth] in an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown Tongue, ſpeaketh not unto Men,</hi> &amp;c. If the Prohibition be the ſame, and the reaſon of the prohibition be the ſame in both; then it is not the being expreſly or occaſionally handled, that can make ſo vaſt a difference, as that the former ſhall be lawful, and the latter unlawful.</p>

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. How far is the Apoſtle's prohibition to be extended?</p>
               <p>This will be determined partly from what hath been before ſaid, and partly from the current of the Apoſtle's Diſcourſe, who as he lays down that general Rule, <hi>Let all things be done to Edifying;</hi> ſo upon that principle, he prohibits the uſe of an Unknown Tongue, as inconſiſtent with it, Verſe 14. <hi>If I pray in an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown Tongue, my Spirit prayeth, but my underſtanding remaineth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful.</hi> Where he doth not ſpeak of a better and worſe, and prefer that which is underſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">

                     </p>
                  </note>that which is not (as they would have it) but he ſpeaks of a good and bad; and ſo doth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely condemn an Unknown Tongue for the unprofitableneſs of it. For, ſaith he, <hi>My Spirit prayeth,</hi> not the Affection, but the Spirit in the gift of an Unknown Tongue (as many of the <note place="margin">
                     <p>S. Chryſoſt. Homil. <hi>35.</hi> Theophylact.</p>

               <p>So that from the whole we may with good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon conclude, That the adminiſtration of Divine Service in an Unknown Tongue is as unlawful as expreſs Scripture can make it: And that after all their attempts to decline, pervert and overthrow it, the fourteenth Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> remains in full force againſt the Opinion and Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and is a ſufficient Reaſon on their part, to keep the Scriptures in an Unknown Tongue, as long as their Service is, contrary to the Scripture, celebrated conſtantly in it.</p>

what more plain than the means they have provided is not ſufficient for to inſtruct and edifie the people; and that after all, they do hold this inſtruction unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and that the people are ſafe without it? And this is the caſe, for it is generally reſolved by their Caſuiſts, both for Prieſt and People, that <q>they do their duty and merit, when they ſay their Prayers, <note place="margin">Salmeron. in <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>16.</hi> Diſp. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note>though they do not underſtand;</q> ſo <hi>Eckius,</hi> ſo <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meron,</hi> &amp;c. And <q>if it were otherwiſe, very few would do their duty, when ſo very few do at <note place="margin">Inſtruct. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerd. c. <hi>13.</hi> n. <hi>5, &amp; 6.</hi>
                     </note>all underſtand what they ſay,</q> as Cardinal <hi>Tolet</hi> doth determine. So indulgent are they; and very reaſonable is it that they ſhould be ſo, that when they have put out the peoples Eyes, they ſhould take good care to make the way broad and ſmooth for them.</p>
               <p>But in good earneſt, can we think this way as ſafe as it is broad, and that there is no <hi>Ditch</hi> into which both Prieſt and People, if alike blind, may fall and periſh? And if there be, muſt not the caſe of that people be very lamentable that are wholly left to the ability and ſincerity of their Prieſt? who if he wants the former, may, through ignorance, turn the moſt ſolemn part of their Service, as it happens, into Nonſenſe or Blaſphemy. And if he wants the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may uſe a Spell for Prayer, and the antient charm <note place="margin">D. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> Anſw. to <hi>T. G.</hi> c. 3. Sect. 3.</note>of <hi>Abracadabra</hi> for <hi>Ave Maria</hi> (as a learned perſon hath obſerved). Nay inſtead of baptizing in the ſacred Name of the <hi>Father,</hi> &amp;c. he may do by the perſon, as a Jew under the profeſſion of a Prieſt, is ſaid to have done by a certain Prince in the laſt Age, and baptize him in the horrid name of the <hi>Devil.</hi> There is then nothing ſo abſurd or wicked, which, according to the caſe, may not be practiſed. And neither Prayers be Prayers, nor Sacraments Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62571:30"/>
nor perſons Chriſtians, as long as the Prieſt doth alone know, or neither Prieſt nor People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing that there be no defect in either of theſe, and that the whole Service is faithfully and underſtandingly performed; yet if the Tongue in which it is performed be not underſtood of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there can be no underſtanding of the ſence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it; and where the ſence and matter is not underſtood, there cannot be (as I have ſhewed) thoſe diſpoſitions of Soul, that attention of Mind, that Faith which gives the <hi>Amen</hi> to our Prayers, &amp;c. and which renders the Service acceptable to God and beneficial to our ſelves; and conſequently a ſervice ſo contrived, as ſhall defeat thoſe ends, is one of the greateſt miſchiefs that can befal a Church, and muſt render the Romiſh Church inexcuſable in the injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it, and juſtifie thoſe that have reformed it.</p>

               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth anathematize, and doom to Hell, thoſe that hold a Vulgar Tongue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in Divine Service; and doth both abſolutely forbid their own <hi>Miſſal</hi> to be ſo tranſlated, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute thoſe that have ſo uſed it.

                  </note>cannot, dare not ſay it is unlawful in it ſelf. For it is better to have it in the Vulgar than not at all; ſaith one. It is matter of Diſcipline, ſaith a ſecond. It hath been granted in ſome caſes, is acknowledged

Why this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry againſt it? Why this Severity? What need of ſuch Decrees and Anathemas of Councils? What need ſuch Commands of the Popes for Princes to oppoſe it with all their force (as that of <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. to <hi>Vratiſlaus</hi> of <hi>Bohemia)</hi> what reaſon is there for a general Convention of the Clergy of a Kingdom to proceed againſt a tranſlation of their Miſſal? When if we conſult the ends for which the publick Service was inſtituted, if we conſult the reaſon of the thing; if we conſult Scripture, or Fathers, or the practice of the Church for about ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years together, we ſhall find that it is not only expedient, but neceſſary to have it in a Tongue underſtood of the people, and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that is ſo forward in its Anathema, is under a precedent, and greater one, even that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall preach any other Goſpel, let him be</hi> Anathema. So that which is moſt to be reſpected, the <hi>Anathema</hi> of Heaven, or that of the Council; the command of God, or a Decree of a Pope; the Church of God in its beſt times, or the particular Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in latter Ages; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the edification of the Church of God, or the will and intereſt of a corrupted Church, is not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to conceive. And therefore we may end as we <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Art.</hi> 24.</note>began, with the Church of <hi>England. It is a thing plainly repugnant to the Word of God, and the cuſtome of the Primitive Church, to have publick Prayers in the Church, or to miniſter the Sacraments in a Tongue not underſtood of the people.</hi>
