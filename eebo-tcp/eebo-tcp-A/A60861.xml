            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Some ſhort but neceſſary Animadverſions on the Paper delivered to Dr. Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,
together with a Copy of the Paper it ſelf entituled, <hi>The Confeſſion</hi> of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

            <head type="sub">Reprinted from the Copy publiſhed by the Doctor, and theſe Animadverſions
added to prevent the deluding of Proteſtants by it.</head>
            <p>ALL that have heard of the Execution of <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> and of the Paper he left with Dr. <hi>Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi>
are undoubtedly curiouſly inquiſitive after the ſight of it; it is therefore thus printed in
a Half Sheet, for the convenience of diſperſing them throughout the Kingdom. But I durſt
not make this Publication, without taking notice of the Incredibility of ſome paſſages in it,
for I do not know the Atteſtors. But admitting <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> did leave this Paper, and the Atteſtations
be true, it doth not therefore follow the Narrative it ſelf is true, I leave any man to judge whether the
ſecond Paragraph looks like the drawing up of ſuch a Layman as <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> or not rather like the work
of a Churchman. Thoſe that know our preſent Sheriffs, know them to be Men of more Prudence and
Honeſty, than he would ſuggeſt them to be; and as for our Recorder, he is known to be too good a
Chriſtian to ſwear at that rate, and too wiſe a man to tell ſuch a Fellow that <hi>The Libel was a Court Trick;</hi>
nor can he be thought ſo ridiculous as to tell him, <hi>Do you ſay a thing, and we have thoſe that will ſwear it.</hi>
But the truth is, the whole Contrivance is ſo fooliſh, that no wiſe man will believe it. Notwithſtanding
his ſo ſolemn declaring and proteſting his Paper to be true, yet the whole Kingdom can give him the Lie
in one paſſage, <hi>viz.</hi> where he tells us, that the Sheriffs brought Inſtructions, which they ſaid came from
the Lords and Commons, who met that day in order to addreſs the King in his behalf; when all men
know the Parliament was not ſitting during his Impriſonment in <hi>Newgate,</hi> (where onely the Sheriffs came
to him) nor did they meet till ſeveral days after he was ſent to the <hi>Tower.</hi> Now when he is ſo eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
herein, who will believe the reſt? It was reported it would come out by order of Council, but
that proving falſe, we may well ſuſpect the Story it ſelf, there being ſo many <hi>Shams</hi> now abroad.</p>

together with his laſt Speech.</head>
            <p>I <hi>Edward Fitz Harys,</hi> having been indicted of High Treaſon, for
endeavouring to dethrone the King was thereupon found
Guilty, and Sentence of Death paſſed upon me. I the
aforeſaid <hi>Edward Fitz-harys</hi> do voluntarily and freely, without
any hopes to ſave my life, but as a dying Man, and to diſcharge
my Conſcience towards God, and for the better ſatisfaction of
the World, make this Declaration following, in the preſence of
God, and unto Doctor <hi>Francis Hawkins,</hi> Chaplain of the <hi>Tower</hi>
of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do profeſs and declare my Religion in the general to be
that which hath been truly and anciently delivered in the firſt
Four General Councils; and in particular, my belief is that true
Faith of a Chriſtian, briefly contained in thoſe three Creeds
commonly called <hi>The Apoſtles Creed, St. Athanaſius's</hi> and <hi>The Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene
Creeds:</hi> And I die a Member, and in the Communion of
<hi>Chriſts</hi> Holy Catholick Church, hoping for Mercy through the
alone Merits of the Paſſion of our Lord and Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do alſo confeſs and declare, as to the Crimes which I die
for, I was no further concerned in the Libel, than as employed
to give the King notice of what Libels, or other Accuſations
there were againſt him; and to this intent, and no other, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to get this Libel which at length I did from Mr. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verard,</hi>
all written under his own hand and carried it to Mrs. <hi>Wall,</hi>
by whoſe means I conveyed all Matters of this or the like nature
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the King. I told her I had a Buſineſs of great conſequence to
acquaint the King with: but ſhe anſwered me. That my Lord
<hi>Sunderland</hi> being out, there would be no money had for Secret
Service, and adviſed me to go to the Ld. <hi>Clarendon</hi> or <hi>Hyde:</hi> but
before I could do this, I was taken. As for that part of the Libel
which I left with <hi>Everard,</hi> as a Pledge to aſſure him I would not
betray him, I received it of the Lord <hi>Howard:</hi> And the Money
I received from the King, was for bringing a libel called <hi>The
King unvail'd,</hi> and the <hi>Lady Portſmouths Articles.</hi> I call God to
Witneſs, I never had a Farthing charity from the King.</p>
            <p>I do further confeſs and declare, That the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> told
me of a Deſign to ſeize upon the Kings Perſon, and to carry him
into the City, and there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
their Deſires. <hi>Heyns</hi> and my ſelf were privy to this deſign, and
had ſeveral Meetings with the <hi>Lord Howard;</hi> and as an Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
the <hi>Lord Howard</hi> aſſured us of breaking the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> taking off the Additional Revenue of the Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops,
Forty nine Men, and Grantees, whoſe Eſtates were to be
ſhar'd amongſt the Party.</p>
            <p>I do confeſs and declare. That while I was in <hi>Newgate,</hi> the
Sheriffs <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Corniſh,</hi> came to me, with a Token from the
Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> which I knew to be true, and brought Heads
with them from <hi>Everard,</hi> wherein he accuſed me of being a
Court Emiſſary, or <hi>Yorkiſt,</hi> put on by the King to put the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
into Proteſtant Houſes to trepan them. But I declare upon
my death I had no ſuch intent, nor do I know any ſuch thing:
The Sheriffs likewiſe told me I was to be tryed within three or
four days, that the People would Proſecute me, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
would impeach me, and that nothing would ſave my
life but diſcovering the Popiſh Plot: and then the Sheriffs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid
gave me great encouragement from the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi>
that if I would declare I believed ſo much of the Plot as
amounted to the introducing the R. C. or if I could find out any
that could Criminate the Queen, R. H. or make ſo much as a
plauſible Story to confirm the Plot, that the Parliament would
reſtore me to my fathers Eſtate, with the Profits thereof ſince
his Majeſties Reſtauration. I finding my ſelf in the condition I
was, in <hi>Newgate</hi> Fettered, Monyleſs and Friendleſs, my Wife
ready to Lye-in, without any ſubſiſtence, my Children in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
condition, and muſt needs be in a worſe my death,
and I could ſee no other Refuge for life but complying with
them, ſo, not with ambitious intent, but to ſave my life I did
comply: The Sheriffs brought inſtructions which they ſaid came
from the Lords and Commons, who met that day in order to
Addreſs to the King in my behalf, if I ſhould confirm the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
and they made uſe of the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Name, and
others, what Advantage I might have thereby. At the firſt I
made a formal Story concerning the Plot, which was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
<pb facs="tcp:105588:2"/>
to any body, but moſt relating to general heads known
publickly; upon which Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> told me, theſe were things
cried about the Streets two years ago: I replied, I could ſay
no more: Mr. Sheriff ſaid, he was ſorry for me with all his
heart, but thought I could ſay more if I would and preſſed me
hard to ſpeak to ſeveral Heads, unto which unleſs I ſpoke, he
ſaid, there was no hopes of life: the Heads I was to ſpeak to is
what the examination taken by Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> and Sir <hi>George
Treby</hi> contains, and a great deal more that I did not ſay then,
relating to the Queen, R. H. Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> declaring <hi>French</hi>
Penſioners, Lords, <hi>Hallifax, Hide, Clarendon, Feverſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

and others; the Burning the Fleet, Forts and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in Popiſh hands, Meal-Tub Plot, Prentices Plot, The
Contrivance of the libel on the Lady <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> being a <hi>French</hi>
Deſign to deſtroy Proteſtants. Theſe and many other Heads
were brought me by the Sheriffs.</p>
            <p>I do farther confeſs and declare, That Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> and
Sir <hi>George Treby</hi> coming to me to examine me, Sir <hi>Robert Clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
asked me what I could ſay concerning <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s Murder? I
anſwered, <hi>Something.</hi> He replied, it may be I was in a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
recollect your ſelf. And what I ſaid concerning Father
<hi>Patrick,</hi> was forced out of me: and what I ſaid concerning
him is not true. Sir <hi>George Treby</hi> was with me three hours,
or thereabouts, and preſſed to ſay concerning <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s Death:
And ſaid. Unleſs I could ſpeak to that Murder, I could ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
Whereupon, I ſaid ſomething I had from others. He ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, if I could ſay no more? I replyed, <hi>Is not this enough to
ſave my Life? Am I not Rogue enough?</hi> The Recorder hereupon
ſwore Gods wounds. What were you ever but a Rogue? Then
the Recorder entred upon the Heads of the Examination:
which being done, He told me, All this would not ſave my life,
unleſs I would ſpeak to the <hi>Libel,</hi> which was a Court-Trick:
And it was not for nothing that I had been ſo often ſeen at the
Lady <hi>Portſmouths.</hi> The <hi>L. Shaftsbury</hi> ſaid, You know more of
theſe matters than any man. Sir <hi>George</hi> would have me ſpeak to
the Conſult: that the Duke was at it, the Lords, <hi>Belaſis, Arundel,</hi>
and <hi>Powis</hi> were at it: You have ſeen them go to it at St. <hi>Jame</hi>'s
without doubt they were there: Do you but ſay it, we have
thoſe that will ſwear it.</p>
            <p>I do further declare and confeſs, That what I ſaid againſt the
Queen and the Duke, I was put upon in the matter of Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundbury
Godfrey</hi>'s Murder: And do further declare, That what
I ſwore againſt the Earl of <hi>Danby:</hi> the threatning words that
were uttered I did (to the beſt of my remembrance) hear, but
whom they concern'd I could not well know, by what my Lord
himſelf ſaid. And what <hi>de Puis</hi> told me concerning my Lord
of <hi>Danby,</hi> I believe was ſpoken out of ill will: And what I
ſaid againſt him, was to ſtave off my Trial till a Parliament:
and they were the more deſirous to accuſe the Lord <hi>Danby</hi> of
<hi>Godfrey's</hi> Murder becauſe the Crime of Murder is not inſerted
in his Pardon. I am ſorry for what I ſaid againſt the Queen,
his Royal Highneſs, and the Earl of <hi>Danby:</hi> I deſire God to
forgive me the wrong I did them, and do heartily beg their
pardon.</p>
            <p>I do further declare and proteſt, That this Confeſſion and
Declaration of mine I own ſincerely as a dying man, and not to
ſave my life; and I call God and all his Angels to witneſs the
truth of it; and I renounce Mercy at the hands of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
if this be not true.</p>
            <p>And I do further declare and proteſt as a dying man, unto
<hi>James Walmeſly, Edward Pattel,</hi> and <hi>Mary Walmeſly,</hi> That I have
made this Confeſſion and Declaration unto Dr. <hi>Hawkins,</hi> freely
and of my own voluntary accord, without any manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
made, or hopes given me by him from the King, of ſaving
my life by this Confeſſion; I having given him to underſtand
before hand, they were matters of conſequence, and ſuch as
chiefly concern'd the good of the King and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I give the Doctor my hearty thanks for all his Prayers, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
and Charitable Offices he hath done me, and I pray God
to bleſs him for ever for it. I forgive all the world, and deſire
all the world to forgive me; and the Lord have mercy on my

more than once, aſſured by me, that there was no
hope of his Life that I knew of, whatever he ſhould
ſay; nor of his Salvation, if he ſhould ſay any thing
that he knew to be falſe: of which he being through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſenſible, and perfectly convinced, proceeded to
write the <hi>Narrative</hi> aforeſaid. And I continuing to
admoniſh him upon every point that was material,
not to ſay any thing but what was exactly true, he
took occaſion, at ſeveral periods of his <hi>Narrative,</hi> to
kneel down, and ſolemnly to Proteſt the Truth of
every word therein contained. And this I do again
declare upon the Faith of a Chriſtian, and the word
of a Miniſter of the Goſpel.</p>

            <head>Mr. Fitz-Harris's Speech at his Execution at
Tyburn, <date>July 1. 1681.</date>
            </head>
            <p>GOod People, This Infamous kind of Death is much
more irksome to me, than Death it ſelf: Such a
Judgment as this my Sins againſt God may juſtly bring
upon me, and I do moſt humbly ſubmit unto it. But as
to the Crimes which I now die for, I take God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
I was no further concerned in the Libel, than to
diſcover to the King what Practices of that kind were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, being employed for that end, though thoſe
that employed me refuſed to do me Juſtice at my Tryal.
And I call God to Witneſs, I never had a Farthing of
Money of the King in my Life, but on the Account of
the like Service. And as to the Witneſſes that have ſworn
againſt me, I do here ſolemnly declare, now at my Death,
That I have not ſeen the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador ſince the
beginning of the breaking out of the Plot, neither have I
had any Acquaintance with him. And as to his
Confeſſor, I never ſpoke with him in my life; neither
have I had any dealing, either directly or indirectly in my
life with them, though Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> and the reſt
ſwore moſt falſly to the contrary. And how like it is
that the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador would give Three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Crowns for writing that Libel, I leave the World
to judge. What I might further declare, I have left
with Dr. <hi>Hawkins.</hi> I forgive all the World, and do
hope that God will forgive me. I beg the Prayers of all
good People for a happy Paſſage into the other World.</p>
