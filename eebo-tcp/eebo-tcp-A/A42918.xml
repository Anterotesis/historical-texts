         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of Francis Godolphin <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
Nephew and Heir, and one of the Adminiſtrators of Sir Will. Godolphin Kt. deceaſed,
in Reference to the Bill depending before the Honourable Houſe of Commons for the
better Diſcovery of all Lands, and other Revenues given to Superſtitious Uſes,
for Applying the ſame to the Uſe of <hi>Greenwich</hi> Hoſpital.</head>
            <p>THAT Sir <hi>William Godolphin</hi> died at <hi>Madrid</hi> in <hi>July</hi> 1696. ſeized of divers Lands in <hi>England,</hi> and poſſeſſed of a very
conſiderable Perſonal Eſtate in <hi>England,</hi> and divers other Countries, to a very great Value.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Sir <hi>William Godolphin</hi> ſome few days before his Death, did make a Nuncupative Will, and thereby did give to
his Nephew the ſaid <hi>Francis Godolphin,</hi> all his Lands in <hi>England,</hi> and 7000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, and to the Children of the ſaid Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
4000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, and to his Neice <hi>Elizabeth Godolphin,</hi> Wife of <hi>Charles Godolphin</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 4000 <hi>l.</hi> and to the ſaid <hi>Charles
Godolphin,</hi> 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and to his Uncle <hi>Francis Bluet,</hi> 200 <hi>l.</hi> which ſaid Nuncupative Will was reduced into Writing in the
Life-time of the ſaid Sir <hi>William Godolphin;</hi> But there being no Executor appointed, nor any Diſpoſition thereby made of
the Reſidue of his Perſonal Eſtate, Adminiſtration of the Goods of the ſaid Sir <hi>William Godolphin,</hi> with the ſaid Will annext,
was granted by the Judge of the Prerogative Court of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to the ſaid <hi>Francis Godolphin,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth Godolphin,</hi> they
being his next of Kin.</p>
            <p>Soon after the ſaid Adminiſtration granted, it was pretended, That the ſaid Sir <hi>William Godolphin</hi> did in his Life-time make
or Aſſent to ſome Notarial Act, by which he had Conſtituted certain Popiſh Prieſts his Teſtamentaries, (<hi>i. e.</hi> his Will-makers'
and had given them Authority after his Deceaſe to make his Will according to ſuch Directions as he had Communicated to
them, and that by ſuch Notarial Act he gave to each of his ſaid Teſtamentario's a Legacy, and alſo divers Sums of Money for
Superſtitious Uſes, and appointed others therein Named to Execute the Will that ſhould be made after his Death, for the
good of his Soul, which he therein declared to be his Univerſal Heir, and he did thereby Revoke all former Wills, Power
to make Wills and Diſpoſitions whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And it was further pretended, That the ſaid Prieſts and other Teſtamentaries, had, purſuant to that Authority,
made and publiſhed a Will in the Name of the ſaid Sir <hi>William Godolphin</hi> after his Deceaſe, whereby divers Sums of
Money were given and appointed to divers Popiſh Superſtitious Uſes, and ſome Endeavours were made to ſet up and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
that pretended Will and Diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the ſaid <hi>Francis Godolphin,</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Charles Godolphin,</hi> did apply themſelves to the High Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and obtained an Act to paſs in the Tenth Year of His Majeſty's Reign, whereby the ſaid Adminiſtration granted to
the ſaid <hi>Francis Godolphin</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth Godolphin,</hi> is confirmed and eſtabliſhed, and the ſaid Power to make a Will is declared
Null and Void; and the declaring his Soul to be his Univerſal Heir, and all the Gifts and Appointments made by the ſaid
Teſtamentario's, are alſo declared to be Void and of no Effect.</p>
            <p>By which Act of Parliament the ſaid <hi>Francis Godolphin</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth Godolphin,</hi> as Adminiſtrators of the Goods and Chattels
of the ſaid Sir <hi>William Godolphin,</hi> and as his next of Kin, became intituled to all the reſt and reſidue of the ſaid Sir <hi>William
Godolphin</hi>'s Perſonal Eſtate, not particularly diſpoſed of by the ſaid Nuncupative Will, Except as in the ſaid. Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is Excepted and Reſerved.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Francis Godolphin</hi> is Heir at Law to the ſaid Sir <hi>William Godolphin,</hi> and as his Heir, is in poſſeſſion of his
Real Eſtate.</p>
            <p>The Bill which is now brought into the Honourable Houſe of Commons for the better Diſcovery of all Lands, and
other Revenues given to Superſtitious Uſes for applying the ſame to the uſe of <hi>Greenwich</hi> Hoſpital, may Involve the ſaid
Adminiſtrators in great Troubles in Relation to the ſaid Perſonal Eſtate, and alſo the ſaid <hi>Francis Godolphin</hi> in relation to the
Real Eſtate in caſe it ſhould paſs, upon pretence that the ſaid Sir <hi>William Godolphin</hi> did give or appoint his ſaid real or
perſonal Eſtate, or any part of it to Popiſh Superſtitious Uſes; And the ſaid Bill being ſubſequent to the Act paſſed
in the Tenth Year of His Majeſty's Reign in favour of the ſaid <hi>Francis Godolphin</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth Godolphin</hi> the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and being contrary herein to the ſaid former Act, may be looked upon as a Repeal of the ſaid former Act, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
that Eſtabliſhment and Quiet in relation to the ſaid Sir <hi>William Godolphin</hi>'s Eſtate, which was intended for the ſaid <hi>Francis
Godolphin</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth Godolphin</hi> by the ſaid former Act.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it is humbly hoped by the ſaid <hi>Francis Godolphin,</hi> That the Honourable Houſe will permit a Clauſe to be brought in and added to the ſaid Bill to ſave the Right of the ſaid <hi>Francis Godolphin</hi> to the Eſtate of the ſaid <hi>William Godolphin,</hi> and that the ſaid Bill may not in any ſort defeat or alter the ſaid former Act, or any thing therein contained.</p>
