            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But reflecting upon that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and ſatisfaction, that I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in diſcourſing with you on ſuch matters; and knowing that your Noble Genius is gratiſied by ſuch kind of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations; I thought, I could not make more ſuitable payment for my content, or better acknowledge the favour I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in your acquaintance, then by preſenting you a Diſcourſe about <hi>Prae-exiſtence;</hi> and giving you a peculiar intereſt in <hi>it,</hi> as you have in its <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</hi> Not that I would ſuggeſt, that you are a favourer of any ſtrange opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or hold any thing in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or any other, that is ſit to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanc'd.

                  <p>IT is none of the leaſt commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble indulgences of our Church, that ſhe allows us a latitude of judging in points of <hi>Speculation;</hi> and ties not up mens Conſciences to an implicite aſſenting to opinions, not <hi>neceſſary</hi> or <hi>Fundamental;</hi> which favourable and kind <hi>permiſſion,</hi> is queſtionleſs a great obligation upon the ingenuous, ſubmiſſively to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and obſerve her pious appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>order.</hi> Nor is there leſs <hi>Reaſon</hi> in this <hi>parental in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,</hi> than there is of Chriſtian <hi>charity</hi> and <hi>prudence;</hi> ſince to tie all others up to our opinions, and to impoſe difficult and diſputable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters under the Notion of <hi>Confeſſions</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> is a moſt unchriſtian piece of
<pb facs="tcp:55102:9"/>
                     <hi>Tyranny,</hi> the foundation of <hi>perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and very root of <hi>Antichriſtianiſme.</hi> So that I have often wondred, that thoſe that heretofore would have forced all men to a compliance with their darling <hi>notions,</hi> and would have made a prey of them, that could not bow down before the <hi>Idol</hi> of their new-framed <hi>Orthodoxy;</hi> ſhould yet have the face to object <hi>perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and unchriſtian <hi>Tyranny</hi> to our Church Appointments; when them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves lie under a deep and Crimſon guilt of thoſe very ſame miſcarriages, which they endeavour to affix upon thoſe more innocent <hi>Conſtitutions.</hi> For is it not a far more blameable and obnoxious impoſition to frame <hi>Syſtems</hi> of diſputable <hi>Opinions,</hi> and to require their admittance into our <hi>Creeds,</hi> in the place of the moſt <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, neceſſary,</hi> and <hi>fundamental</hi> veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; Than it is to appoint ſome harmleſs orders of <hi>circumſtance</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:55102:9"/>
                     <hi>ceremony,</hi> which in themſelves are <hi>indifferent</hi> and <hi>innocent?</hi> And let any equal Man be Judge, which is the greater <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> either to <hi>Idolize</hi> and place <hi>Religion</hi> in things of <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute</hi> and meer <hi>opinions;</hi> or conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly to obſerve the <hi>Sanctions</hi> of that <hi>Authority</hi> we are bound to obey. But how all thoſe ill apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reproaches of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> recoyl upon thoſe that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them, I have fully proved in a Diſcourſe on this Subject, which in its due time may ſee the <hi>Light.</hi> But for the preſent I go on with what I was about; Therefore I ſay, 'tis a moſt commendable excellency in our <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions;</hi> which with all due regard ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged; That they lay ſtreſs on few matters of <hi>opinion,</hi> but ſuch as are of important concernment, or very <hi>meridian</hi> truths. Which I mention not to this purpoſe, as if
<pb facs="tcp:55102:10"/>
men might therefore indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in what conceits and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous opinions ſoever their phancies might give birth to, (This were an unpardonable abuſe of that noble and ingenuous Liberty that is affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us;) But that they might ſee the beauty of thoſe well temper'd Conſtitutions; and that the mouth of obloquy might be ſtopped that ſlanders our Church, as if it yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no ſcope at all for <hi>free inquiry;</hi> when I dare ſay there is not a Church in Chriſtendome, that in this regard is leſs taxable.</p>
                  <p>As for the opinion of <hi>Praeexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence,</hi> the ſubject of the following Papers, it was never determined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt by ours, nor any other Church, that <hi>I</hi> know of; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>I</hi> conceive is left as a matter of <hi>School Speculation,</hi> which without danger may be <hi>problematically</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on either hand. And I have ſo
<pb facs="tcp:55102:10"/>
great confidence in all true Sons of our common Mother, to think, that they will not fix any harſh and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere cenſures, upon the innocent <hi>Speculations</hi> of thoſe, though poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly they may be Errours, who own the <hi>Authority, Articles, Canons,</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of that Church which they are ſo deſervedly zealous for.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let me here premoniſh once for all, that I intend no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation in Religion, or diſturbance of our eſtabliſhed and received Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, by any thing I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in this little <hi>Treatiſe;</hi> But only an innocent repreſentation of an Antient and Probable opinion, which <hi>I</hi> conceive, may contribute ſomewhat towards the clearing and vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Divine Attributes,</hi> and ſo repreſenting the ever bleſſed <hi>Deity,</hi> as a more fit object of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration,</hi> than the <hi>Opinions</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> make him. And what ever
<pb facs="tcp:55102:11"/>
may be thought of the thing it ſelf, or the manage of this affair, I'm ſure the end and deſign is concerning and important, and deſerves at leaſt a favourable conſtruction of the undertaking. For there is nothing more for the intereſt of <hi>Religion,</hi> than that God be repreſented to his Creatures as amiable and lovely, which cannot be better done, than by clearing up his Providences and dealings with the Sons of men, and diſcovering them to be full of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Sweetneſs and Benignity; ſo that though I ſhould be miſtaken in the opinion which <hi>I</hi> endeavour to recommend, yet <hi>I</hi> expect the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the ingenuous, being betray'd into an errour, if it be one, by ſo pardonable an occaſion.</p>
                  <p>If it be excepted againſt this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, that the Doctrine of <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eexiſtence</hi> hath in a late Diſcourſe been purpoſely handled; beſides
<pb facs="tcp:55102:11"/>
what the learned Dr. <hi>More</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of it; and therefore that this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour may ſeem a ſuperfluous, unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Repetition: <hi>I</hi> anſwer, that that very Treatiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Account of <hi>Origen,</hi> made ſome ſuch thing as this expedient. For though the proof and management of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair be there unexceptionable, as far as the Author is by his deſign inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; yet, he being confined to the reaſons of <hi>Origen,</hi> and to the anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch objections, as the <hi>Fathers</hi> urged againſt him; hath not ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtated and cleared the buſineſs, but that there was room for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undertakers. And 'tis a great diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to ſo ſtrange and unuſual a Doctrine as this, to be but partially handled: ſince ſo long, it will not be underſtood, and conſequently be but expoſed to contempt and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy. Nor can we hope that the world will be ſo favourable to a <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:55102:12"/>
or take ſo much pains for the underſtanding of that which they think a <hi>groſs abſurdity,</hi> as to collect thoſe Principles that are ſcatter'd up and down the writings of that great and excellent Reſtorer of the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Cabbala,</hi> and accommodate them to the intereſt of this opinion. So that <hi>I</hi> thought that till the <hi>Reaſons, Anſwers, Principles,</hi> and <hi>particular State</hi> of the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> were brought all together, to talk of <hi>Praeexiſtence</hi> in Earneſt were but to make a mans ſelf ridiculous, and the Doctrine, the common <hi>Ludibrium</hi> of fools and ignorants.</p>
                  <p>And yet <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſs my ſelf to be ſo much a contemner of the half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted cenſurers of things they know not, that this Reaſon alone could not have moved my pen the breadth of a letter; But ſome ingenious friends of mine, who were willing to do their Maker right, in a due
<pb facs="tcp:55102:12"/>
apprehenſion of his Attributes and Providences, having read the <hi>Letter of Reſolution,</hi> and thence being induced to think favourably of <hi>Prae-exiſtence,</hi> were yet not fully ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the proof, nor able to give ſtop to thoſe <hi>objections,</hi> which their imperfect knowledge of the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> occaſioned; wherefore they deſired me to draw up a more full and particular Account of that Doctrine, which they had now a kindneſs for, and which wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to recommend it to them, but a clear and full repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. For their ſatisfaction then, <hi>I</hi> drew up the following Diſcourſe, intending at firſt, that it ſhould go no further than their hands, whoſe intereſt in mine affections had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it; but they being more than <hi>I</hi> could well pleaſure with writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Copies, and perceiving others of my acquaintance alſo, to whom
<pb facs="tcp:55102:13"/>
                     <hi>I</hi> owe regard and ſervice, to be in the like condition with theſe; <hi>I</hi> was induced to let this <hi>Little Triſle</hi> tread a more <hi>publick Stage;</hi> and to ſpeak my mind to them from the <hi>Preſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If</hi> further reaſon be expected for mine undertaking a buſineſs in which others have been ingaged, <hi>I</hi> would deſire them to conſider what an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite of Books are written upon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all ſubjects can be named. And <hi>I</hi> am confident, if they turn o're <hi>Libraries,</hi> they'l find no <hi>theam,</hi> that is of any conſideration, leſs tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced than this is. So that no body hath reaſon to call it a <hi>Crambe,</hi> who conſiders, that there are multitudes, even of Scholars that have never ſeen or heard of any thing of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; And there is not, that <hi>I</hi> know of, any one Book extant in any language beſides this, that purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſolely, and fully treats of <hi>Praeex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence.</hi> Wherefore who ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
<pb facs="tcp:55102:13"/>
this as a ſuperfluous ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if he will be juſt, muſt paſs the ſame cenſure upon well nigh every Diſcourſe the Preſs is deliver'd of; for hee'l meet with few written on leſs handled ſubjects. I might urge alſo if there were need on't, that various repreſentations of the ſame thing, fit the variety of phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and guſts of peruſers; and that may have force and prevalence to perſwade in one, which ſignifies nothing in another. But 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; he that will judge me on this account, muſt paſs the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on every Sermon he hears, and every Book he looks on; And ſuch a cenſure will do me as little hurt, as him good, that paſſeth it.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this exception, 'tis not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely that ſome may object, that I uſe <hi>Arguments</hi> that have already been pleaded in behalf of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; which rightly underſtood,
<pb facs="tcp:55102:14"/>
is no matter of diſrepute; ſince e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one elſe doth it that deals in a Subject formerly written of. And I would have him that commenceth ſuch a charge againſt me, to conſult divers Authours who have handled the ſame ſubject; and if he find not the ſame Arguments and Reaſons infinitely repeated every where, let him call me <hi>plagiary,</hi> and ſpare not. 'Tis true therefore I have not baulk't the reaſons of <hi>Origen,</hi> Dr. <hi>More,</hi> or the Authour of the <hi>Letter of Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,</hi> becauſe they had been uſed already; but freely own the aſſiſtance of thoſe worthy Authours; however I think I have ſo managed, fortified, and ſecured them againſt excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, eſpecially the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that <hi>I</hi> may reaſonably expect a pardon, yea and an intereſt in them alſo. For 'tis the backing of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that gives it force and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy; which <hi>I</hi> have done to the
<pb facs="tcp:55102:14"/>
moſt weighty of them, at my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per coſt and charges. Nor ſhould I have been faithful to my cauſe, had <hi>I</hi> omitted any thing that <hi>I</hi> thought confirm'd it, upon any pretence whatever; ſince poſſibly this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe may fall into the hands of ſome, who never met with thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Authors. And my deſign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a full proof, defence, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of <hi>Praeexiſtence,</hi> it had been an unpardonable defect to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted thoſe weighty reaſons by which its learned aſſertors have inforced it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If</hi> any yet ſhould criminate me (as <hi>I</hi> know ſome did the <hi>account of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,)</hi> for uſing many of the ſame <hi>words,</hi> and ſome of the ſame <hi>phraſes</hi> and <hi>expreſſions,</hi> that thoſe others, who have writ about thoſe matters, have made uſe of; <hi>I</hi> am not very careful to anſwer them in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and <hi>I</hi> doubt this engagement
<pb facs="tcp:55102:15"/>
againſt thoſe little ſcruples, will but ſeem importune to the judicious. For no body blames the frequent uſage of words of Art; or thoſe which the firſt <hi>Maſters</hi> or <hi>Reſtorers</hi> of any Doctrine have been wont to expreſs their notions by; ſince that ſuch words and expreſſions are beſt underſtood, as have by cuſtome, or the Authority of ſome great Authors, been appropriated to ſuch Doctrines, as they have imployed them in the ſervice of. And ſhould every man that writes on any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, be obliged to invent a-new, all the terms he hath need of, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly to ſhun thoſe <hi>proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive words</hi> and <hi>phraſes</hi> that are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his hands, and the buſineſs he is about; all things will be fill'd with <hi>impertinency, darkneſs</hi> and <hi>confuſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It muſt be acknowledged then, that moſt of the peculiar <hi>words</hi> and <hi>phraſes</hi> that either I, or any body
<pb facs="tcp:55102:15"/>
elſe that will ſpeak properly and intelligibly in this matter, make uſe of, are borrowed from the judicious and elegent contriver of them, the profound Reſtorer and Refiner of almoſt-extinct <hi>Platoniſm:</hi> Whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention hath been ſo happy in this kind, that it hath ſerved up thoſe notions in the moſt <hi>appoſite, ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, comprehenſive</hi> and <hi>expreſſive</hi> words that could well be thought of. Wherefore 'twere an humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome piece of folly for any man that deals in theſe matters, induſtriouſly to avoid ſuch <hi>termes</hi> and <hi>expreſſions</hi> as are ſo adapted and fitted to this purpoſe, and ſo well known among thoſe that are acquainted with this way of <hi>Learning;</hi> when without vanity he could not think to be better furniſh't from his own phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
                  <p>If in the following papers I have uſed any <hi>expreſſions</hi> of others, which
<pb facs="tcp:55102:16"/>
theſe conſiderations will not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; I muſt beg pardon for my <hi>memory,</hi> which doth not uſe to be ſo ſerviceable. And where I writ this Diſcourſe, I had not one of my books within my reach, that treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>indeed any other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi> Nor am I at leaſure now to examine them and <hi>this,</hi> to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I can find any ſuch <hi>coincidences;</hi> which a mans phancy dealing fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in ſuch matters, might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly occaſion. If any there be, let thoſe that find them out, pardon them, as the ſlips of a too <hi>officious imagination;</hi> or however elſe they treat them, they ſhall not much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe the Author.</p>
                  <p>And now that this Diſcourſe may paſs with leſs controul among thoſe that ſhall light on it, I find my ſelf ingag'd to ſpeak a little to a double ſort of Readers, who are like to be offended at my deſign, and averſe
<pb facs="tcp:55102:16"/>
to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> aſſerted in theſe <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</hi> And (1) ſome will boggle at <hi>Praeexiſtence,</hi> and be afraid to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, upon an apprehenſion that the Admiſſion of this opinion will diſorder and change the Frame of <hi>Orthodox</hi> Divinity; which, were there cauſe for ſuch a jealouſie, were but a commendable caution; but there's hope this may prove but a panick fear, or ſuch a needleſs ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour as ſurpriſeth Children in the dark, when they take their beſt friends for ſome <hi>Bug-Bear</hi> that would carry them away, or hurt them. For 'tis but ſuppoſing (as I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where intimated in the diſcourſe it ſelf) that God created all ſouls toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he did the Angels; That ſome of them ſinned and fell with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Apoſtate Spirits;</hi> and for their diſobedience were thruſt into a ſtate of ſilence and inſenſibility; That the <hi>Divine goodneſs</hi> ſo provided for
<pb facs="tcp:55102:17"/>
them, that they ſhould act a part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in <hi>terreſtrial Bodies,</hi> when they ſhould fitly be prepared for them; And that <hi>Adam</hi> was ſet up as our great <hi>Protoplaſt</hi> and <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> who, had he continued in <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> we had then been ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in that happineſs which he at firſt was inſtated in; but by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy defection and diſobedience we loſt it; and became thus miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in our <hi>New life</hi> in theſe earthly bodies. I ſay the Doctrine of <hi>Prae-exiſtence</hi> thus ſtated, is, in nothing that I know of, an enemy to <hi>common Theology:</hi> all things hence proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as in our ordinary Syſtems; with this only difference, that this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> clears the <hi>divine</hi> Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes from any ſhadow of harſhneſs, or breach of equity, ſince it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth us to have ſinned and deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the miſery we ſuffer in this condition before we came hither:
<pb facs="tcp:55102:17"/>
whereas the other which teacheth, that we became both guilty and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable by the ſingle and ſole offence of <hi>Adam,</hi> whenas we were not then in being, or as to our ſouls, as much as <hi>potentially</hi> in our great <hi>Progenitour;</hi> bears ſomewhat hardly upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of the <hi>Divine perfections.</hi> So that if the wary Reader be afraid to venture upon the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that I have drawn up at the end, (which, I confeſs, I would not give him the leaſt incouragement to meddle with) yet without danger he may admit of <hi>Praeexiſtence</hi> as accommodated to the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Nor ſhould I indeed have medled with the other <hi>ſcheme,</hi> which is built upon the <hi>Principles</hi> of meer <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> but that thoſe friends who drew the reſt of the Diſcour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e from me, ingag'd me to give them an Account of the <hi>Philoſophical Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis.</hi> In which, I know, I have
<pb facs="tcp:55102:18"/>
not in every particular, followed the mind of the Maſters of the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genian Cabbala;</hi> but kept my ſelf to the conduct of thoſe <hi>Principles,</hi> that I judged moſt rational; though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the things wherein I differ, are very few and inconſiderable. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever for that reaſon I thought fit to intitle no body to the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> that I have made a draught of, leſt I ſhould have affix't on any one, what he would not have owned. But for the main, thoſe that underſtand it, know the Fountain; and for others, 'tis no great matter if they be ignorant.</p>
                  <p>Now if any one judge me to be a Proſelyte to thoſe <hi>opinions,</hi> becauſe I call them not all to nought, or damn not thoſe, that have a favour for them; I know not how to avoid the doom of their ſevere diſpleaſure; having ſaid as much in the place where I treat of thoſe matters, to purge my ſelf of ſuch a ſuſpicion, as I thought neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb facs="tcp:55102:18"/>
to clear me, in the opinion of any competently ingenuous. As for others, let me ſay what I can, I ſhall be what their wiſdoms think fit to call me; And let that be what it will, I am very well content to bear it. I'le only add, to take off the ground of this uncharitable jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that among the favourers of <hi>Praeexiſtence,</hi> I know none that are adherers to thoſe <hi>opinions;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for me to have declaim'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any, on this account, had been a piece of <hi>Knight-Errantry;</hi> And thoſe <hi>Dons</hi> that do ſo make <hi>Gyants</hi> of the <hi>Wind-mills</hi> of their own <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, (2) There are another ſort of Readers that I have a word to ſay to, who contemn and laugh at every thing that their narrow noddles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend not. This, I confeſs, is a good <hi>eaſie</hi> way of <hi>confutation,</hi> and if we may take every fool's ſmile for a
<pb facs="tcp:55102:19"/>
                     <hi>Demonſtration, Praeexiſtence</hi> will be routed. But the beſt on't is, to call things by their right names, this is but a vulgar, childiſh humour ariſing from nothing but a fond doating on the opinions we were firſt inſtructed in. For having made thoſe the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of truth and ſolidity, theſe prepoſſeſt diſcerners preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude every thing that is a ſtranger to their ears and underſtandings, and of another ſtamp from their <hi>Education-receptions,</hi>

                     <p>The opinions propoſed concerning the original of Souls.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT hath always been found a matter of diſcouraging difficulty, among thoſe that have buſied themſelves in ſuch <hi>Inquiries,</hi> To determine the <hi>Soul</hi>'s <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal.</hi> Inſomuch that after all the conteſts and diſputes that have been about it, many of the wiſeſt Inquiſitors have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it <hi>undeterminable:</hi> or, if they have ſate down in either of the two opinions, <hi>viz.</hi> of it's <hi>immediate Creation,</hi> or <hi>Traducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (which of later ages have been the only competitors); they have been driven to it, rather from the abſurdities of the <hi>oppoſite opinion,</hi> which they have left; than drawn by any rational <hi>alliciency</hi> in that which they have taken to. And indeed, if we do but impartially conſider the grand inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55102:25"/>
which each party urgeth againſt the others Concluſion, it would even tempt one to think, that both are right in their <hi>oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and neither in their <hi>aſſertion.</hi> And ſince each ſide ſo ſtrongly oppugns the other and ſo weakly defends it ſelf, 'tis a ſhrewd ſuſpicion that they are both miſtaken. Wherefore if there be a <hi>third</hi> that can lay any probable claim to the truth, it deſerves to be heard to plead its cauſe; and, if it be not chargeable with the contradictions or abſurdities either of the one or other, to be admitted.</p>
                  <p>Now though theſe later ages have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the matter to lie between <hi>immediate Creation,</hi> and <hi>ſeminal Traduction;</hi> yet I find that the more <hi>antient</hi> times have pitcht upon <hi>Praeexiſtence,</hi> as more likely than either; For the <hi>Platoniſts, Pythagoreans,</hi> the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daean</hi> wiſe men, the Jewiſh <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and ſome of the moſt learned and antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were of this opinion. Wherefore I think we owe ſo much at leaſt to the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</hi> of thoſe grave <hi>Sages,</hi> as to examine this <hi>Doctrine</hi> of theirs, and if neither of the later <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> can eaſe our anxious minds, or free themſelves from abſurdities; and this Grey <hi>Dogma</hi> fairly clear all doubts, and be obnoxious to no ſuch contradictions; I ſee no reaſon but we may give it a favourable admittance, till ſomething elſe appear
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55102:25"/>
more concinnous and rational. Therefore let us take ſome account of what the two firſt <hi>opinions</hi> alledge one againſt another, and how they are proved by their promoters and defendants. Now if they be found unable to withſtand the ſhock of one anothers op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; we may reaſonably caſt our eyes upon the third, to ſee what force it brings to vouch its intereſt, and how it will behave it ſelf in the encounter.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Daily creation <hi>of</hi> Souls <hi>is inconſiſtent</hi> with the Divine Attributes.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe firſt of theſe <hi>opinions</hi> that offers it ſelf to Tryal is, <hi>that God daily creates humane ſouls, which immediately are united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bodies that Generation hath prepared for them.</hi> Of this ſide are our later <hi>Divines,</hi> and the generality of the <hi>Schoolmen.</hi> But not to be born down by <hi>Authorities,</hi> Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what reaſon ſtands againſt it. Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) If our Souls came immediately out of the hands of God when we came firſt into theſe bodies, Whence then are thoſe enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly brutiſh inclinations, that ſtrong natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral proclivity to vice and impiety, that are exſtant in the children of men? All the works
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55102:26"/>
of God bear his image, and are perfect in their kind. Purity is his nature, and what comes from him, proportionably to its capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city partakes of his perfections. Every thing in the <hi>natural world</hi> bears the ſuperſcription of his <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>goodneſs;</hi> and the ſame foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain cannot ſend forth <hi>ſweet</hi> waters and <hi>bitter.</hi> Therefore 'tis a part of our allegiance to our Maker to believe, * that he made us <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>innocent,</hi> and if we were but juſt then fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by him when we were united with theſe <hi>terreſtrial bodies,</hi> whence ſhould we contract ſuch degenerate propenſions? Some tell us, that this impurity was immediately derived from the <hi>bodies</hi> we are united to; But, how is it poſſible, that purely <hi>paſſive inſenſible</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould transfuſe <hi>habits</hi> or <hi>inclinations</hi> into a Nature that is quite of another Make and Quality? How can ſuch a cauſe produce an effect ſo diſproportionate? * Matter can do nothing but by motion, and what relation hath <hi>that</hi> to a moral contagion? How can a <hi>Body</hi> that is neither capable of <hi>ſenſe</hi> nor <hi>ſin,</hi> infect a <hi>ſoul,</hi> as ſoon as 'tis united to it, with ſuch vitious debauched diſpoſitions?</p>
                  <p>But others think to evade by ſaying, That we have not theſe <hi>depravities</hi> in our natures, but contract them by <hi>Cuſtome, education,</hi> and evil <hi>uſages.</hi> How then comes it about, that thoſe that have had the ſame care and induſtry uſed upon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55102:26"/>
them, and have been nurtured under the ſame diſcipline and ſevere overſight, do ſo vaſtly and even to wonder differ in their <hi>inclinations?</hi> * How is it that thoſe that are under continual temptations to <hi>vice,</hi> are yet kept within the bounds of <hi>vertue,</hi> and ſobriety?

couple of <hi>unclean Adulterers</hi> ſhall think fit to join in their <hi>beſtial pleaſures;</hi> is methinks to have a very mean apprehenſion of the <hi>divine Majeſty</hi> and <hi>Purity.</hi> This is to make him the worſt of <hi>Servants</hi> by ſuppoſing him to <hi>ſerve</hi> his creature's vices, to wait upon the vileſt actions, and to engage the ſame infinite Power that made the world for the perfecting what was begun by <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Wantons.</hi> This Argument was uſed of old by pious and learned <hi>Origen,</hi> and hath been imployed in the ſame ſervice ſince, by his <hi>modern</hi> defendents. But I foreſee an <hi>evaſion</hi> or two, that poſſibly with ſome may ſtand for an <hi>anſwer,</hi> the removal of which will clear the buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>It may be pretended that God's atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>create</hi> ſouls for the ſupply of ſuch <hi>generations,</hi> is but an act of his <hi>juſtice,</hi> for the <hi>detection,</hi> and conſequently <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,</hi> of ſuch lawleſs offenders; which therefore will be no more matter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement than the waiting of an <hi>Officer</hi> of <hi>juſtice</hi> to diſcover and apprehend a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this Subterfuge cannot elude the force of the <hi>Argument,</hi> for it hath no place at all in moſt Adulteries; yea great <hi>injuſtice</hi> and <hi>injury</hi> is done many times by ſuch <hi>illegitimate</hi> births; the Child of a Stranger being by this means admitted

to carry away the <hi>inheritance</hi> from the <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> off-ſpring.

                  </p>
                  <p>But further it may be ſuggeſted, that it is no more <hi>indecent</hi> for God to <hi>create ſouls</hi> to furniſh thoſe <hi>unlawful Generations,</hi> than it is that a man ſhould be nouriſht by meat that he hath unlawfully come by, or that the <hi>Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> which he hath ſtoln ſhould ingender with his own. But the difference of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances from the caſe in hand is eaſily diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; in that the <hi>nouriſhment</hi> and <hi>productions</hi> ſpoken of, proceed in a ſet orderly way of <hi>natural cauſes,</hi> which work <hi>fatally</hi> and <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily</hi> without reſpect to <hi>moral circumſtances;</hi> and there is no reaſon, it ſhould be in the power of a ſinful creature to engage his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> to pervert or ſtop the courſe of nature, when he pleaſeth. But in the caſe of creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouls, God is ſuppoſed to act by <hi>explicite</hi> and <hi>immediate Will,</hi> the ſuſpending of which,

in ſuch a caſe as this, is far different in point of credit and <hi>decorum,</hi> from his altering the ſetled <hi>Laws</hi> he hath ſet in the Creation, and turning the world upſide down.</p>
                  <p>I might further add <hi>(4ly),</hi> That * it ſeems very <hi>incongruous</hi> and <hi>unhandſome</hi> to ſuppoſe, that God ſhould create two <hi>ſouls</hi> for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of one <hi>monſtrous body.</hi> And of ſuch <hi>prodigious productions</hi> there is mention in <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</hi> That's a remarkable inſtance in <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus,</hi> of a <hi>Monſter</hi> born at <hi>Emmaus</hi> with two <hi>hearts,</hi> and two <hi>heads;</hi> the diverſity of whoſe <hi>appetites, perceptions,</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that it had two ſouls within that <hi>bi-partite habitation.</hi> Now, to conceive the moſt <hi>wiſe Maker</hi> and <hi>Contriver</hi> of all things, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to create two <hi>ſouls,</hi> for a <hi>ſingle</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, rather than ſuffer that <hi>ſuper-plus</hi> of <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> which conſtitutes the <hi>monſtrous excreſcence</hi> to prove <hi>effoete &amp; inanimate,</hi> is methinks a <hi>derogatory apprehenſion</hi> of his <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and ſuppoſeth him to act more <hi>ineptly</hi> in the great and <hi>immediate</hi> inſtances of his power, than in the ordinary courſe of nature about leſs noble and accurate <hi>productions.</hi> Or, if it be pretended, that <hi>Souls</hi> were ſent into them while the <hi>bodies</hi> were yet <hi>diſtinct,</hi> but that afterwards they grew into one: This, I ſay, will not heal the breach that this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> makes upon the <hi>divine Wiſdom;</hi> it tacitely reflecting a ſhameful overſight upon <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:55102:31"/>
that he ſhould not be aware of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>coaleſcence</hi> of theſe bodies into one, when he made ſouls for them; or at leaſt, 'tis to ſuppoſe him, <hi>knowingly</hi> to act <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>And now one would think that an <hi>opinion</hi> ſo very <hi>obnoxious,</hi> and ſo lyable to ſuch grand <hi>inconveniences,</hi> ſhould not be admitted but upon moſt preſſing <hi>reaſons</hi> and <hi>ineludible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations.</hi> And yet there is not an <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> that I ever heard of from reaſon to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it, but only ſuch as are brought: from the impoſſibility of the way of <hi>Traduction;</hi> which indeed is chargeable with as great <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities,</hi> as that we have been diſcourſing of. 'Tis true, ſeveral <hi>Scriptures</hi> are <hi>preſt</hi> for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the cauſe; but I doubt much againſt their <hi>intent</hi> and <hi>inclination.

                  <p>Thus we ſee then that the <hi>traduction</hi> of the Soul, ſuppoſing it to be <hi>produced</hi> out of <hi>nothing,</hi> cannot be defended.</p>
                  <p>Nor doth the ſecond general way yield any more relief to this <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> For if it be made of any thing <hi>praeexiſtent,</hi> it is either

                  <p>There are but two reaſons that I can think of, worth the naming: (1) <hi>A man</hi> begets <hi>a man,</hi> and <hi>a man</hi> he is not without a <hi>Soul,</hi> therefore 'tis pretended that the <hi>ſoul</hi> is <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</hi> But this argument is eaſily detected of palpable <hi>ſophiſtry,</hi> and is as if one ſhould argue, a man is <hi>mortal,</hi> therefore his <hi>Soul</hi> is <hi>mortal;</hi> or is <hi>fat</hi> and <hi>luſty,</hi> therefore his <hi>Soul</hi> is <hi>ſo.</hi> The abſurdity of which kinds of <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning</hi> lyes in drawing that into a <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>rigorous affirmation,</hi> which is only meant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>vulgar</hi> ſpeech, and is true only in ſome remarkable <hi>reſpect</hi> or <hi>circumſtance.</hi> Thus we ſay, A <hi>man</hi> begets a <hi>man</hi> becauſe he doth the <hi>viſible</hi> and only <hi>ſenſible</hi> part of him; The vulgar, to whom common ſpeech is accommodate, not taking ſo much notice of what is paſt the ken of their <hi>ſenſes.</hi> And therefore <hi>Body</hi> in ordinary ſpeaking is oft put for <hi>Perſon,</hi> as here <hi>man</hi> for the <hi>body.</hi> Sometimes the <hi>nobleſt part</hi> is uſed for the <hi>whole,</hi> as when 'tis ſaid 70 Souls went down with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt;</hi> therefore ſuch arguments as the <hi>aſſerters</hi> of <hi>traduction</hi> make uſe of, which are drawn from vulgar <hi>ſchemes</hi> of <hi>ſpeech,</hi> argue nothing but the deſperateneſs of the <hi>cauſe,</hi> that needs ſuch pitiful <hi>ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries</hi> to recommend it.

For the firſt; I ſuppoſe very few have ſuch <hi>narrow Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the <hi>divine power,</hi> as to affirm that <hi>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence</hi> could not produce all thoſe beings at firſt, which apart he is ſuppos'd to <hi>create daily;</hi> which implies no <hi>contradiction,</hi> or as much as <hi>difficulty,</hi> to be <hi>conceived;</hi> and which <hi>de facto</hi> he hath done in the caſe of <hi>Angels.</hi> Or, if <hi>inconſiſtence</hi> with any <hi>Attribute</hi> ſhould be pretended, <hi>that</hi> ſhall be prov'd quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe hereafter; And the <hi>amicable</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> with them, yea, the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of it, from this very conſideration of the <hi>divine Attributes,</hi> ſhall be argued in the proceſs.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, whoever concludes that <hi>God</hi> made not all <hi>ſouls</hi> of old, when he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the world out of nothing, muſt confeſs the reaſon of this aſſertion to be, becauſe he <hi>would not.</hi> And then I would ask him, how he came to know what he affirms ſo boldly? Who acquainted him with the <hi>Divine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels?</hi> Is there a word ſaid in his <hi>revealed Will</hi> to the contrary? or, hath he by his <hi>holy</hi> pen-men told us that either of the other ways was more ſutable to his <hi>beneplaciture?</hi> Indeed, 'tis very likely that a ſtrong and ready <hi>phancy,</hi> poſſeſt with a perſwaſion of the falſhood of this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> might find ſome half phraſes in <hi>Scripture,</hi> which he might ſuborn to ſing to the tune of his <hi>imagination.</hi> For, in ſuch a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55102:38"/>
                     <hi>Miſcellaneous</hi> piece as the <hi>Bible</hi> is, it will not be difficult for a man that's ſtrongly reſolv'd againſt an opinion, to find ſomewhat or other that may ſeem to him to ſpeak the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of his <hi>phancy;</hi> And therefore it ſhall go hard, but that thoſe whom their <hi>educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or <hi>prejudice</hi> have engaged againſt this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> will light on ſome obſcure pieces of <hi>texts,</hi> and broken ſentences or other, that ſhall ſeem to condemn what they diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of. But I am ſecurely confident, that there is not a ſentence in the <hi>ſacred volume,</hi> from end to end, that ever was intended to teach, that all <hi>Souls</hi> were not <hi>made</hi> of <hi>old;</hi> or that, by a legitimate conſequence, would inferr it. And if any there be that ſeem to look another way, I dare ſay they are <hi>colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral,</hi> and were never deſigned by the <hi>divine</hi> Authors for the purpoſe they are made to ſerve, by the enemies of <hi>Praeexiſtence.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to conceal any thing that with the leaſt ſhew of probability can be pretended from the <hi>ſacred volume</hi> in diſcountenance of the Doctrine of <hi>Praeexiſtence,</hi> I'le bring into view whatever I know to have the leaſt face of a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> to the contrary, in the <hi>divine Revelations.</hi> That ſo, when it ſhall appear that the moſt ſpecious <hi>Texts</hi> that can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, have nothing at all in them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the <hi>ſouls praeexiſtence,</hi> we may be ſecure that God hath not diſcovered to us in his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55102:39"/>
                     <hi>written will,</hi> that 'twas not his <hi>pleaſure</hi> to <hi>create</hi> all <hi>ſouls</hi> together.</p>
                  <p>Therefore (1.), It may be pretended, that the Doctrine of <hi>Praeexiſtence</hi> comports not with that <hi>innocence</hi> and <hi>integrity</hi> in which the <hi>Scripture</hi> determines <hi>Adam</hi> to have been made. Since it ſuppoſeth the <hi>deſcent</hi> into theſe <hi>bodies</hi> to be a <hi>culpable lapſe</hi> from an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and better ſtate of <hi>Life,</hi> and this to be a ſtate of <hi>incarceration</hi> for former <hi>delinquencies.</hi> To this I <hi>anſwer,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) No one can object any thing to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe againſt <hi>Praeexiſtence</hi> from the <hi>unconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs</hi> of it, until he know the particular <hi>frame</hi> of the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> without which, all <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnations</hi> relating to the <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>thing,</hi> will be wide of the mark, and but little to the buſineſs. Therefore, if the Objector would have patience to wait till we come to that part of our undertaking, he would find that there was but little ground for ſuch a <hi>ſcruple.</hi> But however, to prevent all cavillings, in this place I'le ſhew the <hi>invalidity</hi> of this <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</hi> Wherefore,</p>
                  <p>(2) There is no neceſſity from the Doctrine of <hi>Praeexiſtence</hi> to ſuppoſe <hi>Adam</hi> a <hi>Delinquent,</hi> before his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>tranſgreſſion</hi> in a <hi>terreſtrial</hi> body: for conſidering, that his <hi>body</hi> had vaſt <hi>advantages</hi> above ours, in point of <hi>Beauty, Purity,</hi> and <hi>Serviceableneſs</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:55102:39"/>
to the Soul, what harſhneſs is there in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that God might ſend one of thoſe <hi>immaculate Spirits</hi> that he had made, into ſuch a Tenement, that he might be his <hi>ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> in the affairs of this <hi>lower Family;</hi> and an <hi>overſeer,</hi> and <hi>ruler</hi> of thoſe other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that he had ordered to have their dwelling upon earth? I am ſure, there is no more contrariety to any of the <hi>Divine Attributes</hi> in this <hi>ſuppoſition,</hi> than there is in that, which makes God to have ſent a <hi>pure</hi> ſpirit, which he had <hi>juſt</hi> made, into ſuch a <hi>body.</hi> Yea,</p>
                  <p>(3) Suppoſing that ſome <hi>Souls fell,</hi> when the <hi>Angels</hi> did (which the proceſs of our diſcourſe will ſhew to be no unreaſonable ſuppoſition) this was a <hi>merciful proviſion</hi> of our <hi>Maker,</hi> and a generous undertaking for a <hi>Seraphick</hi> and <hi>untainted Spirit.</hi> For by this means, fit and congruous <hi>matter</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for thoſe Souls to reſide and act in, who had rendred themſelves unfit to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>enjoy</hi> themſelves in more <hi>refined bodies.</hi> And ſo thoſe Spirits that had <hi>ſinned</hi> themſelves into a ſtate of <hi>ſilence</hi> and <hi>inactivity,</hi> are by this <hi>ſeaſonable means,</hi> which the <hi>divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> hath contrived for them, put once more into a capacity of acting their parts anew, and coming into play again. Now if it ſeem hard to any to conceive how ſo noble a <hi>Spirit</hi> in ſuch an <hi>advantagious body,</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:55102:40"/>
ſhould have been impoſed upon by ſo groſs a <hi>deluſion,</hi> and ſubmit ſo <hi>impotently</hi> to the firſt <hi>temptation;</hi> He may pleaſe to conſider, that the difficulty is the ſame, ſuppoſing him juſt then to have been <hi>made;</hi> if we grant him but that <hi>purity</hi> and thoſe great <hi>perfections</hi> both of <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>underſtanding,</hi> which <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox theology</hi> allows him.</p>
                  <p>Yea, again (4) I might ask, What <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience</hi> there is in ſuppoſing, that <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf was one of thoſe <hi>delinquent Souls,</hi> * which the divine <hi>pity</hi> and <hi>compaſſion</hi> had thus ſet up again; that ſo, ſo many of his excellent Creatures might not be loſt and undone irrecoverably; but might act anew, though upon a lower ſtage in the univerſe? A due conſideration of the <hi>infinite foecundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and fulneſs of the <hi>divine goodneſs</hi> will, if not <hi>warrant,</hi> yet <hi>excuſe</hi> ſuch a <hi>ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now if it be demanded, What <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage Adam</hi>'s ſtanding had been to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, had he continued in the ſtate of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence;</hi> and how <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>miſery</hi> is brought upon us by his <hi>Fall,</hi> according to this <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis?</hi> I anſwer, that then among many other great priviledges, he had tranſmitted downwards by way of natural <hi>generation</hi> that <hi>excellent</hi> and <hi>bleſſed temper</hi> of <hi>body;</hi> which ſhould have been like his own <hi>happy craſis.</hi> So that our <hi>apprehenſions</hi> ſhould have been
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55102:40"/>
more <hi>large</hi> and <hi>free,</hi> our <hi>affections</hi> more <hi>regular</hi> and <hi>governable;</hi> and our <hi>inclinations</hi> to what is good and vertuous, <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>vigorous.</hi> For we cannot but obſerve in this <hi>ſtate,</hi> how vaſt an influence the temper of our <hi>bodies</hi> hath upon our <hi>minds;</hi> both in reference to <hi>intellectual</hi> and <hi>moral diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Thus, daily experience teacheth us, how that, according to the <hi>ebb</hi> or <hi>flow</hi> of certain humours in our bodies, our wits are either more <hi>quick, free,</hi> and <hi>ſparkling,</hi> or elſe more <hi>obtuſe, weak,</hi> and <hi>ſluggiſh.</hi> And we find that there are certain <hi>clean</hi> and <hi>heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> diſpoſitions of <hi>body</hi> which make us <hi>cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> and <hi>contented;</hi> others on the contrary <hi>moroſe, melancholy,</hi> and <hi>dogged.</hi> And 'tis eaſie to obſerves how <hi>age</hi> or <hi>ſickneſs</hi> ſowers, and crabbs our natures. I might inſtance in almoſt all other <hi>qualities</hi> of the <hi>mind,</hi> which are ſtrangely influenc't and modifyed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the bodies <hi>conſtitution.</hi> But none will deny ſo plain a truth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I forbear to inſiſt further on it. Nor need I mention any more <hi>advantages;</hi> ſo many, and ſuch <hi>great</hi> ones, being conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon <hi>this.</hi> But our great <hi>Protoplaſt</hi> and <hi>repreſentative,</hi> falling through his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy <hi>diſobedience,</hi> beſides the integrity and rectitude of his <hi>mind,</hi> he loſt alſo that <hi>bleſſed conſtitution</hi> of <hi>Body,</hi> which would have been ſo great a priviledg to his <hi>off-ſpring:</hi> ſo that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55102:41"/>
it became now <hi>corrupt, weak,</hi> and <hi>indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> for the nobler exerciſes of the Soul; and he could tranſmit no better to us, than himſelf was owner of. Thus we <hi>ſell in him,</hi> and were made <hi>miſerable</hi> by his <hi>tranſgreſſion.</hi> We have bodies conveyed to us, which ſtrangely do <hi>bewitch</hi> and <hi>betray</hi> us. And thus we all bear about us the marks of the <hi>firſt apoſtacy.</hi> There are other ſad effects of his <hi>defection,</hi> but this may ſuffice for my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe. Thus we ſee how that the <hi>derivation</hi> of <hi>original depravity</hi> from <hi>Adam</hi> is as clear in this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> as can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in either of the other. And upon other Accounts it ſeems to have much the advantage of both of them. As will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the <hi>unprejudiced</hi> in what is further to be diſcourſed of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Finally,</hi> therefore, If the urgers of the <hi>Letter</hi> of <hi>Geneſis</hi> of either ſide, againſt this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> would but conſider, <hi>That the Souls that deſcend hither, for their praevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in another ſtate, lye in a long condition of ſilence and inſenſibility, before they appear in terreſtrial bodies;</hi> each of them then might, from the doctrine of <hi>Praeexiſtence</hi> thus ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, gain all the <hi>advantages</hi> which he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth to have by his <hi>own opinion,</hi> and avoid all thoſe <hi>alſurdities</hi> which he ſeeth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther run upon. If the Aſſerters of <hi>daily Creation</hi> think it clear from Scripture that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55102:41"/>
                     <hi>God is the Father of Spirits, and immediate maker of Souls,</hi> they'l find the <hi>ſame</hi> made good and aſſented to in this <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> And if they are unwilling to hold any thing contrary to the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> which is <hi>immortal</hi> and <hi>indiſcerpible,</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Praeexiſtence</hi> amicably cloſeth with them in this alſo.</p>
                  <p>And if the Patrons of <hi>Traduction</hi> would have a way, how <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>miſery</hi> may be <hi>propagated</hi> from our <hi>firſt Parent</hi> without aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing the <hi>divine Attributes,</hi> or affirming any thing contrary to the <hi>phaenomena</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> and <hi>Nature;</hi> this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> will clear the buſineſs; It giving us ſo fair an Account how we all <hi>dye</hi> in <hi>Adam,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blotting the <hi>Wiſdom, Juſtice,</hi> or <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> of God, or affirming any thing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the <hi>Appearances</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have been the longer on this Argument, becauſe 'tis like to be one main <hi>objection;</hi> And we ſee it is ſo far from prejudicing, that it is no inconſiderable evidence of the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Praeexiſtence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, beſides this that I have named, I cannot think of any <hi>Arguments</hi> from <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> againſt this Doctrine, conſiderable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to excuſe a mention of them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if the <hi>candid Reader</hi> will pardon the impertinency I'le preſent to view what I find moſt <hi>colourable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:55102:42"/>
Therefore (2), It may be ſome are ſo inadvertent as to urge againſt our <hi>ſouls</hi> having been of <hi>old,</hi> that, <hi>Sacred</hi> writ ſays <hi>We are but of Yeſterday;</hi> which expreſſion of <hi>divine Scripture,</hi> is queſtionleſs to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of our <hi>appearance</hi> on this <hi>ſtage</hi> of <hi>Earth.</hi> And is no more an <hi>Argument</hi> againſt our <hi>Praeexiſtence,</hi> than that other phraſe of his, <hi>Before I go hence,</hi> and <hi>Be no more,</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our <hi>future exiſtence</hi> in an other ſtate after the preſent life is ended. Nor will it prove more the buſineſs it is brought for, than the expreſſion of <hi>Rachels weeping for her Children becauſe they were not,</hi> will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr, that they were, <hi>abſolutely nothing.</hi> Nor can any thing more be made.</p>
                  <p>(3.) Of that place in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes, Yea, better is he than both they,</hi> (meaning the <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>living) which hath not yet been;</hi> ſince, beſids that 'tis a like <hi>ſcheme</hi> of <hi>ſpeech</hi> with the former, it ſeems more to favour, than diſcountenance <hi>Praeexiſtence;</hi> for what is <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely nothing</hi> can neither be <hi>worſe,</hi> nor <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Moreover, we coming from a ſtate of <hi>ſilence</hi> and <hi>inactivity</hi> when we drop into <hi>theſe bodies,</hi> we were before, as if we had <hi>not been;</hi> and ſo there is better ground in this caſe, for ſuch a manner of ſpeaking, than in meer <hi>non-appearance;</hi> which yet Scripture phraſeth a <hi>Not being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>* And now I cannot think of any place
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55102:42"/>
in the <hi>Sacred volume</hi> more that could make a tolerable plea againſt this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> of our <hi>Souls</hi> having been before they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe <hi>bodies;</hi> except</p>
                  <p>(4.) Any will draw a <hi>negative Argument</hi> from the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Creation,</hi> concluding that the <hi>Souls</hi> of men were not made of <hi>old,</hi> becauſe there is no mention there, of any ſuch matter. To which I return briefly, That the ſame Argument concludes againſt the being of <hi>Angels,</hi> of whoſe <hi>Creation</hi> there is no more ſay'd in the firſt <hi>ſtory</hi> than of this <hi>inferiour</hi> rank of <hi>Spirits, Souls.</hi> The reaſon of which <hi>ſilence</hi> is commonly taken to be, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> had here to do with a rude and <hi>illiterate</hi> people, who had few or no apprehenſions of any thing beyond their <hi>ſenſes,</hi> and therefore he takes notice to them of nothing but what was <hi>ſenſible</hi> and of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon obſervation. This reaſon is given alſo why <hi>minerals</hi> were omitted. 'Twere an eaſy matter, to ſhew how the outward <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex,</hi> the <hi>Letter</hi> of this <hi>Hiſtory</hi> is adapted to mean and vulgar apprehenſions, whoſe <hi>nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs</hi> renders them incapable of <hi>ſublimer ſpeculations.</hi> But that being more than needs for our preſent purpoſe, I ſhall forbear to ſpeak further of it.</p>
                  <p>I might (2) further add, that great and learned <hi>Interpreters</hi> tell us, that all ſorts of <hi>Spirits, Angels,</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi> are <hi>ſymbollically</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:55102:43"/>
meant by the <hi>creation</hi> of <hi>heaven,</hi> and <hi>light.</hi> And, if it were directly in the way of our preſent buſineſs, it might be made appear to be no improbable conjecture. But I referr him that is curious in this particular to the great <hi>Reſtorer</hi> of the <hi>antient Cabbala,</hi> the Learned Dr. <hi>H. More</hi> in his <hi>conjectura Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baliſtica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now from the conſideration of the <hi>ſilence</hi> of the <hi>firſt Hiſtory,</hi> we deſcend to the laſt and moſt likely to be urged <hi>ſcruple,</hi> which is to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>(5.) We are not to ſtep beyond the <hi>divine Revalations,</hi> and ſince God hath made known no ſuch Doctrine as this, of the Souls <hi>Praeexiſtence</hi> any where in his word, we may reaſonably deny it, or at leaſt have no ground to imbrace it. This is the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant <hi>objection</hi> of all the reſt, and moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prepoſſeſs timorous and wary inquirers againſt this <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> wherefore I conceive that a full anſwer to this doubt, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent many ſcrupulous <hi>Haeſitations,</hi> and make way for an unprejudic'd hearing of what I have further to alledge in the behalf of this <hi>opinion.</hi> And</p>
                  <p>(1.) I wiſh that thoſe that urge <hi>Scripture ſilence</hi> to diſprove <hi>praeexiſtence</hi> would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how <hi>ſilent</hi> it is both in the caſe of <hi>Daily Creation,</hi> and <hi>Traduction;</hi> we have ſeen already that there is nothing in <hi>Sacred</hi> writ
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55102:43"/>
to warrant either, but only ſuch <hi>Generals</hi> from which the <hi>reſpective Patrons</hi> of either Doctrine would inferr their own concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though indeed they all of them with better right and congruity prove <hi>Praeex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(2.) I ſuppoſe thoſe that argue from <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-ſilence</hi> in ſuch caſes miſtake the deſign of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which is not to determine <hi>points</hi> of <hi>ſpeculation,</hi> but to be a <hi>rule</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Manners.</hi> Nor doth it otherwiſe deſign the teaching of <hi>Doctrinals,</hi> than as they have a tendency to promote the <hi>divine</hi> life, <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Holineſs.</hi> It was never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it's <hi>inſpired</hi> Authors to fill our <hi>Heads</hi> with <hi>notions,</hi> but to regulate our diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>appetites</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> and to <hi>direct</hi> us the <hi>way</hi> to a nobler <hi>happineſs.</hi> Therefore thoſe that look for a <hi>ſyſteme</hi> of <hi>opinions</hi> in thoſe otherways-deſigned writings, do like him that ſhould ſee for a body of natural Philoſophy, in <hi>Epictetus</hi> his <hi>morals,</hi> or <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca's Epiſtles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(3.) <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſpoke and writ as the condition of the perſons with whom they dealt adminiſtred occaſion, as as did alſo the other <hi>pen-men.</hi> Therefore doubtleſs there were many noble Theories which they could have made the world ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, which yet for want of a fit occaſion to draw them forth were never
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55102:44"/>
upon Record. And we know, ſew <hi>ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> truths are deliver'ed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> but ſuch as were called forth by the <hi>controverſies</hi> of thoſe <hi>times:</hi> And <hi>Praeexiſtence</hi> was none of them, it being the conſtant opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as appears by that Queſtion, <hi>Maſter, was it for this man's ſin or his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that he was born blind,</hi> which ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it of the <hi>Diſciples</hi> alſo. Wherefore</p>
                  <p>(4.) There was little need of more teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that, which thoſe times were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently inſtructed in: And indeed, as the caſe ſtands, if <hi>Scripture-ſilence</hi> be <hi>Argumentative,</hi> 'twil be for the advantage of <hi>Praeexiſtence;</hi> ſince it being the <hi>then common opinion,</hi> and the <hi>diſciples</hi> themſelves being of that belief, 'tis very likely, had it been an errour, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> or his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> would have wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt againſt it. But there being not a word let fall from them in diſapproval of that <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinon,</hi> though ſometimes occaſions were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred (as by the <hi>Queſtion</hi> of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and ſome other occurrences) 'tis a good preſumption of the ſoundneſs of it.</p>
                  <p>Now that <hi>Praeexiſtence</hi> was the common opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in thoſe times might be made good with full and convictive evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, were it worth our labour to inſiſt much upon this Inquiry; but this being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>by-conſideration,</hi> a brief touch of it will ſuffice us.

* Mr. <hi>Ben Iſrael</hi> in his <hi>Problems de Creatione,</hi> aſſures us, that <hi>Praeexiſtence</hi> was the <hi>common belief</hi> of all <hi>wiſe</hi> men among the <hi>Jews,</hi> without exception. And the <hi>Author</hi> of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> who certainly was a <hi>Jew,</hi> probably <hi>Philo,</hi> plainly ſuppoſeth the ſame Doctrine in that Speech, <hi>For I was a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Child, and had a good Spirit, wherefore the rather being good, I came into a body undefiled.</hi> As alſo did the Diſciples in their Foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Queſtion to our <hi>Saviour;</hi> For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they ſuppoſed, that he might have <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> before he was <hi>born,</hi> the Queſtion had been <hi>ſenſleſs</hi> and <hi>impertinent.</hi> Again, when Chriſt askt them, <hi>whom men ſaid he was</hi> they anſwered, that ſome ſaid <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> others <hi>Elias,</hi> others <hi>Jeremias</hi> or one of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> which ſayings of theirs ſuppoſe their belief of a <hi>Metempſychoſis</hi> and conſequently of <hi>Praeexiſtence.</hi> Theſe, one would think, were very proper occaſions for our <hi>Saviour</hi> to have rectified his <hi>miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> followers, had their <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> been an <hi>errour,</hi> as he was wont to do in caſes not more conſiderable. Therefore if the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Praeexiſtence</hi> will needs urge <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſuppoſed ſilence</hi> againſt it; they have no reaſon to take it amiſs if I ſhew them how their Argument recoyls upon themſelves, and deſtroy their <hi>own</hi> cauſe, inſtead of their <hi>Adverſaries.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>There was <hi>ſtrong meat</hi> for the more <hi>grown</hi> and <hi>manly</hi> Chriſtians, as well as <hi>milk</hi> for <hi>babes,</hi> and weaker <hi>Conſtitutions.</hi> Now <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> was deſigned for the benefit of the <hi>moſt,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> could little underſtand, and leſs make uſe of a <hi>ſpeculation</hi> ſo remote from <hi>common conceit,</hi> as <hi>Praeexiſtence.</hi> Among us, <hi>wiſe men</hi> count it not ſo proper to deal forth <hi>deep</hi> and <hi>myſterious points</hi> in <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to common and promiſcuous <hi>Auditories.</hi> Wherefore the Apoſtles and others of their more improv'd and capable <hi>diſciples</hi> might have had ſuch a <hi>Doctrine</hi> among them, though it were never expreſly defined in their <hi>publick writings.</hi> And the Learned <hi>Origen</hi> and ſome other of the <hi>Antients</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that <hi>Praeexiſtence</hi> was a <hi>Cabbala</hi> which was handed down from the <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> ages, to <hi>their times;</hi> and we know <hi>thoſe</hi> were <hi>early,</hi> and had therefore better advantages of knowing the certainty of ſuch a <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> than we at ſo vaſt a <hi>diſtance.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But (6) at once to remove this <hi>ſtone</hi> of <hi>offence</hi> out of the way, I think <hi>Scripture</hi> is not ſo <hi>ſilent</hi> in this matter as is imagin'd. And I'm confident, more can be ſaid from

thoſe <hi>divine</hi> writings in behalf of <hi>Praeexiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> than for many <hi>opinions,</hi> that it's op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers are very fond of, and think to be there evidently aſſerted.

For, as mens, <hi>phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> will readily furniſh them with a proof of that, of whoſe truth they are ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed; So, on the contrary, they'l be very backward to ſee any evidence of that which is ſtrange to them, and which hath alwaies been reputed an <hi>Abſurdity.</hi> But my <hi>Scripture-evidence</hi> is not ſo proper for this place, I intending to make it an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by it ſelf. Therefore if the urger of this <hi>objection,</hi> will but have a little patience till I come ſo far on the way of my <hi>diſcourſe,</hi> I hope he may be ſatisfied that <hi>Praeexiſtence</hi> is not ſuch a ſtranger to <hi>Scripture</hi> as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits it.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>NOw therefore to proceed, let us look back upon our progreſs, and ſo enter on what remains. We have ſeen, that God <hi>could have created</hi> all <hi>Souls at firſt had he ſo pleaſed,</hi> and <hi>that he hath revealed nothing in his written Will to the contrary.</hi> And now if it be found alſo, that he hath not made it known to our <hi>Reaſons</hi> that 'twas not his <hi>will</hi> to do <hi>ſo,</hi> we may conclude this firſt particular, <hi>That no one can ſay, that the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of Praeexiſtence is a falſhhood.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us call to Account the moſt momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55102:47"/>
reaſons that can be laid againſt it, and we ſhall find that they all have not <hi>weight</hi> enough in the leaſt to move ſo <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>ſolid</hi> an <hi>opinion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1.) Then, 'tis likely to be urged, that had we <hi>lived</hi> and acted in a former ſtate, * we ſhould doubtleſs have retain'd ſome <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> of that <hi>condition;</hi> But we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no <hi>memory</hi> of any thing backwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our appearance upon this <hi>preſent ſtage,</hi> it will be thought to be a conſiderable prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, that <hi>Praeexiſtence</hi> is but a <hi>phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I would deſire ſuch kind of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to tell me, how much they <hi>remember</hi> of their <hi>ſtate</hi> and condition in the <hi>womb,</hi> or of the <hi>Actions</hi> of their firſt <hi>infancy.</hi> And I could wiſh they would conſider, that not one paſſage in an hundred is <hi>remembred</hi> of their <hi>grown</hi> and <hi>riper</hi> age. Nor doth there ſcarce a <hi>night</hi> paſs but we <hi>dream</hi> of many things which our <hi>waking Memories</hi> can give us no Account of; yea, <hi>old age</hi> and ſome kinds of <hi>diſeaſes</hi> blot out all the <hi>images</hi> of things <hi>paſt,</hi> and even in this <hi>ſtate</hi> cauſe a <hi>total oblivion.</hi> * Now if the <hi>Reaſons</hi> why we ſhould loſe the <hi>remembrance</hi> of our former life be <hi>greater,</hi> than are the <hi>cauſes</hi> of <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs</hi> in the <hi>inſtances</hi> we have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, I think it will be clear, that this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument hath but little force againſt the <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:55102:47"/>
we are inquiring into. Therefore if we do but reflect upon that long ſtate of <hi>ſilence</hi> and <hi>inactivity</hi> that we emerged from, when we came into theſe bodies; and the <hi>vaſt change</hi> we under-went by our ſinking into this new and unwonted <hi>habitation,</hi> it will appear to the conſiderate, that there is greater reaſon why we ſhould have <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten</hi> our former <hi>Life,</hi> than any thing in <hi>this.</hi> And if a <hi>diſeaſe</hi> or <hi>old age</hi> can raſe out the <hi>memory</hi> of <hi>paſt actions,</hi> even while we are in one and the ſame <hi>condition</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſo <hi>long</hi> and <hi>deep</hi> a <hi>ſwoon</hi> as is abſolute <hi>inſenſibility</hi> and <hi>inertneſs,</hi> may much more reaſonably be thought to blot out the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</hi> of an <hi>other Life,</hi> whoſe paſſages pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably were nothing like the <hi>tranſactions</hi> of <hi>this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this alſo might be given as an other Reaſon of our forgetting our former <hi>ſtate,</hi> ſince uſually things are brought to our <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> by ſome <hi>like occurrences.</hi> But</p>
                  <p>(2.) Some will argue, If <hi>this</hi> be a ſtate of <hi>puniſhment</hi> for <hi>former</hi> miſcarriages, how comes it about then, that 'tis a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than that we laſt came from, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſtate of <hi>ſilence</hi> and <hi>inſenſibility?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That if we look upon our preſent <hi>terreſtrial</hi> condition as an effect of our <hi>defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> from the <hi>higher Life,</hi> and in reference to our former happineſs loſt by our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55102:48"/>
'tis then a <hi>miſery</hi> and a <hi>puniſhment.</hi> But if we compare our <hi>now-</hi>being with the ſtate of <hi>inactivity</hi> we were delivered from, it may then be called an <hi>After-Game of</hi> the <hi>divine Goodneſs,</hi> and a Mercy. As a <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,</hi> that is at firſt put into a dark and diſconſolate dungeon, and afterwards is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd to a more comfortable and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome priſon, may acknowledge his remove to be a <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>deliverance</hi> compared with the <hi>place</hi> he was laſt conſined to; though with reſpect to his <hi>fault</hi> and former <hi>liberty,</hi> even this condition is both a <hi>mulct</hi> and a <hi>miſery.</hi> It is juſt thus in the preſent ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e, and any one may make the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>But it will be ſaid, (3) If our <hi>Souls</hi> liv'd in a <hi>former ſtate,</hi> did they <hi>act</hi> in <hi>bodies,</hi> or without them? The former they'l ſay is abſurd, and the latter incongruous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely; ſince then all the <hi>powers</hi> the Soul hath to exert in a body, would have been <hi>idle</hi> and to no purpoſe. But (1) the moſt that can be argued from ſuch like <hi>objections,</hi> is, that we know not the <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>thing;</hi> and are no Arguments againſt the aſſertion it ſelf. And were it granted that the <hi>paticular ſtate</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> before it came hither is <hi>inconceivable,</hi> yet this makes no more againſt it, than it doth againſt it's <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-condition;</hi> which theſe very <hi>objectors</hi> hold
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55102:48"/>
to be ſo, as to the <hi>particular modus.</hi> But (2) Why is it ſo abſurd that the Soul ſhould have <hi>actuated</hi> another kind of <hi>body,</hi> before it came into <hi>this?</hi> Even <hi>here</hi> 'tis <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately</hi> united to a purer <hi>vehicle,</hi> moves and acts the groſſer body by it; And why then might it not in its former and <hi>purer ſtate</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> have been joyn'd only to ſuch a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined body,</hi> which ſhould have been ſuitable to its own <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>purity?</hi> I'me ſure, many, if not the moſt of the <hi>Antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> thought <hi>Angels</hi> themſelves to be <hi>embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died,</hi> and therefore they reputed not <hi>this</hi> ſuch a groſs abſurdity. But an occaſion hereafter will draw our pen this way again, and therefore I paſs it to a third return to this <hi>objection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(3.) Therefore, though it were granted that the <hi>Soul</hi> lived afore-times without a <hi>body,</hi> what greater <hi>incongruity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> is there in ſuch a <hi>ſuppoſition,</hi> than that it ſhould <hi>live</hi> and <hi>act</hi> after <hi>death</hi> without any union with <hi>matter</hi> or any <hi>body</hi> whatſoever, as the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors</hi> themſelves conceive it doth? But all ſuch objections as theſe will fly away as miſts before the Sun, when we ſhall come particularly to ſtate the <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> And therefore I may be excuſed from further troubling my ſelf and the Reader about them here. Eſpecially ſince, as hath been inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, they prove nothing at all, but that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55102:49"/>
the objectors cannot conceive what manner of ſtate that of <hi>Praeexiſtence</hi> was, which is no prejudice to the opinion it ſelf; that <hi>our Souls were extant before theſe earthly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus then I hope I have clearly enough made good <hi>that all Souls might have been Created from the beginning;</hi> for ought any thing that is made known, either in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> or our <hi>reaſons</hi> to the contrary. * And thereby have removed thoſe <hi>prejudices</hi> that Would have ſtood in the way of our <hi>concluſion.</hi> Wherefore we may now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controul, from our proof of, <hi>That it may be ſo;</hi> paſs on to enquire, whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>it is ſo;</hi> and ſee, whether it may as well be <hi>aſserted,</hi> as <hi>defended.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And truly conſidering that both the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ways are <hi>impoſſible,</hi> and this <hi>third</hi> not at all <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> it may be thought need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to bring more forces into the field to gain it the victory, after its enemies are quite ſcattered and defeated. Yet however, for the <hi>pomp</hi> and <hi>triumph</hi> of truth, though it need not their ſervice, we ſhall add ſome <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive</hi> Arguments, whereby it may appear, that not only all other ways are <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>unpaſſable,</hi> and <hi>this irreproveable;</hi> but alſo that there is <hi>direct</hi> evidence enough to prove it <hi>ſolid</hi> and <hi>rational.</hi> And I make my firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this kind, a <hi>ſecond Argument.</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>This firſt <hi>Evaſion,</hi> that God acts <hi>freely,</hi> and his <hi>meer will</hi> is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon enough for his doing, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing any thing, overthrown by four Conſiderations. Some incident Evaſions, <hi>viz.</hi> that Gods <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> or his <hi>glory,</hi> may be contrary to this diſplay of the divine <hi>goodneſs,</hi> in our being made of old, clearly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">(1.) THerefore, will ſome ſay, God worketh <hi>freely,</hi> nor can he be <hi>obliged</hi> to <hi>act</hi> but when he <hi>pleaſeth.</hi> And this <hi>will</hi> and <hi>pleaſure</hi> of his is the reaſon of our <hi>beings,</hi> and of the <hi>determinate</hi> time of our <hi>beginning.</hi> Therefore if <hi>God</hi> would not that we ſhould have been made <hi>ſooner,</hi> and in a <hi>better</hi> ſtate of life, his <hi>will</hi> is <hi>reaſon</hi> enough, and we need look no further. To this evaſion, I thus Reply.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) 'Tis true indeed, <hi>God</hi> is the moſt <hi>Free Agent,</hi> becauſe none can <hi>compel</hi>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:55102:52"/>
him to <hi>act,</hi> none can <hi>hinder</hi> him from <hi>acting.</hi> Nor can his Creatures oblige him to any thing. But then</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) The <hi>divine liberty</hi> and <hi>freedom</hi> conſiſts not in his acting by meer <hi>arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous will,</hi> as disjunct from his other <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.</hi> For he is ſaid to <hi>act</hi> according to the <hi>Counſel</hi> of his own <hi>will.</hi> So that his <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> are as it were the <hi>Rules</hi> whereby his <hi>will</hi> is directed. Therefore though he cannot be <hi>obliged</hi> to act by any thing <hi>without himſelf,</hi> yet he may be the <hi>Laws</hi> of his own <hi>eſſential rectitude</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> Wherefore I conceive he is ſaid, <hi>not to be able to do</hi> thoſe things (which he might well enough by <hi>abſolute power)</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt not with his <hi>ever bleſſed Attributes.</hi> Nor by the ſame reaſon can he <hi>omit</hi> that which the <hi>eternal Law</hi> of his moſt perſect nature <hi>obligeth</hi> him to. The ſumm is, * <hi>God</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>acts</hi> by <hi>meer will</hi> or <hi>groundleſs humour, that</hi> is a <hi>weakneſs</hi> in his <hi>imperſect</hi> Creatures; but according to the <hi>immutable Rules</hi> of his ever bleſſed <hi>eſſence.</hi> And therefore,</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) 'Tis a derogation from his <hi>infinite Majeſty</hi> to aſſert any thing contrary to his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> upon pretence of his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>pleaſure.</hi> For whatever is moſt ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this moſt bleſſed <hi>Attribute,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts no other, <hi>that</hi> be ſure he <hi>willeth.</hi> Wherefore</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:55102:52"/>
(4) If it be <hi>better,</hi> and more <hi>agreeable</hi> to the <hi>divine goodneſs</hi> that we ſhould have been in an <hi>happier</hi> ſtate, before we came into theſe <hi>bodies, Gods will</hi> cannot then be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the contrary, (eſpecially it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been proved already, that he hath no way <hi>revealed</hi> any ſuch <hi>will</hi> of his) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is demonſtratively clear that his <hi>will</hi> was, <hi>it ſhould be ſo.</hi> Since as God never acts in the abſence of his <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> ſo neither doth he abſtain from acting when thoſe great <hi>Attributes</hi> require it.</p>
                  <p>Now if it be excepted again (2) That 'tis tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e that this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> is moſt ſutable to the <hi>divine goodneſs,</hi> and the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that alone would inferr it: But how know we but his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> contradicts it? I return briefly, That if it be confeſt to be ſo correſpondent to, and inferrible from one <hi>Attribute,</hi> and cannot be prov'd <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent</hi> with another, my buſineſs is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. Therefore let thoſe that pretend an inconſiſtence, prove it. (2) The <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of God is that Attribute and <hi>eſſential perfection,</hi> whereby the <hi>divine</hi> actions are <hi>directed</hi> to their <hi>end,</hi> which is always <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>beſt:</hi> Therefore to do that which is <hi>beſt,</hi> cannot thwart the <hi>divine wiſdom,</hi> but always includes and ſuppoſeth it: Whence it follows, that what <hi>ſo</hi> comports with <hi>goodneſs,</hi> cannot ſtand oppoſite to <hi>Wiſdom.</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:55102:53"/>
Wiſdom in <hi>God</hi> being indeed nothing elſe but <hi>goodneſs,</hi> contriving and directing for the Creature's <hi>good</hi> and happineſs. For we muſt remember, what was ſaid above, that <hi>what is infinitely full and perfect, can have no ends for any ſelf-advantage;</hi> and therefore the <hi>ends</hi> of the <hi>divine wiſdom</hi> are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>without himſelf,</hi> and conſequently <hi>the good and perfection</hi> of his <hi>Creatures.</hi> So that unleſs it can be proved to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>ours,</hi> or any other Creatures <hi>good,</hi> that we ſhould have been extant as ſoon as the <hi>Light,</hi> it cannot be concluded to have any <hi>contradiction</hi> to the <hi>divine wiſdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it will be ſaid again, (3) <hi>Gods glory</hi> is his great end, for the promoting of which his wiſdom <hi>directs</hi> all his Actions; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that which may be <hi>beſt</hi> for the <hi>Creature,</hi> may not be ſo conducive to the <hi>divine Glory,</hi> and therefore not agreeable with his <hi>wiſdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, though I think the world hath a very miſtaken apprehenſion of <hi>Gods glory,</hi> yet I ſhall not here ingage in more contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, than I muſt needs. 'Tis enough for my preſent purpoſe to intimate; That <hi>Gods glory</hi> is no <hi>by-end</hi> or <hi>ſelf-accumulation,</hi> nor an <hi>addition</hi> of anything to Him which he was not eternally poſſeſt of; nor yet is it any thing that ſtands in oppoſition to the <hi>good</hi> of his <hi>Creation;</hi> But the <hi>diſplay</hi> and <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55102:53"/>
of his excellencies;</hi> among the which, his <hi>goodneſs</hi> is not the leaſt conſiderable, if it be not that moſt <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>fundamental At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute</hi> which <hi>gives perfection to all the reſt.</hi> So that we may aſſure our ſelves, that when ever his <hi>goodneſs</hi> obligeth him to acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his <hi>glory</hi> never ſtands in <hi>oppoſition.</hi> For even this is his <hi>glory,</hi> to <hi>communicate</hi> to his creatures ſutably to his own <hi>abſolute fulneſs,</hi> and to act according to the direction of his <hi>eſſential perfections;</hi> yea, though we ſhould ſtate his <hi>glory</hi> to conſiſt alone, in the <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>renown</hi> of his Attributes, yet even then the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of our having been made in the <hi>beginning</hi> will accumulate to his <hi>praiſes,</hi> and repreſent him to his creatures as more <hi>illuſtrious;</hi> ſince it is a more <hi>magnificent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion</hi> of his <hi>goodneſs,</hi> and clears his other <hi>Attributes</hi> from thoſe ſtains of diſ-repute that all other ſuppoſitions caſt upon them. And though his <hi>glory</hi> ſhould conſiſt, as too many fondly imagine, in being <hi>praiſed</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by his <hi>creatures,</hi> even on this account alſo it would have obliged him to have <hi>made us all of old,</hi> rather than oppoſed it; ſince, then, his excellencies had been ſung forth by a more numerous <hi>Quire,</hi> in continual <hi>Hallelujahs.</hi> Now if it ſhould be urged, * that <hi>God made all things for himſelf,</hi> and therefore is not obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the <hi>good</hi> of his creatures in all his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55102:54"/>
I rejoyn, that <hi>God's making all things for himſelf,</hi> can argue no more than his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all things for his own <hi>ends, viz.</hi> the <hi>ends</hi> of <hi>goodneſs.</hi> Beſides, the beſt <hi>Criticks</hi> make that place to ſpeak no more but this, That <hi>God orders</hi> all things <hi>according</hi> to <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> that is, according to the rules of his own <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>perfections.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus then, we ſee that for <hi>God</hi> to do that which is <hi>beſt</hi> for his Creatures, is neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>pleaſure,</hi> his <hi>wiſdom,</hi> nor his <hi>glory,</hi> but moſt conſonant to all of them. And therefore ſince the <hi>Praeexiſtence</hi> of <hi>Souls,</hi> is ſo agreeable to the divine <hi>goodneſs,</hi> and ſince nothing elſe in the <hi>Deity</hi> oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but rather ſweetly conſpires with it, methinks this argument were enough to conclude it. But yet there are other <hi>Evaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> which would elude this <hi>Demonſtration;</hi> I ſhall name the moſt conſiderable and leave it to the judicious to determine, whether they can diſable it.</p>

                     <p>A ſecond general <hi>Evaſion, viz.</hi> that our Reaſons cannot tell what God ſhould do, or what is <hi>beſt,</hi> overthrown by ſeveral conſiderations.

                  </argument>
                  <p>WHerefore the <hi>ſecond</hi> general evaſion is, That our <hi>Reaſons</hi> cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude what God <hi>ſhould do,</hi> there being vaſt fetches in the <hi>divine wiſdom</hi> which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend not, nor can our <hi>natural light</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what is beſt. I anſwer (1) Our Saviour himſelf, who was the beſt Judge in the caſe, teacheth us, that the Reaſon of a man may in ſome things conclude what <hi>God will do,</hi> in that ſaying of his, <hi>If ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil, know how to give good things to your Children, much more ſhall your Father which is in Heaven give his Spirit to them that ask him:</hi> Plainly intimating, that we may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55102:55"/>
argue from any thing that is a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> in our ſelves, to the ſame in <hi>God.</hi> And if we, who are <hi>imperfectly good,</hi> will yet do as much <hi>good</hi> as we can, for thoſe we <hi>love</hi> and <hi>tender;</hi> with greater confidence may we conclude, that <hi>God,</hi> who is <hi>infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo,</hi> will confer upon his <hi>creatures</hi> whatever <hi>good</hi> they are capable of. Thus we ſee our <hi>Saviour</hi> owns the capacity of <hi>reaſon</hi> in a caſe that is very near the ſame that we are dealing in.</p>
                  <p>And God himſelf appeals to the <hi>reaſons</hi> of men to judge of the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>equity</hi> of his ways. <hi>Ye men of</hi> Iſrael <hi>and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>judge between me and my vineyard;</hi> which place I bring to ſhew that meer natural <hi>reaſon</hi> is able to judge in ſome caſes <hi>what is fit for God to do,</hi> and what is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his <hi>eſſence</hi> and <hi>perfections.</hi> And if in <hi>any,</hi>

                  <p>Methinks (2) its <hi>capacity</hi> in the caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us ſhould be own'd as ſoon as in any.

                  <p>I ſay then, and it may ſerve for a (3) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the <hi>general objection:</hi> If we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that to be done by <hi>almighty goodneſs,</hi> which is undoubtedly <hi>beſt</hi> for a whole <hi>ſpecies</hi> of his creatures, meerly on this account, that, for ought we know, it may be for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of ſome others, though there be not the leaſt appearance of any ſuch matter; we can never then argue any thing from the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs.</hi> It can never then be prov'd from that <hi>glorious Attribute,</hi> that he hath not made ſome of his creatures <hi>on purpoſe</hi> that they might be <hi>miſerable;</hi> nor can it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded thence, that he will not <hi>annihilate</hi> all the <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>ſpotleſs</hi> Angels; both which I ſuppoſe, any ſober inquirer will think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruouſly deducible from the <hi>divine goodneſs.</hi> And if to ſay, <hi>for ought we know,</hi> It may be <hi>beſt</hi> for ſome other creatures, that thoſe ſhould be <hi>miſerable,</hi> and theſe <hi>annihilated,</hi> be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to diſable the Argument; on the ſame account we ſhall never be able to prove ought from <hi>this,</hi> or any other <hi>Attribute.</hi> I might add,</p>
                  <p>(2) There is not the leaſt colourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for any ſuch ſuſpicion. For, would the <hi>world</hi> have been too little to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd thoſe <hi>ſouls,</hi> without juſtling with ſome others? or, would they by violence have taken any of the priviledges of the other
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55102:56"/>
intellectual Creatures from them? If ſo, how comes it about that at laſt they can all ſo well conſiſt together? And, could o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures have been more diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tag'd by them, when they were <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,</hi> than they will at laſt, when they are ſo many of them <hi>debauched</hi> and <hi>depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(3) If this be enough to anſwer an <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to ſay, <hi>for ought we know, it may be thus and thus,</hi> when there is not the leaſt ſign or appearance of any ſuch thing, then <hi>nothing</hi> can ever be <hi>proved,</hi> and we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to <hi>everlaſting Scepticiſm.</hi> We ſhould never, for inſtance, from the <hi>order, beauty,</hi> and <hi>wiſe contrivance</hi> of the things that do appear, prove there is a <hi>God,</hi> if it were ſufficient to anſwer, That things are indeed ſo made in this <hi>earth,</hi> on which we are extant; but, it may be, they are framed very <hi>odly, ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly,</hi> and <hi>ineptly</hi> in ſome other <hi>worlds,</hi> which we know nothing of. If this be <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering,</hi> any thing might be <hi>anſwered.</hi> But there is yet another <hi>objection</hi> againſt mine <hi>Argument</hi> from the Divine <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> which looks very formidably at a diſtance, though when we come near it, we ſhall find, it will not bear the tryal. And it may thus be urged.</p>
                  <p>(3) If the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God always obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth him to do what is <hi>beſt,</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi> for
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55102:57"/>
his <hi>Creatures,</hi> How is it then, that we were not made <hi>impeccable,</hi> and ſo not <hi>obnoxious</hi> to <hi>miſery?</hi> Or how doth it conſiſt with that overflowing <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> that we were let to lie in a long ſtate of <hi>ſilence</hi> and <hi>inſenſibility,</hi> before we came into theſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies? This ſeems a preſſing difficulty, but yet there's hopes we may diſpatch it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
                  <p>(1) Had we been made <hi>impeccable,</hi> we ſhould have been another kind of Creatures than now; ſince we had then wanted the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>(4) Had we been ſo <hi>ſixt</hi> in an <hi>inamiſſible happineſs</hi> from the <hi>beginning,</hi> there had then been no <hi>vertue</hi> in the world; nor any of that matchleſs <hi>pleaſure</hi> which attends the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thereof.

                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore in ſum (5ly), The <hi>divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is manifeſted in making all Creatures ſutably to thoſe <hi>Idea's</hi> of their natures, which he hath in his <hi>All-comprehenſive Wiſdom.</hi> And their <hi>good</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> conſiſts in <hi>acting</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe <hi>natures,</hi> and in being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht with all things neceſſary for ſuch <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Now the <hi>divine Wiſdom</hi> is no <hi>arbitrary thing,</hi> that can change, or alter thoſe ſetled <hi>immutable Idea's</hi> of things that are there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented.

all things, aſſigns each <hi>Being</hi> its proper <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and <hi>qualities.</hi> And the <hi>Divine goodneſs,</hi> according to the <hi>wiſe</hi> direction of the <hi>eternal Intellect,</hi> in like diſtinct and orderly manner produceth all things: <hi>viz.</hi> according to all the variety of their reſpective <hi>Idea's</hi> in the <hi>divine</hi> wiſdom. * Wherefore as the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of God obligeth him not to make every <hi>Planet</hi> a <hi>fixt Star,</hi> or every <hi>Star</hi> a <hi>Sun;</hi> So neither doth it oblige him to make every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Life,</hi> a rational <hi>Soul,</hi> or every <hi>Soul,</hi> an impeccable <hi>Angel.</hi> * For this were to tye him to <hi>contradictions.</hi> Since therefore, ſuch an order of <hi>Beings,</hi> as <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,</hi> though <hi>free,</hi> and therefore <hi>mutable</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, were diſtinctly comprehended in the <hi>Divine Wiſdom;</hi> It was an effect of God's <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> to bring them into being, even in ſuch a condition, and in ſuch manner, as in their <hi>eternal Idea's</hi> they were repreſented.</p>
                  <p>Thus then we ſee, it is not contrary to the infinite <hi>plenitude</hi> of the <hi>Divine Goodneſs</hi> * that we ſhould have been made <hi>peccable</hi> and lyable to <hi>defection.</hi> And being thus in our very eſſential conſtitutions <hi>lapſible;</hi> 'twas no defect in the goodneſs of our Maker that he did not interpoſe by his abſolute <hi>omnipotence</hi> to prevent our actual <hi>praevarication</hi> and <hi>apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</hi> Since his goodneſs obligeth him not to ſecure us upon any terms whatever, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch, as may moſt promote the general

                     <hi>good</hi> and advantage. And queſtionleſs, 'twas much better that ſuch, as would <hi>wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> depart from the laws of their bleſſed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and break through all reſtraints of the divine commands, ſhould feel the ſmart of their <hi>diſobedience;</hi> than that <hi>providence</hi> ſhould diſorder the conſtitution of nature to prevent the puniſhment, which they drew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves: Since thoſe <hi>apoſtate</hi> ſpirits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main inſtances to thoſe that ſtand, of the <hi>divine juſtice,</hi> and <hi>ſeverity</hi> againſt <hi>ſinners,</hi> and ſo may contribute not a little to their <hi>ſecurity.</hi> And for that long <hi>night</hi> of <hi>ſilence,</hi> in which multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes ofſouls are buried before they deſcend into <hi>terreſtrial matter,</hi> it is but the due reward of their former diſobedience; for which, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the <hi>happy circumſtances</hi> in which they were made, they deſerv'd to be nothing for ever.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus then we ſee, That Gods making us <hi>lapſible</hi> and permitting us to <hi>fall,</hi> is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice in the leaſt to the infinite fecundity of his <hi>goodneſs,</hi> and his making all things <hi>beſt.</hi> So that mine Argument for <hi>Praeexiſtence</hi> bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd on this Foundation, ſtands yet firm and immoveable, notwithſtanding the rude aſſault of this <hi>objection.</hi> From which I paſs to a <hi>fourth.</hi>

                  <p>(1) Every one that believes the <hi>infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of Gods <hi>goodneſs</hi> is as much obliged to anſwer this <hi>objection,</hi> as I am.

'tis ſuppoſed to do, and by conſequence now is not <hi>infinite.</hi> And to affirm that goodneſs is <hi>infinite,</hi> where what it doth and intends to do is but <hi>finite,</hi> will be ſaid to be a <hi>contradiction,</hi> ſince <hi>goodneſs</hi> is a <hi>relative</hi> term, and in God always reſpects ſomewhat <hi>ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra.</hi> For he cannot be ſaid to be <hi>good</hi> to himſelf, he being a nature that can receive no <hi>additional perfection.</hi> Wherefore this <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> makes no more againſt mine <hi>Argument,</hi> than it doth againſt the <hi>Infinity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Goodneſs,</hi> and therefore I am no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

trouble and Anxiety. For ſearching and contemplative Heads cannot be ſatisfied to be told, That our <hi>ſouls have lived and acted in a former condition,</hi> except they can be helpt to ſome more <hi>particular</hi> apprehenſion of that <hi>State;</hi> How we lived and acted of <hi>old,</hi> and how probably we <hi>fell</hi> from that <hi>better life,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Region of miſery and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Now though indeed my Charity would prompt me to do what I can for the relief and eaſe of any modeſt Inquirer; yet ſhall I not attempt to ſatisfie punctual and eager <hi>curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> in things <hi>hidden</hi> and <hi>unſearchable.</hi> Much leſs ſhall I poſitively determine any thing in matters ſo lubricous and uncertain.

There are doubtleſs infinite

ways and methods according to which the unſearchable wiſdom of our Maker could have diſpoſed of us, which we can have no conceit of; And we are little more capable of unerringly reſolving our ſelves now, how it was with us of old, than a Child in the womb is to determine, what kind of life it ſhall live when it is ſet at liberty from that <hi>dark incloſure.</hi> Therefore let ſhame and bluſhing cover his face that ſhall confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm that 'twas <hi>thus</hi> or <hi>thus</hi> with us in the <hi>ſtate</hi> of our <hi>Fore-Beings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, to ſhew that it may have been that our <hi>Souls</hi> did <hi>Praeexiſt,</hi> though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not punctually and certainly conclude upon the <hi>Particular State,</hi> I ſhall preſume to draw up a conceivable <hi>Scheme</hi> of the <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> And if our narrow minds can think of a way how it might have been, I hope no body will deny that the <hi>divine wiſdom</hi> could have contriv'd it ſo, or infinitely better than we can imagin in our little models.</p>
                  <p>And now I would not have it thought that I go about to inſinuate or repreſent any opinions of my own, or that I am a votary to all the notions I make uſe of, whether of the <hi>Antient,</hi> or more modern <hi>Philoſophers.</hi> For I ſeriouſly profeſs againſt all determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in this kind.

his other <hi>perfections</hi> are not, but far beyond our narrow conception, we may well call it <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>infinite benignity.</hi> This is the <hi>original</hi> and <hi>root</hi> of all things, ſo that this bleſſed, ever bleſſed <hi>Attribute</hi> being the <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Fountain</hi> of all the <hi>Actions</hi> of the Deity, his deſigns can be no other but the <hi>contrivances</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> for the compaſſing the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of the <hi>univerſe.</hi> Therefore to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God to <hi>act</hi> or <hi>deſign</hi> any thing that is not for the good of his Creatures, is either to phancy him to <hi>act</hi> for no <hi>end</hi> at all, or for an <hi>end</hi> that is contrary to his <hi>benign Nature.</hi> Finally therefore, the very <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>infinite fulneſs</hi> is to be <hi>communicating</hi> and <hi>overflowing;</hi> And the moſt congruous apprehenſion that we can entertain of the <hi>Infinite</hi> and <hi>eternal Deity,</hi> is * to conceive him as an <hi>immenſe</hi> and all <hi>glorious Sun,</hi> that is continually <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating</hi> and ſending abroad its <hi>beams</hi> and <hi>bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> which conception of our Maker, if 'twere deeply imprinted on us, would I am confident ſet our apprehenſions right in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Theories,</hi> and chaſe away thoſe <hi>black</hi> and <hi>diſmal</hi> notions which too many have given harbour to.

                     <p>Briefly then, and if it may be more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>higher faculties</hi> are thoſe, where by the <hi>Soul</hi> acts towards <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>immaterial</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: and the <hi>lower</hi> whereby it acts towards the <hi>Body.</hi> Now it cannot with equal <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour</hi> exerciſe it ſelf both ways together; and conſequently the more it is taken up in the <hi>higher operations,</hi> the more prompt and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous it will be in <hi>theſe exerciſes,</hi> and leſs <hi>ſo</hi> about <hi>thoſe</hi> that concern the <hi>body, &amp; è Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus when we are very deeply ingaged in <hi>intellectual contemplations,</hi> our outward <hi>ſenſes</hi> are in a manner <hi>ſhrunk</hi> up and <hi>cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped:</hi> And when our <hi>ſenſes</hi> are highly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55102:80"/>
and gratified, thoſe operations <hi>mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polize</hi> and <hi>imploy</hi> us. Nor is this leſs obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in relation to the <hi>Plaſtick.</hi> For fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and ſevere <hi>Meditations</hi> do much <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi> and <hi>weaken</hi> the <hi>body;</hi> And we are moſt <hi>nouriſht</hi> in our <hi>ſleep</hi> in the <hi>ſilence</hi> of our <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> Now what is thus true in reſpect of <hi>acts</hi> and <hi>particular exerciſes,</hi> is as much <hi>ſo</hi> in <hi>ſtates</hi> and <hi>habits.</hi> Moreover, 'tis apparent that the <hi>Plaſtick</hi> is then moſt ſtrong and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous when our other faculties are wholly unimployed, from the <hi>ſtate</hi> of the <hi>womb.</hi> For <hi>nature</hi> when ſhe is at her <hi>Plaſtick</hi> work, ceaſeth all other operations. The ſame we may take notice of, in <hi>Silk-worms</hi> and other <hi>Inſects,</hi> which lie as if they were <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>inſenſible,</hi> while their <hi>lower powers</hi> are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them into another <hi>appearance.</hi> All which things put together, give good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the truth of our Axiom.</p>
                     <p>I'le conclude this with one Remark more, to prevent miſtake; Therefore briefly; As the <hi>Soul</hi> always acts by the <hi>Body;</hi> ſo in its higheſt <hi>exerciſes</hi> it uſeth ſome of the <hi>inferiour powers;</hi> which, therefore muſt operate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. So that ſome <hi>ſenſes,</hi> as <hi>ſight</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <hi>analagous</hi> to <hi>hearing</hi> may be imployed in conſiderable degree, even when the <hi>higheſt life</hi> is moſt <hi>predominant;</hi> but then it is at the command and in the ſervices of thoſe <hi>nobler powers;</hi> wherefore the <hi>ſenſitive life</hi>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:55102:80"/>
cannot for this cauſe be ſaid to be <hi>invigora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> ſince 'tis under <hi>ſervitude</hi> and <hi>ſubjection,</hi> and its <hi>guſts</hi> and <hi>pleaſures</hi> are very <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>flaccid.</hi> And this is the reaſon of that clauſe in the <hi>Principle (as to their proper exerciſes.)</hi>
                     </p>

and <hi>lower powers,</hi> or the <hi>life of the body,</hi> were <hi>languid</hi> and <hi>remiſs.</hi>
                  </p>

Thus then did we at firſt live and act in a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>aethereal</hi> body; and conſequently in a place of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>bleſſedneſs,</hi> by <hi>Principle</hi> 3d. But particularly to deſcribe and point at this <hi>paradiſaical reſidence,</hi> can be done on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by thoſe that live in thoſe <hi>ſerene</hi> regions of <hi>lightſome</hi> glory: Some <hi>Philoſophers</hi> indeed have adventured * to pronounce the <hi>place</hi> to be the <hi>Sun,</hi> that vaſt <hi>Orb</hi> of <hi>ſplendor</hi> and <hi>brightneſs;</hi> though it may be 'tis more probable, that thoſe <hi>immenſe</hi> tracts of <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>quiet aether</hi> that are above <hi>Saturn,</hi> are the joyous place of our ancient <hi>celeſtial</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode:
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55102:81"/>
But there is no determination in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſuch lubricous uncertainty, where ever it is, 'tis doubtleſs a place and ſtate of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful <hi>bliſs</hi> and <hi>happineſs,</hi> and the <hi>higheſt</hi> that our natures had fitted us to.</p>
                  <p>In this <hi>ſtate</hi> we may be ſuppoſed to have lived in the bliſsful exerciſe of <hi>vertue, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love</hi> and <hi>contemplation,</hi> through very long tracts of <hi>duration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though we were thus <hi>unconceivably happy,</hi> * yet were we not <hi>immutably ſo;</hi> for our higheſt perfections and nobleſt faculties being but <hi>finite,</hi> may after long and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous exerciſe, ſomewhat abate and remit in their ſublimeſt operations, and <hi>Adam</hi> may fall <hi>aſleep;</hi> In which time of <hi>remiſſion</hi> of the <hi>higher powers,</hi> the <hi>lower</hi> may advance and more livelily diſplay themſelves than they could before, by <hi>Axiom</hi> 7; for the <hi>ſoul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little ſlackt in its purſuits of <hi>immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> objects, the <hi>lower powers</hi> which before were almoſt wholly taken up and imployed in thoſe high ſervices, are ſomewhat more releaſt to follow a little the <hi>tendencies</hi> of their proper natures. And now they begin to convert towards the <hi>body,</hi> and warmly to reſent the delights and pleaſures thereof; Thus is <hi>Eve</hi> brought forth, while <hi>Adam</hi> ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. The <hi>lower life,</hi> that of the body is now conſiderably <hi>awakened,</hi> and the <hi>operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the <hi>higher,</hi> proportionably abated.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55102:82"/>
However, there is yet no <hi>anomy</hi> or <hi>diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> for all this is but an innocent exerciſe of thoſe faculties which God hath given us to <hi>imploy,</hi> and as far as is conſiſtent with the <hi>divine laws</hi> to <hi>gratifie.</hi> For it was no fault of ours that we did not unceſſantly keep our <hi>ſpiritual powers</hi> upon the moſt <hi>intenſe</hi> exerciſes that they were capable of exerting; * we were made on ſet purpoſe <hi>defatigable,</hi> that ſo all <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>life</hi> might have their exerciſe; and our <hi>Maker</hi> deſigned that we ſhould feel and taſte the joys of our <hi>conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> bodies, as well as the pleaſures of thoſe <hi>ſeraphick aſpires</hi> and injoyments.</p>
                  <p>And me thinks it adds to the <hi>felicity</hi> of that <hi>ſtate,</hi> that our happineſs was not one <hi>uniform</hi> piece, or continual <hi>repetition</hi> of the ſame, but conſiſted in a moſt <hi>grateful variety, viz.</hi> in the pleaſure of all our faculties, the <hi>lower</hi> as well as the <hi>higher;</hi> for thoſe are as much gratified by ſuitable exerciſes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments as <hi>theſe;</hi> and conſequently accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their <hi>proportion</hi> capable of as great an <hi>happineſs:</hi> Nor is it any more derogation from the <hi>divine goodneſs,</hi> that the <hi>nobleſt</hi> and <hi>higheſt life</hi> was not always exerciſed to the height of its capacity, than that we were not made all <hi>Angels,</hi> all the <hi>Planets</hi> ſo many <hi>Suns</hi> and all the <hi>variety</hi> of the Creatures formed into one <hi>Species:</hi> Yea, as was intimated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove; 'tis an inſtance of the <hi>divine benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore God himſelf having ſo order'd the matter, that the inferiour life ſhould have its turn of <hi>invigoration;</hi> it can be no evil in us, * that that is executed which he hath ſo determined, as long as we paſs not the bounds that he hath ſet us. <hi>Adam</hi> therefore was yet innocent, though he joyed in his beloved <hi>Spouſe,</hi> yea, and was permitted to feed upon all the fruits of this Paradiſe, the various reſults of corporeal pleaſure, as long as he followed not his own <hi>will</hi> and <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites</hi> contrarily to the <hi>divine commands</hi> and <hi>appointments.</hi>

                     <p>When our ſouls go out of theſe bodies therefore, they are not preſently diſcharged of all the matter that belonged to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but carry away their <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>aereal</hi> ſtate to be partakers with them of their <hi>after fortunes;</hi> only leaving the uſeleſs earth behind them.

                     <p>And in order to this diſcovery I muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſomewhat concerning the <hi>Earth,</hi> this
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55102:88"/>
                        <hi>Globe</hi> we live upon; which is, that we are not to conceive it to be a full <hi>bulky maſs</hi> to the <hi>center,</hi> but rather that 'tis ſomewhat like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a ſuckt Egg, in great part, an hollow ſphere, ſo that what we tread upon, is but as it were, an Arch or Bridge, to divide between the <hi>upper</hi> and the <hi>lower regions:</hi> Not that this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>inward hollowneſs</hi> is a meer void <hi>capacity,</hi> for there are no ſuch <hi>chaſms</hi> in nature, but doubtleſs repleniſht it is with ſome fluid bodies or other, and it may be a kind of <hi>air, fire</hi> and <hi>water:</hi> Now this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> will help us eaſily to imagin how the <hi>earth</hi> may <hi>move,</hi> notwithſtanding the pretended indiſpoſition of its Bulk, and on that account I believe it will be ſomewhat the more acceptable with the free and ingenious.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that underſtand the <hi>Carteſian Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,</hi> will readily admit the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> at leaſt as much of it as I ſhall have need of: But for others, I have little hopes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them to any thing, and therefore I'le ſpare my labour of going about to prove what they are either uncapable of, or at firſt daſh judge ridiculous: And it may be <hi>moſt</hi> will grant as much as is requiſite for my purpoſe, which is, <hi>That there are huge vaſt cavities within the body of the Earth;</hi> and it were as needleſs, as preſumptuous, for me to go about to determinemore. Only I ſhall mention a <hi>probability,</hi> that this <hi>groſs
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55102:89"/>
cruſt</hi> which we call <hi>earth,</hi> is not of ſo vaſt a <hi>profundity</hi> as is ſuppoſed, and ſo come more preſs to my buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>'Tis an ordinary obſervation among them that are imployed in <hi>Mines</hi> and <hi>ſubterraneous vaults</hi> of any depth, that <hi>heavy</hi> bodies loſe much of their <hi>gravity</hi> in thoſe hollow <hi>caverns:</hi> So that what the ſtrength of ſeveral men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtir above ground, is eaſily moved by the ſingle force of one under it: Now to improve this experiment, 'tis very likely that <hi>gravity</hi> proceeds from a kind of <hi>magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> and <hi>attractive</hi> vertue in the <hi>earth,</hi> which is by ſo much the more ſtrong and vigorous, by how much more of the <hi>attrahent</hi> contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the <hi>action,</hi> and proportionably <hi>weaker,</hi> where leſs of the <hi>magnetick</hi> Element exerts its <hi>operation;</hi> ſo that ſuppoſing the <hi>ſolid earth,</hi> to reach but to a certain, and that not very great diſtance from the ſurface, and 'tis obvious this way to give an account of the <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>* For according to this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> the <hi>gravity</hi> of thoſe bodies is <hi>leſs,</hi> becauſe the <hi>quantity</hi> of the <hi>earth</hi> that draws them is <hi>ſo;</hi> whereas were it of the ſame nature and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity to the <hi>center,</hi> this diminution of its <hi>bulk,</hi> and conſequently <hi>vertue</hi> would not be at all conſiderable, nor in the leaſt ſenſible: Now though there are other cauſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for this effect, yet there is none ſo
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55102:89"/>
likely, and eaſie a ſolution as this, though I know <hi>it</hi> alſo is obnoxious to exceptions, which I cannot now <hi>ſtand</hi> to meddle with; all that I would have, is, that 'tis a <hi>probability,</hi> * and the mention of the <hi>fountains</hi> of the <hi>great deep</hi> in the <hi>ſacred Hiſtory,</hi> as alſo the <hi>flaming Vulcano's</hi> and <hi>ſmoaking mountains</hi> that all relations ſpeak of, are others.</p>
                     <p>* Now I intend not that after a certain diſtance all is <hi>fluid matter</hi> to the <hi>center.</hi> For the <hi>Carteſian Hypotheſis</hi> diſtributes the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean</hi> ſpace into diſtinct regions of <hi>divers matter,</hi> which are divided from each other by as <hi>ſolid walls,</hi> as is the open air from the <hi>inferiour Atmoſphere:</hi> Therefore I ſuppoſe only that under this <hi>thick outſide,</hi> there is next a <hi>vaſt</hi> and large region of <hi>fluid matter,</hi> * which for the moſt part very likely is a <hi>groſs</hi> and <hi>fetid</hi> kind of <hi>air,</hi> as alſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable proportions of <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>water,</hi> under all which, there may be other <hi>ſolid</hi> floors, that may incompaſs and cover more vaults, and vaſt hollows, the contents of which 'twere vanity to go about to determine; only 'tis very likely, that as the admirable <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of <hi>Des Cartes</hi> ſuppoſeth, * the loweſt and <hi>central</hi> Regions may be filled with <hi>flame</hi> and <hi>aether,</hi> which ſuppoſitions, though they may ſeem to ſome to be but the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>excurſions</hi> of buſie <hi>imaginations;</hi> yet thoſe that know the <hi>French Philoſophy,</hi> and ſee

                     </p>
                     <p>Now then being thus provided, I return again to proſecute my main intendment; Wherefore 'tis very probable, that the <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>degenerate</hi> part of mankind, * are after death committed to thoſe ſqualid <hi>ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous</hi> habitations; in which <hi>dark priſons,</hi> they do ſevere <hi>penance</hi> for their paſt <hi>impieties,</hi> and have their <hi>ſenſes,</hi> which upon earth they did ſo fondly indulge, and took ſuch care to gratifie, now perſecuted with <hi>darkneſs, ſtench,</hi> and <hi>horror.</hi> Thus doth the <hi>divine juſtice</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in puniſhing thoſe vile <hi>Apoſtates</hi> ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to their <hi>delinquencies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if thoſe vicious ſouls are not carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down to the <hi>infernal caverns</hi> by the meer <hi>congruity</hi> of their natures, as is not ſo eaſie to imagine; we may then reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, * that they are driven into thoſe <hi>dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons</hi> by the <hi>inviſible Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> that manage the affairs of the <hi>world</hi> by <hi>Axiom</hi> 3.

Wherefore, I ſay, they are diſpoſed of into

thoſe <hi>black under-Abyſſes,</hi> where they are ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with company like themſelves, and match't unto <hi>bodies</hi> as <hi>impure,</hi> as are their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved <hi>inclinations.</hi> Not that they are all in the ſame <hi>place,</hi> and under the like <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> but are variouſly diſtributed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the merits of their <hi>natures</hi> and <hi>actions;</hi> ſome only into the <hi>upper priſons,</hi> * others to the <hi>Dungeon:</hi> And ſome to the moſt intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Hell,</hi> the <hi>Abyſs</hi> of <hi>fire.</hi> Thus doth a juſt <hi>Nemeſis</hi> viſit all the quarters of the <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now thoſe miſerable priſoners cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape from the places of their confinement; for 'tis very likely that thoſe watchful <hi>ſpirits</hi> that were inſtrumental in committing them, * have a ſtrict and careful eye upon them to keep them within the confines of their goal, that they rove not out into the regions of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>liberty,</hi> yea, 'tis probable that the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> they have contracted in thoſe <hi>ſqualid</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, may by a kind of fatal <hi>magnetiſme</hi> be chained down to this their <hi>proper</hi> element. Or, they having now a <hi>congruity</hi> only to ſuch <hi>fetid vehicles,</hi> may be no more able to abide the <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>lightſome</hi> Air; than the <hi>Bat</hi> or <hi>Owl</hi> are able to bear the <hi>Suns</hi> noon-day <hi>beams;</hi> or, the <hi>fiſh</hi> to live in theſe thinner Regions. This may be the reaſon of the <hi>unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency</hi> of their appearance; and that they moſt commonly get them away at the approach
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55102:91"/>
of <hi>light.</hi> Beſides all this, ſome there are who ſuppoſe that there is a kind of <hi>polity</hi> among themſelves, which may * under ſevere pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, prohibit all unlicenſed <hi>excurſions</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>upper world;</hi> though I confeſs this ſeems nor ſo probable, and we ſtand in no need of the ſuppoſition.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55102:98"/>
for <hi>ſelf-preſervation</hi> and <hi>proviſion,</hi> which now we yield no ſigns of; had not cuſtom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the <hi>endeavours</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> and made it expect aſſiſtance. For the <hi>Indian Infants</hi> will ſwim currently, when aſſoon as they are born, they are thrown into the water. And nature put to her ſhifts, will do many things more than we can ſuſpect her able for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of; which conſider'd, 'tis not hard to apprehend, but that thoſe Infant <hi>Aborigines</hi> are of a very different temper and condition from the weak products of now decayed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; having queſtionleſs, more pure and <hi>ſerviceable bodies, ſenſes</hi> and other <hi>faculties</hi> more <hi>active</hi> and <hi>vigorous,</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> better exerciſed; ſo that they may by a like <hi>ſenſe</hi> to that which carries all creatures to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per food, purſue and take hold of that nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment which the <hi>free</hi> and <hi>willing Earth</hi> now offer'd to their mouths; till being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged by <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>growth,</hi> they can move about to make their choice. * But all this is but the <hi>frolick</hi> exerciſe of my pen chuſing a <hi>Paradox;</hi> And 'tis time to give over the purſuit.</p>
                     <p>To make an end then, we ſee that after the <hi>Conflagration</hi> the earth will be <hi>inhabited</hi> again, and all things proceed much-what in like manner as before. But whether the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> of <hi>this</hi> ſhall be like the former or no, I think is not to be determined. For
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55102:98"/>
as one world hath <hi>periſh't</hi> by <hi>water,</hi> and this preſent <hi>ſhall</hi> by <hi>fire,</hi> 'tis poſſible the next <hi>period</hi> may be by the <hi>Extinction</hi> of the <hi>Sun.</hi> But I am come to the end of the <hi>line,</hi> and ſhall not go beyond this preſent Stage of <hi>Providence,</hi> or wander into an <hi>Abyſſe</hi> of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, where there is neither <hi>Sun</hi> nor <hi>Star</hi> to guide my notions.</p>
                     <p>Now of all that hath been repreſented of this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> there is nothing that ſeems more <hi>extravagant</hi> and <hi>Romantick</hi> than thoſe notions that come under the two laſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; And yet ſo it falls out, that the main matters contained under them, one would think to have a ſtrange conſonancy with ſome expreſſions in the <hi>Sacred Oracles.</hi> For clear it is from the <hi>divine Volume,</hi> that the <hi>wicked</hi> and the <hi>Devils</hi> themſelves are reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to a further and more ſevere <hi>Judgment</hi> than yet afflicteth them; It is as plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be a <hi>vengeance</hi> of <hi>fire</hi> that abides them, as a compleatment of their torments: And that the <hi>Earth</hi> ſhall be <hi>burnt,</hi> is as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely affirmed, as any thing can be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Now if we put all theſe together, they look like a probability, that the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> ſhall conſummate the <hi>Hell</hi> of the wicked. And * thoſe other expreſſions of <hi>Death, Deſtruction, Perdition</hi> of the ungodly, and the like, ſeem to ſhow a favourable regard to the State of ſilence
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55102:99"/>
and <hi>inactivity.</hi> Nor is there leſs appearing countenance given to the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of <hi>Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> * in thoſe paſſages which predict <hi>New Heavens</hi> and a <hi>New Earth,</hi> and ſeem to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate only a <hi>change</hi> of the preſent.</p>
                     <p>And yet I would have no body be ſo cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous as to be taken with little appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor do I mention theſe with an intent that they ſhould with full conſent be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to intend the aſſerting any ſuch Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines; But that there is ſhew enough both in Reaſon and Scripture for theſe Opinions to give an occaſion for an <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> and therefore that they are not meer <hi>arbitrary</hi> and <hi>idle imaginations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now whatever becomes of this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>draught</hi> of the Souls ſeveral <hi>conditions</hi> of life and action, * the main Opinion of <hi>Prae-exiſtence</hi> is not at all concerned. This <hi>Scheme</hi> is only to ſhew, that natural and imperfect Reaſon can frame an <hi>Intelligible Idea</hi> of it; And therefore queſtionleſs the Divine <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> could form and order it, either ſo, or with infinitely more <hi>accuracy</hi> and <hi>exactneſs.</hi> How it was with us therefore of <hi>Old,</hi> I know not; But yet that we may have been, and acted before we deſcended hither, I think is very probable. And I ſee no reaſon but why <hi>Praeexiſtence</hi> may be admitted without altering any thing conſiderable of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Syſteme</hi> of <hi>Theology.</hi> But I ſhut up

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Have now peruſed, and returned the Manuſcript you ſent me; it had contracted many and great Errours in the Tranſcription, which I have corrected: I was enabled to do it by a written Copy of the ſame Diſcourſe, which I have had divers years in my Hands. The Subject is of great and weighty importance, and the Acknowledgment of the Truths here aſſerted and made good, will lay a Foundation for right conceptions in the Doctrines that concern the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:55102:102"/>
of God. For the firſt Errour, which is the ground of the reſt, is, That things are good and juſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God Wills them ſo to be; and if that be granted, we are diſabled from uſing the arguments taken from natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Notions, and the Attributes and Perfections of the Divine Nature, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Blackeſt and moſt Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Opinions that ever were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained concerning Gods proceedings with the Sons of Men. If there be no ſettled Good and Evil, Immutable and Independent on any Will or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then God may have made his reaſonable Creatures on purpoſe to damn them for ever. He may have abſolutely decreed that they ſhould ſin, that he may damn them juſtly; He may moſt ſolemnly and earneſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit Sin by his Laws, and declare great diſpleaſure againſt it; and yet by his ineluctable Decrees force men to all the ſin that is committed in the
<pb facs="tcp:55102:102"/>
World: He may vehemently proteſt his unfeigned deſire of their Life and Happineſs, and at the ſame time ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly reſolve their Eternal Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; He may make it his Glory and Pleaſure to triumph eternally in the torments of poor Worms, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath by his unalterable and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible Will made miſerable; yea, (as the diſcourſe inſtanceth) he may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Decrees concerning the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Elect, after the death of his Son for them, and the miſſion of his Spirit to them, and after all the promiſes he hath made to aſſure them; thruſt <hi>them</hi> alſo at laſt into the dreadful Regions of Death and Woe; I ſay if there be no immutable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects in things, but Juſt and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, Honourable and Diſhonourable, Good and Cruel, Faithful and Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, are reſpects made by meer arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarious Will, it will be in vain to diſpute from Them againſt any ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:55102:103"/>
diſmal Opinions: yea it will be great folly to argue for the Simplicity of the Divine Nature againſt the vile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of the old <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> and the Blaſphemies of the preſent <hi>Muggletonians,</hi> of God's having a Corporal ſhape, Parts and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, if there be no neceſſary Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Connexion, betwixt Immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, Spirituality and Perfection. But this being eſtabliſhed, that there are immutable reſpects in things, and that ſuch and ſuch are Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and their contrary, Defects and imperfections; hence it will follow, that it is impoſſible the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Doctrines can be true concerning God, who <hi>cannot lye,</hi> cannot <hi>deny himſelf: viz.</hi> He being Abſolute and Infinite Perfection, cannot act any thing that is Evil or imperfect; But all the expreſſions in Scripture, that at firſt ſight look towards ſuch a ſenſe, muſt be interpreted by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb facs="tcp:55102:103"/>
                     <hi>Analogy</hi> and courſe of them, which declares his Infinite, Immutable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, and theſe Notions of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which he hath written on the Souls of Men.</p>
                  <p>So that the Subject of this little Diſcourſe, is of vaſt Moment, and the truth aſſerted in it, is, I think, confirmed with an irreſiſtible Strength and force of Reaſoning; and not to be convinced by it, will argue either great weakneſs of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, in not perceiving conſequences that are ſo cloſe and plain; or great obſtinacy of Will, in being ſhut up by prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and preconceiv'd Opinions againſt Light that is ſo clear and manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>The Author was a Perſon with whom I had the Honour and Happineſs of a very particular acquaintance; a man he was of a clear Mind, a deep Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſearching Wit: greatly learned in all the beſt ſorts of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, old and new, a thoughtful and
<pb facs="tcp:55102:104"/>
diligent Enquirer, of a free <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and vaſt Capacity, joyn'd with ſingular Modeſty, and unuſual Sweetneſs of Temper, which made him the Darling of all that knew him: He was a perſon of great Piety and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity; a hearty Lover of God and Men: An excellent Preacher, a wiſe Governour, a profound Philoſopher, a quick, forcible, and cloſe Reaſoner, and above all, a true and exemplary Chriſtian. In ſhort, he was one who had all the Qualifications of a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive</hi> Biſhop, and of an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man. This I ſay not out of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to my Friend, but out of Juſtice to a Perſon of whom no Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be extravagant. He was bred in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and Fellow of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Colledge, where he lived in great Eſteem and Reputation for his eminent Learning and Vertues; he was one of the firſt that overcame the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of the Education of the late
<pb facs="tcp:55102:104"/>
unhappy Times, in that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity, and was very Inſtrumental to enlarge others. He had too great a Soul for the trifles of that Age, and ſaw ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the nakedneſs of Phraſes and Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; He out-grew the pretended O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy of thoſe days, and addicted himſelf to the Primitive Learning and Theology, in which he even then became a great Maſter.</p>
                  <p>After the return of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the excellent Biſhop <hi>Taylor,</hi> foreſeeing the vacancy in the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery of <hi>Connor,</hi> ſent to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> for ſome Learned and Ingenious Man, who might be fit for that Dignity. The motion was made to Dr. <hi>Ruſt,</hi> which correſponding with the great Inclination he had to be converſant with that incomparable Perſon, he gladly accepted of it, and haſtn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he langed at <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> about <hi>Auguſt 1661.</hi> He was received with much Reſpect and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb facs="tcp:55102:105"/>
by that great and good Biſhop, who knew how to value ſuch Jewels; and preferr'd to the Deanery as ſoon as it was void, which was ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He continued in that Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment during the Biſhops Life, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways dearly lov'd, and even admir'd by him.</p>
                  <p>At his Death (that ſad ſtroke to all the Lovers of Religion and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) he was choſen for the laſt ſolemn Office to his Deceaſed Father and Friend; and he Preach't ſuch a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Sermon as became that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Perſon and himſelf. It hath been ſince publiſhed, and I ſuppoſe you may have ſeen it, upon the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Death of Biſhop <hi>Taylor,</hi> which hapned <hi>Auguſt</hi> 13th. 1667. The Biſhopricks were divided; Dr. <hi>Boyle</hi> Dean of <hi>Cork,</hi> was nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Biſhop of <hi>Downe</hi> and <hi>Connor;</hi> and Dr. <hi>Ruſt</hi> Dean of <hi>Connor,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Dromore;</hi> he lived in the
<pb facs="tcp:55102:105"/>
Deanery about ſix years, in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick but three; for in <hi>December 1670,</hi> he dyed of a Fever (in the prime of his years) to the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able grief of all that knew his Worth, and eſpecially of ſuch of them as had been bleſt by his Friendſhip, and moſt ſweet and indearing Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He was buried in the Quire of his own Cathedral Church of <hi>Dromore,</hi> in a Vault made for his Predeceſſour Biſhop <hi>Taylor,</hi> whoſe Sacred Duſt is depoſited alſo there: and what Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitory hath two ſuch Tenants?</p>
                  <p>This is the beſt account I can give you of the Work and the Author: and by it you may perceive his Memory deſerves to live, and this product of him: but there is ſo much reverence due to the <hi>Manes</hi> of ſo venerable a Perſon, that nothing ſhould be haſtily publiſhed under his honour'd name. I know, had he deſigned this Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for the Publick, he would have
<pb facs="tcp:55102:106"/>
made it much more compleat and exact than we now have it; but as it is, the Diſcourſe is weighty, and ſubſtantial, and may be of great uſe. As it goes about now in written Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it, is (I perceive) exceedingly depraved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in danger of being ſtill worſe abuſed; The Publication would preſerve it from further cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. However I dare not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe any thing in it, but this, that you take the judgment of that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Doctor you mention (the deceaſed Authors Friend and mine,) and act according as he ſhall direct.

It were folly and madneſs to ſit down and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the admirable contrivement and artifice of this great Fabrick of the Univerſe; how that all natural things ſeem to act for ſome end, though themſelves take no Cognizance of it: How the Sun by its motion and ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or (which is all one) by being a Centre of the Earths Motion, provides Light and Heat, and Life for this inferiour

World, how living Creatures bring forth a moſt apt compoſure and ſtructure of parts and members, and with that a being endued with admirable Faculties, and yet themſelves have no inſight into, nor conſultation about this incomparable Workmanſhip; how they are furniſhed with Powers and Inclinations for the preſervation of this Body when it is once brought into the World; how without prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious deliberation they naturally take in that Food which without their intention or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion is concocted in their Ventricle, turned into Chyle, that Chyle into Bloud, that Bloud diffuſed through the Veins and Arteries, and therewith the ſeveral Members nouriſhed, and decays of ſtrength repaired; I ſay, the gathering from all theſe (which one would think were a very natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) that there is a wiſe Principle which directs all theſe Beings unknown to you, in their ſeveral motions, to their ſeveral ends, (ſuppoſing the dependence and relations of things to be contingent and arbitrarious) were a piece of folly and incogitancy; For how can the Order of thoſe things ſpeak a wiſe and underſtanding Being, which have no relation or reſpect unto one another, but their whole agreement, ſuitableneſs and proportion is a meer caſual iſſue of abſolute and independent Will? If any thing may be the cauſe of any effect, and a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

mean to any end, who can infer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom from the dependence of things and their relations unto one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? * For we are to know that there is a God, and the Will of that God before we can know the mutual Harmony, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion of things; and yet, if we do not know theſe principal reſpects that things have among themſelves, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible we ſhould ever come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a God: For theſe are the only ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that any Logick in the world can make uſe of to prove any concluſion. But ſuppoſe we ſhould come to know that there is a God, which, as I have demonſtrated, denying the neceſſary and immutable truth of common Notions, and the indiſpenſible and eternal relations of things, is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impoſſible: However, let it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; yet how ſhall we know that theſe common Notions, and principles of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtinct, which are the foundation of all Diſcourſe and Argumentation, are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and infallible Truths; and that our <hi>Senſes,</hi> (which with theſe former Principles, we ſuppoſe this Divine Nature to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us to converſe with this outward world) were not on purpoſe beſtowed upon us, to befool, delude and cheat us; if we be not firſt aſſured of the <hi>Veracity</hi> of God? And how can we be aſſured of that, if we know
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55102:113"/>
not that Veracity is a perfection? and how ſhall we know it is ſo, unleſs there be an intrinſecal relation betwixt Veracity and Perfection? For if it be an arbitrarious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect depending upon the Will of God, there is no way poſſible left whereby we ſhould come to know that it is in God at all; And therefore we have fully as much reaſon to believe that all our common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Principles of natural inſtinct, whereupon we ground all our reaſonings and diſcourſe, are meer Chimaera's to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude and abuſe our faculties; and all thoſe Idea's, Phantaſms and Apprehenſions of our external ſenſes, we imagine are occaſioned in us by the pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If any ſhould affirm, that the terms of common Notions have an eternal and indiſpenſible relation unto one another, and deny it of other truths, he exceedingly betrays his folly and incogitancy; for theſe common Notions and principles are foundations, and radical truths upon which are built all the deductions of reaſon and Diſcourſe, and with which, ſo far as they have any truth in them, they are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably united.

                  <p>THeſe two Books, <hi>Lux Orientalis</hi> and the <hi>Diſcourſe of Truth,</hi> are luckily put together by the <hi>Publiſher,</hi> there being that ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs between them, and mutual ſupport of one another.

In which I would not be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as that I had ſuch an anxiety and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55102:126"/>
fondneſs for the Opinions they maintain, as if all were gone if they ſhould fail; but that the Dogmata being more fully; clearly, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely propounded, men may more ſafely and conſiderately give their Judgments thereon; but with that modeſty as to admit nothing that is contrary to the Judgment of the truly Catholick and Apoſtolick Church.</p>
                  <p>Chap. 2. p. 4. <hi>That he made us pure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,</hi> &amp;c. This is plainly ſignified in the general Moſaick Hiſtory of the Creation, that all that God made he ſaw it was good; and it is particularly declared of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> that they were created or made in a ſtate of Innocency.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 4. <hi>Matter can do nothing but by motion, and what relation hath that to a moral Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?</hi> We muſt either grant that the figures of the particles of Matter and their motion, have a power to affect the Soul united with the Body, (and I remember <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſpeaking of Wine, ſays, it does <gap reason="foreign">

But that Matter has a conſiderable
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55102:126"/>
influence upon a Soul united thereto, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelf does copiouſly acknowledge in his fourth Chapter of this Book; where he tells us, that according to the diſpoſition of the Body, our Wits are either more quick, free, and ſparkling, or more obtuſe, weak, and ſluggiſh; and our Mind more chearful and contented, or elſe more moroſe, melancholick, or dogged, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore that he may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the more conſiſtent with himſelf, it is likely he underſtands by this Moral Contagion the very venome and malignity of vitious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, how that can be derived from Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, eſpecially its power conſiſting in mere motion and figuration of parts. The Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt's deſcription is very appoſite to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Pſal. 58. The ungodly are froward even from their mothers womb; as ſoon as they are born they go aſtray and ſpeak lyes. They are as venomous as the poyſon of a ſerpent, even like the deaf adder that ſtoppeth her ear.</hi> That there ſhould be ſuch a difference in the Nativity of ſome from that of others, and haply begot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the ſame Parents, is no ſlight intimation that their difference is not from their Bodies, but their Souls; in which there is ſo ſudden Eruptions of vitious Inclinations which they had contracted in their former ſtate, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed nor extinct in this, by reaſon of <hi>Adam</hi>'s lapſe, and his loſing the Paradiſiacal body in which he was created, and which ſhould, if it

had not been for his Fall, been tranſmitted to his Poſterity; but that being loſt, the ſeveral meaſures of the priſtine Vitioſity of humane Souls diſcover themſelves in this life, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the juſt Laws of the Divine Nemeſis eſſentially interwoven into the nature of things.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 5. <hi>How is it that thoſe that are under continual temptations to Vice, are yet kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of Vertue,</hi> &amp;c. That thoſe that are continually under temptations to Vice from their Childhood, ſhould keep within the bounds of Vertue, and thoſe that have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual outward advantages from their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to be vertuous, ſhould prove vitious not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, is not rationally reſolved into their free will; for in this they are both of them equal: and if they had been equal alſo in their external advantages or diſadvantages, the different event might well be imputed to the freedom of their Will. But now that one, notwithſtanding all the diſadvantages to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ſhould prove vertuous, and the other, notwithſtanding all the advantages to Vertue ſhould prove vitious; the reaſon of this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to the conſiderate will ſeem to lie dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than the meer liberty of Will in man. But it can be attributed to nothing, with a more due and tender regard to the Divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, than to the <hi>pre-exiſtent</hi> ſtate of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Souls, according to the Scope of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>

                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ms to be a diminutive and diſparaging apprehenſion of the infinite and immenſe goodneſs of God, that he ſhould detrude ſuch excellent Creatures,</hi> &amp;c. To enervate this reaſon, there is framed by an ingenious hand this Hypotheſis, to vie with that of Pre-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence: That Mankind is an Order of Beings placed in a middle ſtate between Angels and Brutes, made up of contrary Principles, <hi>viz. Matter</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> indued with contrary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, <hi>viz. Animal</hi> and <hi>Rational,</hi> and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with contrary Objects proportioned to their reſpective faculties, that ſo they may be in a capacity to exerciſe the Vertues proper and peculiar to their compounded and hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneal nature. And therefore though hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Souls be capable of ſubſiſting by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet God has placed them in Bodies full of brutiſh and unreaſonable Propenſions, that they may be capable of exerciſing many choice and excellent Vertues, which otherwiſe could never have been at all; ſuch as Temperance, Sobriety, Chaſtity, Patience, Meekneſs, Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, and all other Vertues that conſiſt in the Empire of <hi>Reaſon</hi> over <hi>Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.</hi> And therefore he conceives that the creating of humane Souls, though pure and immaculate, and uniting them with ſuch bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Bodies, is but the conſtituting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſuch a Species of Being, which is an Order betwixt <hi>Brutes</hi> and <hi>Angels;</hi> into which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55102:128"/>
latter Order, if men uſe their faculties of the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Principle in them well, they may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend: Foraſmuch as God has given them in their <hi>Spiritual</hi> Principle (containing <hi>Free Will,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> to diſcern what is beſt) a power and faculty of overcoming all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Appetites.</p>
                  <p>This is his Hypotheſis, moſtwhat in his own words, and all to his own ſence, as near as I could with brevity expreſs it: And it ſeems ſo reaſonable to himſelf, that he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes himſelf apt to be poſitive and dogmatical therein. And it might very well ſeem ſo to him, if there were a ſufficient faculty in the Souls of men in this World, to command and keep in order the Paſſions and Appetites of their Body, and to <hi>be</hi> and <hi>do</hi> what their Reaſon and Conſcience tells them they ſhould <hi>be</hi> and <hi>do,</hi> and blames them for not <hi>being</hi> and <hi>doing.</hi> So that they know more by far than they find an ability in themſelves to perform. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly few there are, if any, but this is their condition: Whence all <hi>Philoſophers</hi> (that had any ſenſe of Vertue and Holineſs) as well as <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> have looked upon Man as in a lapſed ſtate, not blaming God, but deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſad condition they found themſelves in by ſome foregoing lapſe or fault in Mankind. And it is ſtrange that our own Conſciences ſhould flie in our faces for what we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have helped.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:55102:128"/>
It is witty indeed which is alleadged in the behalf of this Hypotheſis, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> part of man is able to command the lower <hi>Appetites;</hi> becauſe if the ſuperiour part be not ſtrong enough to govern the inferiour, it deſtroys the very being of <hi>moral</hi> Good and Evil: Foraſmuch as thoſe acts that proceed out of <hi>neceſſity</hi> cannot be <hi>moral,</hi> nor can the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Faculties be obliged to govern the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour, if they are not able, becauſe nothing is obliged to impoſſibilities. But I anſwer, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abilities come upon us by our <hi>own fault,</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of action then are upon the former ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>moral,</hi> or rather <hi>immoral.</hi> And our Conſciences rightly charge us with the Vitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of our Inclinations and Actions, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can mend them here, becauſe they are the conſequences of our former Guilt.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore it is no wonder that there is found a flaw in a ſubtilty that would conclude againſt the univerſal Experience of men, who all of them, more or leſs, that have any ſenſe of Morality left in them, complain that the inferiour powers of the Soul, at leaſt for a time, were too hard for the ſuperiour. And the whole maſs of Mankind is ſo generally corrupt and abominable, that it would argue the wiſe and juſt God a very unequal Matcher of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Souls with brutiſh Bodies, they being univerſally ſo hugely foiled or overcome in the conflict, if he indeed were the immediate
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55102:129"/>
Matcher of them. For how can that be the effect of an equilibrious or ſufficient Free Will and Power, that is in a manner perpetual and conſtant? But there would be near as many Examples one way as the other, if the Souls of men in this ſtate were not by ſome precedent lapſe become unable to govern, as they ought, all in them or about them that is to be ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to their Reaſon. No fine Fetches of Wit can demoliſh the ſteady and weighty ſtructure of ſound and general Experience.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 9. <hi>Wherein he ſeeth it, ten thouſand to one but that they will corrupt,</hi> &amp;c. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion [ten thouſand to one] is figurative, and ſignifies how hugely more like it is that the Souls would be corrupted by their Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration in theſe Animal or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Brutiſh Bodies, than eſcape Corruption. And the effect makes good the Aſſertion: for <hi>David</hi> of old (to ſay nothing of the days of <hi>Noah)</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> after him, declare of Mankind in general, that they are altogether become abominable; there is none that doth good, no not one. Wherefore we ſee what efficacy theſe Bodies have, if inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Souls be put into them by the immediate hand of God, as alſo the force of Cuſtom and corrupt Education to debauch them; and therefore how unlikely it is that God ſhould create innocent Souls to thruſt them into ſuch ill circumſtances.</p>

and unclean Coitions, by creating a Soul to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the impure Foetus,</hi> &amp;c. This ſeemed ever to thoſe that had any ſenſe of the Divine Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Sanctity, or were themſelves endued with any due ſenſibleneſs and diſcernment of things, to be an Argument of no ſmall weight. But how one of the more rude and unhewen Oppoſers of <hi>Pre-exiſtence</hi> ſwaggers it out of countenance, I think it not amiſs to ſet down for a pleaſant Entertainment of the Reader.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Admit,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that Gods watchful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence waits upon diſſolute Voluptuaries in their unmeet Conjunctions, and ſends down freſh crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Spirits to actuate their obſcene Emiſſions, what is here done which is not very high and becoming God, and moſt congruous and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to his immenſe Grandeur and Majeſty,</hi> viz. To bear a part amongſt Pimps and Bawds, and pocky Whores and Woremaſters, to riſe out of his Seat for them, and by a free Act of Creation of a Soul, to ſet his Seal of Conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to their Villanies; who yet is ſaid to be of more pure Eyes than to endure to behold Wickedneſs. So that if he does (as his Phraſe is) pop in a Soul in theſe unclean Coitions, certainly he does it winking. But he goes on: <hi>For in the firſt place,</hi> ſays he, <hi>his condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is hereby made ſignal and eximious; he is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly humble beyond a parallel, and by his own Example leſſons us to perform the meaneſt works, if fit and profitable, and to be content even to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55102:130"/>
drudge for the common bénefit of the World.</hi> Good God! what a Rapture has this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Scene of Venerie put this young Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger into, that it ſhould thus drive him out of his little Wits and Senſes, and make him ſpeak inconſiſtences with ſuch an affected Grace and lofty Eloquence! If the act of Gods freely creating Souls, and ſo of aſſiſting wretched Sinners in their foul acts of Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Whoredom, be a <hi>glorious</hi> action, how is it an <hi>Abaſement</hi> of him, how is it his <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation?</hi> and if it be an <hi>humbling</hi> and debaſing of him, how is it <hi>glorious?</hi> The joyning of two ſuch <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, are indeed without <hi>parallel.</hi> The creating of an humane Soul immortal and immaculate, and ſuch as bears the Image of God in it, as all immaculate Souls do, is one of the moſt glorious actions that God can perform; ſuch a Creature is it, as the Schools have judged more of value than the frame of the whole viſible World. But to joyn ſuch a Creature as this to ſuch impure corporeal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is furthermore a moſt tranſcendent Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of both his <hi>Skill</hi> and <hi>Soveraignty;</hi> ſo that this is an act of further <hi>Super-exaltation</hi> of himſelf, not of <hi>Humiliation.</hi> What remains then to be his <hi>Humiliation,</hi> but the condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to aſſiſt and countenance the unclean en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of Adulterers and Adultereſſes? Which therefore can be no Leſſons to us for <hi>Humility,</hi> but a Cordial for the faint-hearted in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55102:130"/>
                     <hi>Debauchery,</hi> and degeneracy of Life; wherein they may plead, ſo inſtructed by this rural Theolog, that they are content to drudge for the common profit of the World. But he proceeds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſecondly,</hi> ſays he, <hi>hereby he elicits Good out of Evil, cauſing famous and heroick perſons to take their Origine from baſe occaſions; and ſo converts the Luſts of ſenſual Varlets to nobler ends than they deſigned them.</hi> As if an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Off-ſpring were the genuine effect of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery or Fornication, and the moſt likely way to People the World with worthy Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages. How this raw Philoſopher will make this comply with his Profeſſion of Divinity, I know not; whenas, it teaches us, that Marriage is honourable, but Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge; and that he puniſhes the Iniquities of the Parents on their Children. But this bold Sophiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> makes God adjudge the nobleſt Off-ſpring to the defiled Bed, and not to puniſh, but reward the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery or Whoredom of debauched perſons, by giving them the beſt and braveſt Children: Which the more true it could be found in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, it would be the ſtronger Argument for Pre-exiſtence; it being incredible that God, if he created Souls on purpoſe, ſhould crown Adultery and Whoredom with the choiceſt Off-ſpring.</p>
                  <p>And then <hi>thirdly and laſtly,</hi> ſays he, <hi>hereby
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55102:131"/>
he often detects the lewdneſs of Sinners, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would be ſmothered,</hi> &amp;c. As if the All-wiſe God could find no better nor juſter means than this to diſcover this Villany. If he be thus immediately and in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way aſſiſtant in theſe Coitions, were it not as eaſie for him, and infinitely more deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, to charge the Womb with ſome <hi>Mola</hi> or <hi>Ephemerous Monſter,</hi> than to plunge an imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culato humane Soul into it? This would as effectually diſcover the Villany committed, and beſides prevent the charge Pariſhes are put to in maintaining Baſtards. And now that we have thus ſeen what a mere nothing it is that this Strutter has pronounced with ſuch ſonorous Rhetorick, yet he is not aſhamed to conclude with this Appeal to I know not what blind Judges: <hi>Now,</hi> ſays he, <hi>are not all theſe Actions and Concerns very graceful and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to God?</hi> Which words in theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances no man could utter, were he not of a craſs, inſenſible, and injudicious Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or elſe made no Conſcience of ſpeaking againſt his Judgment.

In his caſe God acts freely, raiſing himſelf, as it were, out of his Seat to create an immaculate Soul, and put into a foul Body; but in the other caſe God onely is a looker on, there is onely his Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, not his Action. And the vaſt difference of time, he ſalves it with ſuch a Quibble as this, as if it were nothing, becauſe thouſands of Ages ago, in reſpect of God and his Eternity, is not an hour before.

                  <p>Pag. 13. <hi>It ſeems very incongruous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome, to ſuppoſe that God ſhould create two Souls for the ſupply of one monſtrous Body.</hi> And there is the ſame reaſon for ſeveral other Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroſities, which you may take notice of in <hi>Fortunius Licetus,</hi> lib. 2. cap. 58.

For out of his holy hands all things come clean and neat. Many little efforts he

makes afterwards to ſalve this difficulty of Monſters, but yet in his own judgment the ſureſt is the laſt; <hi>That God did purpoſely tye freſh created Souls to theſe monſtroûs ſhapes, that they whoſe Souls ſped better, might humbly thank him.</hi> Which is as wiſely argued, as if one ſhould firſt with himſelf take it for granted that God determines ſome men to monſtrous Debaucheries and Impieties, and then fancy this the uſe of it, that the Spectators of them may with better pretence than the Phariſee, cry out, Lord, we thank thee that we are not as theſe men are. There is nothing permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, but it has its uſe ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and therefore it cannot be concluded, becauſe that an Event has this or that uſe, therefore God by his immediate and free Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence effected it. <hi>A Pre-exiſtentiary</hi> eaſily diſcerns that theſe Monſtroſities plainly imply that God does not create Souls ſtill for every humane Coition, but that having pre-exiſted, they are left to the great <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>

ſeventh days reſt. For if all his works are reſted from, then the creation of Souls (which is a work, nay a Maſter-piece amongſt his works ſcarce inferiour to any) is reſted from alſo. But the above-mentioned Oppoſer of Pre-exiſtence is not at a loſs for an Anſwer; (for his Anſwers being ſlight, are cheap and eaſie to come by:) He ſays therefore, That this ſuppoſeth onely that after that time he ceaſed from creating new Species. A witty Invention! As if God had got ſuch an eaſie habit by once creating the things he created in the ſix days, that if he but contained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf within thoſe kinds of things, though he did hold on ſtill creating them, that it was not <hi>Work,</hi> but mere <hi>Play</hi> or <hi>Reſt</hi> to him, in compariſon of his former labour.

Pag. 17. <hi>And were the Soul quite void of all ſuch implicit Notions, it would remain as ſenſeleſs,</hi> &amp;c.

To this a more elegant Pen and refined Wit objects thus: Now is it not highly derogatory to the infinite and unbounded Wiſdom of God, that he ſhould detrude thoſe Souls which he ſo ſeriouſly deſignes to make happy, into a ſtate ſo hazardous, wherein he ſeeth it to be ten thouſand to one but that they will corrupt and defile themſelves, and ſo make them more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable here and to eternity hereafter? A ſtrange method of recovering this, to put them into ſuch a fatal neceſſity of periſhing: 'tis but an odd contrivance for their reſtauration to Happineſs, to uſe ſuch means to compaſs it which 'tis ten thouſand to one but will make them infinitely more miſerable. This he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in reference to what the Author of <hi>Lux Orientalis</hi> writes, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. where he ſays, <hi>It is a thouſand to one but Souls detruded into theſe bodies will corrupt and defile themſelves, and ſo make themſelves miſerable here and to eternity hereafter.</hi>

                  <p>And much he quotes to the ſame purpoſe

out of the <hi>Account of Origen.</hi> Where the Souls great diſadvantages to Vertue and Holineſs, what from the ſtrong inclinations of the Body, and what from National Cuſtoms &amp; Education in this Terreſtrial State, are lively ſet out with a moſt moving and tragical Eloquence, to ſhew how unlikely it is that God ſhould put inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and immaculate Souls of his own creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on immediately, into ſuch Bodies, and ſo hard and even almoſt fatal condition of miſcarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Upon which this ſubtile <hi>Anti-Pre-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentiary:</hi> Thus you ſee, ſaith he, what ſtrong Objections and Arguments the <hi>Pre-exiſtentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> urge with moſt noiſe and clamour, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves. If therefore theſe Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena be inexplicable, without the <hi>Origenian</hi> Hypotheſis, they are ſo too with it; and if ſo, then the reſult of all is, that they are not ſo much Arguments of <hi>Pre-exiſtence</hi> as Aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Providence.</hi> This is ſmartly and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizingly ſpoken. But let us conſider more punctually the ſtate of the matter.</p>
                  <p>Here then we are firſt to obſerve, how cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly this ſhrewd Antagoniſt conceals a main ſtroke of the Suppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Pity and Compaſſion to lapſed Souls, that had otherwiſe fallen into an eternal ſtate of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Death, had ſet up <hi>Adam</hi> for their relief, and endued him with ſuch a Paradiſiacal body of ſo excellent a conſtitution to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to all his Poſterity, and inveſted him,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55102:136"/>
in vertue of this, with ſo full power <hi>non peccan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> that if he and his Poſterity were not in an happy flouriſhing condition as to their eternal intereſt of Holineſs and Vertue, it would be long of himſelf. And what could God do more correſpondently to his Wiſdom and Goodneſs, dealing with free Agents, ſuch as humane Souls are, than this? And the thing being thus ſtated, no Objections can be brought againſt the Hypotheſis, but ſuch as will invade the inviolable Truths of Faith and Orthodox Divinity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We are to obſerve, how this cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Objector has got theſe two <hi>Pre-exiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries</hi> upon the hip for their youthful flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Rhetorick, when one ſays, it is hundreds to one; the other, ten thouſand to one, that Souls will miſcarry put into theſe diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Terreſtrial ſtate, by which no can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Reader will underſtand any more, than that it is exceeding difficult for them to eſcape the pollutions of this lower World once incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into Terreſtrial Bodies. But it being granted poſſible for them to emerge, this is a great grace and favour of the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſuch peccant wretches, that they are brought out of the ſtate of eternal <hi>Silence</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> to try their Fortunes once more, though incumbred with ſo great difficulties which the Divine <hi>Nemeſis</hi> ſuffers to return upon them. That therefore they are <hi>at all</hi> in a condition
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55102:137"/>
of recovery, is from the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> of God; that their condition is ſo <hi>hard,</hi> from his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> they having been ſo foully pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. And his wiſdom being only to contrive what is moſt agreeable to his Mercy and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, it is not at all derogatory to the infinite and unbounded Wiſdom of God thus to deal with lapſed Souls. For though he does ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly intend to make them happy, yet it muſt be in a way correſpondent to his <hi>Juſtice</hi> as well as <hi>Mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly and Laſtly, Beſides that the Spirit of the Lord pervades the whole Earth ready to aſſiſt the ſincere; there is moreover a mighty weight of mercy added in the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to the world, ſo that the retriving of the Souls of men out of their <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Silence</hi> into this Terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſtate, in which there is theſe helps to the ſincere, it is manifeſtly worthy the Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs. For thoſe it takes no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with, (they beginning the world again on this ſtage) they ſhall be judged onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what they have done here, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an eternal obliteration as well as oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the acts of their Pre-exiſtent ſtate; but thoſe that this merciful Diſpenſation of God has taken any effect upon here, their ſincere deſires may grow into higher accompliſhments in the future ſtate. Which may ſomething mitigate the horrour of that ſeeming univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55102:137"/>
ſqualid eſtate of the Sons of men upon earth. Which in that it is ſo ill, is rightly imputed by both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and the divineſt <hi>Philoſophers</hi> to a Lapſe, and to the <hi>Mercy</hi> and Grace <hi>of God</hi> that it is no worſe. From whence it may appear, that that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for <hi>Pre-exiſtence,</hi> that God does not put newly created innocent Souls into ſuch diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous circumſtances of a terreſtrial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation, though partly out of <hi>Mercy,</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> he has thought fit lapſed Souls ſhould be ſo diſpoſed of, that this I ſay is no aſperſion of Divine Providence.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 36. <hi>And now I cannot think of any place in the ſacred Volume more, that could make a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable plea against this Hypotheſis,</hi> &amp;c. It is much that the ingenious Author thought not of <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. [For the Children being not yet born, neither having done either good or evil, that the purpoſe of God according to Election might ſtand, not of works, but of him that calleth.] This is urged by <hi>Anti-pre-exiſtentiaries,</hi> as a notable place againſt <hi>Pre-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence.</hi> For, ſay they, how could <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi> be ſaid neither to have done good nor evil, if they pre-exiſted before they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this world? For if they pre-exiſted, they acted; and if they acted, they being rational Souls, they muſt have done either good or evil. This makes an handſome ſhew at firſt ſight; but if we conſult <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. we ſhall plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55102:138"/>
ſee that this is ſpoke of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> yet ſtrugling in the Womb; as it is ſaid in this Text, <hi>For the Children being not yet born;</hi> but ſtrugling in the Womb, as you may ſee in the other. Which plainly therefore reſpects their actions in this life, upon which certainly the mind of St. <hi>Paul</hi> was fix'd. As if he ſhould have expreſly ſaid: For the Children being not yet born, but ſtrugling in the Womb, neither having done either good or evil in this life as being ſtill in the Womb, it was ſaid of them to <hi>Rebeckah, The elder ſhall ſerve the younger.</hi> Which ſufficiently illuſtrates the matter in hand with St. <hi>Paul;</hi> that as <hi>Jacob</hi> was prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before <hi>Eſau</hi> in the Womb, before either of them was born to act here on the Earth, and that therefore done without any reſpect to their actions; ſo the purpoſe of God touching his people ſhould be of free Election, not of Works.</p>
                  <p>That of <hi>Zachary</hi> alſo, Chap. 12. 1. I have heard alledged by ſome as a place on which no ſmall ſtreſs may be laid.

defines nothing of the time of forming it. There are ſeveral other Texts alledged, but it is ſo eaſie to anſwer them, and would take up ſo much time and room, that I think fit to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them, remembring my ſcope to be ſhort <hi>Annotations,</hi> not a tedious <hi>Commentary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pag. 41. <hi>Mr.</hi> Ben Iſrael <hi>in his Problems De Creatione aſſures us, that Pre-exiſtence was the common belief,</hi> &amp;c. That this was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of the wiſer men amongſt the Jews, R. <hi>Menaſſe Ben Iſrael</hi> himſelf told me at <hi>London</hi> with great freedom and aſſurance, and that there was a conſtant tradition thereof; which he ſaid in ſome ſence was alſo true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Trinity, but that more obſcure. But this of Pre-exiſtence is manifeſt up and down in the Writings of that very ancient and learned Jew <hi>Philo Judaeus;</hi> as alſo ſomething toward a Trinity, if I remember aright.</p>
                  <p>Chap. 5. Pag. 46. <hi>We ſhould doubtleſs have retained ſome remembrance of that condition.</hi> And the rather, as one ingeniouſly argues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our ſtate in this life is a ſtate of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Upon which he concludes, <hi>That if the calamities of this life were inflicted upon us only as a puniſhment of ſins committed in another, Providence would have provided ſome effectual means to preſerve them in our memories. And therefore, becauſe we find no remainders of any ſuch Records in our minds, 'tis,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſufficient
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55102:139"/>
evidence to all ſober and impartial inquirers, that our living and ſinning in a former ſtate is as falſe as inevident.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to this it may be anſwered, That the ſtate we are put in, is not a ſtate <hi>only</hi> of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but of a merciful trial; and it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that we find our ſelves in a lapſed and ſinful condition, our own Conſciences telling us when we do amiſs, and calling upon us to amend. So that it is needleſs particularly to remember our faults in the other world, but the time is better ſpent in faithfully endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to amend our ſelves in this, and to keep our ſelves from all faults of what nature ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Which is a needleſs thing our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhould diſcover to us to have been of old committed by us, when our Conſciences urge to us that they are never to be committed; and the Laws of holy Law-givers and divine Inſtructers, or wiſe Sages over all the world, aſſiſt alſo our Conſcience in her office. So that the end of Gods Juſtice by theſe inward and outward Monitors, and by the croſs and afflicting Rancounters in this preſent ſtate, is to be attained to, <hi>viz.</hi> the amendment of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents if they be not refractory.</p>
                  <p>And we were placed on this ſtage as it were to begin the world again, ſo as if we had not exiſted before. Whence it ſeems meet, that there ſhould be an utter obliteration of all that is paſt, ſo as not to be able by memory
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55102:139"/>
to connect the former life and this together. The memory whereof, if we were capable of it, would be inconſiſtent with the orderly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of this, and overdoze us and make us half moped to the preſent Scene of things. Whenas the Divine Purpoſe ſeems to be, that we ſhould alſo experience the natural pleaſures and ſatisfactions of this life, but in an orderly and obedient way, keeping to the preſcribed rules of Virtue and Holineſs. And thus our faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs being exerciſed <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>But in the mean time, that ſaying which the Poet puts in the mouth of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> touching the inferiour Deities, may not misbeſeem the mercy and wiſdom of the true God concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning lapſed Souls incorporate into terreſtrial Bodies.</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Has quoniam coeli nondum dignamur honore.</l>

                  <p>Let them not be diſtracted betwixt a ſenſible remembrance of the Joys and Glories of our exteriour Heaven above, and the preſent frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things below, but let them live an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and heavenly life upon Earth, exerciſing their Graces and Vertues in the uſe and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe lower earthly Objects, till I call
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55102:140"/>
them up again to Heaven, where, after this long ſwoond they are fallen into, they will more ſeaſonably remember their former Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſiacal ſtate upon its recovery, and reagnize their ancient home. Wherefore if the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring or forgetting of the former ſtate depend abſolutely upon the free contrivance of the Divine Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and Juſtice, as this ingenious Oppoſer ſeems to ſuppoſe, I ſhould even upon that very point of fitneſs conceive that an utter oblivion of the former ſtate is interwoven into the fate and nature of lapſed Souls by a Divine <hi>Nemeſis,</hi> though we do not conceive explicitely the manner how. And yet the natural reaſons the Author of <hi>Lux Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entalis</hi> produces in the ſequel of his Diſcourſe, ſeem highly probable.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, As we had forgot ſome lively Dream we dreamt but laſt night, unleſs we had met with ſomething in the day of a peculiar vertue to remind us of it, ſo we meeting with nothing in this lower ſtage of things that lively reſembles thoſe things in our former ſtate, and has a peculiar fitneſs to rub up our Memory, we continue in an utter oblivion of them. As ſuppoſe a man was lively entertain'd in his ſleep with the pleaſure of dreaming of a fair Cryſtal River, whoſe Banks were ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Trees and Flags in the flower, and thoſe large Flies with blue and golden-colour'd Bodies, and broad thin Wings curiouſly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55102:140"/>
wrought and tranſparent, hovering over them, with Birds alſo ſinging on the Trees, Sun and Clouds above, and ſweet breezes of Air, and Swans in the River with their wings ſometimes lifted up like ſails againſt the wind. Thus he paſſed the night, thinks of no ſuch thing in the morning, but riſing goes about his occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. But towards evening a Servant of a Friend of his preſents him with a couple of Swans from his Maſter. The ſight of which Swans ſtriking his <hi>Perceptive</hi> as ſenſibly as thoſe in his Dream, and being one of the moſt extraordinary and eximious Objects of his Night-viſion, preſently reminds him of the whole ſcene of things repreſented in his ſleep. But neither Sun, nor Clouds, nor Trees, nor any ſuch ordinary thing could in any likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood have reminded him of his Dream. And beſides, it was the lively reſemblance betwixt the Swans he ſaw in his ſleep, and thoſe he ſaw waking, that did ſo effectually rub up his memory. The want therefore of ſuch occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in this life to remind us of the paſſages of the former, is a very reaſonable account why we remember nothing of the former ſtate.</p>
                  <p>But here the Oppoſers of Pre-exiſtence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that the joyous and glorious Objects in the other ſtate do ſo pierce and tranſport the Soul, and that ſhe was inured to them ſo long, that though there were nothing that reſembled
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55102:141"/>
them here, the impreſſion they make muſt be indelible, and that it is impoſſible ſhe ſhould forget them. And moreover, that there is a ſimilitude betwixt the things of the upper World and the lower, which therefore muſt be an help to memory.</p>
                  <p>But here, as touching the firſt, they do not conſider what a Weapon they have given into my hand againſt themſelves. For the long inuredneſs to thoſe Celeſtial Objects abates the piercingneſs of their tranſport; and before they leave thoſe Regions, according to the <hi>Platonick</hi> or <hi>Origenian</hi> Hypotheſis, they grow cooler to ſuch enjoyments: ſo that all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of that piercing tranſport for memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, are loſt. And beſides, in vertue of that piercing Tranſport, no Soul can call into me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory what ſhe enjoyed formerly, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling herſelf into ſuch a Tranſport, which her Terreſtrial Vehicle makes her uncapable of.</p>
                  <p>For the memory of external Tranſactions is ſealed upon us by ſome paſſionate corporeal impreſs in conjunction with them (which makes them whip Boys ſometimes at the boundaries of their Pariſh, that they may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remember it when they are old men;) which Impreſs if it be loſt, the memory of the thing it ſelf is loſt. And we may be ſure it is loſt in Souls incorporate in Terreſtrial Vehicles, they having loſt their Aereal and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55102:141"/>
Celeſtial, and being fatally incapacitated ſo much as to conceit how they were affected by the External Objects of the other World, and ſo to remember how they felt them. And therefore all the deſcriptions that men of a more Aethereal and Entheous temper adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on in this life, are but the Roamings of their Minds in vertue of their Conſtitution to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the nature of the heavenly things in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, not a recovery of the memory of paſt Experience; this State not affording ſo lively a repreſentment of the <hi>Pathos</hi> that accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the actual <hi>ſenſe</hi> of thoſe things, as to make us <hi>think</hi> that we once <hi>really</hi> enjoyed them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. That is onely to be collected by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; the noble exerciſe of which faculty, in the diſcovering of this <hi>Arcanum</hi> of our Pre-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, had been loſt, if it could have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by a compendious Memory. But if ever we recover the memory of our former State, it will be when we are re-entred into it; we then being in a capacity of being really ſtruck with the ſame Pathos we were before, in vertue whereof the Soul may remember this was her priſtine condition.</p>
                  <p>And therefore to anſwer to the ſecond, Though there may be ſome faintneſs of reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance betwixt the things of the other State and this, yet other peculiarities alſo being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and the former ſenſible Pathos to be recovered, which is impoſſible in this State, it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55102:142"/>
is likewiſe impoſſible for us to remember the other in this.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Argument of the Author for the proving the unlikelineſs of our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the other State is, the <hi>long intermiſſion</hi> and <hi>diſcontinuance from thinking of thoſe things.</hi> For 'tis plain that ſuch diſcontinuance or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetude bereaves us of the memory of ſuch things as we were acquainted with in this World. Inſomuch as if an ancient man ſhould read the Verſes or Themes he made when he was a School-boy, without his name ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to them, though he pumpt and ſweat for them when he made them, could not tell they were his own. How then ſhould the Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what ſhe did or obſerv'd many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, nay thouſands of years ago?</p>
                  <p>But yet our Authors Antagoniſt has the face to make nothing of this Argument nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Becauſe, forſooth, it is not ſo much the deſuetude of thinking of one thing, but the thinking of others, that makes us forget that one thing. What a ſhuffle is this! For if the Soul thought on that one thing as well as on other things, it would remember it as well as them. Therefore it is not the thinking of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, but the not thinking of <hi>that,</hi> that makes it forgotten. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſus promptus facit,</hi> as in general, ſo in particular. And therefore diſuſe in any particular ſlackens at firſt, and after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhes the readineſs of the Mind to think
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55102:142"/>
thereof. Whence ſleepineſs and ſluggiſhneſs is the Mother of Forgetfulneſs, becauſe it diſuſes the Soul from thinking of things. And as for thoſe ſeven Chronical Sleepers that ſlept in a Cave from <hi>Decius</hi> his time to the reign of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſius junior,</hi> I dare ſay it would have beſotted them without a Miracle, and they would have roſe out of their ſleep no more wiſe than a Wiſp; I am ſure not altogether ſo wiſe as this awkward Arguer for memory of Souls in their Pre-exiſtent ſtate after ſo hugely long a diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance from it. But for their immediately coming out of an Aethereal Vehicle into a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial, and yet forgetting their former ſtate, what Example can be imagined of ſuch a thing, unleſs that of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who yet ſeems to remember his former glorious condition, and to pray that he may return to it again? Though, for my part I think it was rather Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſpiration than Memory, that enabled him to know that matter, ſuppoſing his Soul did pre-exiſt.</p>
                  <p>Our Authors third and laſt Argument to prove that lapſed Souls in their Terreſtrial condition forget their former ſtate, is from obſervation how deteriorating changes in this earthly Body ſpoils or quite deſtroys the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, the Soul ſtill abiding therein; ſuch as Caſualties, Diſeaſes, and old Age, which chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the tenour of the Spirits, and makes them leſs uſeful for memory, as alſo 'tis likely the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55102:143"/>
Brain it ſelf. Wherefore there being a more deteriorating change to the Soul in coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an earthly Body, inſtead of an aereal or ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereal, the more certainly will her memory of things which ſhe experienced in that ſtate, be waſhed out or obliterated in this.</p>
                  <p>Here our Authors Antagoniſt anſwers, That though changes <hi>in body</hi> may often weaken, and ſometimes utterly ſpoil the memory of things paſt, yet it is not neceſſary that the Souls changing <hi>of her body</hi> ſhould therefore do ſo, becauſe it is not ſo injurious to her facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Which if it were, not onely our <hi>Memory,</hi> but <hi>Reaſon</hi> alſo ſhould have been caſheered and loſt by our migration out of thoſe Vehicles we formerly actuated, into theſe we now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven; but that ſtill remaining ſound and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, it is a ſigne that our Memory would do ſo too, if we had pre-exiſted in other bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and had any thing to remember. And beſides, if the bare tranſlocation of our Souls out of one body into another, would deſtroy the memory of things the Soul has experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, it would follow, that when People by death are ſummoned hence into the other ſtate, that they ſhall be quite bereaved of their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and ſo carry neither applauſe nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of Conſcience into the other World; which is monſtrouſly abſurd and impious. This is the main of his Anſwer, and moſtwhat in his own words. But of what ſmall force it is, we ſhall now diſcover, and how little perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:55102:143"/>
For firſt, we are to take notice that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorating change in the Body, or deteriora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſtate by change of Bodies, is underſtood of a debilitative, diminutive, or privative, not depravative deterioration; the latter of which may be more injurious to the faculties of the Soul, though in the ſame Body, ſuch a deterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating change cauſing Phrenſies and outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Madneſs. But as for diminutive or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative deterioration by change, the Soul by changing her Aereal Vehicle for a Terreſtrial, is (comparing her latter ſtate with her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) much injured in her faculties or opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them; all of them are more ſlow and ſtupid, and their aptitude to exert the ſame Phantaſms of things that occurred to them in the other State, quite taken away, by reaſon of the heavy and dull, though orderly conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Terreſtrial Tenement; which weight and ſtupor utterly indiſpoſes the Soul to recall into her mind the ſcene of her former ſtate, this load perpetually ſwaying down her thoughts to the Objects of this.</p>
                  <p>Nor does it at all follow, becauſe Reaſon is not loſt, therefore Memory, if there were any ſuch thing as Pre-exiſtence, would ſtill abide. For the univerſal principles of Reaſon and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality are eſſential to the Soul, and cannot be obliterated, no not by any death: but the knowledge of any particular external Objects is not at all eſſential to the Soul, nor conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55102:144"/>
the memory of them; and therefore the Soul in the ſtate of ſilence being ſtript of them, cannot recover them in her incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a Terreſtrial Body. But her Reaſon, with the general principles thereof, being eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to her, ſhe can, as well as this State will permit, exerciſe them upon the Objects of this Scene of the Earth and viſible World, ſo far as it is diſcovered by her outward ſenſes, ſhe loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out at thoſe windows of this her earthly Priſon, to contemplate them. And ſhe has the faculty and exerciſe of <hi>Memory</hi> ſtill, in ſuch a ſenſe as ſhe has of <hi>ſenſitive</hi> Perception, whoſe Objects ſhe does remember, being yet to all former impreſſes in the other ſtate a mere <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braſa Tabula.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And laſtly, it is a mere miſtake of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer, or worſe, that he makes the <hi>Pre-exiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries</hi> to impute the loſs of memory in Souls of their former ſtate, merely to their coming into other Bodies; when it is not bare change of Bodies, but their deſcent into worſer Bodies more dull and obſtupifying, to which they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute this loſs of memory in lapſed Souls. This is a real death to them, according to that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Aenigm of that abſtruſe Sage, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>We live their death,</hi> namely of ſeparate Souls, <hi>but are dead to their life.</hi> But the changing of our Earthly Body for an Aereal or Aethereal, this is not <hi>Death,</hi> but <hi>Reviviſcency,</hi> in which all the ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55102:144"/>
of the Soul are (not depreſſed, but) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, and our Memory with the reſt quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as it was in <hi>Eſdras</hi> after he had drunk down that Cup offered to him by the Angel, full of Liquor like Fire, which filled his Heart with Underſtanding, and ſtrengthned his Memory, as the Text ſays.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee how all Objections againſt the three Reaſons of lapſed Souls loſing the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the things of the other ſtate, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh into ſmoak. Wherefore they every one of them ſingle being ſo ſound, all three put together methinks ſhould not fail of convincing the moſt refractory of this Truth, That though the Soul did pre-exiſt and act in another ſtate, yet ſhe may utterly forget all the Scenes thereof in this.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 46. <hi>Now if the reaſons why we loſe the remembrance of our former life be greater,</hi> &amp;c. And that they are ſo, does appear in our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Objections made againſt the ſaid Reaſons, if the Reader will conſider them.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 50. <hi>And thereby have removed all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,</hi> &amp;c. But there is yet one Reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Pre-exiſtence which the ingenious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor never thought of, urged by the <hi>Anti-Pre-exiſtentiaries,</hi> namely, That it implies the reſt of the Planets peopled with Mankind, it being unreaſonable to think that all Souls deſcended in their lapſe to this onely Earth of Ours. And if there be lapſed Souls there, how ſhall they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55102:145"/>
be recovered? ſhall Chriſt undergo another and another death for them? But I believe the ingenious Author would have looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this but as a mean and trifling Argument, there being no force in any part thereof. For why may not this Earth be the onely Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, <hi>Noſocomium</hi> or <hi>Coemeterium,</hi> ſpeaking Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonically, of ſinfully lapſed Souls? And then ſuppoſe others lapſed in other Planets, what need Chriſt die again for them, when one drop of his Bloud is ſufficient to ſave myriads of Worlds? Whence it may ſeem a pity there is not more Worlds than this Earth to be redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by it. Nor is it neceſſary they ſhould hiſtorically know it. And if it be, the Eclipſe of the Sun at his Paſſion by ſome inſpired Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets might give them notice of it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to them as orderly an account of the <hi>Redemption,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> does of the <hi>Creation,</hi> though he ſtood not by while the World was framed, but it was revealed to him by God. And laſtly, it is but a raſh and precarious Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, to ſay that the infinite Wiſdom of God has no more ways than one to ſave lapſed Souls. It is ſufficient that we are aſſured that this is the onely way for the ſaving of the Sons of <hi>Adam;</hi> and theſe are the fixt bounds of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Truth in the Holy Scripture which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to us Inhabitants on Earth. But as for the Oeconomy of his infinite Wiſdom in the other Planets, if we did but reflect upon
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55102:145"/>
our abſolute ignorance thereof, we would have the diſcretion not to touch upon that Topick, unleſs we intended to make our ſelves ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, while we endeavour to make others ſo.</p>
                  <p>Chap. 6. pag. 51. <hi>Now as the infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Deity obligeth him always to do good, ſo by the ſame to do that which is beſt,</hi> &amp;c. To elude the force of this chief Argument of the <hi>Pre-exiſtentiaries,</hi> an ingenious Oppoſer has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed a way which ſeems worth our conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is this; <hi>viz.</hi> By making the Idea of God to conſiſt mainly in Dominion and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, the Scriptures repreſenting him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no other notion than as the Supream Lord and Soveraign of the Univerſe. Wherefore nothing is to be attributed to him that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feres with the uncontroulableneſs of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And therefore, ſays he, they that aſſert Goodneſs to be a neceſſary Agent that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but do that which is beſt, directly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant and deſtroy all the Rights of his Power and Dominion. Nay, he adds afterwards, That this notion of Gods goodneſs is moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently inconſiſtent, not onely with his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Dominion, but with all his other moral Perfections. And for a further explication of his mind in this matter, he adds afterwards, <hi>That the Divine Will is indued with the highest kind of liberty, as it imports a freedom not onely
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55102:146"/>
from foreign Violence, but alſo from inward Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity: For ſpontaneity, or immunity from coacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without indifferency, carries in it as great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity as thoſe motions that proceed from Violence or Mechaniſm.</hi> From whence he concludes, <hi>That the Divine Will cannot otherwiſe be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined than by its own intrinſick energie.</hi> And laſtly, Foraſmuch as no Courtiſie can oblige, but what is received from one that had a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er not to beſtow them, if God neceſſarily acted according to his Goodneſs, and not out of mere choice and liberty of Will, there were no thanks nor praiſe due to him; which therefore would take away the duties of Religion. This is the main of his Hypotheſis, whereby he would defeat the force of this Argument for the Pre-exiſtence of Souls, taken from the Goodneſs of God. Which this Hypotheſis certainly would do, if it were true; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will briefly examine it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore I anſwer, That though the Scriptures do frequently repreſent God as the Lord and Soveraign of the Univerſe, yet it does not conceal his other Attributes of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Mercy, and the like. But that the former ſhould be ſo much inculcated, is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the begetting in the People Awe and Obedience to him. But it is an invalid conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to draw from hence that the Idea of God does mainly conſiſt in Dominion and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty; which abſtracted from his other
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55102:146"/>
Attributes of Wiſdom and Goodneſs, would be a very black and dark repreſentation of him, and ſuch as this ingenious Writer could not himſelf contemplate without averſation and horror. How then can the Idea of God chiefly conſiſt in this? It is the moſt terrifying indeed, but not the moſt noble and accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing part in the Idea of the Deity.</p>
                  <p>This Soveraignty then is ſuch as is either bounded or not bounded by any other Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God. If bounded by none, then he may do as well unwiſely as wiſely, unjuſtly as juſtly. If bounded by Wiſdom and Juſtice, why is it bounded by them, but that it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo to be than otherwiſe? And Goodneſs being as eſſential to God as Wiſdom and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, why may not his Soveraignty be boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by that as well as by the other, and ſo he be bound from himſelf of himſelf to do as well what is beſt as what is better. This conſiſts with his abſolute Soveraignty, as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And indeed what can be abſolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty in an intelligent Being, if this be not? <hi>viz.</hi> fully and entirely to follow the will and inclinations of its own nature, without any check or controul of any one touching thoſe over whom he rules.</p>
                  <p>Whence, in the ſecond place, it appears that the aſſerting that Gods goodneſs is a neceſſary Agent (in ſuch a ſenſe as Gods Wiſdom and Juſtice are, which can do nothing but what is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55102:147"/>
wiſe and juſt) the aſſerting, I ſay, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but do that which is the <hi>best,</hi> does nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directly nor indirectly ſupplant or deſtroy any Rights of his Power or Dominion, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he does fully and plenarily act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own inclinations and will touching thoſe that are under his Dominion. But that his Will is always inclined or determined to what is beſt, it is the Prerogative of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature to have no other Wills nor Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations but ſuch.</p>
                  <p>And as for that in the third place, That this notion of Gods Goodneſs is inconſiſtent with all his other moral Perfections, I ſay, that it is ſo far from being inconſiſtent with them, that they cannot ſubſiſt without it, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the dealings of God with his Creatures. For what a kind of Wiſdom or Juſtice would that be that tended to no good? But I ſuſpect his meaning is by <hi>moral</hi> Perfections, Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that imply ſuch a power of doing or not doing, as is in <hi>humane</hi> actions; which if it be not allowed in God, his Perfections are not <hi>moral.</hi> And what great matter is it if they be not, provided they be as they are and ought to be, <hi>Divine?</hi> But to fancy <hi>moral</hi> actions in God, is to admit a ſecond kind of <hi>Anthropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphitiſm,</hi> and to have unworthy conceits of the Divine Nature. When it was juſt and wiſe for God to do ſo or ſo, and the contrary to do otherwiſe, had he a freedom to decline
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55102:147"/>
the doing ſo? Then he had a freedom to do unjuſtly and unwiſely.</p>
                  <p>And yet in the fourth place he contends for the higheſt kind of liberty in the Divine Will, ſuch as imports a freedom not onely from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Violence, but alſo from inward Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as if the Divine Will could be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe determined, than by its own intrinſick Energie, as if it willed ſo becauſe it willed ſo; which is a ſad principle. And yet I believe this learned Writer will not ſtick to ſay, that God cannot tye, cannot condemn myriads of innocent Souls to eternal Torments. And what difference betwixt <hi>Impoſſibility</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity?</hi> For Impoſſibility it ſelf is onely a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of not doing; which is here internal, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the excellency and abſolute perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Divine Nature. Which is nothing like Mechaniſm for all that; Foraſmuch as it is from a clear underſtanding of what is beſt, and an unbyaſſed Will, which will moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly follow it, nor is determined by its own intrinſick Energy. That it is otherwiſe with us, is our imperfection.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, That Beneficence does not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige the Receiver of it to either Praiſe or Thankſgiving when it is received from one that is ſo eſſentially good, and conſtantly acts according to that principle, when due occaſion is offered, as if it were as abſurd as to give thanks to the Sun for ſhining when he can do
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55102:148"/>
no otherwiſe; I ſay, the caſe is not alike, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Sun is an inanimate Being, and has neither Underſtanding nor Will to approve his own action in the exerting of it. And he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a Creature, if his ſhining depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Will, it is a greater perfection than we can be aſſured would belong to him, that he would unfailingly adminiſter Light to the World with ſuch a ſteadineſs of Will, as God ſuſtains the Creation.</p>
                  <p>Undoubtedly all Thanks and Praiſe is due to God from us, although he be ſo neceſſarily good, that he could not but create us and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for us; foraſmuch as he has done this for our ſakes merely (he wanting nothing) not for his own. Suppoſe a rich Chriſtian ſo inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the works of Charity, that the Poor were as certain of getting an Alms from him, as a Traveller is to quench his thirſt at a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Spring near the Highway; would thoſe that received Alms from him think themſelves not obliged to Thanks? It may be you will ſay, they will thank him, that they may not forfeit his Favour another time. Which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer diſcovers the ſpring of this Miſconceit, which ſeems founded in ſelf-love, as if all Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were to be reſolved into that, and as if there were nothing owing to another, but what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied our own profit. But though the Divine Goodneſs acts neceſſarily yet it does not blindly, but according to the Laws of Decorum
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55102:148"/>
and Juſtice; which thoſe that are unthankful to the Deity, may find the ſmart of. But I cannot believe the ingenious Writer much in earneſt in theſe points, he ſo expreſly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what methinks is not well conſiſtent with them. For his very words are theſe: <hi>God can never act contrary to his neceſſary and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial properties, as becauſe he is eſſentially wiſe, just and holy, he can do nothing that is fooliſh, unjuſt, and wicked.</hi> Here therefore I demand, Are we not to thank him and praiſe him for his actions of Wiſdom, Juſtice, and Holineſs, though they be neceſſary?</p>
                  <p>And if <hi>Juſtice, Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> be the <hi>eſſential</hi> properties of God, according to which he does neceſſarily act and abſtain from acting, why is not his <hi>Goodneſs?</hi> when it is expreſly ſaid by the Wiſdom of God incarnate, <hi>None is good ſave one, that is God.</hi> Which muſt needs be underſtood of his eſſential Goodneſs. Which therefore being an eſſential property as well as the reſt, he muſt neceſſarily act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it. And when he acts in the Scheme of Anger and Severity, it is in the behalf of Goodneſs; and when he imparts his Goodneſs in leſſer meaſures as well as in greater, it is for the good of the <hi>Whole,</hi> or of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe.</hi> If all were Eye, where were the Hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Apoſtle argues? So that his Wiſdom mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates the prompt outflowings of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that it may not outflow ſo, but that in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55102:149"/>
the general it is for the beſt. And therefore it will follow, that if the Pre-exiſtence of Souls comply with the <hi>Wiſdom, Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> of God, that none of theſe reſtrain his prompt and parturient Goodneſs, that it muſt have cauſed humane Souls to pre-exiſt or exiſt ſo ſoon as the Spirits of Angels did. And he muſt have a ſtrange quick-ſightedneſs that can diſcern any claſhing of that act of Goodneſs with any of the aboveſaid Attributes.</p>
                  <p>Chap. 7. pag. 56. <hi>God never acts by mere Will or groundleſs Humour,</hi> &amp;c. We men have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable inclinations in our irregular and depraved Compoſition, have blind luſts or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to do this or that, and it is our preſent eaſe and pleaſure to fulfil them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we fancy it a priviledge to be able to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute theſe blind inclinations of which we can give no rational account, but that we are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by fulfilling them. But it is againſt the Purity, Sanctity, and Perfection of the Divine Nature, to conceive any ſuch thing in Him; and therefore a weakneſs in our Judgments to fancy ſo of him, like that of the <hi>Anthropomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites,</hi> that imagined God to be of Humane ſhape.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 59. <hi>That God made all things for himſelf.</hi> It is ignorance and ill nature that has made ſome men abuſe this Text to the proving that God acts out of either an humourous or ſelfiſh

principle, as if he did things merely to pleaſe himſelf as ſelf, not as he is that ſoveraign <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf-inrereſſed Goodneſs,</hi> and perfect <hi>Rectitude,</hi> which ought to be the meaſure of all things. But the Text implies no ſuch matter: For if you make <gap reason="foreign">

For from hence his Goodneſs is ſo ſtinted or modified, that though he has made all things for his own Will and Pleaſure who is infinite Goodneſs and Benignity, yet there is a day of Evil for the Wicked, as it follows in the Text, becauſe they have not walked anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the Goodneſs that God has offered them; and therefore their puniſhment is in behalf of abuſed Goodneſs. And <hi>Bayns</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly interprets this Text thus: <hi>

[for them that anſwer him] that is, walk an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably to his Goodneſs which he affords them, or [for them that obey him] either way it is very good ſence. And then in oppoſition to theſe, it is declared, that the Wicked, that is, the Diſobedient or Deſpiſers of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he has (not made them wicked, but they having made themſelves ſo) appointed them for the day of Evil. For ſome ſuch Verb is to be ſupplied as is agreeable to the matter, as in that paſſage in the Pſalms; <hi>The Sun ſhall not burn thee by day, neither the Moon by night.</hi> Where [burn] cannot be repeated, but ſome other more ſuitable Verb is to be ſupplied.</p>

Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conſtitutes his very Deity, making him to be himſelf: for could he be arayed with all his other Attributes ſeparate and abſtract from this, they would be ſo far from denominating him a God, that he would be but a prodigious Fiend, and ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiary Devil.</hi> This is ſomething a rude and uncourtly Aſſeveration, and unluckly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion of the Godhead into two parts, and calling one part a Devil. But it is not to be

Which is manifeſtly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict what he ſaid before, That Goodneſs is the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of Gods perfect Eſſence. For thus <hi>Will</hi> muſt have a <hi>Supremacy</hi> over the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55102:153"/>
                     <hi>Head</hi> of the Deity. So that there will be an Head over an Head, to make the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head a Monſter. And what is moſt inſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of all, That he has choſen an Head out of the <hi>Devil-part</hi> of the Deity, to uſe his own rude expreſſion, to controul and <hi>lord</hi> it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver what is the <hi>onely God himſelf,</hi> the reſt a Fiend ſeparate from this, according to his own acknowledgment. Theſe things are ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely abſurd, that one would think that he could have no heart to go about to prove them; and yet he adventures on it, and we ſhall briefly propoſe and anſwer what he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth.</p>
                  <p>And this Supremacy of the <hi>Will,</hi> ſaith he, over the Goodneſs of the Divine Nature, may be made out both by Scripture and other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Evidences. The Scriptures are three; the firſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135. 6. <hi>Whatſoever the Lord pleaſed, that did he in heaven, and in the earth, and in the ſeas, and in all deep places.</hi> Now if we remember but who this Lord is, <hi>viz.</hi> he whom Goodneſs makes to be himſelf, we may eaſily be aſſured what pleaſed him, namely, that which his Wiſdom diſcerned to be the beſt to be done; and therefore it is very right, that whatſoever he pleaſed he ſhould do through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Univerſe. The ſecond place is <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 15. <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?</hi> Yes I trow, every one muſt acknowledge that God has an <gap reason="foreign">

But this does not prove that he ever diſpoſes of any thing otherwiſe than according to his Wiſdom and Goodneſs. If his Goodneſs be ever limited, it is limited by his Wiſdom, but ſo then as diſcerning ſuch a limitation to be for the beſt. So that the meaſure of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms determination is ſtill Goodneſs, the only Head in the Divine Nature, to which all the reſt is ſubordinate. For that there are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent degrees of the Communication of the Divine Goodneſs in the Univerſe, is for the good of the Whole. It is ſufficient to hint theſe things; it would require a Volume to enlarge upon them. And then for the laſt place, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 19. <hi>I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious.</hi> This onely implies that he does <hi>pro ſuo jure,</hi> and without any motive from any one but himſelf, communicate more of his Goodneſs to ſome Men or Nations than others. But that his Wiſdom has not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered this to be beſt for the whole conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things, I challenge any one to prove. But of this we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more afterward. Theſe are the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>The other forcible Evidences are theſe: The firſt, The late Production of the World. The ſecond, The patefaction of the Law but to one ſingle People, namely, the Jews. The third,

The timing the <hi>Meſſias</hi>'s Nativity, and bringing it to paſs, not in the Worlds Infancy or Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcence, but <gap reason="foreign">

Theſe he pretends to be forcible Evidences of the Soveraignty of Gods Will over his Goodneſs, foraſmuch as if the contrary to all theſe had been, it had been much more agreeable to the Goodneſs of God.</p>
                  <p>As for the firſt of theſe forcible Arguments, we have diſarmed the ſtrength thereof alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by intimating that the World could not be <hi>ab oeterno.</hi> And if it could not be <hi>ab oeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> but muſt commence on this ſide of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and be of finite years, I leave to the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer to prove that it has not been created as ſoon as it could be; and that is ſufficient to prove that its late Production is not inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with that principle, that Gods Goodneſs always is the meaſure of his Actions. For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the World of as little continuance as you will, if it was not <hi>ab oeterno,</hi> it was once of as little; and how can we diſcern but that this is that very time which ſeems ſo little to us?</p>

As for the ſecond, which ſeems to have ſuch force in it, that he appeals to any competent Judge, if it had not been infinitely better that God ſhould have apertly diſpenſed his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to all Mankind, than have committed them onely to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in ſo private and clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular a manner; I ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is impoſſible for any one to be aſſured that it is at all better. For firſt, If this Priviledge which was peculiar, had been a Favour common to all, it had loſt its enforcement that it had upon that leſſer num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.

Fifthly, Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great load of the Ceremonial Law
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55102:155"/>
which came along with other more proper Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Jews, ſetting one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and conſidering the freedom of other Nations from it, unleſs they brought any thing like it upon themſelves, the difference of their Conditions will rather ſeem ſeveral Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the communicated Goodneſs of God to his Creatures, than the neglecting of any: Foraſmuch as, ſixthly and laſtly, though all Nations be in a lapſed condition, yet there are the Reliques of the Eternal Law of Life in them. And that things are no better with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them than they are, that is a thouſand times more rationally reſolved into their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits in their pre-exiſtent ſtate than into the bare Will of God, that he will have things for many Ages thus ſqualid and forlorn, merely becauſe he will.

Wherefore we ſee from theſe few ſmall hints, (for it were an infinite Argument fully to proſecute) how feeble or nothing forcible this ſecond Evidence is.</p>
                  <p>Now for the third Evidence, The timing of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s Nativity, That it was not in the Infancy of the World, but rather in its decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Age, or in the latter times. In which
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55102:156"/>
times the <hi>Ancient</hi> of Days, according to his counſel and purpoſe, (which the Eternal <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> that was to be incarnate aſſented and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to) ſent his Son into the World, the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> This did the <hi>Ancient</hi> of Days and the Eternal <hi>Wiſdom</hi> agree upon. But oh the immenſe Priviledge of <hi>Youth</hi> and Confidence! The Author of <hi>No-Pre-exiſtence</hi> ſays, it had been better by far, if they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon the Infancy of the World. As if this <hi>young</hi> Divine were wiſer than the <hi>Ancient</hi> of <hi>Days,</hi> or the <hi>Eternal Wiſdom</hi> itſelf. I, but he will modeſtly reply, That he acknowledges that the Ancient of Days and the Eternal Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are wiſer than he, but that they would not make uſe of their Wiſdom. They ſaw as clearly as could be, that it was far better that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come in the Infancy of the World; but the Father would not ſend him then, merely becauſe he would not ſend him: That his <hi>Will</hi> might act freely as <hi>mere Will</hi> preſcinded from Wiſdom and Goodneſs. This is the plain ſtate of the buſineſs, and yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by him, who with that open freeneſs and fulneſs profeſſes, that preſcind the Divine Goodneſs from the Godhead, what remains is a prodigious Fiend or Devil. What is then: mere <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> left alone, but a blind <hi>Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane</hi> of <hi>Hell?</hi> which yet muſt have the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, and over-power the Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs itſelf. His Zeal againſt Pre-exiſtence
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55102:157"/>
has thus infatuated and blinded this young Writers Intellectuals, otherwiſe he had not been driven to theſe Abſurdities, if he had been pleaſed to admit that Hypotheſis.</p>
                  <p>As alſo that Wiſdom and Juſtice, and Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Decorum attend the Diſpenſation of Divine Goodneſs; ſo that it is not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to every Subject after the moſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple manner, nor at every time, but at ſuch times, and to ſuch Subjects, and in ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures as, reſpecting the whole compages of things, is for the beſt. So that Goodneſs bears the Soveraignty, and according to that Rule, perpetually all things are adminiſtred, though there be a different Scene of things and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars in themſelves vaſtly varying in Goodneſs and Perfection one from another as the parts of the Body do. And ſo for Times and Ages, every ſeaſon of the year yield diſſerent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities: nor are we to expect Roſes in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor Apples and Apricocks in Spring. Now the infinite and incomprehenſible Wiſdom of God comprehending the whole entire Scene of his Providence, and what references there are of one thing to another, that this muſt be thus and thus, becauſe ſuch and ſuch things prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and becauſe ſuch things are, ſuch and ſuch muſt be conſequent; which things paſt and to come lie not under our eye: I ſay, if this haſty Writer had conſidered this, he need not have been driven to ſuch a rude ſolution of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55102:157"/>
this preſent Problem, why the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> came no ſooner into the World, <hi>viz.</hi> Merely becauſe God willed it ſhould be ſo, though it had been far better if it had been otherwiſe; but he would have roundly confeſſed, that undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this was the beſt time and the fitteſt, though it was paſt his reach to diſcover the reaſons of the fitneſs thereof.</p>
                  <p>This as it had been the more modeſt, ſo it had been the more ſolid ſolution of this hard Problem. I but then it had not put a bar to this irrefragable Argument from the Goodneſs of God, for proving Pre-exiſtence: Which he is perſwaded in his own Conſcience is no leſs than a demonſtration, unleſs it be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that the <hi>Will</hi> of God has a <hi>Supremacy</hi> over his Goodneſs; and therefore in ſpight to that abhorred Dogma of Pre-exiſtence, he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther broach ſuch wild ſtuff againſt the glory of God, than not to purchaſe to himſelf the ſweet conceit of a glorious victory over ſuch an Opinion that he has taken a groundleſs toy againſt, and had rather adventure upon groſs Blaſphemies than entertain it.</p>
                  <p>The devout Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. ſpeaking of the Decrees of God and his Providence over the Creation, <hi>Thy righteouſneſs,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is as the great mountains, thy judgments are a great deep.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 11. after he has treated of intricate and amazing points, cries out, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55102:158"/>
and knowledge of God! How unſearchable are his judgments, and his ways paſt finding out!</hi> Now according to the rudeneſs of our young Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there is no ſuch depth of Wiſdom, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchableneſs in the Judgments and Decrees of God and his Providences in the World that moſt amaze us, but the reaſons of them lie ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obvious and ſhallow. Where we fancy that things might have been better otherwiſe, (though of never ſo grand import, as the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is) it is eaſily reſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the <hi>Will</hi> of God, which it has over his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs.</hi> He willed it ſhould be ſo, becauſe he would it ſhould be ſo, though it had been ſar better if the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> had come ſooner. But ſee the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt an inſpired Apoſtle, and a young hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed Theologiſt: This latter reſolves theſe unſearchable and unintelligible Decrees of God and paſſages of Providence, into the mere <hi>Will</hi> of God, <hi>lording</hi> it over the <hi>Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs:</hi> But the Apoſtle, by how much more unſearchable his Judgments and Decrees are, and the ways of his Providence paſt fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out, the greater he declares the depth of the richneſs of his Wiſdom, which is ſo ample, that it reaches into ways and methods of doing for the beſt beyond the Underſtandings of men. For moſt aſſuredly, while the depth of the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God is acknowledged to carry on the ways of Providence, it muſt be alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55102:158"/>
that it acts like itſelf, and chuſeth ſuch ways as are beſt, and moſt comporting with the Divine Goodneſs; or elſe it is not an act of Wiſdom, but of Humour or Overſight.</p>
                  <p>But it may be the Reader may have the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to hear briefly what thoſe great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are, that ſhould induce this young Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo confidently to pronounce, that it had been far better that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould have come in the Infancy of the World, than in the times he came. The very quinteſſence of the force of his arguing extracted out of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſity of his affected ſtyle, is neither more nor leſs than this: That the World be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ore the coming of Chriſt, who was to be the Light of the World, was in very great Darkneſs; and therefore the ſooner he came, the better. But to break the aſſurance of this Arguer for the more early coming o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Chriſt,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, we may take notice out of himſelf, chap. 3. <hi>That the Light of Nature is near akin not onely to the</hi> Moſaick <hi>Law, but to the Goſpel itſelf; and that even then there were the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Holy Ghoſt to carry men on to ſuch vertuous Accompliſhments as might avail them to eternal Salvation.</hi> This he acknowledges pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, and I have ſet it down in his own words. Whence conſidering what a various Scene of things there was to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rom the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> to the end of the World, it became the great and wiſe <hi>Dramatiſt</hi> not to bring upon the Stage
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55102:159"/>
the beſt things in the firſt Act, but to carry on things pompouſly and by degrees; ſomething like that Saying of <hi>Elias,</hi> Two thouſand years under the Light of Nature, two thouſand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, and then comes the Nativity of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and after a due ſpace the happy Millennium, and then the Final Judgment, the compleated Happineſs of the Righteous in Heaven, and the Puniſhment of the Wicked in Hell-fire. But to haſten too ſuddenly to the beſt, is to expect Autumn in Spring, and Virility or Old Age in Infancy or Childhood, or the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> of a Comedy in the firſt Act.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we may obſerve what a weak Diſprover he is of Pre-exiſtence, which like a Gyant would break in upon him, were it not that he kept him out by this falſe Sconce of the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the Divine <hi>Will</hi> over his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs;</hi> which Conceit, how odious and impious it is, has been often enough hinted already. But letting Pre-exiſtence take place, and admitting that there is, according to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, an orderly inſemination of lapſed Souls into humane Bodies, through the ſeveral Ages of the World, whoſe lapſes had ſeveral circumſtantial differences, and that men therefore become differently fitted Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Grace and Favour; how eaſie is it to conceive God according to the fitneſſes of the generality of Souls in ſuch or ſuch periods of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55102:159"/>
times, as it was more juſt, agreeable, or need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them, ſo and in ſuch meaſures to have diſpenſed the Gifts of his ever-watchful and all-comprehending Providence to them, for both time and place. This one would think were more tolerable than to ſay, That God wills merely becauſe he wills; which is the Character of a frail Woman, rather than of a God, or elſe, as this Writer himſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, of a Fiend or Devil. For ſuch, ſays he, is God in the reſt of his Attributes, if you ſeclude his Goodneſs. What then is that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which proceeds onely from that part from which Goodneſs is ſecluded? So that himſelf has dug down the Sconce he would entrench himſelf in, and lets <hi>Pre-exiſtence</hi> come in upon him, whether he will or no, like an armed Giant; whom let him abhor as much as he will, he is utterly unable to reſiſt.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly and laſtly, Suppoſe there were no particular probable account to be given by us, by reaſon of the ſhortneſs of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and the vaſt fetches of the all-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Providence of God, why the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was no earlier than it was; yet according to that excellent Aphoriſm in Morality and Politicks, <hi>Optimè praeſumendum est de Magiſtratu,</hi> we ſhould hope, nay be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured it was the beſt that he came when he did, it being by the appointment of the infinite good and all-wiſe God, and cry out with St.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55102:160"/>
                     <hi>Paul, Oh the depth of the riches of both the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledge of God! How unſearchable are his judgments, and his ways paſt finding out!</hi> And in the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Thy judgments are like a great deep, O Lord, thou preſerveſt man and, beaſt.</hi> And ſo acknowledge his Wiſdom and Goodneſs in the ordering his Creatures, even there where his ways are to our weak and ſcant Underſtandings moſt inexplicable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable. Which Wiſdom and Goodneſs as we have all reaſon to acknowledge in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſo moſt of all in matters of the greateſt concernment, that there moſt aſſuredly God wills not thus or thus merely becauſe he wills, but becauſe his Wiſdom diſcerns that it is for the beſt. And this is ſufficient to ſhew the weakneſs of this third Evidence for proving the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the Divine <hi>Will</hi> over his <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His fourth Evidence is, <hi>The Perpetuity of Hell,</hi> and interminableneſs of thoſe Tortures which after this life vex the Wicked. For, ſays he, had the penalties of mens ſins here been rated by <hi>pure</hi> Goodneſs, free and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled by any other principle, it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that they ſhould have been puniſhed by an eternal Calamity, the pleaſures of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo tranſient and fugitive. Thus he argues, and almoſt in the very ſame words; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concludes, that the authority of Gods <hi>Will</hi> interpoſed, and <hi>pro ſuo jure,</hi> having the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55102:160"/>
                     <hi>Supremacy</hi> over his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> over-ſwayed the more benign Decree; and <hi>Will,</hi> becauſe it would have it ſo, doomed ſinners to theſe <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> Torments. But I would ask this Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Did the <hi>Will</hi> of God in good earneſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſinners thus in Decree, merely becauſe he willed it, not becauſe it was either good or juſt? What a black and diſmal Reproach is here caſt upon the Divine Majeſty! That he ſentences ſinners thus becauſe he will, not becauſe it is juſt. The ſence whereof is, So he will do, right or wrong. But the Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> was of another mind, <hi>Shall not the Judge of the whole Earth do right?</hi> This he ſaid even to Gods face, as I may ſo ſpeak. Wherefore God doing nothing but what is <hi>just,</hi> does nothing but what is alſo <hi>good.</hi> For <hi>Juſtice</hi> is nothing but <hi>Goodneſs modified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor is it aſſerted by thoſe that make <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> the meaſure of Gods Providence, that the modification and moderation thereof is not by his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Juſtice.</hi> So that this Sophiſter puts [pure] to Goodneſs, merely to obſcure the ſence, and put a Fallacy upon his Reader. The ſins of men here are not rated by <hi>pure</hi> Goodneſs, but by that <hi>modification</hi> of <hi>Goodneſs</hi> which is termed <hi>Juſtice;</hi> which is not a diſtinct principle from Goodneſs, but a branch thereof, or Goodneſs it ſelf under ſuch a modification, not mere <hi>Will</hi> acting becauſe it will, right or wrong, good or evil. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55102:161"/>
the ſtate of the Queſtion is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the eternal Torments of Hell are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the <hi>pure</hi> Goodneſs of God, but with his Juſtice. But if they are eternal mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from his <hi>Will,</hi> without any reſpect to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> his <hi>Will</hi> does will what is infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds of what is juſt, becauſe end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is infinitely beyond that which has an end. Such groſs Abſurdities does this Oppoſer of Pre-exiſtence run into, to fetch an Argument from the ſuppoſititious <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the <hi>Will</hi> of God over his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as touching the Queſtion rightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, whether the Perpetuity of Hell to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners conſiſts with the Juſtice of God, a man ought to be chary and wary how he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in this point, that he ſlip not into what may prove diſadvantageous to the Hearer. For there are that will be ſcandalized, and make it ſerve to an ill end, whether one declare for eternal Torments of Hell, or againſt them. Some being ready to conclude from their <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,</hi> that Religion itſelf is a mere <hi>Scarecrow</hi> that frights us with ſuch an incredible <hi>Mormo;</hi> others to indulge to their Pleaſures, becauſe the Commination is not frightful enough to deter them from extravagant Enjoyments, if Hell Torments be not eternal. But yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but deem it a piece of great levity in him that decided the Controverſie, as the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Parſon did that about the May-pole; they
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55102:161"/>
of his Pariſh that were for a May-pole, let them have a May-pole; but they that were not for a May-pole, let them have no May-pole. But this in ſobriety one may ſay, that the uſe of <gap reason="foreign">

So that by any immediate infallible Oracle, we are not able to pronounce for the Eternity or Perpetuity of Hell-torments. And the Creeds uſe the phraſe of Scripture, and ſo ſome may think that they have the ſame latitude of interpretation.

This one would think were enough to repreſs the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this young Writer.</p>
                  <p>But I will adde ſomething more out of his fellow <hi>Anti-Pre-exiſtentiary.</hi> That <hi>Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are not, though <hi>Promiſes</hi> be obligatory. Foraſmuch as in <hi>Comminations</hi> the <hi>Comminator</hi> is the <hi>Creditor,</hi> and he that is menaced the <hi>Debtor</hi> that owes the puniſhment (with which that Latine Phraſe well agrees, <hi>dare poenas)</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:55102:162"/>
but in <hi>Promiſes,</hi> he that promiſeth becomes <hi>Debtor,</hi> and he to whom the Promiſe is made, <hi>Creditor.</hi> Whence the <hi>Promiſer</hi> is plainly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to make good his Promiſe, as being the <hi>Debtor:</hi> But the <hi>Comminator,</hi> as being the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor,</hi> is not obliged to exact the puniſhment, it being in the power of any <hi>Creditor</hi> to remit the Debt owing him if he will. Wherefore in this Commination of <hi>eternal fire,</hi> or everlaſting puniſhment, though <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſignifie here <hi>proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly everlaſting,</hi> as well as in <hi>everlaſting life,</hi> yet becauſe this latter is a <hi>Promiſe,</hi> the other onely a <hi>Commination,</hi> it does not follow, that as ſurely as the Righteous ſhall be rewarded with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, ſo ſurely ſhall the Wicked be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with everlaſting fire, in the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and higheſt extent of the ſignification of the word. Becauſe God in his <hi>Comminations</hi> to the Wicked is onely a <hi>Creditor,</hi> and has ſtill a right and power to remit either part or the whole Debt; but to the Righteous, by vertue of his <hi>Promiſe,</hi> he becomes a <hi>Debtor,</hi> and cannot recede, but muſt punctually keep his word.</p>
                  <p>To all which I adde this Challenge: Let this Writer, or any elſe if they can, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that a Soul may not behave herſelf ſo perverſely, obſtinately, and deſpightfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Spirit of Grace, that ſhe may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be made an everlaſting Hackſtock of the Divine <hi>Nemeſis,</hi> even for ever and ever. And if ſhe deſerve it, it is but juſt that ſhe have
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55102:163"/>
it; and if it be juſt, it is likewiſe good. For <hi>Juſtice</hi> is nothing elſe but <hi>Goodneſs modified</hi> in ſuch ſort, as <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and ſenſe of <hi>Decorum</hi> ſees fitteſt. But the Election of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways for the beſt, all things conſidered, it is plain that Juſtice and the execution thereof, is for the beſt; and that ſo <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> not <hi>mere Will</hi> upon pretence of having a <hi>Supremacy</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> would be the meaſure of this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencing ſuch obdurate ſinners to eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. And this eternal puniſhment as it is a piece of vindicative Juſtice upon theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate ſinners, ſo it naturally contributes to the eſtabliſhment of the Righteous in their Celeſtial Happineſs. Which, this Oppoſer of Pre-exiſtence objects ſomewhere, if Souls ever fell from, they may fall from it again. But theſe eternal Torments of Hell, if they needed it, would put a ſure bar thereto. So that the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> alſo of God is upon this account concerned in the eternal puniſhments of Hell, as well as his <hi>Juſtice.</hi> That it be to the unreclaimable, as that <hi>Orphick Hemiſtichi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> calls it,
<q>

                  <p>The fifth and laſt forcible Argument, as he calls them, for the proving the Soveraignty of Gods Will over his Goodneſs, is this. If Gods <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> ſaith he, be not under the command of his <hi>Will,</hi> but does always what is beſt, why did it not perpetuate the Station of Pre-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55102:163"/>
Souls, and hinder us (if ever we were happy in a ſublimer ſtate) from lapſing into theſe Regions of Sin and Death? But who does not at firſt ſight diſcern the weakneſs of this Allegation? For it is plainly <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an abſurd thing, and contrary to Reaſon, to create ſuch a ſpecies of Being, whoſe nature is free and mutable, and at the firſt daſh to dam up or ſtop the exerciſe of that freedom and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of change, by confining it to a fixt Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As ridiculous as to ſuppoſe a living Creature made with wings and feet, and yet that the Maker thereof ſhould take ſpecial care it ſhould never ſlie nor go. And ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that the mere making of ſuch an Order of Beings as have a freedom of Will, and choice of their Actions, that this is misbecoming the Goodneſs of God, is as dull and idiotical a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and ſuch as implies that God ſhould have made but one kind of Creature, and that the moſt abſolutely and immutably happy that can be, or elſe did not act according to his Goodneſs, or for the beſt: Which is ſo obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Falſhood, that I will not confute it. But it is not hard to conceive that he making ſuch a free-willed Creature as the Souls of men, <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mul cum mundo condito,</hi> and that in an happy condition, and yet not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ixing them in that Station, may excellently well accord with the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> of his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> nor any one be conſtrained to have recourſe to the <hi>Supremacy</hi>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:55102:164"/>
of his <hi>Will</hi> over his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> as if he did it becauſe he would do it, and not becauſe it was beſt.</p>
                  <p>For what can this freedom of Will conſiſt in ſo much as in a temptableneſs by other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that are of an inferiour nature, not ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and holy as the other, to which it were the ſecurity of the Soul to adhere with all due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and therefore her duty. But in that ſhe is temptable by other Objects, it is a ſigne that her preſent enjoyment of the more Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Heavenly Objects, are not received of her according to their excellency, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure and capacity of her preſent ſtate, which though very happy, may be improved at the long run, and in an orderly ſeries of times and things, whether the Soul lapſe into ſin or no. For acceſſion of new improvements increaſeth Happineſs and Joy. Now therefore, I ſay, ſuppoſe ſeveral, and that great numbers, even innumerable myriads of pre-exiſtent Souls, to lapſe into the Regions of Sin and Death, provided that they do not ſin perverſely and obſtinately, nor do deſpight to the Spirit of Grace, nor refuſe the advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offers that Divine Providence makes them even in theſe ſad Regions, why may not their once having deſcended hither tend to their greater enjoyment, when they ſhall have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their priſtine Station? And why may not the ſpecifical nature of the Soul be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55102:164"/>
ſuch, that it be eſſentially interwoven into our Being, that after a certain period of times or ages, whether ſhe ſin or no, ſhe may arrive to a fixedneſs at laſt in her heavenly Station with greater advantage to ſuch a Creature, than if ſhe had been fixed in that ſtate at firſt.</p>
                  <p>The thing may ſeem leaſt probable in thoſe that deſcend into theſe Regions of Sin and Mortality. But in thoſe that are not obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and refractorie, but cloſe with the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious means that is offered them for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverie, their having been here in this lower State, and retaining the memorie (as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they do) of the tranſactions of this Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial Stage, it naturally enhances all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of the priſtine felicitie they had loſt, and makes them for ever have a more deep and vivid reſentment of them. So that through the richneſs of the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, and through the Merits and conduct of the Captain of their Salvation, our Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, they are, after the ſtrong conflicts here with ſin and the corruptions of this lower Region, made more than Conquerours, and greater gainers upon the loſſes they ſuſtained before from their own folly. And in this moſt advantageous ſtate of things, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Pillars in the Temple of God, there to remain for ever and ever. So that unleſs ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls be exceedingly perverſe and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, the exitus of things will be but as in a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55102:165"/>
                     <hi>Tragick Comedy,</hi> and their perverſeneſs and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie lies at their own doors: for thoſe that finally miſcarrie, whoſe number this confident Writer is to prove to be ſo conſiderable that the enhanced happineſs of <hi>the ſtanding</hi> part of pre-exiſtent Souls and <hi>the recovered</hi> does not far preponderate the infelicitie of the others condition. Which if he cannot do, as I am confident he cannot, he muſt acknowledge, That God in not forcibly <hi>fixing</hi> pre-exiſtent Souls in the ſtate they were firſt created, but leaving them to themſelves, acted not from the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of his <hi>Will</hi> over his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> but did what was <hi>best,</hi> and according to that Soveraign Principle of Goodneſs in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie.</p>
                  <p>And now for that ſnitling Dilemma of this eager Oppoſer of Pre-exiſtence, touching the freedom of acting and mutabilitie in humane Souls, whether this mutabilitie be a <hi>Specifick</hi> properly and eſſential to them, or a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Accident.</hi> For if it were eſſential, ſays he, then how was Chriſt a perfect man, his humane nature being ever void of that lapſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie which is eſſential to humanitie? and how come men to retain their ſpecifick nature ſtill, that are tranſlated to Celeſtial happineſs, and made unalterable in the condition they then are? To this I anſwer, That the <hi>Pre-exiſtentiaries</hi> will admit, that the Soul of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was created as the reſt, though in an
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55102:165"/>
happie condition, yet in a lapſable; and that it was his peculiar merit, in that he ſo faithfully, conſtantly, and entirely adhered to the Divine Principle, incomparably above what was done by others of his Claſſis, notwithſtanding that he might have done otherwiſe; and therefore they will be forward to extend that of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> chap. 1. v. 8. <hi>(Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever, the Scepter of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is the Scepter of thy Kingdom. Thou haſt loved Righteouſneſs, and hated Iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the Oyl of Gladneſs above thy Fellows)</hi> to his behaviour in his pre-exiſtent ſtate, as well as in this. And whenever the Soul of Chriſt did exiſt, if he was like us in all things, ſin one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted, he muſt have a capacitie of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, though he would not ſin; that capacitie not put into act being no ſin, but an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Vertue, and ſuch as if he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways devoid of, he could not be like us in all things, ſin onely excepted. For <hi>poſſe peccare non eſt peccatum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as for humane Souls changing their Species in their unalterable heavenly happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Species is not then changed, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and compleated; namely, that facultie or meaſure of it in their <hi>Plaſtick,</hi> eſſentially la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titant there, is by the Divine Grace ſo awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after ſuch a ſeries of time and things, which they have experienced, that now they are

                     </gap>irmly united to an heavenly Body or ethereal Vehicle for ever. And now we need ſay lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the other member of the Dilemma, but to declare, that free will, or mutability in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Souls, is no <hi>ſeparable Accident,</hi> but of the eſſential contexture of them; ſo as it might have its turn in the ſeries of things. And how conſiſtent it was with the Goodneſs of God and his Wiſdom, not to ſuppreſs it in the beginning, has been ſufficiently intimated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. Wherefore now foraſmuch as there is no pretext that either the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> or <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God ſhould ſtreighten the time of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humane Souls, ſo that their exiſtence may not commence with that of Angels, or of the Univerſe, and that this figment of the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi> of Gods mere <hi>Will</hi> over his other At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes is blown away, it is manifeſt that the Argument for the Pre-exiſtence of Souls drawn from the Divine Goodneſs, holds firm and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable againſt whatever Oppoſers.</p>
                  <p>We have been the more copious on this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, becauſe the Oppoſer and others look upon it as the ſtrongeſt proof the <hi>Pre exiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries</hi> produce for their Opinion. And the other Party have nothing to ſet againſt it but a fictitious <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the <hi>Will</hi> of God over his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and other Attributes. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their onely Bulwark, and they taking San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary nowhere but here, in my apprehenſion they plainly herein give up the cauſe, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55102:166"/>
the Opinion which they ſeem to have ſuch an antipathy againſt. But it is high time now to paſs to the next Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Chap. 10. p. 75. <hi>To have contracted ſtrong and inveterate habits to Vice and Lewdneſs, and that in various manners and degrees,</hi> &amp;c.

Wherefore having the ſame bodily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and the ſame advantages of Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what muſt make this great difference as they grow up in the Body, but that their Souls were different before they came into it? And how ſhould they have ſuch a vaſt difference in the proclivity to Vice, but that they lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the ſtate of Pre-exiſtence, and that ſome were much deeper in rebellion againſt God and the Divine Reaſon, than others were, and ſo brought their different conditions with them into theſe Terreſtrial Bodies?</p>

                  <p>Pag. 76. <hi>Whenas others are as fatally ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Opinions,</hi> &amp;c. And this is done, as the ingenious Author takes notice, even where neither Education nor Cuſtom have interpoſed to ſophiſticate their Judgments or Sentiments. Nay, it is moſt certain, that they ſometime have Sentiments and entertain Opinions quite contrary to their Education. So that that is but a ſlight account, to reſtore this Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non into Education and Cuſtom, whenas Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are entertained and ſtiffly maintained in deſpight of them. This I muſt confeſs implies that the aerial Inhabitants philoſophize, but conjecturally onely, as well as the Inhabitants of the Earth. And it is no wonder that ſuch Spirits as are lapſed in their <hi>Morals,</hi> ſhould be at a loſs alſo in their <hi>Intellectuals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and though they have a deſire to know the truth in Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, it ſuiting ſo well with their pride, that yet they ſhould be ſubject to various errours

and hallucinations as well as we, and that there ſhould be different, yea oppoſite Schools of Philoſophie among them. And if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny credit to be given to <hi>Cardans</hi> ſtory of his Father <hi>Facius Cardanus,</hi> things are thus <hi>de fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto</hi> in the aereal Regions. And two of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which <hi>Facius Cardanus</hi> ſaw in that Viſion (left upon Record by him, and of which he often told his Son <hi>Hieronymus</hi> while he was living) were two Profeſſors of Philoſophie in different Academies, and were of different Opinions; one of them apertly profeſſing himſelf to be an <hi>Aven-Roiſt.</hi> The ſtory is too long to inſert here. See Dr. <hi>H. Moore</hi> his <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul,</hi> book 3. chap. 17.</p>
                  <p>So that lapſed Souls philoſophizing in their Aerial State, and being divided into Sects, and conſequently maintaining their different or oppoſite Opinions with heat and affection which reaches the <hi>Plaſtick,</hi> this may leave a great propenſion in them to the ſame Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here, and make them almoſt as prone to ſuch and ſuch Errours, as to ſuch and ſuch Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. This, I ſuppoſe, the ingenious Author propounds as an Argument credible and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, though he does not eſteem it of like force with thoſe he produced before. Nor does his Oppoſer urge any thing to any purpoſe againſt it. The main thing is, That theſe Propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to ſome one Opinion are not univerſal, and blended with the conſtitution of every
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55102:168"/>
perſon, but are thin ſown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and grow up ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly. Where there are five, ſays he, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally bent to any one Opinion, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny millions that are free to all. If ſome, ſays he, deſcend into this life big with aptneſſes and proclivities to peculiar Theories, why then ſhould not all, ſuppoſing they pre-exiſted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, do the like? As if all in the other Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real State were Profeſſors of Philoſophie, or zealous Followers of them that were. The ſolution of this difficulty is ſo eaſie, that I need not inſiſt on it.</p>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55102:168"/>
But for Philoſophical Opinions and Theories' what have they to do with the motion of the Nerves? It is the Soul herſelf that judges of thoſe abſtractedly from the Senſes, or any uſe of the Nerves or corporeal Organ. If the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of our Judgment in Philoſophical The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories be reſolvible into the mere conſtitution of our Bodie, our Underſtanding itſelf will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard to be reſolved into the ſame Principle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: And Bodie will prove the onely difference betwixt Men and Brutes.

But as the Author himſelf ſeems to inſinuate, if there be any ſuch, they are not ſuch as fatal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determine Souls to falſe and erroneous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions. For that would be a corruption and a blemiſh in the very natural Character. Wherefore if the Soul in Philoſophical Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations is fatally determined to falſhood in this life, it is credible it is the effect of its being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured thereto in the other.</p>

                  <p>But if the Opinion of <hi>Menander</hi> be true, that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55102:169"/>
every man has his guardian <hi>Genius,</hi> under whoſe conduct he lives; the Merchant, the Muſician, the Plowman, and the reſt; it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that theſe Genii cannot but receive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable impreſſions of ſuch things as they guide their Clients in. And pre-exiſtent Souls in their aereal eſtate being of the ſame nature with theſe Daemons or Genii, they are capable of the ſame Employment, and ſo tincture themſelves deep enough with the affairs of thoſe parties they preſide over. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they themſelves, after the ſtate of <hi>Silence,</hi> are incorporated into earthly Bodies, they may have a proneneſs from their former tincture to ſuch methods of life as they lived over whom they did preſide. Which quite ſpoils the beſt Argument our Author's Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt has againſt this Topick; which is, That there are ſeveral things here below which the Geniuſſes of men purſue and follow with the hotteſt chaſe, which have no ſimilitude with the things in the other ſtate, as Planting, Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Husbandrie, the working of Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This beſt Argument of his, by <hi>Menander</hi>'s Hypotheſis, which is hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute, is quite defeated.</p>
                  <p>And to deny nothing to this Oppoſer of Pre-exiſtence which is his due, himſelf ſeems un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, in reſolving theſe odd Phaenomena in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the temper of Bodie. And therefore at laſt hath recourſe to a <hi>ſecret Cauſality,</hi> that is, to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55102:170"/>
he knows not what. But at laſt he pitches upon ſome ſuch Principle as that whereby the Birds build their Neſt, the Spider weaves her Webs, the Bees make their Combs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some ſuch thing he ſays <hi>(though he cannot think it that prodigious Hobgoblin</hi> the Spirit of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) may produce theſe ſtrange effects, may byaſs alſo the fancies of men in making choice of their Employments and Occupations. If it be not the <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> then it muſt be that Claſſical Character I ſpoke of above. But if not this, nor the preponderancies of the Pre-exiſtent ſtate, nor <hi>Menander</hi>'s Hypotheſis, the <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> will bid the faireſt for it of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny beſides, for determining the inclinations of all living Creatures in theſe Regions of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as having in itſelf <hi>vitally,</hi> though not <hi>intellectually,</hi> all the Laws of the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence implanted into its eſſence by God the Creator of it. And ſpeaking in the Ethnick Dialect, the ſame deſcription may belong to it that <hi>Varro</hi> gives to their God Genius. <hi>Genius est Deus qui proepoſitus est, ac vim habet omnium rerum gignendarum,</hi> and that is the Genius of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Creature that is congenit to it in vertue of its generation. And that there is ſuch a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Nature</hi> (not a God, as <hi>Varro</hi> vainly makes it, but an unintelligent Creature) to which belongs the <hi>Naſcency</hi> or <hi>Generation</hi> of things, and has the management of the whole matter of the Univerſe, is copiouſly proved to

                  <p>But to conclude, be it ſo that there may be other cauſes beſides the priſtine inurements of the Pre-exiſtent Soul, that may ſomething for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly determine her to one courſe of life here, yet when ſhe is moſt forcibly determined, if there be ſuch a thing as Pre-exiſtence, this may be rationally ſuppoſed to concur in the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55102:171"/>

If it be but ſuch as will look like a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſolution of a Phaenomenon (as this of ſuch a vaſt difference of Genius's) Pre-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence once admitted, or otherwiſe undeniably demonſtrated, the propoſing thereof ſhould be accepted with favour.</p>

                  <p>Now for others that would ſalve the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by communication of Idioms, I will ſet down the words of an ingenious Writer that goes that way: <hi>Thoſe Predicates,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that in a ſtrict and vigorous acception agreed onely to his Divine Nature, might by a communication of Idioms (as they phraſe it) be attributed to his Humane, or at least to the whole Perſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of them both, than which nothing is more ordinarie in things of a mixt and heterogeneous nature, as the whole man is ſtiled immortal from the deathleſſneſs of his Soul:</hi> thus he. And there is the ſame reaſon if he had ſaid that man was ſtiled mortal (which certainly is far the more ordinarie) from the real death of his Bodie, though his Soul be immortal. This is wittily excogitated. But now let us apply it to the Text, expounding it according to his communication of Idioms, affording to the Humane Nature what is onely proper to the Divine, thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:55102:172"/>
                     <hi>Father, glorifie me</hi> [my Humane Nature] <hi>with the glorie that I</hi> [my Divine Nature] <hi>had before the world was.</hi> Which indeed was to be the Eternal, Infinite, and Omnipotent bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Glory of the Father <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. This is the Glory which his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had before the World was. But how can this Humane Nature be glorified with that Glory his Divine Nature had before the world was, unleſs it ſhould become the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it might be ſaid to have pre-exiſted? (But that it cannot be. For there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Humane and Divine Nature in the Hypoſtaſis of Chriſt:) Or elſe becauſe it is hypoſtatically united with the Divine Nature; but if that be the Glory, that he then had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and had it not (according to the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of Pre-exiſtence) before the world was. So we ſee there is no ſence to be made of this Text by communication of Idioms, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no ſence to be made of it without the Pre-exiſtence of the Humane Nature of Chriſt. And if you paraphraſe [me] thus, My Hypoſtaſis conſiſting of my Humane and Divine Nature, it will be as untoward ſence. For if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature be included in [me] then Chriſt prays for what he has aleady, as I noted above. For the Glory of the eternal <hi>Logos</hi> from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to everlaſting, is the ſame, as ſure as he is the ſame with himſelf.</p>

Wherefore that in Chriſt which was not God, namely his Soul, or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, was in Heaven before he appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on Earth, and conſequently his Soul did pre-exiſt. Nor is there any refuge here in the communication of Idioms. For that cannot be attributed to the whole Hypoſtaſis, which is competent to neither part that conſtitutes it.

                  <p>Wherefore theſe places of Scripture touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt being ſuch inexpugnable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Pre-exiſtence of the Soul of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> the Writer of <hi>No Pre-exiſtence,</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, is no where ſo civil or diſcreet as in this point. Where, he ſaies, <hi>he will not ſquab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble about this, but readily yield that the Soul of Chriſt was long extant before it was incarnate.</hi> But then he preſently flings dirt upon the <hi>Pre-exiſtentiaries,</hi> as guilty of a ſhameful preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and inconſequence, to conclude the Pre-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of all other Humane Souls from the Pre-exiſtence of his. <hi>Becauſe he was a peculiar fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of God, was to undergo bitter ſufferings for Mankind; and therefore ſhould enjoy an happy Pre-exiſtence for an</hi> Anti-praemium. <hi>And ſince he was to purchaſe a Church with his own most precious Bloud, it was fit he ſhould pre-exiſt from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, that he might preſide over his Church as Guide and Governour thereof; which is a thing that cannot be ſaid of any other ſoul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a device which, I believe, the <hi>Pre-exiſtentiaries,</hi> good men, never dreamt of, but they took it for granted, that the creation of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55102:174"/>
all Humane Souls was alike, and that the Soul of Chriſt was like ours in all things, ſin onely excepted; as the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> in his Diſcourſe to <hi>Menas</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> argues from this very Topick to prove the Non-pre-exiſtence of our Souls, from the Non-pre-exiſtence of Chriſts, <hi>he being like us in all things, ſin onely excepted.</hi> And therefore as to Exiſtence and Eſſence there was no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Thus one would have verily thought to have been moſt ſafe and moſt natural to conclude, as being ſo punctual according to the declaration of Scripture, and order of things. For it ſeems almoſt as harſh and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to give Angelical Exiſtence to a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies not Angelical, as Angelical Eſſence. For according to them, it belongs to Angels onely to exiſt <hi>a mundo condito,</hi> not to Humane ſouls. Let us therefore ſee what great and urgent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions there are, that the Almighty ſhould break this order.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, That he may remonſtrate the Soul of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to be his moſt ſpecial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite. Why? That is ſufficiently done, and more opportunely, if other ſouls pre-exiſted to be his corrivals. But his faithful adheſion above the reſt to the Law of his Maker, as it might make him ſo great a Favourite: ſo that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent priviledge of being hypoſtatically united with the Godhead, or Eternal <hi>Logos,</hi> would, I trow, be a ſufficient Teſtimony of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55102:174"/>
Gods ſpecial Favour to him above all his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Pre-exiſtent Souls.</p>
                  <p>And then, which is the ſecond thing for his <hi>Anti-praemial</hi> Happineſs (though it is but an <hi>Hyſteron Proteron,</hi> and prepoſterous conceit, to fancie wages before the work) had he leſs of this by the coexiſtence of other ſouls with him, or was it not rather the more highly encreaſed by their coexiſtencie? And how oddly does it look, that one ſolitary Individual of a Species ſhould exiſt for God knows how many ages alone? But ſuppoſe the ſoul of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and all other ſouls created together, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of them fallen, and the Soul of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to undertake their recovery by his ſufferings, and this declared amongſt them; ſurely this muſt hugely inhance his Happineſs and Glory through all the whole order of Humane ſouls, being thus conſtituted or deſigned Head and Prince over them all. And thus, though he was rejected by the Jews and deſpiſed, he could not but be careſſed and adored by his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouls above, before his deſcent to this ſtate of humiliation. And who knows but this might be part at leaſt of that Glory which, he ſays, he had before the world was? And which this ungrateful world denied him, while he was in it, who crucified the Lord of life.</p>
                  <p>And as for the third and laſt, That the Soul of the Meſſiah was to pre-exiſt, that he might preſide over the Church all along from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55102:175"/>
of it: What neceſſity is there of that? Could not the Eternal <hi>Logos</hi> and the Miniſtry of Angels ſufficiently diſcharge that Province? But you conceive a congruity therein; and ſo may another conceive a congruity that he ſhould not enter upon his Office till there were a conſiderable lapſe of Humane Souls which ſhould be his care to recover; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies their Pre-exiſtence before this ſtage of the Earth: And if the Soul of the Meſſiah, united with the <hi>Logos,</hi> preſided ſo early over the Church; that it was meet that other unlapſed ſouls, they being of his own tribe, ſhould be his <hi>Satellitium,</hi> and be part of thoſe miniſtring Spirits that watch for the Churches good, and zealouſly endeavour the recovery of their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-ſouls, under the conduct of the great Soul of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> out of their captivity of ſin and death.</p>
                  <p>So that every way Pre-exiſtence of other ſouls will handſomly fall in with the Pre-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of the ſoul of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that there may be no breach of order, wherias there is no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for it, nor violence done to the Holy Writ, which expreſsly declares Chriſt to have been <hi>like to us in all things</hi> (as well in <hi>Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence</hi> as <hi>Eſſence) ſin onely excepted;</hi> as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour earneſtly urges to the Patriarch <hi>Menas.</hi> Wherefore we finding no neceſſity of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular pre-exiſting, nor convenience, but what will be doubled if other Souls pre-exiſt with
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55102:175"/>
him; it is plain, if he pre-exiſt, it is as he is an Humane ſoul, not as ſuch a particular ſoul; and therefore what proves his ſoul to pre-exiſt, proves others to pre-exiſt alſo.</p>

                  <p>Pag. 87. <hi>Was it for this mans ſin, or his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that he was born blind?</hi> For the avoiding the force of this Argument for proving that Pre-exiſtence was the Opinion of the Jews; and that Chriſt when it was ſo plainly implied in the Queſtion, by his ſilence, or not reproving it, ſeemed to admit it, or at leaſt to eſteem it no hurtful Opinion: They alledge theſe two things: Firſt, That theſe Enquirers having ſome notions of the Divine Preſcience, might ſuppoſe that God foreknowing what kind of perſon this blind man would prove, had antedated his puniſhment. The other is, That the Enquirers may be conceived to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the blind mans original ſin. So that when they enquired whether the man was born blind for his own or his Parents ſin, they might onely ask whether that particular Judgment was the effect of his Parents, or of his own original pravity. This is <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons.</hi>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55102:176"/>
account is that found, that God ſhould puniſh men before they ſin, becauſe he foreſees they will ſin? And he onely produces this example, and a ſlight one too, That <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boams</hi> hand was dried up as he ſtretched it forth to give a ſign to apprehend the Prophet. And the other is as fond an account, That God ſhould ſend ſuch ſevere Judgments on men for their original Pravity, which they cannot help.

                  <p>Pag. 101. <hi>As likely ſome things relating to the ſtate of Spirits,</hi> &amp;c. That is to ſay, Spirits by the miniſtry of other Spirits may be carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch regions as the <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> would not have tranſmitted them to, from the place
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55102:178"/>
where they were before, whether for good or evil. Of the latter kind whereof, I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more particularly in my Notes on the next Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 102. Pill. 4. <hi>The ſouls of men are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of living in other bodies beſides terreſtrial,</hi> &amp;c. For the <hi>Pre-exiſtentiaries</hi> allow her ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to have lived, firſt, in an <hi>Ethereal</hi> body, then in an Aereal; and laſtly, after the ſtate of <hi>Silence,</hi> to live in a Terreſtrial. And here I think, though it be ſomething early, it will not be amiſs to take notice what the <hi>Anti-pre-exiſtentiaries</hi> alledged againſt this Hypotheſis; for we ſhall have the leſs trouble afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, therefore, they ſay, That it does not become the Goodneſs of God to make Mans Soul with a triple <hi>Vital Congruity,</hi> that will fit as well an <hi>Aereal</hi> and <hi>Terreſtrial</hi> condition, as an <hi>Aethereal.</hi> For from hence it appears, that their Will was not ſo much in fault that they ſinned, as the conſtitution of their Eſſence: And they have the face to quote the account of <hi>Origen,</hi> pag. 49. for to ſtrengthen this their firſt Argument. The words are theſe: <hi>They being originally made with a capacity to joyn with this terreſtrial matter, it ſeems neceſſary accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the courſe of nature that they ſhould ſink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, &amp; ſo appear terreſtrial men.</hi> And therefore, ſay they, there being no deſcending into theſe earthly bodies without a lapſe or previous ſin, their very conſtitution neceſſitated them to ſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:55102:178"/>
The ſecond Argument is, That this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis is inconſiſtent with the bodies Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. For the <hi>Aereal</hi> bodie immediately ſucceeding the <hi>Terreſtrial,</hi> and the <hi>Aethereal</hi> the <hi>Aereal,</hi> the buſineſs is done, there needs no reſuſcitation of the <hi>Terreſtrial</hi> body to be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. Nor is it the ſame <hi>numerical body</hi> or <hi>fleſh</hi> ſtill, as it ought to be, if the Reſurrection-body be <hi>Aethereal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third is touching the <hi>Aereal</hi> Body; That if the ſoul after death be tyed to an <hi>Aere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> body (and few or none attain to the <hi>Aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real</hi> immediately after death) the ſouls of very good men will be forced to have their abode amongſt the very Devils. For their Prince is the Prince of the Air, as the Apoſtle calls him; and where can his ſubjects be, but where he is? So that they will be enforced to endure the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of theſe foul Fiends; beſides all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious changes in the Air, of Clouds, of Vapours, of Rain, Hail, Thunder, tearing Tempeſts and Storms; and what is an Image of Hell it ſelf, the darkneſs of Night will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm them every four and twenty hours.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Argument is touching the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereal</hi> ſtate of Pre-exiſtence. For if ſouls when they were in ſo Heavenly and happy an eſtate could lapſe from it, what aſſurance can we have, when we are returned thither, that we ſhall abide in it? it being but the ſame Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs we were in before: and we having the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55102:179"/>
ſame <hi>Plaſtick</hi> with its triple <hi>Vital Congruity,</hi> as we had before. Why therefore may we not lapſe as before?</p>
                  <p>The fifth and laſt Argument is taken from the ſtate of <hi>Silence.</hi> Wherein the Soul is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed devoid of perception. And therefore their number being many, and their attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the place of conception in the Womb being merely Magical, and reaching many at a time, there would be many attracted at once; ſo that ſcarce a <hi>Foetus</hi> could be formed which would not be a multiform Monſter, or a clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Humane <hi>Foetus</hi>'s, not one ſingle <hi>Foetus.</hi> And theſe are thought ſuch weighty Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that Pre-exiſtence muſt ſink and periſh under their preſſure. But, I believe, when we have weighed them in the balance of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Reaſon, we ſhall find them light e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                  <p>And truly, for the firſt; It is not only weak and ſlight, but wretchedly diſingenuous. The ſtrength of it is nothing but a maimed and fraudulent Quotation, which makes aſhew as if the Author of the <hi>Account</hi> of <hi>Origen,</hi> bluntly affirmed, without any thing more to do, that ſouls being originally made with a capacity to joyn with this terreſtrial matter, it ſeems ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, according to the courſe of nature, that they ſhould ſink into it, and ſo appear terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al men: Whenas if we take the whole Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph as it lies, before they caſt themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55102:179"/>
this fatal neceſſity, they are declared to have a freedom of will, whereby they might have ſo managed their happy Eſtate they were created in, that they need never have faln. His words are theſe: <hi>What then remains, but that through the faulty and negligent uſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whilſt they were in ſome better condition of life, they rendred themſelves leſs pure in the whole extent of their powers, both Intellectual and Animal; and ſo by degrees became diſpoſed for the ſuſception of ſuch a degree of corporeal life, as was leſs pure, indeed, than the former; but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly anſwerable to their preſent diſpoſition of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. So that after certain Periods of time they might become far leſs fit to actuate any ſort of body, than the terreſtrial; and being originally made with a capacity to joyn with this too, and in it to exerciſe the Powers and functions of life, it ſeems neceſſary,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the very words of the Author of the Account of <hi>Origen,</hi> wherein he plainly affirms, that it was the fault of the Souls them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they did not order themſelves then right when they might have done ſo, that caſt them into this terreſtrial condition. But what an Oppoſer of Pre-exiſtence is this, that will thus ſhameleſly falſifie and corrupt a Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of an ingenious Author, rather than he will ſeem to want an Argument againſt his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion! Wherefore briefly to anſwer to this Argument, It does as much become the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55102:180"/>
of God to create ſouls with a triple <hi>Vital Congruity,</hi> as to have created <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe with free Will, and a capacity of ſinning.</p>
                  <p>To the Second, the Pre-exiſtentiaries will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That it is no more abſurd to conceive (nor ſo much) that the ſoul after death hath an Airy body, or it may be ſome an <hi>Ethereal</hi> one, than to imagine them ſo highly happy after death without any body at all. For if they can act ſo fully and beatifically without any body, what need there be any Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body at all? And if it be moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to the ſoul to act in ſome body, in what a long unnatural eſtate has <hi>Adams</hi> ſoul been, that ſo many thouſand years has been without a body? But for the ſoul to have a body, of which ſhe may be the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, certainly is moſt natural, or elſe ſhe will be in an unnatural ſtate after the Reſurrection to all Eternitie. Whence it is manifeſt, that it is moſt natural for the ſoul, if ſhe act at all, to have a body to act in. And therefore, unleſs we will be ſo dull as to fall into the drouzie dream of the <hi>Pyſchopannychites,</hi> we are to allow the ſoul to have ſome kind of body or other till the very Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>But thoſe now that are not <hi>Pſychopannychites,</hi> but allow good Souls the joys and glories of Paradiſe before the Reſurrection of the Body, let them be demanded to what end the ſoul ſhould have a Reſurrection-body; and what
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55102:180"/>
they would anſwer for themſelves, the <hi>Pre-exiſtentiaries</hi> will anſwer for their poſition that holds the Soul has an Aethereal body al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, or an Aereal one which may be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into an Aethereal body. If they will alledge any Concinnity in the buſineſs, or the firm promiſe of more highly compleating our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs at the union of our terreſtrial bodies with our ſouls at the Reſurrection; This, I ſay, may be done as well ſuppoſing them to have bodies in the mean time as if they had none. For thoſe bodies they have made uſe of in the interval betwixt their Death and Reſurrection, may be ſo thin and dilute, that they may be no more conſiderable than an <hi>Interula</hi> is to a Royal Robe lined with rich Furrs, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with Gold. For ſuppoſe every mans bodie at the Reſurrection framed again out of its own duſt, bones, ſinews and fleſh, by the miraculous Power of God, were it not as eaſie for theſe ſubtile Spirits, as it is in the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to enter theſe bodies, and by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power aſſiſting, ſo to inactuate them, that that little of their Vehicle they brought in with them, ſhall no more deſtroy the individuation of the Body, than a draught of wine drunk in, does the individuation of our body now, though it were, immediately upon the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, actuated by the Soul. And the ſoul at the ſame inſtant actuating the whole Aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, it is exquiſitely the ſame numerical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55102:181"/>
even to the utmoſt curioſity of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. But the Divine Aſſiſtance working in this, it is not to be thought that the ſoul will looſe by reſuming this Reſurrection-body, but that all will be turned into a more full and ſaturate Brightneſs and Glory, and that the whole will become an heavenly, ſpiritual, and truly glorified Body, immortal and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible.</p>
                  <p>Nor does the being thus turned into an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly or ſpiritual Body, hinder it from being ſtill the ſame Numerical body, foraſmuch as one and the ſame Numerical matter, let it be under what modifications it will, is ſtill the ſame numerical matter or body; and it is groſs ignorance in Philoſophie that makes any conceive otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>But a rude and ill-natured Oppoſer of Pre-exiſtence is not content that it be the ſame nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical body, but that this ſame numerical body be ſtill fleſh, peeviſhly and invidiouſly thereby to expoſe the Author of the <hi>Account</hi> of <hi>Origen,</hi> who, pag. 120. writes thus: <hi>That the bodie we now have, is therefore corruptible and mortal, becauſe it is fleſh; and therefore if it put on incorruption and immortality, it muſt put off it ſelf firſt, and ceaſe to be fleſh.</hi> But queſtionleſs that ingenious Writer underſtood this of <hi>natural</hi>

                  <p>So little inconſiſtency is there of this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis (as touching the ſouls acting in either an Aereal or Aethereal Vehicle, during the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val betwixt the Reſurrection and her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hence) with the Reſurrection of the bodie. But in the mean time, there is a ſtrong bar thereby put to the dull dream of the <hi>Pſycho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panychiles,</hi> and other harſhneſſes alſo eaſed or ſmoothed by it.</p>
                  <p>Now as for the third Argument, which muſt needs ſeem a great <hi>Scare-crow</hi> to the illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, there is very little weight or none at all in it. For if we take but notice of the whole <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> what is the dimenſion thereof, and of the three Regions into which it is diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, all theſe Bugbears will vaniſh. As for the Dimenſion of the whole Atmoſphere, it is by the skilful reputed about fifty to Italick miles
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55102:182"/>
high, the <hi>Convex</hi> of the middle Region thereof about four ſuch miles, the <hi>Concave</hi> about half a mile. Now this diſtribution of the Air into theſe three <hi>Regions</hi> being thus made, and the Hebrew tongue having no other name to call the <hi>Expanſum</hi> about us, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Heaven,</hi> here is according to them a diſtribution of Heaven into <hi>three,</hi> and the higheſt Region will be part of the <hi>third</hi> Heaven.</p>
                  <p>This therefore premiſed, I anſwer, That though the ſouls of good men after death be detained within the Atmoſphere of the Air, (and the Air it ſelf haply may reach much higher than this Atmoſphere that is bounded by the mere aſcent of exhalations and vapours) yet there is no neceſſity at all that they ſhould be put to thoſe inconveniencies, which this Argument pretends, from the company of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, or incommodious changes and diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Air. For ſuppoſe ſuch inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in the middle and loweſt Region, yet the upper Region, which is alſo part of the third Heaven, thoſe parts are ever calm and ſerene. And the Devils Principality reaching no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than through the middle and loweſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion next the earth, (not to advertiſe that his quarters may be reſtrained there alſo) the ſouls of the departed that are good, are not liable to be peſter'd and haunted with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Preſence or Occurſions of the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and grim Retinue, or of the vagrant vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55102:182"/>
of that foul Feind, that is Prince of the Air, he being onely ſo of theſe lower parts thereof, and the good ſouls having room enough to conſociate together in the upper Region of it.</p>
                  <p>Nor does that promiſe of our Saviour to the thief on the Croſs, that that very day he ſhould be with him in Paradiſe, at all claſh with this Hypotheſis of Aereal Bodies, both becauſe Chriſt by his miraculous power might confer that upon the penitent thief his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferer, which would not fall to the ſhare of other penitents in a natural courſe of things; and alſo becauſe this third Region of the Air may be part of Paradiſe it ſelf: <hi>(In my Fathers houſe there are many Manſions)</hi> and ſome learned men have declared Paradiſe to be in the Air, but ſuch a part of the Air as is free from groſs Vapours and Clouds; and ſuch is the third Region thereof. In the mean time we ſee the ſouls of good men departed, freed from thoſe Panick fears of being infeſted either by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome company of Fiends and Devils, or incommodated by any dull cloudy obſcurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or violent and tempeſtuous motions of the Air.</p>
                  <p>Onely the ſhadowy Vale of the Night will be caſt over them once in a <hi>Nycthemeron.</hi> But what incommodation is that, after the brisk active heat of the Sun in the day-time, to have the variety of the more mild beams of the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55102:183"/>
Moon, or gentle, though more quick and chearful, ſcintillations of the twinkling Stars? This variety may well ſeem an addition to the felicity of their ſtate. And the ſhadowyneſs of the Night may help them in the more compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Introverſions of their contemplative mind, and caſt the ſoul into ineffably pleaſing ſlumbers and Divine extaſies; ſo that the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of the Night may prove more ſolacing and beatifick ſometimes, than thoſe of the day. Such things we may gueſs at afar off, but in the mean time be ſure, that theſe good and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Souls know how to turn all that God ſends to them to the improvement of their Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth Argument we anſwer, That there are not a few reaſons from the nature of the thing that may beget in us a ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that ſouls recovered into their Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Happineſs will never again relapſe, though they did once.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, it may be a miſtake that the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is altogether the ſame that it was before. For our firſt Paradiſiacal Bodies from which we lapſed, might be of a more crude and dilute Aether, not ſo full and ſaturate with Heavenly glory and perfection as our Reſurrection-body is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſoul was then unexperienced, and lightly coming by that Happineſs ſhe was in, did the more heedleſsly forgo it, before
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55102:183"/>
ſhe was well aware; and her mind roved af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter new adventures, though ſhe knew not what.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is to be conſidered, whether Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation be not a ſtronger tenour for endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Happineſs, than the being created happie. For this being wrought ſo by degrees upon the <hi>Plaſtick,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>with ineffable groans and piercing deſires after that Divine Life, that the Spirit of God co-operating exciteth in us;</hi> when Regeneration is perfected and wrought to the full by theſe ſtrong Agonies, this may rationally be deemed a deeper tincture in the ſoul than that ſhe had by mere Creation, whereby the ſoul did indeed become Holy, innocent and happie, but not coming to it with any ſuch ſtrong previous conflicts and eager workings and thirſtings after that ſtate, it might not be ſo firmly rooted by far as in Regeneration begun and accompliſhed by the operation of Gods Spirit, gradually but more deeply renewing the Divine Image in us.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It being a renovation of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into a priſtine ſtate of ours, the ſtrength and depth of impreſſion ſeems increaſed upon that account alſo.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The remembrance of all the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips we underwent in our lapſed condition, whether of Mortification or croſs Rancoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, this muſt likewiſe help us to perſevere when once returned to our former Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:55102:184"/>
Sixthly, The comparing of the evanid plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of our lapſed or terreſtrial life, with the fulneſs of thoſe Joys that we find ſtill in our heavenly, will keep us from ever having any hankering after them any more.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The certain knowledge of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment, which if not true, they could not know, muſt be alſo another ſure bar to any ſuch negligencies as would hazard their ſetled felicity. Which may be one reaſon why the irreclaimable are eternally puniſhed, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it may the better ſecure eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to others.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Though we have our triple <hi>Vital Congruity</hi> ſtill, yet the <hi>Plaſtick</hi> life is ſo throughly ſatisfied with the <hi>Reſurrection-body,</hi> which is ſo conſiderably more full and ſaturate with all the heavenly richneſs and Glorie than the former, that the <hi>Plaſtick</hi> of the ſoul is as entirely taken up with this one Bodie, as if ſhe enjoyed the pleaſures of all three bodies at once, <hi>Aethereal, Aereal,</hi> and <hi>Terreſtrial.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And laſtly, Which will ſtrike all ſure, He that is <hi>able</hi> to ſave to the <hi>utmoſt,</hi> and has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed us <hi>eternal life,</hi> is as <hi>true</hi> as <hi>able,</hi> and therefore cannot fail to perform it. And who can deny but that we in this State I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, are as capable of being <hi>fixed</hi> there, and confirmed therein, as the Angels were after <hi>Lucifer</hi> and others had faln?</p>
                  <p>And now to the fifth and laſt Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55102:184"/>
the ſtate of <hi>Silence,</hi> I ſay it is raiſed out of mere ignorance of the moſt rational as well as moſt <hi>Platonical</hi> way of the ſouls immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate deſcent <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. For the firſt Mover or ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in this matter, I mean in the formation of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> is the <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> the great <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>The firſt Predelineations and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drome Irradiations into the matter,</hi> before the particular ſoul, it is preparing for, come into it. Now the <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> being ſuch a ſpirit as contains <hi>Spermatically</hi> or <hi>Vitally</hi> all the Laws contrived by the Divine Intellect, for the management of the Matter of the World, and of all Eſſences elſe <hi>unperceptive,</hi> or <hi>quatenus unperceptive,</hi> for the good of the Univerſe; we have all the reaſon in the world to ſuppoſe this <hi>Vital</hi> or <hi>Spermatical</hi> Law is amongſt the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That it tranſmit but one ſoul to one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared conception. Which will therefore be as certainly done, unleſs ſome rare and odd caſualty intervene, as if the Divine Intellect it ſelf did do it. Wherefore one and the ſame <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> which prepares the matter by ſome general Predelineation, does at the due time tranſmit ſome one ſoul in the ſtate of <hi>Silence</hi> by ſome particularizing Laws (that fetch in ſuch a ſoul rather than ſuch, but moſt ſure but one, unleſs as I ſaid ſome ſpecial caſualty happen) into the prepared Matter, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55102:185"/>
at two places at once according to its <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>energetical</hi> vertue or power.</p>
                  <p>Hence therefore it is plain, that there will be no ſuch cluſters of <hi>Foetus</hi>'s and monſtrous deformities from this Hypotheſis of the ſouls being in a ſtate of <hi>Silence.</hi> But for one to ſhuffle off ſo fair a ſatisfaction to this difficulty, by a precarious ſuppoſing there is no ſuch Being as the Spirit of Nature, when it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable by ſo many irrefragable Arguments that there is, is a Symptome of one that phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophizes at random, not as Reaſon guides. For that is no reaſon againſt the exiſtence of the Spirit of Nature, becauſe ſome define it <hi>A Subſtance incorporeal, but without ſenſe and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion,</hi> &amp;c. as if a ſpirit without ſenſe and animadverſion were a contradiction. For that there is a <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> is demonſtrable, though whether it have no ſenſe at all is more dubitable. But though it have no ſenſe or perception, it is no contradiction to its being a Spirit, as may appear from Dr. <hi>H. Mores Brief Diſcourſe</hi> of the <hi>true Notion of a Spirit.</hi> To which I direct the Reader for ſatisfaction, I having already been more prolix in anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Arguments than I intended. But I hope I have made my preſage true, that they would be found to have no force in them to overthrow the Hypotheſis of a threefold <hi>Vital Congruity</hi> in the Plaſtick of the ſoul. So that this fourth <hi>Pillar,</hi> for any execution they can do, will ſtand unſhaken.</p>

not of <hi>Silence</hi> in no ſenſe. For ſome being murdered have in all likelyhood in their own perſons complained of their murderers, as it is in that ſtory of <hi>Anne Walker;</hi> and there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others of the ſame nature.</p>
                  <p>And beſides, it is far more reaſonable, there being ſuch numerous multitudes of <hi>ſilent</hi> ſouls, that their leaſt continuance in theſe <hi>Terreſtrial</hi> bodies ſhould at their departure be as it were a Magical <hi>Kue</hi> or <hi>Teſſera</hi> forthwith to the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Congruity of life</hi> to begin to act its part up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ceaſing of the other, that more ſouls may be rid out of the ſtate of <hi>Silence.</hi> Which makes it more probable that every ſoul that is once beſmeared with the unctuous moiſture of the Womb, ſhould as it were by a <hi>Magick Oyntment</hi> be carried into the <hi>Air</hi> (though it be of a ſtill-born Infant) than that any ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the ſtate of <hi>Silence</hi> or <hi>Inactivity</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pretence of the remaining vigour of the <hi>Terreſtrial Congruity</hi> of life.

                  <p>And therefore this being ſo apparently for the beſt, this Law is interwoven into the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the World</hi> and every particular ſoul, that upon the ceaſing of her <hi>Terreſtrial</hi> Union, her <hi>Aereal</hi> Congruity of life ſhould immediately operate, and the Spirit of Nature aſſiſting, ſhe ſhould be dreſt in Aereal robes, and be found

among the Inhabitants of thoſe Regions. If ſouls ſhould be remanded back into the ſtate of Silence that depart before the Terreſtrial Period of <hi>Vital Congruity</hi> be orderly unwound, ſo very few reach the end of that Period, that they muſt in a manner all be turned into the ſtate of <hi>Inactivity.</hi> Which would be to weave <hi>Penelope</hi>'s Web, to do and undo becauſe the day is long enough, as the Proverb is, when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it rather ſeems too ſhort, by reaſon of the numeroſity of <hi>Silent</hi> ſouls that expect their turn of Recovery into Life.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 125. <hi>But onely follow the clew of this Hypotheſis.</hi> The Hypotheſis requires no ſuch thing, but it rather claſhes with the firſt and chiefeſt <hi>Pillar</hi> thereof, <hi>viz.

ſingle ſtring may be immediately made to ſound alone, while the other is mute and ſilent. For, I ſay, theſe are the <hi>free</hi> Laws of the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Wiſdom,</hi> but <hi>fatally</hi> and <hi>vitally,</hi> not <hi>intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> implanted in the <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> and in all Humane Souls or Spirits.

But the <hi>Plaſtick</hi> powers in the world are not ſuch, but onely <hi>Vital</hi> and <hi>Fatal,</hi> as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 126. <hi>That an Aereal body was not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for it to diſplay its force upon,</hi> &amp;c. It is far more ſafe and rational to ſay, that the ſoul deſerts her Aereal Eſtate by reaſon that the Period of the <hi>Vital Congruity</hi> is expired, which according to thoſe fatal Laws I ſpoke of before is determined by the Divine Wiſdom. But whether a ſoul may do any thing to abbreviate this Period, and excite ſuch ſymptoms in the Plaſtick as may ſhorten her continuance in that ſtate, let it be left to the more inquiſitive to define.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 128. <hi>Where is then the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the juſt and the wicked, in ſtate, place, and body?</hi> Their difference in place I have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſhewn, in my Anſwer to the third Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the <hi>triple Congruity of Life</hi> in the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55102:190"/>
                     <hi>Plaſtick</hi> of Humane Souls, how fitly they may be diſpoſed of in the Air. But to the rude Buffoonry of that crude Oppoſer of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Pre-exiſtence, I made no Anſwer. It being methinks ſufficiently anſwered in the Scholia upon <hi>Sect. 12. Cap. 3. Lib.</hi> 3. of Dr. <hi>H. Mores Immortalitas Animae,</hi> if the Reader think it worth his while to conſult the place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now for State and Body the difference is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious. The <hi>Vehicle</hi> is of more pure Air, and the Conſcience more pure of the one than of the other.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 130. <hi>For according to this Hypotheſis, the gravity of thoſe bodies is leſs, becauſe the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the earth that draws them is ſo,</hi> &amp;c. This is an ingenious invention both to ſalve that Phaenomenon, why Bodies in Mines and other deep ſubterraneous places ſhould ſeem not ſo heavy nor hard to lift there, as they are in the ſuperiour Air above the earth; and alſo to prove that the cruſt of the earth is not of ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a thickneſs as men uſually conceive it is. I ſay, it is ingenious, but not ſo firm and ſure. The Quick-ſilver in a <hi>Torricellian</hi> Tube will ſink deeper in an higher or clearer Air, though there be the ſame Magnetiſm of the earth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it that was before. But this is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo fit an illuſtration, there being ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe than I drive at conjoyned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
                  <p>But that which I drive at is ſufficient of it
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55102:190"/>
ſelf to ſalve this Phaenomenon. A Bucket of water, while it is in the water comes up with eaſe to him that draws it at the Well; but ſo ſoon as it comes into the Air, though there be the ſame earth under it that there was before, it feels now exceeding more weighty. Of which I conceive the genuine reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> which ranges all things in their due order, acts proportionately ſtrongly to reduce them thereto, as they are more hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeniouſly and diſproportionately placed as to their conſiſtencies. And therefore by how much more craſs and ſolid a body is above that in which it is placed, by ſo much the ſtronger effort the Spirit of Nature uſes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to its right place; but the leſs it exceeds the craſſneſs of the Element it is in, the effort is the leſs or weaker.</p>
                  <p>Hence therefore it is, that a ſtone or ſuch like body in thoſe ſubterraneous depths ſeems leſs heavy, becauſe the air there is ſo groſs and thick, and is not ſo much diſproportionate to the groſſneſs of the ſtone as our air above the earth here is; nor do I make any doubt, but if the earth were all cut away to the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of any of theſe Mines, ſo that the Air might be of the ſame conſiſtency with ours, the ſtone would then be as heavy as it is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to us in this ſuperioor ſurface of the earth. So that this is no certain Argument for the proving that the cruſt of the earth is of ſuch
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55102:191"/>
thinneſs as this Author would have it, though I do not queſtion but that it is thin enough.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 131. <hi>And the mention of the Fountains of the great Deep in the Sacred Hiſtory,</hi> &amp;c. This is a more conſiderable Argument for the thinneſs of the cruſt of the earth; and I muſt confeſs I think it not improbable but that there is an Aqueous hollow <hi>Sphaericum,</hi> which is the Baſis of this habitable earth, according to that of Pſalm 24. 2. <hi>For he hath founded it upon the ſeas, and eſtabliſhed it upon the flouds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pag. 131. <hi>Now I intend not that after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſtance all is fluid matter to the Centre;</hi> That is to ſay, After a certain diſtance of earthly Matter, that the reſt ſhould be fluid Matter, namely, Water and Air, to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But here his intention is directed by that veneration he has for <hi>Des Cartes.</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I believe if he had freely examined the thing to the bottom, he would have found it more reaſonable to conclude all fluid betwixt the <hi>Concave</hi> of the Terreſtrial Cruſt and the <hi>Centre</hi> of the Earth, as we uſually phraſe it, though nothing be properly Earth but that Cruſt.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 131. <hi>Which for the moſt part very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is a groſs and foetid kind of air,</hi> &amp;c. On this ſide of the <hi>Concave</hi> of the Terreſtrial Cruſt there may be ſeveral Hollows of foetid air and ſtagnant water, which may be ſo many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular lodgings for lapſed and unruly Spirits
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55102:191"/>
But there is moreover a conſiderable Aqueous <hi>Sphaericum</hi> upon which the earth is founded, and is moſt properly the Abyſs; but in a more comprehenſive notion, all from the <hi>Convex</hi> thereof to the <hi>Centre</hi> may be termed the Abyſs, or the Deepeſt place that touches our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 131. <hi>The loweſt and central Regions may be filled with flame and aether,</hi> &amp;c. That there was the Reliques of a Sun after the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruſtation of the Earth and Aqueous Orb, is according to this Hypotheſis reaſonable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. And a kind of Air and Aether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt this diminiſhed Sun and the <hi>Concave</hi> of this Aqueous Orb, but no craſs and opake concamerations of hard Matter interpoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt.</p>
                  <p>Which is an Hypotheſis the moſt kind to the ingenious Author of <hi>Telluris Theoria Sacra,</hi> that he could wiſh. For he holding that there was for almoſt two thouſand years an opake earthy Cruſt over this Aqueous Orb unbroke till the Deluge, which he aſcribes to the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, it was neceſſary there ſhould be no opake Orb betwixt the Central Fire and this Aqueous Orb; for elſe the Fiſhes for ſo long a time had lived in utter darkneſs, having eyes to no purpoſe, nor ability to guide their way or hunt their prey. Onely it is ſuppoſed, which is eaſie to do, that they then ſwam with their backs toward the Centre, whenas as now
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55102:192"/>
they ſwim with their bellies thitherward; they then plying near the <hi>Concave,</hi> as now near the <hi>Convex</hi> of this watry Abyſs. Which being admitted, the difference of their poſture will neceſſarilly follow according to the Laws of Nature, as were eaſie to make out, but that I intend brevity in theſe Annotations.</p>
                  <p>Onely I cannot forbear by the way to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe how probable it is that this Central Fire which ſhone clear enough to give light to the Fiſhes ſwimming near the <hi>Concave</hi> of this Watry Orb, might in proceſs of time grow dimmer and dimmer, and exceeding much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of its light, by that time the Cruſt of the Earth broke and let in the light of the Sun of this great <hi>Vortex</hi> into this Watry Region, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Air or Aether there, there has been ſtill a decay of light, the Air or Aether growing more thick as well as that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Central Fire or Sun, being more and more inveloped with fuliginous ſtuff about it. So that the whole Concavity may ſeem moſt like a vaſt duskiſh Vault, and this dwindling over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded Sun a Sepulchral Lamp, ſuch as, if I remember right, was found in the Monuments of <hi>Olybius</hi> and <hi>Tulliola.</hi> An hideous diſmal forlorn Place, and fit Receptacle for the <hi>Methim</hi> and <hi>Rephaim.</hi>

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55102:199"/>
never have made herſelf ſo obnoxious, but for ought one knows, ſhe might have ſtood and retained her Authority for ever.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, this is ſuitable enough, and very well worth our noting, That foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as there is no aſſurance of the Holy Ghoſt's aſſiſting unneceſſary Deciſions, though it were of the Univerſal Church, much leſs of any National one, ſo that if ſuch a point be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, it is uncertainly determined, and that there may be ſeveral ways of holding a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Point, ſome more accommodate to one kind of men, others to another, and that the Deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church are for the Edification of the people, that either their <hi>Faith</hi> may be more firm, or their <hi>Lives</hi> more irreprehenſible: theſe things, I ſay, being premiſed, it ſeems moſt prudent and Chriſtian in a Church to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the Deciſion of the circumſtances of any neceſſary point, foraſmuch as by deciding and determining the thing one way, thoſe other handles by which others might take more faſt hold on it are thereby cut off, and ſo their aſſent made leſs firm thereto.</p>
                  <p>We need not go far for an example, if we but remember what we have been about all this time. It is neceſſarie to believe that we have in us an Immortal Spirit capable of Salvation and Damnation, according as we ſhall behave ourſelves. This is certainly revealed to us, and is of indiſpenſable uſefulneſs. But though
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55102:200"/>
this Opinion or rather Article of Faith be but o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, yet there are ſeveral waies of holding it. And it lies more eaſie in ſome mens minds, if they ſuppoſe it created by God at every conception in the Womb; in otherſome, if they conceive it to be <hi>ex Traduce;</hi> and laſtly in others, if it pre-exiſt. But the waies of holding this Article ſignifie nothing but as they are ſubſervient to the making us the more firmly hold the ſame. For the more firmly we believe it, the greater influence will it have upon our lives, to cauſe us to live in the fear of God, and in the waies of Righteouſneſs like good Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore now it being ſuppoſed that it will ſtick more firm and fixt in ſome mens minds by ſome one of theſe three waies, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than by either of the other two, and thus of any one of the three; It is manifeſt, it is much more prudently done of the Church not to cut off two of theſe three handles by a needleſs, nay, a harmful Deciſion, but let every one chooſe that handle that he can hold the Article faſteſt by, for his own ſupport and Edification. For thus every one laying firm hold on that handle that is beſt fitted for his own graſp, the Article will carry all theſe three ſorts of believers ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e up to Heaven, they living accordingly; whenas two ſorts of them would have more ſlippery or uncertain hold, if they had no handle offered to them but
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55102:200"/>
thoſe which are leſs ſuitable to their graſp and Genius.</p>
                  <p>Which ſhews the Prudence, Care, and Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of Judgment in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that as in other things, ſo in this, ſhe has made no ſuch needleſs and indeed hurtful Deciſions, but left the modes of conceiving things of the greateſt moment, to every ones ſelf, to take it that way that he can lay the faſteſt hold of it, and it will lie the moſt eaſily in his mind without doubt and wavering. And therefore there being no one of theſe handles but what may be uſeful to ſome or other for the more eaſie and undoubted holding that there is in us an Immaterial and Immortal Soul or Spirit, my having taken this ſmall pains to wipe off the ſoil, and further the uſefulneſs of one of them by theſe Annotations, if it may not merit thanks, it muſt, I hope, at leaſt deſerve excuſe with all thoſe that are not of too ſowre and tetrick a Genius, and prefer their own humours and ſentiments before the real bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of others.</p>
                  <p>But now if any one ſhall invidiouſly object, that I prefer the Chriſtian Diſcretion of my own Church the Church of <hi>England,</hi> before the Judgment and Wiſdom of a General Council, namely, the fifth Oecumenical Council held at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in <hi>Juſtinians</hi> time under the Patriarch <hi>Eutychius,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Menas</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceaſed, to whom <hi>Juſtinian</hi> ſent that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:55102:201"/>
of his againſt <hi>Origen</hi> and his errours, amongſt which <hi>Pre-exiſtence</hi> is reckoned one: In anſwer to this, ſeveral things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that right may be done our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, What number of Biſhops make a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, ſo that from their <hi>Numeroſity</hi> we may rely upon their Authority and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility that they will not conclude what is falſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whether in whatſoever matters of debate, though nothing to the Salvation of mens ſouls, but of curious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Speculation, fitter for the Schools of Philoſophers than Articles of Faith for the edification of the people (whoſe memory and conſcience ought to be charged with no notions that are not ſubſervient to the rightly and duly honouring God and his onely begotten Son our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the faithful diſcharging their duty to man) the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God can rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be expected; or onely in ſuch things as are neceſſary to be profeſſed by the people, and very uſeful for the promoting of Life and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. And as <hi>Moſes</hi> has circumſcribed his Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of the Creation within the limits of <hi>Mundus Plebeiorum,</hi> and alſo the Chronology of time according to Scripture is bounded from the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> to the coming again of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to Judgment, and Sentencing the wicked to everlaſting puniſhment, and the righteous to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55102:201"/>
life everlaſting: ſo whether the Deciſions of the Church are not the moſt ſafely contained within theſe bounds, and they faithfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves in the conduct of Souls, if they do but inſtruct them in ſuch truths only as are within this compaſs revealed in ſacred Scripture. And whether it does not make for the Intereſt and Dignity of the Church to decline the medling with other things, as unprofitable and unneceſſary to be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Whether if a General Council meet not together <hi>in via Spiritus Sancti,</hi> but ſome ſtickling imbitter'd Grandees of the Church out of a pique that they have taken againſt ſome perſons get through their intereſt a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council called, whether is the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt to be expected in ſuch a meeting, ſo that they ſhall conclude nothing againſt truth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Whether the Authority of ſuch General Councils as Providence by ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table prodigie may ſeem to have intimated a diſlike of, be not thereby juſtly ſuſpected, and not eaſily to be admitted as infallible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciders.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Whether a General Council that is found miſtaken in one point, anathematizing that for an Hereſie which is a truth, forfeits not its Authority in other points, which then whether falſhoods or truths, are not to be dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55102:202"/>
ſo from the Authority of that Council, but from other Topicks.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Since there can be no commerce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man, nor he communicate his mind and will to us but by ſuppoſition, That our ſenſes rightly circumſtantiated are true, That there is skill in us to underſtand words and Grammar, and ſchemes of ſpeech, as alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon notions and clear inferences of Reaſon, whether if a General Council conclude any thing plainly repugnant to theſe, is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of ſuch a Council true and valid; and whether the indeleble Notices of truth in our mind that all Mankind is poſſeſſed of, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Logical, Moral, or Metaphyſical, be not more the dictates of God, than thoſe of any Council that are againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, If a Council, as general as any has been called, had in the very midnight of the Churches Apoſtaſie and ignorance met, and concluded all thoſe Corruptions that now are obtruded by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, Invocation of Saints, Worſhipping of Images, and the like, whether the Deciſions of ſuch a Council could be held infallible or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid. What our own excellently well Reformed Church holds in this caſe, is evident out of her Articles. For,</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, The Church of <hi>England</hi> plainly declares. <hi>That General Councils when they be gathered together, foraſmuch as they be an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55102:202"/>
of men whereof all are not governed with the Spirit and Word of God, they may err, and ſometimes have erred even in things pertaining to God. Wherefore,</hi> ſaith ſhe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>things ordained by them as neceſſary to Salvation have neither ſtrength nor Authority, unleſs it may be declared that they be taken out of Holy Scripture.</hi> Artic 21.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, And again, <hi>Artic.</hi> 20. where ſhe allows the Church to have power to decree Rites and Ceremonies, and Authority in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies of Faith, but with this reſtriction, <hi>That it is not lawful for the Church to ordain any thing that is contrary to Gods Word written, neither may it ſo expound one place of Scripture that it be repugnant to another:</hi> ſhe concludes: <hi>Wherefore although the Church be a Witneſs and Keeper of Holy Writ, yet as it ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree any thing againſt the ſame, ſo beſides the ſame ought it not to inforce any thing to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved for neceſſity of Salvation.</hi> What then, does ſhe null the Authority of all the General Councils, and have no deference for any thing but the mere Word of God to convince men of Hereſie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No ſuch matter. What her ſenſe of theſe things is, you will find in 1 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. Wherefore,</p>
                  <p>Tenthly and laſtly, What General Councils the Church of <hi>England</hi> allows of for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of Hereticks you may underſtand out of theſe words of the Statute: <hi>They ſhall not
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55102:203"/>
adjudge any matter or cauſe to be Hereſies, but onely ſuch as heretofore have been adjudged to be Hereſie by the Authority of the Canonical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or by the firſt four General Councils or any of them, or by any other General Council wherein the ſame was declared Hereſie by the expreſs and plain words of the ſaid Canonical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By brief reflections upon ſome of theſe ten Heads, I ſhall endeavour to leſſen the Invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of my <hi>ſeeming</hi> to prefer the Diſcretion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> before the Judgment of a <hi>General Council,</hi> I mean of ſuch a General Council as is ſo unexceptionable that we may relie on the Authority of their Deciſions, that they will not fail to be true. Of which ſort whether the fifth reputed General Council be, we will briefly firſt conſider.</p>
                  <p>For reflecting on the firſt head, It ſeems ſcarcely numerous enough for a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. The firſt General Council of <hi>Nice</hi> had above three hundred Biſhops; That of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi> above ſix hundred: This fifth Council held at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had but an hundred ſixty odd. And which ſtill makes it more unlike a General Council, in the very ſame year, <hi>viz.</hi> 553, the Weſtern Biſhops held a Council at <hi>Aquileia,</hi> and condemned this fifth Council held at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Pre-exiſtence of Souls being a mere Philoſophical Speculation, and indeed
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55102:203"/>
held by all Philoſophers in the affirmative that held the Soul incorporeal; we are to conſider whether we may not juſtly deem this caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrible to the ſecond Head, and to look ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like Pope <hi>Zacharies</hi> appointing a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to condemn <hi>Virgilius</hi> as an Heretick, for holding <hi>Antipodes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We may very well doubt whether this Council proceeded <hi>in via Spiritus Sancti,</hi> this not being the firſt time that the lovers and admirers of <hi>Origen</hi> for his great Piety and Knowledge, and ſingular good ſervice he had done to the Church of Chriſt in his time, had foul play plai'd them. Witneſs the ſtory of <hi>Theophilus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who to revenge himſelf on <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> and two others that were lovers of <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Anti-Anthropomorphites,</hi> ſtickled ſo, that he cauſed <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in his See, as he did in his own, to condemn the Books of <hi>Origen</hi> in a Synod. To which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation <hi>Epiphanius</hi> an <hi>Anthropomorphite,</hi> and one of more Zeal than Knowledge, would have got the ſubſcription of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> but he had more Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Honeſty than to liſten to ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious demand.</p>
                  <p>And as it was with thoſe Synods called by <hi>Theophilus</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> ſo it ſeems to be with the fifth Council. Piques and Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnings amongſt the Grandees of the Church ſeemed to be at the bottom of the buſineſs. <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:55102:204"/>
in his Hiſtory of this fifth Council takes notice of the enmity betwixt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi>'s Apocriſiarie, and <hi>Theodorus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea Cappadociae</hi> an <hi>Origeniſt.</hi> And <hi>Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus</hi> likewiſe mentions the ſame, who ſays, touching the buſineſs of <hi>Origen,</hi> that <hi>Pelagius</hi> the Popes Apocriſiarie, <hi>eam quaeſtionem in ipſius Theodori odium moviſſe exiſtimabatur.</hi> And truly it ſeems to me altogether incredible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there were ſome helliſh ſpight at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, that they ſhould not have contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to condemn the errours ſuppoſed to be <hi>Origens</hi> (but after ſo long a time after his death, there being in his writings ſuch choppings and changings and interpolations, hard to prove to be his) but have ſpared his name, for that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable good ſervice he did the Church in his life-time. See Dr. <hi>H. Mores</hi> Preface to his <hi>Collectio Philoſophica,</hi> Sect. 18. where <hi>Origens</hi> true Character is deſcribed out of <hi>Euſebius.</hi> Wherefore whether this be to begin or carry on things <hi>in via Spiritus Sancti,</hi> ſo that we may rely on the Authority of ſuch a Council, I leave to the impartial and judicious to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In reference to the fourth Head, That true wiſdom and moderation, and the holy aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit did not guide the affairs of this Council, ſeems to be indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Divine Providence, who to ſhew the effect of their unwiſe proceedings in the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55102:204"/>
ſelf-ſame year the Council ſate, ſent a moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Earthquake for forty days together upon the City of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> where the Council was held, and upon other Regions of the Eaſt, even upon <hi>Alexandria</hi> it ſelf and other places, ſo that many Cities were levelled to the ground. Upon which <hi>Spondanus</hi> writes thus: <hi>Haec verò praeſagia fuiſſe malorum quae ſunt prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictam Synodum conſecuta, nemo negare poterit quicun<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> ab eventis facta noverit judicare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This alſo reminds me of a Prodigy as it was thought that happened at the ſixth reputed Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, where nigh three hundred Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were gathered together to decide this nice and ſubtile Point, namely, whether an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration or volition of Chriſt were to be dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>na operatio ſive volitio</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, according to that Axiom of ſome Metaphyſicians, that <hi>Actio eſt ſuppoſiti,</hi> and ſo the Humane and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature of Chriſt being coaleſcent into <hi>one perſon,</hi> his <hi>volition</hi> and <hi>operation</hi> be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>one</hi> as his perſon is but <hi>one;</hi> or becauſe of the <hi>two Natures,</hi> though but one perſon, there are to be conceived <hi>two operations</hi> or two voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This latter Dogma obtained, and the other was condemned by this third <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolitan Council:</hi> whereupon, as <hi>Paulus Diaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> writes, abundance of Cobwebs or Spiders webs fell or rained, as it were, down upon the heads of the people, to their very great aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Some interpret the Cobwebs of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55102:205"/>
Hereſies; others haply more rightfully of troubling the Church of Chriſt with over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great niceties and curioſities of ſubtile Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which tend nothing to the corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her Faith, and promoting a good Life; and are ſo obſcure, ſubtile, and lubricous, that look on them one way they ſeem thus, and another way thus.</p>
                  <p>To this ſixth General Council there ſeemed <hi>two Operations</hi> and <hi>two Wills</hi> in Chriſt, becauſe of his <hi>two Natures.</hi> To a Council called after by <hi>Philippicus</hi> the Emperour, and <hi>John</hi> Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> conſidering Chriſt as <hi>one perſon,</hi> there appeared <hi>Numeroſiſſimo Orienta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium Epiſcoporum collecto Conventui<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> as <hi>Sponda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> has it: but as <hi>Binius, Innumerae Orientalium Epiſcoporum multitudini congregatae,</hi> but <hi>one will</hi> and <hi>one operation.</hi> And certainly this nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous or innumerable company of Biſhops muſt put as fair for a General Council as that of leſs than three hundred. But that the Authority of both theſe Councils are leſſened upon the account of the ſecond Head, in that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they conſulted about tended nothing to the corroboration of our Faith, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of a good Life, I have already intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things I was tempted to note, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the tenth Head. For it ſeems to mean undeniable Argument, that our <hi>First Reformers,</hi> which are the <hi>Riſen Witneſſes,</hi> were
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55102:205"/>
either exquiſitely well ſeen in Eccleſiaſtick Hiſtory, or the good Hand of God was upon them that they abſolutely admitted onely the four firſt General Councils; but after them, they knew not where to be, or what to call a General Council, and therefore would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of any ſo called for the adjudging any matters Hereſie. But if any pretended to be ſuch, their Authority ſhould no further prevail, than as they made out things by expreſs and plain words of Canonical Scripture. And for other Synods, whether the Seventh, which is the ſecond of <hi>Nice,</hi> or any other that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have to be General in defence of their own exorbitant points of <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Practice,</hi> they will be found of no validity, if we have recourſe to the ſixth, ſeventh, eighth and ninth Heads.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, In reference to the fifth Head. This fifth Council loſeth its Authority in anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizing what in <hi>Origen</hi> ſeems to be true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that expreſs Text of Scripture, John 16. 28. (eſpecially compared with others. See Notes on <hi>Chap. 11.) I came forth from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and am come into the world; again I leave the world, and go to the Father.</hi> He came forth from his Father which is in Heaven, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he taught us to pray to him (the Divine <hi>Shechina</hi> being in a peculiar manner there) He leaves the world and goes to the Father, which all underſtand of his Aſcenſion into Heaven,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:55102:206"/>
whence his coming from the Father muſt have the ſame ſenſe, or elſe the Antitheſis will plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fail. Wherefore it is plain he came down from Heaven (as he ſignifies alſo in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) as well as returns thither. But he can neither be truly ſaid to come from heaven, nor return thither, according to his Divine Nature. For it never left Heaven, nor removes from one place to another; and therefore this Scripture does plainly imply the Pre exiſtence of the Soul of the Meſſiah, according to the Doctrine of the <hi>Jews,</hi> before it was incarnate. And this ſtricture of the old <hi>Cabala</hi> may give light to more places of St. <hi>Johns</hi> Writings than is fit to recite in this haſte; I will onely name one by the by, 1 <hi>John 4. 2. Every Spirit that confeſſeth</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>that Jeſus is the Chriſt come in the fleſh,</hi> that is to ſay, is the Chriſt incarnate, <hi>is of God.</hi> For the Meſſiah did exiſt, <hi>viz.</hi> his Soul, before he came into the fleſh, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Which was ſo well known, that upon the above-cited ſaying <hi>(John</hi> 16. 28.) of our Saviour, they preſently anſwered, <hi>Lo, now ſpeakeſt thou plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſpeakeſt no Parable;</hi> becauſe he clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovers himſelf by this Character to be the expected Meſſias incarnate. Nor is there any poſſible evaſion out of the clearneſs of this Text <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rom the communication of Idioms, becauſe Chriſt cannot be ſaid to come down from Heaven according to his Humane Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:55102:206"/>
it was there, therefore his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was there before it was incarnate.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, The Authority of the Deciſion of this Council (if it did ſo decide) is leſſened, in that contrary to the ſecond Head (as was hinted above) it decides a point that Faith and Godlineſs is not at all concerned in. For the Divinity of Chriſt, which is the great point of Faith, is as firmly held ſuppoſing the Soul of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> united with the <hi>Logos</hi> before his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, as in it. So that the <hi>ſpight</hi> onely of <hi>Pelagius</hi> againſt <hi>Theodorus</hi> to multiply Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematiſms againſt <hi>Origen,</hi> no <hi>uſe</hi> or <hi>neceſſity</hi> of the Church required any ſuch thing. Whence again their Authority is leſſened upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the third Head.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things may very well ſuſpend a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mind, and loth to be impoſed upon, from relying much upon the Authority of this fifth Council. But ſuppoſe its Authority entire, yet the Acts againſt <hi>Origen</hi> are not to be found in the Council. And the ſixth Council in its Anathematiſms, though it mention <hi>Theodorets</hi> Writings, the Epiſtle of <hi>Ibas</hi> and <hi>Theoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Mopſueſtenus</hi> who were concerned in the fifth Council; yet I find not there a ſyllable touching <hi>Origen.</hi> And therefore thoſe that talk of his being condemned by that fifth Council, have an eye, I ſuppoſe, to the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematiſms at the end of that Diſcourſe which <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Emperour ſent to <hi>Menas.</hi> Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch

of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> according to which form they ſuppoſe the errours of <hi>Origen</hi> condemned. Which if it were true, yet <hi>ſimple Pre-exiſtence</hi> will eſcape well enough.</p>
                  <p>Nor do I think that learned and intelligent Patriarch <hi>Photius</hi> would have called the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Opinion of Pre-exiſtence of ſouls <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>But this ſimple Doctrine of Pre-exiſtence is ſo unexceptionable and harmleſs, that the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55102:207"/>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, though it reckon the other errours of <hi>Origen</hi> condemned in the fifth Council, omits this of Pre-exiſtence. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that Eccleſiaſtick that framed that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe for the Emperour, if he did it not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, had not fully, deliberately and impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered the Dogma of Pre-exiſtence ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in its ſelf, nor does once offer to anſwer any Reaſons out of Scripture or Philoſophy that are produced for it. Which if it had been done, and this had been the onely errour to be alledged againſt <hi>Origen,</hi> I cannot think it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, nay ſcarce poſſible, though their ſpight had been never ſo much againſt ſome lovers of <hi>Origen,</hi> that they could have got any Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council to have condemned ſo holy, ſo able, ſo victorious a Champion for the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church in his life-time for an Heretick, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo tolerable a punctilio, about three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after his death. What Father that wrote before the firſt four General Councils, but might by the Malevolent, for ſome odd paſſage or other, be doomed an Heretick, if ſuch ſeverity were admittable amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians?</p>
                  <p>But I have gone out further than I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, and it is time for me to bethink me what I intended. Which was the juſtifying of my ſelf in my ſeeming to prefer the Diſcretion of our own Church in leaving us free to hold the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55102:208"/>
Incorporeity and Immortality of the ſoul by any of the three handles that beſt fitted every mans Genius, before the Judgment of the fifth General Council, that would abridge us of this liberty. From which Charge I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to free my ſelf, briefly by theſe two ways: Firſt, by ſhewing how hard it is to prove the fifth Oecumenical Council ſo called, to be a legitimate General or Oecumenical Council, and ſuch as whoſe Authority we may relie on. And ſecondly, if it was ſuch, by ſhewing that it did not condemn ſimply the Pre-exiſtence of ſouls, but Pre-exiſtence with ſuch and ſuch Appendages. So that there is no real claſhing betwixt our Church and that Council in this.</p>
                  <p>But however this is, from the eighth and ninth Heads it's plain enough that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is no favourer of the Concluſions of any General Council that are enjoyned as neceſſary to Salvation, that be either repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Holy Scripture, or are not clearly to be made out from the ſame; which Non-pre-exiſtence of Souls certainly is not, but rather the contrary. But being the point is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently clear from Scripture either way to all, and the Immortality of the Soul and ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence after death is the main uſeful point; that way which men can hold it with moſt firmneſs and eaſe, her Candour and Prudence has left it free to them to make uſe of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:55102:208"/>
And as for General Councils, though ſhe does not in a fit of Zeal, which <hi>Theodoſius</hi> a Prior in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> is ſaid to have done, anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize from the Pulpit all people that do not give as much belief to the four firſt General Councils as to the four. Goſpels themſelves; yet, as you may ſee in the tenth Head, ſhe makes the Authority of the firſt four General Councils ſo great, that nothing is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged Hereſie but what may be proved to be ſo either from the <hi>Scripture</hi> or from theſe <hi>four Councils.</hi> Which Encomium might be made with leſs skill and more confidence by that Prior, there having been no more than four General Councils in his time. But it was ſingular Learning and Judgment, or elſe a kind of Divine Sagacity in our firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, that they laid ſo great ſtreſs on the firſt four General Councils, and ſo little on any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers pretended ſo to be.</p>
                  <p>But in all likelihood they being perſwaded of the truth of the prediction of the Apoſtaſie of the Church under Antichriſt how univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal in a manner it would be, they had the moſt confidence in thoſe General Councils which were the earlieſt, and that were held within thoſe times of the Church which ſome call <hi>Symmetral.</hi> And without all queſtion, the two firſt General Councils, that of <hi>Nice,</hi> and that other of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> were within thoſe times, <hi>viz.</hi> within four hundred years after
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55102:209"/>
Chriſt; and the third and fourth within the time that the ten-horned Beaſt had his horns growing up, according to Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. But the Definitions of the third and fourth Councils, that of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and that other of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> (which are to eſtabliſh the <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of Chriſt, which is not to be conceived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Union of both Natures into <hi>one perſon;</hi> as alſo his <hi>Theanthropy,</hi> which cannot conſiſt with the confuſion of <hi>both Natures</hi> into one) were vertually contained in the Definitions of the firſt and ſecond Councils. So that in this regard they are all of equal Authority, and that unexceptionable. Firſt, becauſe their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions were concerning points neceſſary to be decided one way or other, for the ſettlement of the Church in the objects of their Divine Worſhip. And therefore they might be the better aſſured that the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt would not be wanting upon ſo weighty an occaſion. And ſecondly, in that thoſe two firſt Councils were called while the Church was <hi>Symmetral,</hi> and before the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> came in, according to the teſtimony of the Spirit in the Viſions of the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which Viſions plainly demonſtrate, that the Definitions of thoſe Councils touching the <hi>Triunity</hi> of the Godhead and <hi>Divinity</hi> of Chriſt are not Idolatrous, elſe the Apoſtaſie had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun before the time theſe Oracles declare it did; and if not Idolatrous, then they are moſt
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55102:209"/>
certainly true. And all theſe four Councils driving at nothing elſe but theſe neceſſary points to be decided, and their deciſion being thus plainly approved by the ſuffrage of the Holy Ghoſt in the Apocalypſe, I appeal to any man of ſenſe and judgment if they have not a peculiar prerogative to be believed above what other pretended General Council ſoever; and conſequently with what <hi>ſpecial</hi> or rather <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> ſagacity our firſt Reformers have laid ſo peculiar a ſtreſs on theſe four, and how conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent our Mother the Church of <hi>England</hi> is to herſelf, <hi>that the deciſions of General Councils have neither ſtrength nor Authority further than the matter may be cleared out of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> For here we ſee, that out of the Holy Scriptures there is a moſt ample teſtimony given to the Deciſions of theſe four General Councils. So that if one ſhould with <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> the Prior of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> in a fit of Zeal ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematize all thoſe that did not believe them as true as the four Evangeliſts, he would not want a fair Plea for his religious fury.</p>
                  <p>But for men after the <hi>Symmetral</hi> times of the Church, upon Piques and private quarrels of Parties, to get General Councils called as they fancy them, to conclude matters that tend neither to the confirmation of the real Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, or of ſuch a ſenſe of them as are truly uſeful to life and godlineſs, and herein to expect the infallible
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55102:210"/>
aſſiſtances of the Holy Spirit, either upon ſuch terms as theſe, or for rank worldly intereſt, is ſuch a preſumption as to a free Judgment will look little better than Simony, as if they could hire the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I run further into the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of General Councils, and the meaſure of their Authority, than was requiſite upon ſo ſmall an occaſion; and yet I think there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſaid, but if ſeriouſly weighed may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the intelligent Reader, whether he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour Pre-exiſtence or not. Which is no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be favoured than is conſiſtent with the known and approved Doctrines of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, nor claſhes any thing with the ſoundeſt Syſtemes of Divinity, as Dr. <hi>H. More</hi> ſhews his way of exhibiting the Theorie does not, in his <hi>General Preface</hi> to his <hi>Collectio Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophica,</hi> Sect. 19. whoſe cautious and caſtigate method I have imitated as near as I could in theſe my Annotations. And he has indeed been ſo careful of admitting any thing in the Hypotheſis that may juſtly be ſuſpected or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt, that his Friend Mr. <hi>Glanvil</hi> m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55102:210"/>
to recover it to its primeval purity and ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>And yet when the buſineſs is reduced to this harmleſs and unexceptionable ſtate, ſuch is the modeſty of that Writer, that he declares that if he were as certain of the Opinion as of any demonſtration in Mathematicks, yet he holds not himſelf bound in conſcience to profeſs it any further than is with the good-liking or permiſſion of his Superiours. Of which tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per if all men were, it would infinitely contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the peace of the Church. And as for my ſelf, I do freely profeſs that I am altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſelf-ſame Opinion and Judgment with him.</p>

                  <p>ABout a fortnight or three weeks ago, while my <hi>Annotations</hi> upon the two foregoing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes were a printing, there came to my hands Mr. <hi>Baxter's Reply</hi> to Dr. <hi>Mores Anſwer to a Letter of the learned Pſychopyriſt,</hi> printed in the ſecond Edition of <hi>Saduciſmus Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphatus:</hi> Which <hi>Reply</hi> he ſtyles a <hi>Placid Collation with the Learned Dr.</hi> Henry More. I being fully at leaſure, preſently fell upon reading this <hi>Placid Collation;</hi> which I muſt confeſs is ſo writ, that I was much ſurprized in the reading of it, I expecting by the Title
<pb facs="tcp:55102:213"/>
thereof nothing but fairneſs and freeneſs of Judgment, and calmneſs of Spirit, and love and deſire of Truth, and the proſperous ſucceſs thereof in the World, whether our ſelves have the luck to light on it, or where ever it is found.</p>
                  <p>But inſtead of this, I found a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial loftineſs of Spirit, and a ſtudie of obſcuring and ſuppreſſing of the Truth by petty crooked Artifices, ſtrange diſtortions of the ſenſe of the Doctors Arguments, and Falſifications of Paſſages in his Anſwer to the Letter of the <hi>Pſychopyriſt.</hi> Which ſurprize moved me, I confeſs, to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent meaſure of <hi>Indignation</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the injured Doctor, and of the Truth he contends for: And that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, according to the <hi>Idioſyncraſie</hi> of my <hi>Genius,</hi> ſtirred up the <hi>merry Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> in me, I being more prone to laugh than to be ſeverely angry or ſurly at thoſe that do things unhandſomely; And this merry humour ſtirred up, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing ſo much upon my Judgment as
<pb facs="tcp:55102:213"/>
to make me think that this <hi>Placid Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was not to be anſwered, but by one in a pleaſant and jocular humor; And I finding my ſelf ſomething ſo diſpoſed, and judging the matter not of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as to be buzzed upon long, and that this more lightſome, brisk and jocular way of anſwering the <hi>Placid Collation</hi> might better befit an <hi>unknown Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatour,</hi> than the <hi>known</hi> Pen and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Doctor, I preſently betook my ſelf to this little Province, thinking at firſt onely to take notice of Mr. <hi>Baxters Diſingenuities</hi> towards the Doctor; but one thing drawing on another, and that which followed being carefully managed and apparently uſeful, I mean the Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> pretended <hi>Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> againſt the <hi>Penetrability</hi> or <hi>Indiſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pibility</hi> of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and all his ſmaller Criticiſms upon the Doctors Definition thereof, in finiſhing theſe three Parts, I quickly completed the whole little Work of what I call the <hi>Digreſſion,</hi> (inſerted

                  <p>Sect. 1. pag. 165. <hi>AND that there are neceſſary mutual reſpects,</hi> &amp;c. Here was a groſs miſtake in the former Impreſſion. For this clauſe there ran thus: <hi>By the firſt I mean nothing elſe, but that things neceſſarily are what they are. By the ſecond, that there are neceſſary mutual Reſpects and Relations of things one unto another.</hi> As if theſe mutual Reſpects and Relations of Things one to another were Truth in the <hi>Subject,</hi> and not Truth in the <hi>Object;</hi> the latter of which he handles from the fourth Section to the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, in which laſt Section alone he treats of Truth in the <hi>Subject</hi> or Underſtanding. The former part of the Diſcourſe is ſpent in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Truth in the <hi>Object;</hi> that is to ſay, of Truth in the nature of things, and their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Reſpects and mutual Relations one to another. Both which are antecedent in the order of nature to all Underſtandings, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55102:215"/>
therefore both put together make up the firſt branch of the Diviſion of Truth. So groſly had the Authours MS. been depraved by paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through the hands of unskilful Tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as Mr. <hi>J. Glanvil</hi> complains at the end of his Letter prefixed to this Diſcourſe. And ſo far as I ſee, that MS. by which he corrected that according to which the former Impreſſion was made, was corrupt it ſelf in this place. And it running glibly, and they expecting ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly the propoſal of the other member of the Diviſion, the errour, though ſo great, was overſeen. But it being now ſo ſeaſonably cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, it gives great light to the Diſcourſe, and makes things more eaſie and intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>Sect. 2. pag. 166. <hi>That any thing may be a ſuitable means to any end,</hi> &amp;c. It may ſeem a monſtrous thing to the ſober, that any mans Underſtanding ſhould be ſo depraved as to think ſo. And yet I have met with one that took himſelf to be no ſmall Philoſopher, but to be wiſer than both the Univerſities, and the Royal Society to boot, that did earneſtly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm to me, that there is no natural adapta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of means to ends, but that one means would be as good as another for any end if God would have it ſo, in whoſe power alone every thing has that effect it has upon another. Whereupon I asked him, whether if God would a Foot-ball might not be as good an
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55102:215"/>
Inſtrument to make or mend a Pen withal, as a Pen-knife. He was ſurprized; but whether he was convinced of his madneſs and folly, I do not well remember.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 167. <hi>Is it poſſible there ſhould be ſuch a kind of Geometry, wherein any Problem ſhould be demonſtrated by any Principles?</hi> Some of the <hi>Carteſians</hi> bid fair towards this Freakiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whenas they do not ſtick to aſſert, that, If God would, he could have made that the whole ſhould be leſſer than the part, and the part bigger than the whole. Which I ſuppoſe they were animated to, by a piece of raillery of <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> in anſwering a certain Objection; where, that he may not ſeem to violate the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Power of God for making what Laws he pleaſed for the ordering of the matter of the Univerſe (though himſelf ſeems to have fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the world out of certain inevitable and neceſſary Mechanical Laws) does affirm, that thoſe Laws that ſeem ſo neceſſary, are by the arbitrarious appointment of God, who, if he would, could have appointed other Laws, and indeed framed another Geometry than we have, and made the power of the <hi>Hypotenuſa</hi> of a Right-angled Triangle unequal to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the <hi>Baſis</hi> and <hi>Cathetus.</hi> This piece of Drollery of <hi>Des Cartes</hi> ſome of his followers have very gravely improved to what I ſaid above of the Whole and Part. As if ſome ſuperſtitious Fop, upon the hearing one being
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55102:216"/>
demanded, whether he did believe the real and corporeal preſence of Chriſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to anſwer roundly that he believed him there booted and ſpurred as he rode in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhould become of the ſame Faith that the other ſeemed to profeſs, and glory in the improvement thereof by adding that the Aſs was alſo in the Sacrament, which he ſpurred and rid upon. But in the mean time, while there is this Phrenſie amongſt them that are no ſmall pretenders to Philoſophy, this does not a little ſet off the value and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of this preſent <hi>Diſcourſe of Truth,</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive them if they be not wilfully blind.</p>

                  <p>Sect. 4. pag. 168. <hi>The Divine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cannot be the fountain of the Truth of things,</hi> &amp;c. This ſeems at firſt ſight to be a very harſh Paradox, and againſt the current Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Metaphyſicians, who define Tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental or Metaphyſical Truth to be nothing elſe but the relation of the Conformity of things to the Theoretical (not Practical) In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect of God; His Practical Intellect being that by which he knows things as produced or to be produced by him, but his Theoretical that, by which he knows things as they are: but yet in an <hi>Objective</hi> manner, as <hi>Exiſtent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively,</hi> not <hi>really.</hi> And hence they make Tranſcendental Truth to depend upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Truth of God, which alone is moſt properly Truth, and indeed the fountain and origine of all Truth. This in brief is the ſenſe of the Metaphyſical Schools. With which this paſſage of our Author ſeems to claſh, in denying the Divine Intellect to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Truth of things, and in driving ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at this, That the things themſelves in their <hi>Objective Exiſtence,</hi> ſuch as they appear there unalterably and unchangeably to the Divine Intellect, and not at pleaſure contrived by it
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55102:217"/>

That in theſe, I ſay, conſiſts the <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>Object,</hi> and that the <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>Subject</hi> is a conception con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to theſe, or to the Truth of them whether in the uncreated or created Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
                  <p>So that the niceneſs of the point is this: Whether the Tranſcendental Truth of things exhibited in their <hi>Objective Exiſtence</hi> to the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oretical Intellect of God conſiſts in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to that Intellect, or the Truth of that Intellect in its Conformity with the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table natures and Relations or Reſpects of things exhibited in their <hi>Objective Exiſtence,</hi> which the Divine Intellect finds to be unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſuch, not contrives them at its own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. This though it be no <gap reason="foreign">

ſuppoſe, Binary, Quinary, Ternary, Denary, is ſuch a ſetled number and no other, and has ſuch properties in it ſelf, and references im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately accrewing to it, and aptitudes which no other number beſides it ſelf has; ſo it is with Idea's) the Idea's I ſay therefore of thoſe things which we call by thoſe names above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recited being unchangeable, the aptitudes and references immediately iſſuing from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture repreſented in the Idea, muſt be alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable and neceſſary. Thus it is with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical</hi> and <hi>Phyſical</hi> Idea's; and there is the ſame reaſon concerning ſuch Idea's as may be called <hi>Moral.</hi> Foraſmuch as they reſpect the rectitude of Will in whatever Mind, created or uncreated.</p>
                  <p>And thus, laſtly, it is with <hi>Metaphyſical</hi> Idea's, as for example; As the <hi>Phyſical</hi> Idea of <hi>Body,</hi> Matter or Subſtance <hi>Material</hi> contains in it immediately of its own nature or inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ſpecifick Eſſence real <hi>Diviſibility</hi> or <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerpibility, Impenetrability</hi> and mere <hi>Paſſivity</hi> or Actuability, as the proper fruit of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Difference and intimate Form thereof, unalterably and immutably as in its Idea in the Divine Intellect, ſo in any Body or Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Subſtance that does exiſt: So the Idea of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> or of a Subſtance <hi>Immaterial,</hi> the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Idea to the other, contains in it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately of its own nature <hi>Indiſcerpibility, Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trability,</hi> and <hi>Self-Activity,</hi> as the inſeparable
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55102:218"/>
fruit of the eſſential difference or intimate form thereof unalterably and immutably, as in its Idea in the Divine Intellect, ſo in any Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Subſtance properly ſo called that doth exiſt. So that as it is a contradiction in the <hi>Idea</hi> that it ſhould be the Idea of Subſtance <hi>Immaterial,</hi> and yet not include in it <hi>Indiſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pibility,</hi> &amp;c. ſo it is in the <hi>being</hi> really exiſtent, that it ſhould be Subſtance <hi>Immaterial,</hi> and yet not be <hi>Indiſcerpible,</hi> &amp;c. For were it ſo, it would not anſwer to the Truth of its Idea, nor be what it pretendeth to be, and is indeed, an <hi>exiſtent</hi> Being <hi>Indiſcerpible;</hi> which exiſtent Being would not be Indiſcerpible, if any could diſcerp it.</p>
                  <p>And ſo likewiſe it is with the Idea of <hi>Ens ſummè &amp; abſolutè perfectum,</hi> which is a ſetled determinate and immutable Idea in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Intellect, whereby, were not God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that <hi>Ens ſummè &amp; abſolutè perfectum,</hi> he would diſcern there were ſomething better than Himſelf, and conſequently that he were not God. But he diſcerns Himſelf to be this <hi>Ens ſummè &amp; abſolutè perfectum,</hi> and we cannot but diſcern that to ſuch a Being belongs <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality,</hi> which implies <hi>Indiſcerpibility,</hi> (and who but a mad man can imagine the Divine Eſſence diſcerpible into parts?) <hi>Infinity</hi> of <hi>Eſſence,</hi> or Eſſential <hi>Omnipreſence, Self-Cauſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> or <hi>neceſſary Exiſtence</hi> immediately of it ſelf or from it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reſulting from the abſolute and

peculiar perfection of its own nature, whereby we underſtand that nothing can exiſt <hi>ab aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> of it ſelf but He. And laſtly, <hi>Omniſcience</hi> and <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> whereby it can do any thing that implies no contradiction to be done. Whence it neceſſarily follows, that all things were Created by Him, and that he were not God, or <hi>Ens ſummè perfectum,</hi> if it were not ſo: And that amongſt other things he created <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> (as ſure as there are any Spirits in the world) <hi>indiſcerpible</hi> as himſelf is, though of finite Eſſences and Metaphyſical Amplitudes; and that it is no derogation to his <hi>Omnipotence</hi> that he cannot diſcerp a Spirit once created, it being a contradiction that he ſhould: Nor therefore any argument that he cannot create a Spirit, becauſe he would then puzzle his own Omnipotence to diſcerp it. For it would then follow, that he cannot create any thing, no not <hi>Metaphyſical Monads,</hi> nor Matter, unleſs it be Phyſically diviſible <hi>in infinitum;</hi> and God Himſelf could never divide it into parts Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically indiviſible; whereby yet his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence would be puzzled: And if he can divide matter into <hi>Phyſical Monads</hi> no further diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, there his Omnipotence is puzzled again; And by ſuch ſophiſtical Reaſoning, God ſhall be able to create nothing, neither Matter nor Spirit, nor conſequently be God, or <hi>Ens ſummè &amp; abſolutè perfectum,</hi> the Creator and Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of all things.</p>

This is ſo Mathematically clear and true, that I wonder that Mr. <hi>Rich. Baxter</hi> ſhould not rather exult, (in his <hi>Placid Collation)</hi> at the diſcovery of ſo plain and uſeful a truth, than put himſelf, p. 79. into an Hiſtrionical (as the Latin) or (as the Greek would expreſs it) Hypocritical fit of trembling, to amuze the populacy, as if the Doctor in his ſerious and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid reaſoning had verged towards ſomething hugely exorbitant or prophane. The igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant fear where no fear is, but God is in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the knowing and upright. It's plain, this Reaſoning brings not the exiſtence of God into any doubt, (For it is no repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to either his nature or exiſtence, not to be able to do what is a contradiction to be done) but it puts the <hi>Indiſcerpibility</hi> of Spirits (which is a Notion mainly uſeful) out of all doubt. And yet Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> his phancie ſtalking upon wooden ſtilts, and getting more than a ſpit and a ſtride before his Reaſon, very magiſterial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounces, <hi>It's a thing ſo high, as required ſome ſhew of proof to intimate that God cannot be God if he be Almighty, and cannot conquer his own Omnipotency.</hi> Anſ. This is an expreſſion ſo high and in the Clouds, that no ſenſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to be ſeen, unleſs this be it: That God cannot be God, unleſs he be not Almighty; as he would diſcover himſelf not to be, if he could not diſcerp a Spirit of a Metaphyſical ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude when he has created it. But it plainly
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55102:220"/>
appears from what has been ſaid above, that this diſcerping of a Spirit, which is immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and eſſentially of its own nature indiſcerpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as well as a Phyſical Monad is, imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a contradiction, it is no derogation to the Almightineſs of God that he cannot do it; all Philoſophers and Theologers being agreed on that <hi>Maxim,</hi> That what implies a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to be done, is no Object of Gods Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſs.

Wherefore that Objection being thus clearly removed, God, as ſure as himſelf is, can create a Spirit, penetrable and <hi>indiſcerpible,</hi> as himſelf is, and is expreſly acknowledged to be ſo by Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> himſelf, pag. 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> Let me now interpoſe a word or two in the behalf of the Doctor. Is not this a plain piece of Diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity againſt the Doctor, who has ſpent ſo great a part of his time in Philoſophie (which the mere <hi>Letter</hi> of the Scripture very rarely reveals any thing of) to reproach him for his having uſed his underſtanding ſo much about things not revealed in Scripture? Where ſhould he uſe his Underſtanding and Reaſon, if not in things unrevealed in Scripture; that is, in Philoſophical things? Things revealed in Scripture are Objects rather of Faith than of Science and Underſtanding. And what a Paradox is this, that our Underſtandings, as our Eyes, are made onely for things revealed? When our Eyes are ſhut, all the whole viſible world, by the cloſing of the <hi>palpebrae</hi> is vailed from us, but it is revealed to us again by the opening of our eyes; and ſo it is with the eye of the Underſtanding. If it be ſhut through
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55102:222"/>
Pride, Prejudice, or Senſuality, the myſteries of Philoſophy are thereby vailed from it; but if by true vertue and unfeigned ſanctity of mind <hi>that</hi> eye be opened, the Myſteries of Philoſophy are the more clearly diſcovered to it, eſpecially if points be ſtudied with <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular induſtry,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges of the Doctor, pag. 21. onely he would there pin upon his back an <hi>Humble Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noramus</hi> in ſome things, which the Doctor, I dare ſay, will eaſily admit in many things, yea in moſt; and yet, I believe, this he will ſtand upon, that in thoſe things which he profeſſes to know, he will challenge all the world to diſprove if they can.

For though it is not <hi>certain</hi> or neceſſary, yet it is <hi>very probable.</hi> For if there were of the higheſt Orders of the Angels that fell, it is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they had corporeal Vehicles, without which it is hard to conceive they could run into diſorder. And our Saviour Chriſts Soul, which actuates a glorified ſpiritual Bodie, being ſet above all the Orders of Angels, it is likely that there is none of them is ſo refined above his Humane Nature, as to have no bodies at all. Not to add, that at the Reſurrection we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Thirdly, Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> pag. 6. wrongfully blames the Doctor for being ſo defective in his ſtudies as not to have read over Dr. <hi>Gliſſon De Vita Naturae;</hi> and ſays he has talk'd with diverſe high pretenders to Philoſophie, and askt their judgment of that Book, and found that none
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55102:223"/>
of them underſtood it, but neglected it, as too hard for them; and yet contemned it. His words to Dr. <hi>More</hi> are theſe: <hi>I marvel that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hen you have dealt with ſo many ſorts of Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, you meddle not with ſo ſubtile a piece as that of old Dr.</hi> Gliſſons, <hi>De Vita Naturae.</hi> He thinks the <hi>ſubtilty</hi> of the Book has deterred the Doctor from reading it, as ſomething above <hi>his</hi> Capacity, as alſo of <hi>other</hi> high Pretenders to Philoſophie.</p>
                  <p>This is a Book it ſeems calculated onely for the elevation of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſubtile and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime wit. And indeed by the benefit of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this Book he is moſt dreadfully armed with the affrightful terms of <hi>Quoddities</hi> and <hi>Quiddities,</hi> of <hi>Conceptus formalis</hi> and <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalis,</hi> of <hi>Conceptus adaequatus</hi> and <hi>inadaequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and the like. In vertue of which <hi>thwack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> expreſſions he has fancied himſelf able to play at <hi>Scholaſtick</hi> or <hi>Philoſophick</hi> Quarter-ſtaff with the moſt doughty and beſt appointed Wits that dare enter the Liſts with him; and as over-neglectful of his flock, like ſome conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Shepherds, that think themſelves no ſmall fools at the uſe of the Staff or Cudgil-play, take Vagaries to Fairs or Wakes to give a ſpecimen of their skill; ſo he ever and anon makes his <hi>Polemick</hi> ſallies in Philoſophie or Divinity to entertain the Spectators, though very oft he is ſo rapt upon the knuckles, that he is forced to let fall his wooden Inſtrument,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:55102:224"/>
and blow his fingers. Which is but a juſt Nemeſis upon him, and he would do well to interpret it as a ſeaſonable reproof from the great Paſtor of Souls, to whom we are all accountable.</p>
                  <p>But to return to his ſpeech to the Doctor; I will adventure to anſwer in his behalf, That I marvel that whenas Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> has had the curioſity to read ſo many Writers, and ſome of them ſure but of ſmall concern, that he has not read that ſound and <hi>ſolid</hi> piece of Dr. <hi>More,</hi> viz. his <hi>Epiſtola altera ad V. C.</hi> with the <hi>Scholia</hi> thereon, where <hi>Spinozius</hi> is confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Which if he had read he might have ſeen <hi>Volum. Philoſoph. Tom.</hi> 1. pag. 604, 605, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the Doctor has not onely read that <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> Piece of Doctor <hi>Gliſſons,</hi> but underſtands ſo throughly his <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that he has ſolid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſubſtantially confuted it. Which he did in a faithful regard to Religion. For that <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> if it were true, were as ſafe, if not a ſafer Refuge for <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> than the mere Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick Philoſophie is: And therefore you may ſee there, how <hi>Cuperus,</hi> brought up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> from his very childhood, does confeſs, how the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> now-a-daies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode the Mechanick Philoſophie as not being for their turn, and betake themſelves whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuch an Hypotheſis as Dr. <hi>Gliſſons Vita Naturae.</hi> But, God be thanked, Dr. <hi>H. More</hi> in the fore-cited place has perfectly routed
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:55102:224"/>
that fond and foul Hypotheſis of Dr. <hi>Gliſſon,</hi> and I dare ſay is ſorry that ſo good and old a Knight <hi>errant</hi> in Theologie and Philoſophie as Mr. <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> ſeems to be, ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come benighted, as in a wood, at the Cloſe of his daies, in this moſt horrid dark Harbour and diſmal Receptacle or Randevouz of wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <hi>Atheiſts.</hi> But I dare ſay for him, it is his ignorance, not choice, that has lodged him there.</p>
                  <p>The fourth <hi>Diſingenuity</hi> of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Doctor is, in complaining of him as if he had wronged him by the Title of his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> to his <hi>Letter,</hi> in calling it an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to a <hi>Pſychopyriſt,</hi> pag. 2. 82. As if he had aſſerted <hi>that</hi> materiality of Spirits which belongs to bodies, pag. 94. In complaining alſo of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency with himſelf, pag. 10. as if he one while ſaid that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> made Spirits to be Fire or <hi>material,</hi> and another while ſaid he made them not Fire or <hi>material.</hi> But to the firſt part of this Accuſation it may be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That if it is Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> that is called the Learned <hi>Pſychopyriſt,</hi> how is the thing known to the world but by himſelf? It looks as if he were ambitious of the Title, and proud of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ivil treating he has had at the hands of the Doctor, though he has but ill repai'd his civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in his Reply. And beſides this, there is no more harſhneſs in calling him <hi>Pſychopyriſt,</hi> than if he had called him <hi>Pſycho-Hyliſt,</hi> there being nothing abſurd in <hi>Pſychopyriſm</hi> but ſo
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55102:225"/>
far forth as it includes <hi>Pſycho-Hyliſm,</hi> and makes the Soul <hi>material.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which <hi>Pſycho-Hyliſm</hi> that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> does admit, it is made evident in the Doctors <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> Sect. 16. And Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Placid Collation</hi> (as he miſ-calls it, for aſſuredly his mind was turbid when he wrote it) pag. 2. allows that Spirits may be called Fire <hi>Analogicè</hi> and <hi>Eminenter,</hi> and the Doctor in his Preface in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates that the ſenſe is to be no further ſtretched, than the <hi>Pſychopyriſt</hi> himſelf will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p>But now that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> does aſſert <hi>that</hi> Materiality in created Spirits that belongs to bodies in the common ſenſe of all Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, appears Sect. 16. where his words are theſe: <hi>But cuſtom having<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made MATERIA, but eſpecially CORP<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S to ſignifie onely ſuch groſſer Subſtance as the three paſſive Elements are</hi> (he means Earth, Water, Air) <hi>I yield,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſo to ſay, that Spirits are not Corporeal or Material.</hi> Which plainly implies that Spirits are in no other ſenſe <hi>Immaterial,</hi> than <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Aether</hi> are, <hi>viz.</hi> than in this, that they are thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner matter.</p>
                  <p>And therefore to the laſt point it may be anſwered in the Doctors behalf, that he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly does nowhere ſay, That Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> does not ſay that <hi>Spirits</hi> are <hi>Material,</hi> as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial is taken in the common ſenſe of all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers for what is <hi>impenetrable</hi> and <hi>diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pible.</hi>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:55102:225"/>
Which is <hi>Materia Phyſica,</hi> and in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to which, a Spirit is ſaid to be <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial.</hi> And which briefly and diſtinctly ſtates the Queſtion. Which if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would have taken notice of, he might have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf the labour of a great deal of need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs verboſity in his <hi>Placid Collation,</hi> where he does over-frequently, under the pretence of more diſtinctneſs, in the multitude of words obſcure knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Upon Sect. 10. pag. 21. where Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Queſtion is, <hi>How a man may tell how that God that can make many out of one, cannot make many into one,</hi> &amp;c. To which the Doctor there anſwers: <hi>If the meaning be of ſubſtantial Spirits, it has been already noted, that God acting in Nature does not make many ſubſtances out of one, the ſubſtance remaining ſtill entire; for then Generation would be Creation. And no ſober man believes that God aſſiſts any creature ſo in a natural courſe, as to enable it to create: And then I ſuppoſe that he that believes not this, is not bound to puzzle himſelf why God may not as well make many ſubſtances into one, as many out of one, whenas he holds he does not the latter,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are the Doctors own words in that Section. In reply to which, Mr. <hi>Baxter: But to my Queſtion,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>why God cannot make two of one, or one of two, you put me off with this lean Anſwer, that we be not bound to puzzle our ſelves about it. I think,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>that Anſwer
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:55102:226"/>
might ſerve to much of your Philoſophical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> plainly deals very diſingenuouſly with the Doctor in perverting his words, which affirm onely, <hi>That he that denies that God can make two ſubſtances of one in the ſenſe above-declared, need not puzzle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf how he may make one of thoſe two again.</hi> Which is no <hi>lean,</hi> but <hi>full</hi> and appoſite Anſwer to the Queſtion there propounded.</p>
                  <p>And yet in this his <hi>Placid Collation,</hi> as if he were wroth, he gives ill language, and inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, That much of the Doctors Philoſophical Diſputes are ſuch as are not worth a mans puzling himſelf about them; whenas it is well known to all that know him or his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that he concerns himſelf in no Theories but ſuch as are weighty and uſeful, as this of the <hi>Indiſcerpibility</hi> of Spirits is, touching which he further ſlanders the Doctor, as if it were his <hi>mere Aſſertion without any Proof.</hi> As if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had never read, or forgot the Doctors <hi>Diſcourſe of the true Notion of a Spirit,</hi> or what he has writ in the further <hi>Defence</hi> thereof. See Sect. 26, 28, 30, 31. Thus to ſay any thing in an angry mood, verily does not become the Title of a <hi>Placid Collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The Doctor in Sect. 11. of his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Notion of a Spirit,</hi> writes thus: I deſire you to conſider the nature of Light throughly, and you ſhall find it nothing but a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:55102:226"/>
certain motion of a <hi>Medium,</hi> whoſe parts or particles are ſo or ſo qualified, ſome ſuch way as <hi>Carteſianiſm</hi> drives at. To this Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> replies againſt the Doctor, pag. 59. <hi>Really,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>when I read how far you have eſcaped the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions of</hi> Carteſianiſm, <hi>I am ſorry you yet ſtick in ſo groſs a part of it as this is; when he that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no more than motion in the nature of Fire, which is the Active Principle by which Mental and Senſitive Nature operateth on Man and Brutes and Vegetables, and all the Paſſive Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and all the viſible actions in this lower world are performed, what can that mans Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie be worth? I therefore return your Counſel, ſtudy more throughly the nature of Ethereal Fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Satis pro imperio!</hi> very <hi>Magiſterially</hi> ſpoken! and in ſuch an igneous Rapture, that it is not continuedly ſenſe. Does <hi>Mental</hi> and <hi>Senſitive</hi> Nature act on Brutes and Vegetables and all the Paſſive Elements? But to let go that: Is all the Doctors Philoſophie worth nothing if he hold with <hi>Des Cartes</hi> touching the Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon of Light as to the <hi>Material</hi> part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? It is the ignorance of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that he rejects <hi>all</hi> in <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> and Judiciouſneſs in the Doctor, that he retains <hi>ſome</hi> things, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies where his Philoſophie is deficient. He names here onely the <hi>Mechanical</hi> Cauſe of Light, <hi>viz. Motion,</hi> and duly modified <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi> But in his <hi>Enchiridium</hi> he intimates an
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55102:227"/>
higher principle than either Fire or Aether, or any thing that is <hi>Material,</hi> be it as fine and pure as you pleaſe to fancie it. See his <hi>Enchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid. Metaphyſ.</hi> Cap. 19. where he ſhews plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Light would not be Light, were there not a <hi>Spiritus Mundanus,</hi> or <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> which pervades the whole Univerſe; Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> ignorance whereof has caſt him into ſo deep a dotage upon <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> and fine diſcerpible <hi>Corporeities,</hi> which he would by his Magiſterial Prerogative dubb <hi>Spirits,</hi> when to nothing that Title is due, but what is <hi>Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable</hi> and <hi>Indiſcerpible</hi> by reaſon of the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Oneneſs of its Eſſence, even as God the Father and Creator of all Spirits is one Indiſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pible Subſtance or Being. And therefore I would adviſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to ſtudie more throughly the true nature of a Spirit, and to let go theſe <hi>Ignes Fatui</hi> that would ſeduce him into thick miſts and bogs. For that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> is moſt certainly the Mover of the matter of the world, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difier thereof, and thence exhibits to us not onely the Phaenomena of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> but of Earth and Water, and frames all Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles into ſhape and growth; and Fire of it ſelf is but a dead Inſtrument in its hand, as all is in the hand of God, who is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>! and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as <hi>Syneſius,</hi> if I well remember, ſomewhere calls him in his Hymns.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, That is alſo leſs ingenuouſly done
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55102:227"/>
of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> when the Doctor ſo friendly and faithfully puts him in a way of undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelf, Sect. 17. touching the Doctrine of Atoms, that he puts it off ſo ſlightly. And ſo Sect. 18. where he earneſtly exhorts him to ſtudie the nature of Water, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> does others to ſtudie the nature of Fire; he, as if he had been bitten, and thence taken with that diſeaſe the Phyſicians call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and which ſignifies the <hi>fear of Water,</hi> has ſlunk away and quite neglected the Doctors friendly monition; and is ſo ſmall a Proficient in <hi>Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticks,</hi> that pag. 68. he underſtands not what greater wonder there is in the riſing of the Dr.'s Rundle, than in the riſing of a piece of Timber from the bottom of the Sea. Which is a ſign he never read the 13th Chapter of the Dr.'s <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiridion Metaphyſicum,</hi> much leſs the Scholia thereon. For if he had, he would diſcern the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and the vaſt uſefulneſs of the one above that of the other to prove a <hi>Principium Hylar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicum</hi> diſtinct from the matter of the Univerſe, againſt all evaſions and tergiverſations whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. But theſe things cannot be inſiſted on here.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> pag. 76. charges the Doctor with ſuch a ſtrange Paradox as to half of it, that I cannot imagine from whence he ſhould fetch it. <hi>You ſeem,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to make all ſubſtance Atoms, Spiritual Atoms and Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Atoms.</hi> The latter part of the charge the Doctor I doubt not but will acknowledge to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55102:228"/>
be true: But may eaſily prove out of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> pag. 65. that he muſt hold ſo too. For his words there are theſe: <hi>Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> God is able to divide all matter into Atoms or indiviſible parts I doubt not.</hi> And can they be Phyſically di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into parts of which they don't conſiſt? But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> by the ſame reaſon making Spirits diviſible by God, though not by any Creature, makes them conſiſt of Spiritual A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, for they cannot but conſiſt of ſuch parts as they are diviſible into. And if they be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible by God into larger ſhreds onely but not into Atoms, then every created Spirit, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly particular ones, are ſo many ſubtil living Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets made up of ſpiritual rags and clouts. But if God can divide them neither into ſpiritual <hi>Atoms</hi> nor <hi>larger</hi> ſpiritual <hi>parcels,</hi> he can't di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them at all. And ſo according to what the Doctor contends for, they will be, as they ought to be, abſolutely indiſcerpible.</p>
                  <p>I omit here to take notice of another ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of Mr. <hi>Baxters,</hi> That though the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a Spirit he will have to be diviſible, yet he will have the form indiviſible, pag. 50, 99. and yet both parts to be Spirit ſtill; which implies a contradiction. For then one of the parts will be without the form of a Spirit, and conſequently be no Spirit, and yet be a Spirit according to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who makes Spirits diviſible into parts of the ſame denomination, as when water is divided into two parts, each part is ſtill water, pag. 53.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:55102:228"/>
Ninthly. That which occurrs pag. 48. is a groſs Diſingenuity againſt the Doctor, where Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays, <hi>And when you make all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to be Souls and to animate ſome matter, you ſeem to make God to be but</hi> Anima Mundi. How unfair and harſh is this for you Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> who has been ſo tenderly and civilly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Doctor in his Anſwer to your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he conſtantly hiding or mollifying any thing that occurred therein that might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much expoſe you, to repreſent him as a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſo groſs a Paradox as this, That there is no God but an <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> which is the Poſition of the <hi>Vaninian Atheiſts,</hi> which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has expreſly confuted in his <hi>Myſtery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> and declared againſt lately in his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements on <hi>Joſ Glanvils</hi> Letter to himſelf, in the ſecond Edition of <hi>Saduciſmus Triumpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus?</hi> This looks like the breaking out of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian rancour, in a <hi>Reply</hi> which bears the Specious Title of a <hi>Placid Collation.</hi> Which is yet exceedingly more aggravable, for that this odious Collection is not made from any words of the Doctor, but from a fiction of Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> For the Doctor has nowhere Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, nor ever thought that <hi>all</hi> Spirits, but only all <hi>Created</hi> Spirits, might probably be Souls, that is to ſay, actuate ſome matter or other. And thoſe words are in his Preface to his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the <hi>Letter</hi> of the <hi>Pſychopyrist,</hi> as I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before. I might reckon up ſeveral other
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55102:229"/>
Diſingenuities of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> towards the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in this his <hi>Placid Collation;</hi> but I have enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated enough already to weary the Reader, and I muſt remember I am but in a <hi>Digreſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall onely name one <hi>Diſingenuity</hi> more, which was antecedent to them all, and gave occaſion both to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Letter, and to the Doctors <hi>Anſwer</hi> thereto, and to this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> of Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> And that was, That Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Methodus Theologiae</hi> (as he has done alſo in a little Pamphlet touching Judge <hi>Hales)</hi> without giving any reaſons, which is the worſt way of traducing any man or his ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntiments, ſlighted and ſlurred thoſe two eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Attributes of a Spirit, <hi>Penetrability</hi> and <hi>Indiſcerpibility,</hi> which for their certain Truth and uſefulneſs the Doctor thought fit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the World.</p>
                  <p>But foraſmuch as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> has in this his <hi>Reply</hi> produced his Reaſons againſt them, I doubt not but the Doctor will accept it for an amends. And I, as I muſt diſallow of the Diſingenuity of the omiſſion before, yet to be juſt to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I muſt commend his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and judgment in being willing to omit them; they appearing to me now they are produced, ſo weak and invalid. But ſuch as they are, I ſhall gather them out of his <hi>Reply,</hi> and bring them into view.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, pag. 13. It is alledged, That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath two forms univocally ſo called.

But if <hi>Penetrabilitie</hi> and <hi>Indiſcerpibilitie</hi> be added to the <hi>Virtus Vitalis,</hi> to the <hi>Vital Power</hi> of a Spirit, it will have two forms. Therefore <hi>Penetrabilitie</hi> and <hi>Indiſcerpibilitie</hi> are to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the notion of a Spirit. See alſo <hi>p.</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, pag. 14. <hi>Penetrable</hi> and <hi>Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpible</hi> can be no otherwiſe a form to Spirits, than <hi>Impenetrable</hi> and <hi>Diſcerpible</hi> are a form to Matter. But <hi>Impenetrable</hi> is onely a modal <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptus</hi> of Matter, and <hi>Diſcerpible</hi> a Relative notion thereof, and neither one nor both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Virtus vitalis</hi> in a Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, pag. 14. He ſees no reaſon why <hi>Quantity,</hi> and the <hi>Trina Dimenſio,</hi> may not as well be part of the form of Matter as <hi>Diſcerpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie</hi> and <hi>Impenetrabilitie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, pag. 15, 16. Nothing is to be known without the mediation of Senſe, except the immediate ſenſation itſelf, and the acts of intellection and volition or nolition, and what the Intellect inferreth of <hi>the like,</hi> by the percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe. Wherefore as to the modificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſubſtance of Spirits which is contrary to <hi>Impenetrabilitie</hi> and <hi>Diviſibilitie,</hi> I may grope, ſays he, but I cannot know it poſitively for want of ſenſation.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, pag. 16, 17. If <hi>Indiſcerpibilitie</hi> be the eſſential character of a Spirit, then an Atom of matter is a Spirit, it being acknowledged to be <hi>Indiſcerpible.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Indiſcerpibilitie</hi> is a falſe character of a Spirit.</p>

                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:55102:230"/>
Sixthly, pag. 17, 18. [Penetrable] whether actively or paſſively underſtood, can be no proper Character of a Spirit, foraſmuch as Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can penetrate a Spirit, as well as a Spirit Matter, it poſſeſſing the ſame place. See <hi>pag.</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, pag. 40, 41. <hi>Immaterialitie,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Penetrabilitie</hi> and <hi>Indiſcerpibilitie,</hi> in your own judgment I think are none of them proper to Spirit. For they are common to diverſe <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents</hi> in your account, <hi>viz.</hi> to Light, Heat, Cold. And again in his own words,</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, pag. 77. If your <hi>Penetrabilitie,</hi> ſays he, imply not that all the ſingular Spirits can contract themſelves into a <hi>Punctum,</hi> yea that all the Spirits of the world may be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, I find it not yet ſufficiently explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. See alſo <hi>pag.</hi> 52, 78, 89, 90.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, pag. 50. Seeing, ſays he, you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Amplitude, Quantitie, and Dimenſions and Logical Materialitie to the Subſtantialitie of Spirits, I ſee not but that you make them Intellectually diviſible, that is, that one may think of one part as here, and another there. And if ſo, though man cannot ſeparate and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them, if it be no contradiction, God can.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, and laſtly, pag. 90. The putting of <hi>Penetrability</hi> and <hi>Indiſcerpibility</hi> into the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Spirit, is needleſs, and <hi>hazardous,</hi> it being ſufficient to hold that God hath made Spirits of no kind of parts but what do Naturally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:55102:230"/>
Separation, and ſo are inſeparable unleſs God will ſeparate them, and ſo there is no fear of loſing our Perſonality in the other State. But <hi>Penetrability</hi> and <hi>Indiſcerpibility</hi> being hard and doubtful words, they are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter left out, leſt they tempt all to believe that the very Being of Spirits is as doubtful as thoſe words are.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I faithfully though briefly brought into view all Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Arguments againſt the <hi>Penetrability</hi> and <hi>Indiſcerpibility</hi> of Spirits, which I ſhall anſwer in order as they have been recited.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt therefore I ſay, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors Definition of a Spirit, which is [A Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance immaterial intrinſecally indued with life and a faculty of motion] where <hi>Subſtance</hi> is the <hi>Genus,</hi> and the reſt of the terms com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the <hi>Differentia</hi> (which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> calls <hi>Conceptus formalis</hi> and <hi>Forma)</hi> I ſay, that this <hi>Difference</hi> or <hi>Form</hi> though it conſiſt of many terms, yet theſe terms are not <hi>Heterogeneal,</hi> as he would inſinuate, pag. 22. but <hi>Congene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi> and one in order to another, and eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and inſeparably united in that <hi>one</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which is rightly and properly called <hi>Spirit,</hi> and in vertue of that one ſubſtance, though their Notions and Operations differ, they are really <hi>one</hi> inſeparable ſpecifick <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> or <hi>Form,</hi> as much as Mr. <hi>Baxters Virtus vitalis un a-trina</hi> is; that is to ſay, they are
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:55102:231"/>
ſpecifick knowable terms, <hi>ſuccedaneous</hi> to the true <hi>intimate ſpecifick Form</hi> that is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowable; and therefore I ſay, in this ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e theſe knowable terms are one inſeparable ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Difference or Form whereby Spirit is diſtinguiſhed from Bodie or <hi>Matter</hi> in a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical acception. Which the Univerſality of Philoſophers hold to conſiſt in <hi>Impenetrability,</hi> and <hi>Diſcerpibilitie,</hi> and <hi>Self-inactivitie.</hi> Which if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would have been pleaſed to take notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> that a Spirit is ſaid to be a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance <hi>Immaterial</hi> in oppoſition to Matter <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical,</hi> he might have ſaved himſelf the labour of a deal of tedious triſling in explication of words to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>But to ſhew that this Pretence of more Forms than one in one Subſtance is but a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, I will offer really the ſame Definition in a more ſuccinct way, and more to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> tooth, and ſay, As <hi>Corpus</hi> is <hi>Subſtantia Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alis</hi> (where <hi>Materialis</hi> is the ſpecifick Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>Corpus</hi> comprized in one term:) ſo <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus</hi> is <hi>Subſtantia Immaterialis</hi> (where <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialis</hi> the ſpecifick Difference of <hi>Spiritus</hi> is likewiſe comprized in one term, to pleaſe the humour of Mr. <hi>Baxter.)</hi> But now as under that one term [Materialis] are comprized <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrabilitie, Diſcerpibilitie,</hi> and <hi>Self-Inactivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> ſo alſo under that one term [Immaterialis] are comprized, as under one head, <hi>Penetrability, Indiſcerpibility,</hi> and <hi>Intrinſecal life</hi> and <hi>motion,</hi>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:55102:231"/>
that is, an eſſential facultie of life and motion, which in one word may be called <hi>Self-Activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Whence <hi>Penetrability, Indiſcerpibility,</hi> and <hi>Self-Activity</hi> are as much one Form of a Spirit, as Mr. <hi>Baxters Vita, Perceptio,</hi> and <hi>Appetitus,</hi> is one Form thereo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. For though in both places they are three diſtinct notions, at leaſt as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would have it, yet they are the eſſential and inſeparable Attributes of one ſubſtance, and the immediate fruit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of the <hi>Specifick nature</hi> thereof. They are inſeparably one in their Source and Subject.</p>
                  <p>And this I think is more than enough to take off this firſt little Cavil of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> againſt the Doctors including <hi>Penetrability</hi> and <hi>Inſeparability</hi> in the Form or Specifick diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a Spirit. For all that ſame is to be called <hi>Form,</hi> by which a thing is that which it is, as far as our Cognitive faculties will reach, and by which it is eſſentially diſtinguiſhed from other things. And if it were not for <hi>Penetrabilitie</hi> and <hi>Indiſcerpibilitie, Spirit</hi> would be confounded with <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Matter.</hi> And Body or Phyſical Matter might be <hi>Self-Active, Sentient,</hi> and <hi>Intelligent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the Second I anſwer, That whoſoever ſearches things to the bottom, he will find this a ſound Principle in Philoſophie, That there is nothing in the whole Univerſe but what is either <hi>Subſtantia</hi> or <hi>Modus.</hi> And when a Mode or ſeveral Modes put together are
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55102:232"/>
immediately and eſſentially inſeparable from a Subſtance, they are lookt upon as the <hi>Form,</hi> or the onely knowable <hi>Specifick difference</hi> of that Subſtance. So that <hi>Impenetrability</hi> and <hi>Diſcerpibility,</hi> which are immediately eſſential to, and inſeparable from Body or Matter, and Self-Inactivitie, (as <hi>Irrational</hi> is made the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick difference of a Brute) may be added alſo: Theſe, I ſay, are as truly the Form or Specifick difference of Body or Matter, as any thing knowable is of any thing in the world. And <hi>Self-Inactivity</hi> at leaſt, is contrary to the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus vitalis</hi> of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> though <hi>Impenetrability</hi> and <hi>Diſcerpibility</hi> were not. So that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this oeconomy, you ſee how plainly and exquiſitely <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> are made op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite <hi>Species</hi> one to another. And 'tis theſe Modal differences of Subſtances which we only know, but the <hi>Specifick</hi> Subſtance of any thing is utterly unknown to us, however Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is pleaſed to ſwagger to the contrarie, p. 44, 62. Where he ſeems to miſ-underſtand the Doctor, as if by <hi>Eſſence</hi> he did not underſtand <hi>Subſtance,</hi> as both <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <hi>Eſſentia</hi> uſually ſignifie (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with the Ancients) but any Being at large.</p>
                  <p>But of <hi>Subſtance</hi> it is moſt true, we know it onely by its eſſential <hi>Modes,</hi> but the <hi>Modes</hi> are not the <hi>Subſtance</hi> it ſelf of which they are Modes; otherwiſe the Subſtance would want Modes, or every Subſtance would be more ſubſtances than one. And Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:55102:232"/>
ſaith, pag. 62. <hi>To know an eſſential Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and to know</hi> ipſam eſſentiam ſcientiâ ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daequatâ, <hi>is all one.</hi> Which inadequate or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial knowledge, ſay I, is this, the knowing of the Eſſential Mode of the Subſtance, and not knowing the Subſtance it ſelf; Otherwiſe if both the Eſſential <hi>Modes</hi> were known, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the <hi>Specifick Subſtance</hi> to which the Modes belong (more than that thoſe Modes belong to that Subſtance) the knowledge would be full and adequate, and ſtretcht through the whole Object. So that Mr. <hi>Baxters Scientia inadoequata,</hi> and the Doctors denying the bare Subſtance it ſelf to be known, may very well conſiſt together, and be judged a mere <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Which is an exerciſe more grateful it's likely to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> than to the Doctor.</p>
                  <p>To the third I ſay, Any one that conſiders may find a neceſſarie reaſon why <hi>Quantitie</hi> or <hi>Trina Dimenſio</hi> ſhould be left out in the Form of <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Matter,</hi> eſpecially why the Doctor ſhould leave it out, becauſe he does profeſſedly hold, That whatever is, has <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical</hi> Quantitie or Metaphyſical <hi>Trina Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſio;</hi> Which no man can denie that holds God is <hi>Eſſentially</hi> preſent every-where. And no man, I think, that does not dote can denie that. Wherefore allowing Matter to be <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;</hi> in that <hi>Generical</hi> nature, <hi>Trina Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio</hi> is comprized, and need not be again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in the <hi>Form.</hi> But when in the <hi>Forma</hi>
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:55102:233"/>
or <hi>Differentia,</hi> Diſcerpible and Impenetrable is added, this is that which makes the <hi>Trina Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio</hi> (included in the <hi>Genus, Subſtantia)</hi> of a <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real</hi> kind, and does conſtitute that <hi>Species</hi> of things, which we call <hi>Corpora.</hi> This is ſo plain a buſineſs, that we need inſiſt no longer upon it.</p>
                  <p>Now to the fourth, I anſwer briefly, That from what knowledge we have by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the <hi>Senſes</hi> and inference of the <hi>Intellect,</hi> we arrive not onely to the knowledge of <hi>like things,</hi> but of <hi>unlike,</hi> or rather <hi>contrary:</hi> As in this very example, we being competently well inſtructed, indeed aſſured by our Senſes, that there is ſuch a kind of thing as Body, whoſe nature is to be <hi>Impenetrable</hi> and <hi>Diſcerpible,</hi> and our Reaſon certainly informing us, as was noted even now, that whatever is, has a kind of Amplitude more or leſs, or elſe it would be nothing; hence we are confirmed, that not <hi>Extenſion</hi> or <hi>Trina Dimenſio,</hi> but <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrabilitie</hi> and <hi>Diſcerpibilitie</hi> is the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and adequate nature of what we call <hi>Body;</hi> and if there be any oppoſite ſpecies to <hi>Body,</hi> our Reaſon tells us it muſt have oppoſite Modes or Attributes, which are <hi>Penetrability</hi> and <hi>Indiſcerpibility.</hi> This is a plain truth not to be groped after with our fingers in the dark, but clearly to be diſcerned by the eye of our underſtanding in the light of Reaſon. And thus we ſee (and many examples more we might accumulate) That by the help of our
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:55102:233"/>
                     <hi>Senſes</hi> and <hi>Inference</hi> of our <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> we are able to conclude not onely concerning <hi>like things,</hi> but their <hi>contraries</hi> or <hi>oppoſites.</hi> I muſt confeſs I look upon this allegation of Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> as very weak and faint.</p>
                  <p>And as for his fifth, I do a little marvel that ſo grave and grandaevous a perſon as he ſhould pleaſe himſelf in ſuch little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>irts of Wit and Sophiſtry as this of the <hi>Indiſcerpibility</hi> of an <hi>Atom</hi> or <hi>Phyſical Monad.</hi> As if <hi>Indiſcerpibility</hi> could be none of the eſſential or ſpecifical Modes or Attributes of a Spirit, becauſe a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Monad</hi> or <hi>Atom</hi> is <hi>Indiſcerpible</hi> alſo, which is no Spirit. But thoſe very <hi>Indiſcerpibilities</hi> are <hi>Specifically</hi> different. For that of a <hi>Spirit</hi> is an <hi>Indiſcerpibility</hi> that ariſes from the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive perfection and <hi>Oneneſs</hi> of the Eſſence, be it never ſo <hi>ample;</hi> that of an <hi>Atom</hi> or <hi>Phyſical Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nad,</hi> from imperfection and privativeneſs, from the mere <hi>littleneſs</hi> or ſmalneſs thereof, ſo ſmall that it is impoſſible to be ſmaller, and thence onely is Indiſcerpible.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth alſo is a pretty juvenile Ferk of Wit for a grave ancient Divine to uſe, That <hi>Penetrability</hi> can be no proper Character of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> becauſe Matter can penetrate Spirit as well as Spirit Matter, they both poſſeſſing the ſame ſpace. Suppoſe the bodie A. of the ſame amplitude with the bodie B. and thruſt the bodie A. againſt the bodie B. the bodie A. will not nor can penetrate into the ſame ſpace
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:55102:234"/>
that the bodie B. actually occupies. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the bodie A. a Spirit of that amplitude, and according to its nature piercing into the ſame ſpace which the bodie B. occupies, how plain is it that that active piercing into the ſame ſpace that the bodie B. occupies, is to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the <hi>Spirit</hi> A. &amp; not to the bodie B? For the <hi>bodie</hi> A. could not get in. Theſe are pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie forc'd diſtortions of Wit, but no ſolid me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of due Reaſon. And beſides, it is to be noted, that the main Character of a <hi>Spirit</hi> is, as to <hi>Penetrability,</hi> that <hi>Spirit</hi> can penetrate <hi>Spirit,</hi> but not <hi>Matter Matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now the Seventh is as ſlight as the Fifth. Diverſe Accidents, ſaith he, penetrate their Subjects, as Heat, Cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore <hi>Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trabilitie</hi> is no proper Character of a Spirit. But what a vaſt difference is there here! The one pierce the matter, (or rather are in the matter merely as continued Modes thereof) the other enters into the matter as a diſtinct Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance therefrom. Penetration therefore is here underſtood in this Character of a Spirit, of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netratio Subſtantialis,</hi> when a ſubſtance pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates ſubſtance, as a Spirit does Spirit and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which Matter cannot do. This is a certain Character of a Spirit. And his inſtancing in Light as Indiſcerpible, is as little to the purpoſe. For the ſubſtance of Light, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Materia ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliſſima</hi> and <hi>Globuli,</hi> are diſcerpible. And the motion of them is but a <hi>Modus,</hi> but the point
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:55102:234"/>
in hand is Indiſcerpibilitie of Subſtance.</p>
                  <p>To the Eighth I Anſwer, That Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here is hugely unreaſonable in his demands, as if <hi>Penetrabilitie</hi> of Spirits were not ſufficiently explained, unleſs it can be made out, that all the Spirits in the world, Univerſal and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, may be contracted into one <hi>Punctum:</hi> But this is a Theme that he <hi>loves</hi> to enlarge upon, and to declaim on very Tragically, as <hi>pag.</hi> 52. If Spirits have parts which may be extended and contracted, you will hardly ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily prove as ſay, that God cannot divide them. And when in your Writings ſhall I find ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction into how much ſpace one Spirit may be extended, and into how little it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and whether the whole Spirit of the World may be contracted into a Nut-ſhell or a Box, and the Spirit of a Flea may be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Convex of all the world? And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>pag.</hi> 78. You never tell into how little parts onely it may be contracted; And if you put any limits, I will ſuppoſe that one Spirit hath contracted itſelf into the leaſt compaſs poſſible; and then I ask, Cannot another and another Spirit be in the ſame compaſs by their Penetration? If not; Spirits may have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Spiſſitude which is not Penetrable, and Spirits cannot penetrate contracted Spirits, but onely dilated ones. If yea; then <hi>quaero,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all created Spirits may not be ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. And I ſhould hope that the Definition
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55102:235"/>
of a Spirit excludeth not God, and yet that you do not think that his Eſſence may be contracted and dilated. O that we knew how little we know!</p>
                  <p>This grave moral <hi>Epiphonema</hi> with a ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſhaking of the Head is not in good truth much misbecoming the ſly inſinuating cunning of Mr. <hi>Richard Baxter,</hi> who here makes a ſhew, ſpeaking in the firſt perſon [We] of lamenting and bewailing the ignorance of his own igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but friendly hooks in, by expreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the plural number, the Doctor alſo into the ſame condemnation. <hi>Solamen miſeris—</hi>as if He neither did underſtand his own igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the things he Writes of, but will be ſtrangely ſurpriſed at the hard Riddles Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> has propounded, as if no <hi>Oedipus</hi> were able to ſolve them. And I believe the Doctor if he be called to an account will freely confeſs of himſelf, That in the things he poſitively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces of, ſo far as he pronounces, that he is indeed altogether <hi>ignorant</hi> of any <hi>ignorance</hi> of <hi>his own</hi> therein; But that this is by reaſon that he according to the cautiouſneſs of his Genius does not adventure further than he clearly ſees ground, and the notion appears uſeful for the Publick. As it is indeed uſeful to underſtand that <hi>Spirits</hi> can both <hi>Penetrate</hi> matter and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate one another, elſe God could not be <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially</hi> preſent in all the parts of the <hi>Corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Univerſe, nor the Spirits of Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:55102:235"/>
be in God. Both which notwithſtanding are moſt certainly true, to ſay nothing of the <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> which particular Spirits alſo Penetrate, and are Penetrated by it.</p>
                  <p>But now for the <hi>Contraction</hi> and <hi>Dilatation</hi> of Spirits, that is not a propertie of Spirits in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral as the other are, but of <hi>particular created</hi> Spirits, as the Doctor has declared in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the <hi>Immortalitie of the Soul.</hi> So that that hard Queſtion is eaſily anſwered concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Gods</hi> contracting and dilating himſelf; That he does neither, he being no <hi>created</hi> Spirit, and being more abſolutely perfect than that any ſuch properties ſhould be competible to him. And it is reaſonable to conceive that there is little actually of that propertie in the <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> it being no <hi>particular</hi> Spirit, though <hi>created,</hi> but an Univerſal one, and having no need thereof. For the corporeal world did not grow from a ſmall <hi>Embryo</hi> into that vaſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude it is now of, but was produced of the ſame largeneſs it now has, though there was a ſucceſſive delineation and orderly poliſhing and perfecting the vaſt diſtended parts thereof. And to ſpeak compendiouſly and at once, That God that has Created all things <hi>in number, weight</hi> &amp; <hi>meaſure,</hi> has given ſuch meaſures of <hi>Spiritual Eſſence</hi> and of the facultie of <hi>contracting</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating</hi> the ſame, as alſo of Spiritual <hi>Subtilty</hi> of ſubſtance, as ſerves the ends of his Wiſdom and Goodneſs in creating ſuch a ſpecies of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:55102:236"/>
So that it is fond, unskilful, and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, to ask if the whole Spirit of the world can be contracted into a Nut-ſhell, and the Spirit of a Flea extended to the Convex of the Univerſe. They that talk at this rate err, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liens from the Wiſdome of God, and ignorant of the Laws of Nature, and indeed of the voice of Scripture itſelf. Why ſhould God make the Spirit of a Flea, which was intended for the conſtituting of ſuch a ſmall Animal, large enough to fill the whole world? Or what need of ſuch a contraction in the <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> or <hi>Plaſtick Soul</hi> of the corporeal Univerſe, that it may be contrived into a Nut-ſhell?</p>
                  <p>That it has ſuch <hi>Spiritual ſubtiltie</hi> as that <hi>particular</hi> Spirits may contract themſelves in it ſo cloſe together, as to be commenſurate to the firſt Inchoations of a <hi>Foetus,</hi> which is but very ſmall, ſtands to good reaſon, and Effects prove it to be ſo. As alſo this ſmalneſs of a <hi>Foetus</hi> or <hi>Embryo</hi> that <hi>particular</hi> Spirits are ſo far contracted at firſt, and expand themſelves leiſurely afterwards with the growth of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die which they regulate. But into how much leſſer ſpace they can or do contract themſelves at any time, is needleſs to know or enquire. And there is no Repugnancie at all, but the <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> might be contracted to the like <hi>Eſſential Spiſſitude</hi> that ſome <hi>particular</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are; but there is no reaſon to conceit that it ever was or ever will be ſo contracted, while the World ſtands.</p>

                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:55102:236"/>
Nor laſtly is there any Inconvenience in putting indefinite limits of <hi>Contraction</hi> in a Spirit, and to allow that after ſuch a meaſure of Contraction, though we cannot ſay juſt what that is, it naturally contracts no further, nor does another ſo contracted naturally pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate this thus contracted Spirit. For as the uſefulneſs of that meaſure of <hi>Self-Penetrability</hi> and <hi>Contraction</hi> is plain, ſo it is as plain, that the admitting of it is no incongruitie nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoditie to the Univerſe, nor any confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Specifick</hi> modes of <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Bodie.</hi> For theſe two Spirits, ſuppoſe, contracted to the utmoſt of their natural limits, may natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoid the entring one another, not by a dead <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> as in Bodies or Matter, but by a vital Saturitie, or natural Uneaſineſs in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Beſides that, though at ſuch a contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pitch they are naturally <hi>impenetrable</hi> to one another, yet they demonſtrate ſtill their <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality,</hi> by <hi>Self-Penetration,</hi> haply a thouſand and a thouſand times repeated. And though by a Law of life (not by a dead <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>), they are kept from penetrating one another, yet they both in the mean time neceſſarily pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate Matter, as undergoing the diverſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of <hi>eſſential Spiſſitude</hi> in the ſame. So that by the increaſe of that <hi>eſſential Spiſſitude,</hi> they may approach near to a kind of <hi>Hylopathick</hi> diſpoſition of <hi>Impenetrability,</hi> and thence, by the Matter of the Univerſe (out of which they
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55102:237"/>
never are) be curb'd from contracting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any further, than to ſuch a degree; and I noted at firſt, that <hi>ſpiritual Subtilty,</hi> as well as <hi>Amplitude,</hi> is given in meaſure to created Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.

                     </gap> utmoſt ſenſe thereof. And to argue againſt <hi>Impenetrability</hi> its being the propertie of <hi>Matter</hi> from this kind of Impenetrability of <hi>contracted Spirits,</hi> is like that quibbling So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtrie againſt <hi>Indiſcerpibility</hi> being the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> becauſe a <hi>Phyſical Monad</hi> is alſo <hi>indiſcerpible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ninth Objection is againſt the <hi>Indiſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pibility</hi> of Spirits, and would infer, that becauſe the Doctor makes them intellectually diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, therefore by Divine Power, <hi>if it imply no contradiction,</hi> a Spirit is Diſcerpible into Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal parts. But this is ſo fully ſatisfied alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by the Doctor in his <hi>Diſcourſe of the true Notion of a Spirit,</hi> and its <hi>Defence,</hi> to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what I have ſaid already above to prove it <hi>does imply a contradiction,</hi> that I will let it go, and proceed.</p>
                  <p>To the tenth and laſt Allegation, which pretends, That theſe two terms <hi>Penetrable</hi> and <hi>Indiſcerpible</hi> are <hi>needleſs</hi> and <hi>hazardous</hi> in the Notion of a Spirit. But how <hi>uſeful</hi> or <hi>needful Penetrability</hi> is, is manifeſt from what we have ſaid to the eighth Objection. And the needfulneſs of <hi>Indiſcerpibility</hi> is alſo ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:55102:237"/>
ſhewn by the Doctor in his <hi>Defence of the true Notion of a Spirit,</hi> Sect. 30. But now for the <hi>Hazardouſneſs</hi> of theſe terms, as if they were ſo hard, that it would diſcourage men from the admitting of the Exiſtence of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; It appears from what has been ſaid to the eighth Objection, That <hi>Penetrability</hi> is not onely intelligible and admittable, but neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be admitted, in the Notion of a Spirit, as ſure as God is a Spirit, and that there are Spirits of men and Angels, and that the Souls of men are not made of Shreds, but actuate their whole grown bodie, though at firſt they were contracted into the compaſs of a very ſmall <hi>Foetus.</hi> And that there is no Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie that an Eſſence may be ample, and yet indiſcerpible, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf muſt allow, who, pag. 51. plainly declares, <hi>That it is the vileſt contradiction to ſay that God is capable of diviſion.</hi> So that I wonder that he will call [Penetrable] and [Indiſcerpible] <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>doubtful</hi> words, and ſuch as might ſtumble mens belief of the Exiſtence of Spirits, when they are terms ſo <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>neceſſary.</hi> Nor can that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitie</hi> that belongs to a Spirit be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or underſtood without them, eſpecially without <hi>Indiſcerpibilitie.</hi> And indeed if we do not allow <hi>Penetrability,</hi> the Soul of a man will be far from being <hi>one,</hi> but a thing <hi>diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,</hi> and ſcatter'd in the pores of his corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real conſiſtencie.</p>

We will conclude with Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Conceit of the <hi>Indiviſibleneſs</hi> of a Spirit, and ſee how that will corroborate mens faith of their Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, and put all out of <hi>hazard.</hi> Various Elements, ſaith he, pag. 50. vary in <hi>Diviſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Earth</hi> is moſt diviſible; <hi>Water</hi> more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the parts more inclining to the cloſeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact; <hi>Air</hi> yet more hardly; and in <hi>Fire,</hi> no doubt the <hi>Diſcerpibility</hi> is yet harder: And if God have made a Creature ſo ſtrongly incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the unitie of all the parts, that no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can ſeparate them but God onely, as if a Soul were ſuch, it is plain that ſuch a Being need not fear a diſſolution by Separation of parts. <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is well ſaid for an heedleſs and credulous multitude; but this is not to Philoſophize, but to tell us that God works a perpetual Miracle in holding the ſmall tenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts of the Soul together, more pure and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>auſe, which I am perſwaded he has not ſo little judgment as that he can have any great confidence in. And therefore in ſundry places he intimates that he does allow or at leaſt not deny but that <hi>Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trabilitie</hi> and <hi>Indiſcerpibilitie</hi> is contained in the Notion of a Spirit; but not as part of the <hi>Conceptus formalis,</hi> but as <hi>Diſpoſitio</hi> or <hi>Modus ſubſtantiae,</hi> but yet withal ſuch a <hi>Diſpoſitio</hi> as is <hi>eſſential</hi> to the ſubſtance that with the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptus formalis</hi> added, makes up the true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Spirit.

upon the Doctors Definition of the ſame, which do occur, pag. 80, 81. and elſewhere, as I ſhall advertiſe.</p>
                  <p>The Doctors Definition of a Spirit in his Diſcourſe of that Subject, Sect. 29. is this [A Spirit is a Subſtance immaterial intrinſecally indued with life and the facultie of motion] where he notes that <hi>Immaterial</hi> contains vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in it <hi>Penetrability</hi> and <hi>Indiſcerpibility.</hi> Now let us hear how Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> criticizes on this Definition.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſaies he, pag. 80. Your Definition is common, good and true, allowing for its little imperfections, and the common imperfection of mans knowledge of Spirits. If by [Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial] you mean not [without Subſtance] it ſignifieth truth, but a negation ſpeaketh not a formal Eſſence. <hi>Anſ.</hi> How very little theſe <hi>imperfections</hi> are, I ſhall note by paſſing through them all; and for the <hi>common</hi> imperfection of mans <hi>knowledge of Spirits,</hi> what an unskilful or hypocritical pretence that is, the Doctor hath ſo clearly ſhewn in his <hi>Diſcourſe of the true Notion of a Spirit,</hi> Sect. 16, 17, 18, 19. that it is enough to ſend the Reader thither for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. But as for [Immaterial] how can any one think that thereby is meant [with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Subſtance] but thoſe that think there is nothing but Matter in the Phyſical ſenſe of the word, in the world? As if [Subſtance Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material] was intended to ſignifie [Subſtance
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:55102:240"/>
without Subſtance]! And laſtly, the Doctor will denie that [In] in <hi>Immaterial</hi> ſignifies ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively here more than in <hi>Immortal, Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,</hi> or <hi>Infinite,</hi> but that it is the indication of oppoſite properties to thoſe of <hi>Phyſical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> viz. <hi>Impenetrability</hi> and <hi>Diſcerpibility,</hi> and that therefore <hi>Immaterial</hi> here includes <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerpibility</hi> and <hi>Penetrability.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, pag. 81. Spirit it ſelf, ſaies he, is but a metaphor. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though the word firſt ſignified other things before it was uſed in the ſenſe it is here defined, yet uſe has made it as good as if it were originally <hi>proper.</hi> With your Logicians, in thoſe Definitions, <hi>Materia eſt Cauſa ex qua res eſt, Forma eſt Cauſa per quam res eſt id quod eſt; Materia</hi> and <hi>Forma</hi> are Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical words, but uſe has made them in thoſe Definitions as good as proper; nor does any ſober and knowing man move the leaſt ſcruple touching thoſe Definitions on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. To which you may add, that <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles</hi> caution againſt Metaphors in defining things, is to be underſtood of the Definition it ſelf, not the <hi>Definitum;</hi> but <hi>Spirit</hi> is the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum</hi> here, not the Definition.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, [Intrinſecally indued with liſe] tells us not that it is the <hi>Form.</hi> Qualities, and proper Accidents are <hi>intrinſecal. Anſ.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I ſuppoſe, for clearneſs ſake, would have had <hi>Form</hi> written over the head of this part of the Definition, as the old bungling
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:55102:241"/>
painters were wont to write, This is a Cock, and this a Bull; or as one wittily perſtringed a young Preacher that would name the Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Topicks he took his Arguments from, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was like a Shoemaker that offered his Shoes to ſale with the Laſts in them. I thought Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had been a more nimble Logician than to need ſuch helps to diſcern what is the <hi>Genus</hi> in the Definition, what the <hi>Differentia</hi> or <hi>Forma.</hi> And for [intrinſecally indued] I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he is ignorant of the proper force and ſenſe of the word <hi>Intrinſecùs,</hi> which ſignifies as much as <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Fourthly, The [Facultie of motion] ſaies he, is either a Tautologie included in <hi>Life,</hi> or elſe if explicatorie of <hi>Life,</hi> it is defective. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is neither Tautological nor Exegetical, no more than if a man ſhould define <hi>Homo, Animal ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionale riſibile.</hi> [Riſibile] there, is neither Tautological, though included in <hi>Animal ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale;</hi> nor Exegetical, it ſignifying not the ſame with <hi>Rationale.</hi> And the Definition is as true with <hi>Riſibile</hi> added to it, as if omitted. But the addition of <hi>Riſibile</hi> being needleſs, is indeed ridiculous. But it is not <hi>Ridiculous</hi> to add the faculty of motion in this Definition of a Spirit, becauſe it is not <hi>needleſs,</hi> but is added on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to inſtruct ſuch as Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal facultie</hi> of <hi>motion</hi> belongs to Spirit <hi>quatenus</hi> Spirit, and indued with <hi>Life;</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as yet he, pag. 35. will not admit that ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion is an indication of <hi>Life</hi> in the ſubject that moves itſelf, although it is the very prime argument that his beloved and admired Dr. <hi>Gliſſon</hi> uſeth to prove, that there is <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally life in Matter.</hi> But it is the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome of an over-<hi>Polemical</hi> Fencer, to deny a thing merely becauſe he finds it not for his turn.

                  <p>Sixthly, You do not ſay here, ſaith he, that they are the <hi>Form,</hi> but elſewhere you do; and the Form ſhould be <hi>expreſt,</hi> and not onely <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi> contained, as you ſpeak. <hi>Anſ.</hi> What would you have him in the very Definition it ſelf, which is ſo clear an one, ſay, This is the <hi>Genus,</hi> this the <hi>Form,</hi> as thoſe bunglers I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above writ the names of the Animals they had ſo badly drawn? And that the <hi>Form</hi> ſhould be <hi>expreſt</hi> is true, but it is ſufficient it be expreſt in ſuch a comprehenſive term as contains under it all that belongs to ſuch a

Species. As when we have divided <hi>Vivens</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Planta</hi> and <hi>Animal,</hi> if we then define <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> to be <hi>Vivens ſenſu praeditum,</hi> that one word <hi>ſenſus,</hi> is ſufficient, becauſe it reaches any Species of Animal, and none but Animals. And yet here the Doctor is not ſo niggardly as to pinch the expreſſion of all the Form or Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, into that one word <hi>Immaterial,</hi> whereby he here onely intimates <hi>Penetrability</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerpibility;</hi> but for fuller explication addeth, <hi>Intrinſecally indued with Life and the facultie of motion.</hi> But laſtly, For his elſewhere calling <hi>Penetrability</hi> and <hi>Indiſcerpibility</hi> the <hi>Form</hi> of a Spirit, he nowhere makes them the <hi>whole Form</hi> of a Spirit, but makes the Logical <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Differentia</hi> of a Spirit, to be all that which he has expreſſed in this Definition, <hi>viz.</hi> [Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material] which denotes <hi>Penetrability</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerpibility,</hi> and [Intrinſecal life and motion]. And it is evident that when he calls this <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia</hi> in his Definition, <hi>Form,</hi> that he does not mean the very <hi>ſpecifick</hi> Subſtance or Eſſence, whereby a Spirit is a Spirit, but onely eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or inſeparable <hi>Attributes,</hi> which onely are known to us, and which are only in an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe ſaid to be the <hi>Form</hi> it ſelf, or <hi>ſpecifick</hi> Nature. They are onely the <hi>Reſult</hi> of the <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Notes</hi> of an Eſſence or Subſtance <hi>Specifically</hi> diſtinct from ſome other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p>It is not ſo in <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Forms as in Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical

                     <hi>Forms</hi> or <hi>Figures,</hi> as to Viſibilitie or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibilitie. <hi>Dic tu formam hujus lapidis,</hi> ſays <hi>Scaliger</hi> to <hi>Cardan, &amp; Phyllida ſolus habeto.</hi> But there are inſeparable and eſſential <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of a <hi>ſubſtantial Form,</hi> neceſſarily reſulting from the Form it ſelf, as there are in external Forms or Figures. As for example, from the <hi>form</hi> of a <hi>Globe,</hi> which is a round Form, defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the equalitie of all lines from one point drawn thence to the Superficies. From this form does neceſſarily and inſeparably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Character of an eaſie rouling Mobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. That a bodie of this Form is the moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily moved upon a Plain, of any bodie in the world. And ſo from the <hi>Form</hi> of a piece of Iron made into what we call a <hi>Sword;</hi> Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for ſtriking, for cutting, for ſtabbing, and for defending of the hand, is the neceſſarie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from this Form thereof. And ſo I ſay that from the intimate and eſſential <hi>Form</hi> of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſuppoſe, eſſentially and inſeparably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult ſuch and ſuch properties by which we know that a Spirit is a diſtinct Species from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, though we do not know the very <hi>ſpecifick</hi> eſſence thereof. And therefore here I note by the by, that when the Doctor ſaies any ſuch or ſuch Attributes are the <hi>Form</hi> of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he does <hi>datâ operâ balbutire cum balbutien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus,</hi> and expreſſes himſelf in the language of the Vulgar, and ſpeaks to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his own Dialect. For it is the declared opinion
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:55102:243"/>
of the Doctor, that the intimate <hi>Form</hi> of no Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or Subſtance is knowable, but onely the inſeparable Fruits or Reſults thereof. Which is a Principle wants no proof, but an appeal to every mans faculties that has ordinarie wit and ſinceritie.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, They are not the <hi>Form,</hi> ſaith he, but the <hi>Diſpoſitio vel Conditio ad formam.</hi> Anſ. You may underſtand out of what was ſaid even now, that <hi>Penetrabilitie</hi> and <hi>Indiſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pibilitie</hi> are ſo far from being <hi>Diſpoſitio ad for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam,</hi> that they are the <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Reſults</hi> of the intimate and <hi>Specifick Form</hi> of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and that they ſuppoſe this <hi>Specifick Form</hi> in order of nature to precede them, as the Form of a Globe precedes the rouling mobilitie thereof. In vertue of a Spirits being ſuch a Specifick ſubſtance, it has ſuch inſeparable attributes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from it, as a <hi>Globe</hi> has <hi>mobilitie.</hi> And as the <hi>Globe</hi> is conceived <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>mobilitie</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably reſulting from it; ſo the <hi>Specifick</hi> Nature of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is its true and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Form, and made ſuch according to the eternal Idea thereof in the Intellect of God, being one ſimple <hi>Specifick</hi> ſubſtance or Eſſence, has reſulting from it thoſe eſſential or inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable properties which we attribute to a Spirit, itſelf in the mean time remaining but one ſimple ſelf-ſubſiſtent <hi>Actus Entitativus,</hi> whoſe <hi>Penetrabilitie</hi> and <hi>Indiviſibilitie</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf, pag. 99. ſays is eaſily defendible. And
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:55102:244"/>
the Doctor, who underſtands himſelf, I dare ſay for him, defends the <hi>Penetrabilitie</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſibilitie</hi> of no Eſſences but ſuch.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, If ſuch Modalities, ſays he, or Conſiſtence were the <hi>Form,</hi> more ſuch ſhould be added which are left out. <hi>Anſ.</hi> He ſhould have nominated thoſe which are left out.

                  <p>Ninthly, <hi>Penetrabilitie</hi> and <hi>Indiſcerpibilitie</hi> are two Notions, and you ſhould not give us, ſays he, a <hi>compound</hi> Form. <hi>Anſ.</hi> This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that <hi>Penetrability</hi> and <hi>Indiſcerpibility</hi> are the <hi>Form</hi> of a Spirit; but I have ſaid again and again, they are but the <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Reſult</hi> of the <hi>Form.</hi> A Spirit is one ſimple <hi>Specifick</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or ſubſtance, and that true <hi>Specifickneſs</hi> in its Eſſence, is the <hi>real</hi> and <hi>intimate Form,</hi> or <hi>Conceptus formalis</hi> thereof, but that which we know not (as I noted above out of <hi>Julius Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger)</hi> though we know the eſſential and inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Attributes thereof, which may be <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> though in <hi>one ſimple</hi> ſpecifick Subſtance, as there are many Attributes in God immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inſeparably reſulting from his moſt <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> ſpecifick Nature.</p>

I ſay again as I ſaid before, that neither <hi>Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trability</hi> nor <hi>Indiſcerpibility,</hi> nor <hi>Life</hi> nor <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> are the <hi>ſpecifick Form</hi> it ſelf of a Spirit, which is a ſimple Subſtance, but the <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Reſults</hi> of this <hi>ſpecifick Form;</hi> and all theſe have a proper <hi>Cognation</hi> with one another, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in <hi>Immateriality</hi> or <hi>Spirituality:</hi> and how the common ſagacitie of mankind has preſaged, that the moſt noble functions of life are performed by that which is moſt <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> and moſt <hi>one,</hi> as <hi>Penetrability</hi> and <hi>Indiſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pibility</hi> makes the conſiſtence of a Spirit to be, the Doctor has noted in his <hi>Diſcourſe of the true notion of a Spirit.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in reading Theological Syſtems may obſerve, That Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes as much differing among themſelves as theſe, are given to the moſt ſimple Eſſence of God.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, You ſay, ſays he, pag. 82. Life intrinſecally iſſues from this Immaterial Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: But the <hi>Form</hi> is concreated with it, and iſſues not from it. <hi>Anſ.</hi> I grant that the <hi>Form</hi> is concreated with the Spirit. For a Spirit is nothing elſe but ſuch a <hi>ſpecifick</hi> ſimple Subſtance or Eſſence, the <hi>Specifickneſs</hi> of whoſe
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:55102:245"/>
nature onely is its real intimate <hi>Form.</hi> And if we could reach by our Conception that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Form</hi> it ſelf, it would be but the <hi>Conceptus inadaequatus</hi> of one ſimple Subſtance, and be the true <hi>Conceptus formalis</hi> thereof; and the <hi>Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus fundamentalis,</hi> to ſpeak in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> or Dr. <hi>Gliſſons</hi> language, would be <hi>Subſtance</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> which is contracted into this <hi>Species</hi> by this <hi>real intimate Form;</hi> which both conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered together, being but one ſimple Eſſence, they muſt needs be created together, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that Idea of a Spirit which God has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his eternal mind. And life will as naturally and neceſſarily iſſue from ſuch a <hi>Species</hi> or <hi>Specifick Eſſence,</hi> or from <hi>Subſtance</hi> contracted into ſuch a <hi>Species</hi> by the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Form,</hi> as <hi>Mobility</hi> does iſſue from the form of a Globe. From whence it is plainly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood how Life does intrinſecally iſſue from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material Subſtance, nor is the <hi>Form</hi> it ſelf but the Fruit thereof. And as it were but trifling to ſay that the power of eaſie rolling every way on a Plain were the very Form of a Globe, the word <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Vertue</hi> being but a dark, looſe, general, dilute term, and which belongs to every thing, and is reſtrained onely by its Operation and Object; but it is the Form or Figure of the Globe that is the immediate cauſe that that Vertue or Power in general is ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to this eaſie rolling: ſo it is in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> pretended Form of a Spirit, which he
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:55102:245"/>
makes <hi>Virtus vitalis,</hi> a <hi>power</hi> of living: <hi>Power</hi> there, is ſuch a dark dilute term, looſe and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. But that it is determined to life, it is by that intimate ſpecifick Form, which we know not; but onely this we know, That it is to the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>living</hi> as the Figure of a Globe is to the <hi>Power</hi> of eaſie <hi>rolling,</hi> and that in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one can be without the other. There muſt be a Specifick Eſſence, which is the root of thoſe Powers, Properties, or Operations from whence we conclude diſtinct Species of things: For 'tis too coarſe and ſlovenly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that theſe are clarted on them, but the Specifick Powers ariſe immediately, and inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably from the Specifick Nature of the thing; elſe why might they not be other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as well as theſe?</p>
                  <p>Twelfthly and laſtly, pag. 32. But do you verily believe, ſaith he, that <hi>Penetrability</hi> or <hi>Subtility</hi> is a ſufficient <hi>Efficient</hi> or <hi>Formal</hi> cauſe of Vitalitie, Perception and Appetite, and ſo of Intellection and Volition? I hope you do not. <hi>Anſ.</hi> I hope ſo of the Doctor too; and before this, I hoped that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into the nature of a <hi>Formal cauſe</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Laws of Logick, than once to imagine that any one in his Wits could take <hi>Penetrabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> to be the <hi>Formal cauſe</hi> of <hi>Intellection</hi> and <hi>Volition.</hi> For then every Spirit being <hi>Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable,</hi> every Spirit even of a plant, at leaſt of the vileſt <hi>Animalonium,</hi> would have Intellection
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:55102:246"/>
and Volition. Nor, for the ſame reaſon, can any body think that <hi>Penetrability</hi> is a <hi>ſufficient</hi> Efficient cauſe of Intellection and Volition. Nor is it ſo much as the <hi>Efficient</hi> cauſe of <hi>Vita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Perception, Appetite,</hi> much leſs the <hi>Formal.</hi> So infinitely is Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> out in theſe things. But the caſe ſtands thus: The Subſtance of that ſpecies of things which we call a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and is ſo by that <hi>intimate ſpecifick Form</hi> which I named before, this ſubſtance is the cauſe of <hi>Vitality</hi> in ſuch a ſenſe as the round Form of a Globe, or any matter of that Form is, <hi>quatenus</hi> of that Form, the cauſe of its own rolling Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie. I ſay therefore, that <hi>Vitality</hi> is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and neceſſarie a Fruit or Effect of the <hi>real and intimate Form</hi> of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> as that eaſie mobilitie is of the Form of a Sphere or Globe; And ſuch a kind of <hi>Vitality, Vegetative, Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, Intellective</hi> of ſuch a Species of Spirit: Theſe kinds of <hi>Vitalities</hi> are the Fruits or Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects neceſſarie and immediate of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ſo ſpecificated Subſtances; that is to ſay, they are immediately <hi>Self-living,</hi> and all of them <hi>Penetrable</hi> and <hi>Indiſcerpible</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>quatenus Spirits,</hi> all theſe eſſential attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes ariſing from the ſimple eſſence or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificated ſubſtance of every Spirit, of what Claſſis ſoever, created according to its own Idea eternally ſhining in the Divine Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
                  <p>As for example; In the Idea of a Plaſtick
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:55102:246"/>
Spirit onely; <hi>Penetrability, Indiſcerpibility,</hi> and <hi>Plaſtick Vitality,</hi> whereby it is able to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganize Matter thus and thus, are not three Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences clarted upon ſome fourth Eſſence, or glewed together one to another, to make up ſuch an Idea: But the Divine Intellect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives in itſelf one ſimple ſpecifick Eſſence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and intrinſecally of it ſelf, indued with theſe eſſential Properties or Attributes. So that when any thing does exiſt according to this Idea, thoſe three properties are as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Conſequential to it, and as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as <hi>Mobility</hi> to the <hi>Form</hi> of a <hi>Globe.</hi> It is the <hi>ſpecifick Subſtance</hi> that is the neceſſary Source of them, and that acts by them as its own connate or natural inſtruments, fitted for the ends that the eternal Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God has conceived or contrived them for.</p>
                  <p>For it is manifeſt, that thoſe eſſential Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of a Spirit contrarie to Matter are not in vain. For whenas a <hi>Plaſtick</hi> Spirit is to actuate and organize Matter, and inwardly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it into certain forms, <hi>Penetrability</hi> is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that it may poſſeſs the Matter, and order it throughout; As alſo that <hi>Oneneſs</hi> of Eſſence and <hi>Indiſcerpibility,</hi> that it may hold it toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For what ſhould make any maſs of Matter <hi>one,</hi> but that which has a ſpecial <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of Eſſence in it ſelf, quite different from that of Matter? And foraſmuch as all Souls
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:55102:247"/>
are indued with the <hi>Plaſtick</hi> whether of Brutes or Men, not to add the Spirits of Angels; ſtill there holds the ſame reaſon in all ranks, that Spirits ſhould be as well <hi>Penetrable</hi> and <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerpible</hi> as <hi>Vital.</hi> And if there be any <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi>

                  <p>To return therefore to the particular point we have been about all this while. I hope by this time I have made it good, that the Dr.'s <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition</hi> of a <hi>Spirit</hi> is ſo clear, ſo true, ſo expreſs, and uſefully inſtructive (and that is the ſcope of the Doctors Writings) that neither he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor any body elſe, let them conſider as much as they can, will ever be able to mend it.

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:55102:247"/>
pronounces with a gracious nod, <hi>You mean well—but all our Conceptions here muſt have their ALLOWANCES, and we muſt confeſs their weakneſs.</hi> This is the Sentence which grave Mr. <hi>Baxter, alto ſupercilio,</hi> gives of the Doctors ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate Definition of a Spirit, to humble <hi>him,</hi> and exalt <hi>himſelf,</hi> in the ſight of the <hi>populacie.</hi> But is it not a great weakneſs, or worſe, to talk of favourable <hi>allowances,</hi> and not to <hi>allow</hi> that to be <hi>unexceptionable</hi> againſt which <hi>no juſt exception</hi> is found?</p>
                  <p>But to give Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> his due, though the extream or extimate parts of this Paragraph, pag. 82. which you may fancie as the skin thereof, may ſeem to have ſomething of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs and toughneſs in it, yet the Belly of the Paragraph is full of plums and ſweet things. For he ſaies, <hi>And we are all greatly beholden to the Doctor for his ſo induſtrious calling fooliſh Senſualiſts to the ſtudy and notion of</hi> inviſible <hi>Beings, without which, what a carcaſs or nothing were the world?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But is it not pity then, while the Doctor does diſcharge this Province with that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and induſtrie, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhould diſturb him in his work, and hazzard the fruits and efficacie thereof, by eclipſing the clearneſs of his Notions of <hi>Spiritual</hi> Beings, (for <hi>Bodies</hi> may be alſo <hi>inviſible)</hi> by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition or oppoſition of his own great Name againſt them, who, as himſelf tells the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:55102:248"/>
world in his <hi>Church-Hiſtory,</hi> has wrote <hi>four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Books,</hi> even as old Dr. <hi>Gliſſon</hi> his Patron or rather Pattern in Philoſophy arrived to at leaſt <hi>fourſcore Years</hi> of age? And Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> it ſeems is for the common Proverb, The older the wiſer; though <hi>Elihu</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> be of another mind, who ſaies there, <hi>I ſaid Days ſhould ſpeak, and multitude of Years ſhould teach Wiſdom; But there is a Spirit in man, and the Inſpiration of the Almighty giveth him <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> But whither am I going?</p>
                  <p>I would conclude here according to promiſe, having reſcued the Doctors Definition of a Spirit from Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> numerous little <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſms,</hi> like ſo many ſhrill buſie Gnats trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peting about it, and attempting to inſix their feeble <hi>Proboſcides</hi> into it; and I hope I have ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced them all.</p>
                  <p>But there is ſomething in the very next Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph which is ſo wrongfully charged upon the Doctor, that I cannot forbear ſtanding up in his juſtification. The Charge is this: That he has fathered upon Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> an Opinion he never owned, and nick-named him <hi>Pſycho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyriſt</hi> from his own fiction. As if, ſays he, we ſaid that <hi>Souls</hi> are <hi>Fire,</hi> and alſo took <hi>Fire,</hi> as the Doctor does, for <hi>Candles</hi> and <hi>hot Irons,</hi> &amp;c. onely. But I anſwer in behalf of the Doctor, as I have a little toucht on this matter before, That he does indeed entitle a certain Letter (which he anſwers) to a <hi>Learned Pſychopyriſt</hi>
                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:55102:248"/>
as the Author thereof: But Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> name is with all imaginable care concealed. So that he by his needleſs owning the Letter, has notch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that nick-name (as he calls it) of <hi>Pſycho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyriſt</hi> upon himſelf, whether out of greedineſs after that alluring Epithet it is baited with, I know not; but that he hangs thus by the gills like a Fiſh upon the Hook, he may thank his own ſelf for it, nor ought to blame the Doctor. Much leſs accuſe him for ſaying, that Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> took <hi>Fire</hi> in no other ſenſe than that in Candles and hot Iron, and the like. For in his <hi>Preface,</hi> he expreſly declares on the <hi>Pſychopy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts</hi> behalf, that he does not make this <hi>craſs</hi> and <hi>viſible</hi> Fire the Eſſence of a Spirit, but that his meaning is more ſubtile and refined. With what conſcience then can Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſay, that the Doctor affirms that he took Fire in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe than that in Candles and hot Iron, and the like, and that he held <hi>all</hi> Souls to be ſuch Fire? whenas the Doctor is ſo modeſt and cautious, that he does not affirm that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> thinks any to be ſuch; though even in this <hi>Placid Collation,</hi> he profeſſes his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards the Opinion, that <hi>Ignis</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative Spirit</hi> is all one, pag. 20, 21. I have oft profeſſed, ſaith he, that I am ignorant whether <hi>Ignis</hi> and <hi>Vegetative Spirit</hi> be all one, (to which I moſt incline) or whether <hi>Ignis</hi> be an active nature made to be the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which the three ſpiritual natures,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:55102:249"/>
                     <hi>Vegetative, Senſitive,</hi> and <hi>Mental</hi> work on the three paſſive natures, Earth, Water, <hi>Air.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And again, pag. 66. If it be the Spirit of the world that is the neareſt cauſe of illumination, by way of natural activity, then that which you call the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> I call <hi>Fire;</hi> and ſo we differ but <hi>de nomine.</hi> But I have (ſaith he as before) profeſſed my ignorance, whether <hi>Fire</hi> and the <hi>Vegetative nature</hi> be all one, (which I incline to think) or whether <hi>Fire</hi> be a middle active nature between the <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> and the mere <hi>Paſſive,</hi> by which <hi>Spirits</hi> work on <hi>bodie.</hi> And, pag. 71. I doubt not but <hi>Fire</hi> is a Subſtance permeant and exiſtent in all mixt bodies on Earth. In your bloud it is the prime part of that called the Spirits, which are nothing but the <hi>igneous</hi> principle in a pure Aereal Vehicle, and is the organ of the <hi>Senſitive</hi> faculties of the Soul. And if the Soul carry any Vehicle with it, it's like to be ſome of this. I doubt you take the ſame thing to be the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> though you ſeem to vilifie it. And, pag. 74. I ſuppoſe you will ſay, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the world does this. But call it by what name you will, it is a pure active Subſtance, whoſe form is the <hi>Virtus motiva, illuminativa &amp; calefactiva,</hi> I think the ſame which when it operateth on due ſeminal Matter is <hi>Vegetative.</hi> And laſtly, pag. 86. I ſtill profeſs my ſelf in this alſo uncertain, whether <hi>Natura Vegetativa</hi>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:55102:249"/>
and <hi>Ignea</hi> be all one, or whether <hi>Ignis</hi> be <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura Organica</hi> by which the three <hi>Superiour</hi> (he means the <hi>Vegetative, Senſitive,</hi> and <hi>Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi> Natures) operate on the <hi>Paſſive.</hi> But I incline moſt to think they are all one, when I ſee what a glorious <hi>Fire</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> is, and what operation it hath on Earth, and how unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is that ſo glorious a Subſtance ſhould not have as noble a formal nature as a Plant.</p>
                  <p>This is more than enough to prove that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in the moſt proper ſenſe is inclined to <hi>Pſychopyriſm</hi> as to the <hi>Spirit of the world,</hi> or <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative ſoul</hi> of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe;</hi> that that <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> is <hi>Fire:</hi> And that all <hi>created</hi> Spirits are <hi>Fire, analogicè</hi> and <hi>eminenter,</hi> I have noted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that he does freely confeſs.</p>
                  <p>But certainly if it had not been for his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the Atomick Philoſophie which he ſo greatly deſpiſeth, he would never have taken the <hi>Fire</hi> it ſelf, a <hi>Congeries</hi> of agitated particles of ſuch figures and dimenſions, for the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>world.</hi> But without further doubt have concluded it onely the inſtrument of that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in its operations, as alſo of all other created Spirits, accordingly as the Doctor has declared a long time ſince in his <hi>Immortalitas Animae,</hi> Lib. 2. Cap. 8. Sect. 6. And finding that there is one ſuch univerſal <hi>Vegetative</hi> Spirit (properly ſo called) or <gap reason="foreign">

great <hi>Plant,</hi> or if ſome obſcure degree of ſenſe be given to it, one large <hi>Zoophyton</hi> or <hi>Plant-ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,</hi> whence the Sun will be endued or actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as much by a <hi>Vegetative</hi> Nature as any particular Plant whatſoever; whereby Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> might have took away his own diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie he was entangled in. But the truth is, Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> defectiveneſs in the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the <hi>Atomick Philoſophy,</hi> and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs therefrom, as alſo from the <hi>true Syſtem of the world,</hi> which neceſſarily includes the <hi>motion of the Earth,</hi> we will caſt in alſo his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence from the <hi>Pre-exiſtence of Souls</hi> (which three Theories are hugely neceſſary to him that would Philoſophize with any ſucceſs in the deepeſt points of natural Religion and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence) makes him utter many things that will by no means bear the Teſt of ſeverer Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>But in the mean time this Deſectiveneſs in ſound Philoſophie neither hinders him nor any one elſe from being able Inſtruments in the Goſpel-Miniſtrie, if they have <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>But if any ſuch, as I noted above, for that they conceit themſelves alſo dapper fellows at Cudgils or Quarter-ſtaff, ſhall, leaving their Flocks ſolitary in the fields, out of an itch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter applauſe from the Country-Fry, gad to Wakes and Fairs to give a proof of their dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity at thoſe Rural exerciſes; if they ſhall, I ſay, for their pains return with a bruiſed knuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle or broken pate, who can help it? it will learn them more wit another time.

So that he may either enjoy his Repoſe, or betake

himſelf to ſome deſign of more uſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, I having diſpatcht my <hi>Digreſſion,</hi> I ſhall return to the main buſineſs in hand. I think it may plainly appear from what has been ſaid, that it is no ſuch harſh thing to adventure to conclude, That the Truth of the Divine Intellect <hi>quatenus conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive, ſpeculative,</hi> or <hi>obſervative,</hi> which a <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonist</hi> would be apt to call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Intellect <hi>exhibitive</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, (for though it be but one and the ſame Intellect, yet for diſtinctneſs ſake we are fain to ſpeak as of two) does conſiſt in its Conformity with the Divine Intellect <hi>exhibitive,</hi> with the immutable Idea's, Reſpects and References of things there. In conceiving and obſerving them (as I may ſo ſpeak) to be ſuch as they are repreſented in the ſaid Intellect <hi>quatenus</hi> neceſſarily and unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly repreſenting ſuch Idea's with the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Reſpects and References of them. In this conſiſts the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Divine Intellect <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative.</hi> But the Tranſcendental Truth of things conſiſts in their Conformity to the Divine Intellect <hi>Exhibitive.</hi> For every thing is true as it anſwers to the immutable Idea of its own nature diſcovered in the Divine Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect <hi>Exhibitive.</hi> To which alſo the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Intellect <hi>quatenus Conceptive, Speculative,</hi> or <hi>Obſervative,</hi> gives its ſuffrage ſteadily and unalterably, conceiving theſe immutable Idea's
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:55102:251"/>
of things in their <hi>Objective Exiſtence</hi> what their natures will be, with their neceſſary refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, aptitudes or ineptitudes to other things when they are produced into act.</p>
                  <p>From whence we may diſcern, how that ſaying of this ingenious Author of the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Truth</hi> is to be underſtood. Where he writes, <hi>It is againſt the nature of all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to make its Object.</hi> Which if we will candidly interpret, muſt be underſtood of all underſtanding <hi>quatenus</hi> merely <hi>conceptive, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative</hi> or <hi>obſervative,</hi> and of framing of its Object at its pleaſure. Which as it is not done in the ſetled Idea of a Sphere, Cylinder and Pyramid, no more is it in any other Idea's with their properties and aptitudes immediately iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing from them, but all the Idea's with their inevitable properties, aptitudes, or ineptitudes are neceſſarily repreſented in the Divine Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect <hi>Exhibitive,</hi> immutably ſuch as they are, a Triangle with its three Angles equal to two right ones, a right-angled Triangle with the power of its <hi>Hypotenuſa</hi> equal to the powers of the <hi>Baſis</hi> and <hi>Cathetus</hi> both put together: Which things ſeem neceſſary to every ſober man and rightly in his wits, our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding being an <hi>Abſtract</hi> or <hi>Copy</hi> of the Divine Underſtanding. But thoſe that ſay that if God would, he might have made the three An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of a Triangle unequal to two right ones, and alſo the powers of the <hi>Baſis</hi> and <hi>Cathetus</hi>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:55102:252"/>
of a right-angled Triangle unequal to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the <hi>Hypotenuſa,</hi> are either Buffoons and Quibblers, or their Underſtandings being but creatural huffineſs of mind and an ambition of approving themſelves the Broachers and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of ſtrange Paradoxes, has crazed their Intellectuals, and they have already entred the ſuburbs of down-right Phrenſie and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude; Out of what has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated, we may reconcile this harſh ſounding Paradox of our Author, that ſeems ſo point-blank againſt the current doctrine of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſical Schools, who make Tranſcendental Truth to depend upon the Intellectual Truth of God, which they rightly deem the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Origine of all Truth, whenas he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declares, <hi>That the Divine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Fountain of the Truth of things:</hi> But the ſeeming abſurdity will be eaſily wiped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, if we take notice of our diſtinction touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Divine Underſtanding <hi>quatenus</hi> merely <hi>conceptive, ſpeculative</hi> or <hi>obſervative,</hi> and <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus</hi> neceſſarily (through its own infinite and immutable pregnancie and foecundity) <hi>Exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> of the diſtinct and determinate Idea's or natures of things, with their immediate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, Reſpects or Habitudes in their <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective Exiſtence,</hi> repreſenting them ſuch as they certainly will be if reduced into act. His aſſertion is not to be underſtood of the Divine
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:55102:252"/>
Underſtanding in this latter ſenſe, but in the former. But being it is one and the ſame Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, though conſidered under this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Notion, our Author, as well as the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Metaphyſicians, will agree to this truth in the ſenſe explained; That the Divine Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is the Fountain of the truth of things, and that they are truly what they are, as they anſwer to their Idea's repreſented in the <hi>Exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitive</hi> Intellect of God. How the Author himſelf comes off in this point, you will better underſtand when you have read the fifteenth, ſixteenth and ſeventeenth Sections of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Let this ſuffice in the mean time for the removing all ſtumbling-blocks from before the Reader.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 168. <hi>Nor the foundation of the referen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces one to another;</hi> that is to ſay, The Divine Underſtanding <hi>quatenus Conceptive</hi> or <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative,</hi> is moſt certainly not the Foundation of the references of things one to another; but the Divine Underſtanding <hi>quatenus Exhibitive,</hi> that repreſents the Idea's or natures of things in their <hi>Objective Exiſtence</hi> ſuch as they would be if reduced really into act, repreſents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all the references and habitudes they have one to another. Which habitudes are repreſented not as flowing from or arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly founded in any Intellect whatſoever, but as reſulting from the natures of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that reſpect one another, and are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:55102:253"/>
in the <hi>Exhibitive</hi> Underſtanding of God. Which is the main thing that this inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Author would be at, and ſuch as will ſerve all his intents and purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 168. <hi>It is the nature of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding ut moveatur, illuminetur,</hi> &amp;c. namely, of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding <hi>quatenus Conceptive</hi> or <hi>Speculative,</hi> not <hi>quatenus Exhibitive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pag. 169. <hi>No Idea's or Repreſentations either are or make the things they repreſent,</hi> &amp;c. This Aſſertion is moſt certainly true. But yet they may be ſuch Idea's and Repreſentations as may be the meaſure of the Truth of thoſe things they repreſent: And ſuch are all the Idea's in the Divine Intellect <hi>Exhibitive,</hi> their ſetled di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct natures neceſſarily exhibited there in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the abſolute perfection of the Deitie, though onely in their <hi>Objective Exiſtence,</hi> are the meaſures of the Truth of thoſe things when they are reduced into act, as I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above; but they are not the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves reduced into act, no more than an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tographon is the very Copy.</p>
                  <p>Ibid. <hi>All <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding is ſuch;</hi> that is, Idea's and Repreſentations of the natures of things in their <hi>Objective Exiſtence,</hi> the Patterns of what and how they are when they Exiſt, and what references and aptitudes they have. I ſuppoſe he means here by Underſtanding, not any power of the mind to conceive any thing, but Underſtanding properly ſo called,

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> ſpeak, the Idea's or Repreſentations of ſuch things as are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily and unalterably ſuch, not fictions at pleaſure. Let the Intellect <hi>Speculative</hi> be ſuch Idea's or Repreſentations as theſe, and then what it perceives, conceives, or obſerves, it does not make, but it is made to its hand, as not being able to be otherwiſe, nor it ſelf to think otherwiſe. And therefore it is rightly inferred as follows: That no Speculative Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in that reſtrict ſenſe above-named makes at pleaſure the natures, reſpects and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of its Objects repreſented in the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect <hi>Exhibitive</hi> in their <hi>Objective Exiſtence,</hi> but finds them there. Nor does any Intellect whatſoever make them at pleaſure, but they are neceſſarily and unalterably repreſented in the <hi>Exhibitive</hi> Intellect of the Deitie, both their natures, reſpects, and habitudes, as I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above.</p>
                  <p>Sect. 5. pag. 169. <hi>It remains then that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, arbitrarious and independent Will muſt be the Fountain of all Truth,</hi> &amp;c. It being ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that the Divine Underſtanding and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Will of God are the onely competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours who ſhould be the Fountain of all Truth, and the former Section proving in a ſenſe rightly underſtood, that the Divine Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding cannot be the Fountain of Truth, it remains that the mere Will of God ſhould be
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:55102:254"/>
the Fountain of Truth, and that things are true onely becauſe he wills they be ſo. As if four bore a double proportion to two becauſe God would have it ſo; but if he would that Two ſhould bear a double proportion to Four, it would immediately be ſo.</p>
                  <p>Ibid. <hi>Which Aſſertion would in the firſt place deſtroy the nature of God,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, if he will, it deſtroys his very <hi>Exiſtence.</hi> For if all Truths depend upon Gods Will, then this Truth, <hi>That God Exiſts,</hi> does. And if he will the contrary to be true, namely, That he does not Exiſt, what becomes of him then?</p>
                  <p>Ibid. <hi>And rob him of all his Attributes.</hi> That it robs him of Science and aſſured Knowledge, whoſe Objects are <gap reason="foreign">

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this ſuppoſition takes away all the ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and ſcientifick Knowableneſs in things, it taking away their ſetled, fixt and neceſſary ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitudes one to another, as if <hi>double</hi> proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Four to Two did no more belong to it in Truth and Reality than <hi>Sub-double,</hi> and that Four in Truth were no more the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternarie number than the Binary, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently either, as the Will of God will
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:55102:254"/>
have it. This plainly pulls up by the roots all pretence of Science or Knowledge in God, Angels, and Men. And much more, flatly to aſſert, That if God will, contradictions may be true. For this plainly implies that there is really no Repugnancy nor Connection of one thing with another, and that therefore no one thing can be proved or diſproved from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 171. <hi>If we diſtinguiſh thoſe two Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes in God,</hi> &amp;c. namely, of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> as if the one were <hi>Noematical,</hi> the other <hi>Dianoetical;</hi> although that diſcurſiveneſs is more quick than lightning, or rather an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intuitive diſcernment of the conſequence or coheſion of things at once.</p>
                  <p>Sect. 6. pag. 172. <hi>Becauſe they ſuppoſe that God is mutable and changeable,</hi> &amp;c. This can be no allegation againſt the other Arguings, becauſe we cannot be aſſured of the Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or Unchangeableneſs of God, but by admitting of what thoſe arguings drive at, namely, That there is an immutable, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and unchangeable reference and reſpect or connection of things one with another. As for example, of Immutableneſs or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs with Perfection, and of Perfection with God. For to fancie God an imperfect Being is nonſenſe to all men that are not delirant; and to fancie him Perfect, and yet Changeable in ſuch a ſenſe as is here underſtood, is as arrant
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:55102:255"/>
a Contradiction or Repugnancie. Wherefore they that would oppoſe the fore-going Algu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by ſuppoſing God Unchangeable, muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge what is aimed at, That there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and unchangeable reſpect and connection betwixt things, or elſe their oppoſition is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weak and vain. But if they grant this, they grant the Cauſe, and ſo Truth has its juſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and triumph. This Section is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly clear of it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Sect. 8. pag. 174. <hi>Will ſpoil God of that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Rectitude which is the greateſt perfection of his nature,</hi> &amp;c. In the fifth Section it was ſaid, That the making the Will of God the Fountain of all Truth robs him of all his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes. And there it is proved how it robs him of his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Knowledge.</hi> Here it is ſhewn how it robs him of his <hi>Juſtice, Mercy, Faithfulneſs, Goodneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 175. <hi>For to ſay they are indiſpenſably ſo becauſe God underſtands them ſo,</hi> &amp;c. This, as the Author ſaies, muſt be extream Incogitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. For the Truth of the Divine Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Speculative</hi> conſiſts in its Conformitie with the Idea's of things and their Reſpects and Habitudes in the Divine Underſtanding <hi>Exhibitive,</hi> which neceſſarily, unchangeably and unalterably repreſents the natures of things with their Reſpects and Habitudes in their <hi>Objective Exiſtence,</hi> ſuch as they neceſſarily are when they do really exiſt. As of a Sphere,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:55102:255"/>
Pyramid, Cube and Cylinder. And there is the ſame reaſon of all natures elſe with their Reſpects and Habitudes, that they are as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily exhibited as the Cube and Cylinder, and their Habitudes and Reſpects one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the proportion that a Cylinder bears to a Sphere or Globe of the ſame altitude and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual diameter. Which <hi>Archimedes</hi> with incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable clearneſs and ſubtiltie of wit has demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in his Treatiſe <hi>De Sphaera &amp; Cylindro,</hi> to be <hi>ratio ſeſquealtera,</hi> as alſo the Superficies of the Cylinder with its Baſes to bear the ſame proportion to the Superſicies of the Sphere.

And the nature of Juſtice, Mercy, Faithfulneſs and Goodneſs are with their habitudes and reſpects as ſixedly, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately and unalterably repreſented in their Idea's, as the Sphere and Cylinder, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Form or Being whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Sect. 9. pag. 178. <hi>For we are to know that there is a God, and the Will of God,</hi> &amp;c. That is to ſay, If there be no ſetled natures and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and habitudes of things in the order of Nature antecedent to any <hi>Will</hi> whatever, Meditation or Contrivance, nor there be any certain nature, reſpects, habitudes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections of things in themſelves; it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that we firſt know there is a God, and

what his <hi>Will</hi> is touching the natures, reſpects and habitudes of things. Whether theſe which we ſeem to diſcern and do argue from are the ſame he means and wills, or ſome other. And ſo there will be a neceſſity of knowing God and his Will, before we have any means to know him; or, which is all one, we ſhall never have any means to know him upon this falſe and abſurd Hypotheſis.</p>
                  <p>Sect. 11. pag. 181. <hi>Then it infallibly follows that it is all one what I do or how I live,</hi> &amp;c. This, as the following words intimate, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in reference to the pleaſing God, and to our own future Happineſs. But it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt it is not all one what I do or how I live (though I did ſuppoſe there were no real di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betwixt Truth and Falſhood, Good and Evil in the ſenſe here intended) in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to this preſent condition in this World, where the ſenſe of pain and eaſe, of impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and liberty, and of the ſecurity or ſaſety of a mans own perſon will oblige him to order his life in ſuch a manner as hath at leaſt the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Temperance, Faithfulneſs, and Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Sect. 12. pag. 183. <hi>If the oppoſition of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory Terms depend upon the arbitrarious reſolves of any Being whatſoever.</hi> The plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and irrefragableneſs of this Truth, that the oppoſition of contradictory Terms is an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, habitude or <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:55102:256"/>
methinks ſhould aſſure any that are not pure Sots or crazie Fantaſticks, that there may be many other ſuch unalterable and immutable habitudes of Terms, Natures or Things that are every jot as unaboliſhable as this. Which is no derogation to the Divine Perfection, but an Argument of it; unleſs we ſhould conceit that it is the height of the Perfection of Divine Omnipotence to be able to deſtroy himſelf. And truly to fancie an ability in him of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or aboliſhing thoſe eternal, neceſſary and immutable habitudes or reſpects of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of things repreſented in their Idea's by the Divine Intellect <hi>Exhibitive,</hi> is little leſs than the admitting in God an ability of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying or aboliſhing the Divine Nature it ſelf, becauſe <hi>ipſo facto</hi> the Divine Wiſdom and Knowledge would be deſtroyed, as was ſhewn in the fifth Section, and what a God would that be that is deſtitute thereof!</p>
                  <p>Wherefore it is no wonder that thoſe men that are ſober and in their wits, find it ſo impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in themſelves but to conceive that ſuch and ſuch natures are ſteadily ſuch and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and betwixt ſuch and ſuch natures there are ſteadily and immutably ſuch habitudes and reſpects and no others. Foraſmuch as the Intellect of man is as it were a ſmall compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Tranſcript of the Divine Intellect, and we feel in a manner in our own Intellects the firmneſs and immutability of the Divine, and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:55102:257"/>
of the eternal and immutable Truths exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there. So that thoſe that have their minds ſo crackt and ſhatter'd as to be able to fancy that if God would, he could change the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Pag. 184. <hi>If any one ſhould affirm that the Terms of common notions have an eternal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable relation to one another,</hi> &amp;c. That this priviledge is not confined to the common notions they are abundantly convinced of, that have beſtowed any competent ſtudy upon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, where the connection of every link of the demonſtration is diſcerned to be as firmly and indiflolubly knit, as the Terms of a common notion are the one with the other. And it is our Impatience, Careleſneſs or Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices that we have not more concluſions of ſuch certitude than we have in other ſtudies alſo.</p>
                  <p>Sect. 13. pag. 184. <hi>For if there be Truth antecedently to the Divine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> &amp;c. This Objection of the Adverſaries is framed ſomething perverſly and invidiouſly, as if the other party held, That there were Truth ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently to the Divine Underſtanding, and as if from thence the Divine Underſtanding would be a mere paſſive Principle actuated by ſomething without, as the Eye by the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:55102:257"/>
Sun. But it is a plain caſe, out of what has been declared, that the Divine Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (though there be ſuch eternal Natures and unchangeable reſpects and habitudes of them repreſented in the Idea's that are in the <hi>Exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitive</hi> Intellect of the Deity) that it is, I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any external Object whatever, and yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had exhibited to it ſelf the eternal and unalterable natures and reſpects of things in their Idea's. And it was noted moreover, that the Truth of the external Objects, when brought into act, is meaſured by their Conformity to theſe Idea's.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the Divine Underſtanding being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things, how could there be any Truth before it, there being neither Underſtanding nor Things in which this Truth might reſide? Or the Divine Underſtanding be a mere paſſive Principle actuated by ſomething without, as the eye by the Sun, whenas queſtionleſs the Divine Intellect <hi>quatenus Exhibitive</hi> is the moſt active Principle conceivable; nay, indeed <hi>Actus puriſſimus,</hi> the moſt pure Act, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has defined God? It is an eternal, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and immutable Energy, whoſe very Eſſence is a true and fixt Ideal Repreſentation of the natures of all things, with their reſpects and habitudes reſulting eternally from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine foecundity at once. How then can this, which is ſo pure and pregnant an Energy, be a mere paſſive Principle, or be actuated by any
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:55102:258"/>
external Object, when it was before any thing was? But a further Anſwer is to be found of the Authour himſelf in the Fifteenth Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 185. <hi>Which is to take away his inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency and ſelf ſufficiency.</hi> Namely, If there be mutual and unalterable <hi>Congruities</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruities</hi> of things, as if they would deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine God in his actions by ſomething without himſelf. Which is a mere miſtake. For the pregnant fulneſs of the Divine Eſſence and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection eternally and neceſſarily exerting itſelf into an Ideal diſplay of all the natures, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, reſpects and habitudes of things, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Congruities or Incogruities, and theſe fixt, immutable, neceſſary and unchangeable in their Ideal or <hi>Objective Exiſtence;</hi> And in time producing things according to theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radigms or Patterns into actual Exiſtence by his Omnipotence, and ever ſuſtaining, ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and governing them by his unfailing Power and ſteady and unchangeable Wiſdom and Counſel; I ſay, when all things are thus from God, ſuſtained by God, and regulated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the natures he has given them, which anſwer the Patterns and Paradigms in him, how can any ſuch determination of his Will any way claſh with his Self-ſufficiency or Independency, whenas we ſee thus, that all things are from God and depend of him, and his actions guided by the immutable Idea's in
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:55102:258"/>
his own nature, according to which all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things are what they are, and their Truth meaſured by their Conformity with them. But there is a fuller anſwer of the Author's, to this Objection, in the ſixteenth and ſeventeenth Sections.</p>
                  <p>Sect. 14. pag. 187. <hi>And to fetter and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Freedom and Liberty it ſelf in the fatal and immutable chains and reſpects of things,</hi> &amp;c. This is a miſconceit that ſavours ſomething of a more refined <hi>Anthropomorphitiſm,</hi> that is to ſay, Though they do not make the Eſſence of God finite and of an Humane figure or ſhape, yet they imagine him to have two different Principles in him, an extravagant and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined luſt or appetite, as it is in man, and an Intellectual or rational Principle, whoſe Laws are to correct the luxuriancies and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſities of the other, and to bridle and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate them. But this is a groſs miſtake; For there is no ſuch blind and impetuous will in God upon which any Intellectual Laws were to lay a reſtraint, but his whole nature being <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>Intellectual,</hi> and he acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own nature, which contains thoſe Idea's and immutable reſpects, Congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities and Incongruities of things there eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unalterably repreſented, he acts with all freedom imaginable, nor has any chains of reſtraint laid upon him, but is at perfect liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do as his own nature requires and ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:55102:259"/>
Which is the moſt abſolute liberty that has any ſound or ſhew of Perfection with it, that can be conceived in any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Sect. 15. pag. 189. <hi>And does as it were draw them up into its own beams.</hi> This is ſomething a ſublime and elevate expreſſion. But I ſuppoſe the meaning thereof is, That the natures and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects of the things of this lower Creation, the Divine Underſtanding applies to the bright ſhining Idea's found in his own exalted nature, and obſerves their Conformity therewith, and acknowledges them true and right as they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their eternal Patterns.</p>
                  <p>Sect. 16. pag. 189. <hi>To tie up God in his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the reaſon of things, deſtroys his Liberty, Abſoluteneſs, and Independency.</hi> This is ſaid, but it is a very vain and weak allegation, as may appear out of what has been ſuggeſted above. For reaſons of things and their habitudes and references repreſented in the eternal Idea's in their <hi>Objective Exiſtence,</hi> which is the Pattern of their natures when they exiſt actually, is the very life and nature of the Divine Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; And as I noted above, the moſt true and perfective libertie that can be conceived in any Being is, that without any check or tug, or lubricity and unſteadineſs, it act according to its own life and nature. And what greater Abſoluteneſs than this? For that which acts according to its own nature, acts alſo according
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:55102:259"/>
to its own will or appetite. And what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Independencie than to have a power upon which there is no reſtraint, nor any modification of the exerciſe thereof, but what is taken from that which has this power? For the eternal and immutable reaſons of things are originally and Paradigmatically in the Divine Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, of which thoſe in the Creatures are but the Types and tranſitorie Shadows. The Author in this Section has ſpoke ſo well to this preſent Point, that it is needleſs to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>add any thing more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect. 17. pag.</hi> 191. In this ſeventeenth Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the Author more fully anſwers that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, As if Gods acting according to the reaſons of things inferred a dependency of him upon ſomething without himſelf; Which he does with that clearneſs and ſatisfaction, that it is enough to commend it to the peruſal of the Reader.</p>
                  <p>Sect. 18. pag. 193. <hi>Truth in the power or faculty is nothing elſe but a Conformity of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions or Idea's unto the natures and relations of things which in God we may call,</hi> &amp;c. The Deſcription which follows is (though the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor nowhere takes notice of that diſtinction) a Deſcription of the Divine Underſtanding <hi>quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Exhibitive,</hi> not <hi>Conceptive</hi> or <hi>Speculative.</hi> The Truth of which latter does indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the Conformity of its Conception unto the natures and relations of things, but not

                  <p>Pag. 194. <hi>Now all that Truth that is in any created Being, is by participation and derivation from this firſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> (that is, from the Divine Underſtanding <hi>quatenus Exhibitive) and Fountain of Intellectual Light.</hi> That is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Platonick</hi> Dialect, of thoſe ſteady, unalterable and eternal Idea's (<gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Pag. 195. <hi>For things are what they are, and cannot be otherwiſe without a Contradiction,</hi> &amp;c. This was true before any external or created things did exiſt. True of every <hi>Form</hi> in that eternal <hi>Omniformity,</hi> which the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> call the Intellectual World, as the Author has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved above in this Section. A Circle is a Circle, and a Triangle a Triangle there, nor can be otherwiſe without a Contradiction. And ſo of a Globe, Cylinder, Horſe, Eagle, Whale, Fire, Water, Earth, their Ideal fixt and determinate natures, habitudes, aptitudes, and reſpects neceſſarily and immutably there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, are ſuch as they are, nor can be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe without a contradiction. And becauſe it is thus in the Divine Nature or Eſſence, which is the root and fountain of the exteriour Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:55102:261"/>
the ſame is true in the created Beings themſelves. Things are there alſo what they are, nor can they be a Globe ſuppoſe, or a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder, and yet not be a Globe or a Cylinder at once, or be both a Globe and Cylinder at once; and ſo of the reſt.

Which I thought fit to take notice of, as well for the inſtruction of others, as for a due Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretiation of theſe two brief Treatiſes of theſe

                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful,</hi> I ſay, and not a little <hi>grateful</hi> to men of refined Fancies and gay Intellectuals, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign and Philoſophical tempers, and Lovers of great Truths and Goodneſs. Which natural conſtitution were a tranſcendent priviledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, were there not one great danger in it to thoſe that know not how to uſe it skilfully. For it does ſo nearly ape, as I may ſo ſpeak, the Divine Benignity it ſelf, and that unſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſſed Love that does truly ariſe from no other ſeed than that of real Regeneration (which Self-mortification and a ſerious endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of aboliſhing or utterly demoliſhing our own will, and quitting any thing that would captivate us, and hinder our union with God and his Chriſt, does neceſſarily precede) that too haſtily ſetting up our reſt in theſe mere complexional attainments, which is not <hi>Spirit</hi> but <hi>Fleſh,</hi> though it appear marvellous ſweet and goodly to the owner, if there be not due care taken to advance higher in that Divine and Eternal Principle of real Regeneration, by a conſtant mortification of our own will, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e may be a perpetual hazzard of this <hi>Fleſh</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:55102:263"/>
corrupt and fly-blown, and ſending up at laſt no ſweet ſavour into the noſtrils of the Almighty. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh, and that which is born of the ſpirit is ſpirit;</hi> And all fleſh is graſs, and the beauty thereof as the flower of the field; but that which is born of the eternal Seed of the living Word, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>And therefore there is no ſafe Anchorage for the Soul, but in a perpetual endeavour of annihilating of her own Will, that we may be one with Chriſt, as Chriſt is with God. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe if we follow the ſweet enticing Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of mere Nature, though it look never ſo ſmugly on it, it will ſeduce us into a falſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and at laſt ſo corrupt our Judgment, and blind us, that we ſhall ſcarce be able to diſcern him that is that great Light that was ſent into the world, but become every man an <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> to himſelf, or be ſo ſilly as to be led about by other <hi>Ignes Fatui,</hi> whenas it is moſt certain that Chriſt is the only way, the Truth and the Life, and he that does not clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee that, when he has opportunity to know it, let his pretence to other knowledge be what it will, it is a demonſtration that as to Divine things he is ſtark blind. But no man can really adhere to Chriſt, and unwaveringly, but by union to him through his Spirit; nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Spirit of life, but by reſolved Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of his own will, and a deadneſs to all
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:55102:263"/>
worldly vanities, that we may be reſtored at laſt to our ſolid happineſs which is through Chriſt in God, without whoſe Communion no ſoul can poſſibly be happy.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I think it not amiſs to cloſe theſe my Theoretical Annotations on theſe two Treatiſes, with that more Practical and Devotional Hymn of <hi>A. B.</hi> that runs much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mortification of our own Wills, and of our Union and Communion with God, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into Engliſh by a Lover of the Life of our Lord Jeſus.</p>
