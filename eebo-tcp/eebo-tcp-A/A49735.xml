            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Prefatory Remarks,</head>
            <p>IT would be but an impertinent sort of a <hi>Preface,</hi> (though
not so unusual,) to tell you here of the <hi>Design</hi> of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>Poem,</hi> when any one may see for what it is <hi>Design'd,</hi>
tho that Elaborate sort of superfluity, has been an <hi>Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
to many a <hi>Piece,</hi> and <hi>whole Sheets</hi> spent in an <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi>
of the <hi>Title Page,</hi> that's <hi>Clear,</hi> and then its Author
has nothing now to do, but to <hi>Clear</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>If any can <hi>Censure</hi> it for a <hi>bold Attempt,</hi> wee'll with all
our <hi>Heart</hi> own our <hi>Confidence:</hi> But then it shall be only
plac't in him, that has most <hi>Reason</hi> to <hi>Censure,</hi> and that's
the <hi>Subject,</hi> who is the most <hi>concern'd,</hi> and the <hi>best Judg;</hi>
and then his <hi>severer Animadversions</hi> will be superseded by
the <hi>Kindness</hi> of the <hi>Oblation:</hi> And a <hi>Kid</hi> can never be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spisd,</hi>
only because we could not offer an <hi>Hecatombe:</hi> And
lest his own <hi>Modesty</hi> may Master his <hi>Judgment,</hi> or others
<hi>Envy</hi> condemn <hi>mine,</hi> and both make it too much for such a
<hi>Subject;</hi> both will be better <hi>pleas'd</hi> too when I tell them it was
<hi>Penn'd</hi> (as indeed it was,) only to <hi>Please</hi> my Self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59939:3"/>The <hi>Motive</hi> that inclin'd the <hi>Muse</hi> to <hi>this undertaking,</hi>
was not a determin'd <hi>Flattery,</hi> but a <hi>Chance</hi> of <hi>Fancy,</hi> and
so far from <hi>Affectation</hi> of <hi>Favour;</hi> 'tis a sordid Saul that
turns <hi>Sycophant</hi> out of <hi>Design:</hi> Had it aim'd so <hi>low,</hi> sure
its <hi>Subject</hi> should have been more <hi>Lofty:</hi> Some <hi>PATRON
PEER,</hi> some <hi>Person Greater,</hi> and perhaps deserving <hi>Less.</hi>
Its <hi>Author</hi> is <hi>much</hi> satisfyed such a <hi>Theam</hi> has Exercis'd his
own <hi>Pen,</hi> and as <hi>little</hi> Sollicitous whether it gratifie any
<hi>other</hi> Person: That which he is concerned for, is, His
ever appearing at all like a <hi>Poet,</hi> tho it were in praise of the
best; and what he could have better Exprest perhaps in a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyrick,</hi>
than a <hi>Poem;</hi> there being to that required such a
<hi>Smooth</hi> and <hi>Natural Easiness,</hi> not to be acquired by the <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishings</hi>
of <hi>Art,</hi> and <hi>Industry: Such</hi> a sort of <hi>Wits</hi> must
be <hi>happily conceived</hi> so in the <hi>Womb:</hi> if ever their <hi>Muse</hi>
will become <hi>Happy</hi> in its <hi>Conceptions:</hi> The <hi>Latin Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism</hi>
tell us truly, (that <hi>they</hi> must be <hi>born,</hi> while <hi>others</hi>
may be <hi>made:</hi>) and they but unfortunately Glory with the
<hi>Great,</hi> to be Fam'd for their <hi>Mothers Labour,</hi> not their
<hi>own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which put us upon <hi>Poetry,</hi> was not to <hi>Chear</hi> up our
<hi>Padding Prose,</hi> with the Comfortable noise of Bells, and
<hi>Rhyme,</hi> an Excuse perhaps that can't be well made use of
where the <hi>Verse</hi> tires too, and proves out a <hi>Jade:</hi> But if a
Body may deal <hi>plainly</hi> in an Age, where 'tis hard to find
<pb facs="tcp:59939:3"/>
               <hi>plain Dealing:</hi> It was the Effects of some solitary Retirements,
even among the midst of Company: <hi>Thought</hi> and the <hi>Muse,</hi>
could still affect their <hi>Obscure</hi> Retreats, where others only the
most <hi>splendid</hi> Appearance, and made a shift to <hi>warm</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into <hi>Verse</hi> upon a <hi>Cold Spring,</hi> and <hi>Epsome Water:</hi>
so that we won't pretend to so much as a <hi>Small Beer Poet,</hi> when
inspir'd only with the <hi>Element</hi> of <hi>John Taylor.</hi> I confess I
never lov'd much <hi>Strong Drink,</hi> and have read the <hi>Muses</hi>
had a great many <hi>Fountains</hi> too that never ran <hi>Wine:</hi> And
were I as well barrell'd as their Popular <hi>Poet, Ogg</hi> himself,
I should hardly Love to be always as <hi>full</hi> too; (tho if his
Verse were to be gaged in his Vessel'twould be still found <hi>emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>)
Even <hi>then</hi> I should rather chuse to jog on <hi>Lazily</hi> in Sober
Sense, than take the <hi>Pains</hi> to be Drunk for his <hi>Elaborate</hi> Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
Well may the Sot, (as they say) Blaspheme in his
<hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> when only the <hi>Devils Apollo</hi> Fires him with
his <hi>God.</hi> The little Satyr we have spent on him, and some
such Seditious Scriblers, was both seasonable, and pertinent,
and proceeded from a double Provocation: Their avowing
themselves Enemies to all <hi>Loyalty,</hi> as well as the <hi>Laureat,</hi>
their Libelling of late their own <hi>Sovereign</hi> as well as his
<hi>Subjects;</hi> and tho the sucking <hi>Muse</hi> is yet Young enough to
want <hi>Teeth:</hi> Yet they may find its <hi>Gumms</hi> too, can make a
shift to <hi>bite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Rural</hi> sort of Entertainment we met with in the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59939:4"/>
has in some Places made the Fancies <hi>Pastoral.</hi> The
<hi>Eye</hi> being affected with such <hi>External</hi> Objects, as made the
like Impression on the Mind <hi>within:</hi> And 'tis an Old Axiome
we learnt I remember out of our Schools; That there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the <hi>Intellect,</hi> but what is first represented to it by the
<hi>Sense:</hi> Which Maxim in Philosophy, I am sure is so far Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,
that whatever the <hi>Sense</hi> represents, must at the same
time be in the <hi>Intellect.</hi> And the <hi>Course</hi> Object of the Eye,
<hi>refin'd</hi> into Thought and Idaea.</p>
            <p>The Digression at last into the praise of our <hi>David</hi> is so far
warrantable, as it has some Relation to the <hi>Poem.</hi> And so its
Author can't be altogether said to <hi>Digress;</hi> it being but on a
<hi>Theam,</hi> which the Subject of <hi>ours</hi> has so well handled, it
offers only at a little piece of Imitation; and we have the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of a standing <hi>Maxim, that in Great attempts 'tis-some
Honor to Miscarry:</hi> But if this won't Apologize, the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
hearty Loyalty will make the better Plea. He must
still remember in all his Works, what he does in his Prayers
and Drink, the <hi>King,</hi> and the serving up of the best Dish
in the Rear is an Argument of <hi>Choice,</hi> not <hi>Error,</hi> and the
<hi>end</hi> has a Proverbial Right of <hi>crowning</hi> every Work, which
it can be more litterally said to do with a <hi>Crown'd Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Character of <hi>Sheba</hi> might be well <hi>pursued,</hi> whom Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
has so well <hi>overtaken,</hi> and any Satyr against the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
<pb facs="tcp:59939:4"/>
can be never <hi>unseasonable,</hi> that show themselves
so ready to Rebel at all <hi>Seasons:</hi> though the <hi>Text</hi> does not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that he was in <hi>Absolon's</hi> Rebellion, 'tis shrewdly to be
presum'd that he was: And as <hi>his</hi> Insurrection was after the
Youths defeat, 'tis to be suspected too that this our <hi>Sheba</hi> might
have created our <hi>David</hi> a <hi>second,</hi> and a <hi>worse</hi> Trouble: I
am sure he Countenances the Character in his end, and <hi>Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi>'s
are oblig'd by the Rules of Logick to differ, to prevent
their being the <hi>same;</hi> and should they happen not to be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries
in the Text, the contrary of which is rather there
implyed: Yet <hi>Verse</hi> need not be <hi>crampt</hi> with <hi>Chronology,</hi>
tho it <hi>bind</hi> an <hi>Historian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for those that are so <hi>tender</hi> as to think it <hi>hardness</hi> to
the <hi>Dead;</hi> they are only such as are concern'd for his <hi>dying;</hi>
Yet they sure may give us leave to side with the Government in
a little <hi>Satyr</hi> on their <hi>Hero;</hi> that have invaded it so <hi>viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently</hi>
for him in a <hi>Libel,</hi> and a <hi>Panegyrick.</hi> And whatever
Compassion they have for the <hi>Ashes</hi> of the <hi>Dead,</hi> none sure is
bound to reverence the <hi>Dust</hi> of a <hi>Traytor.</hi>

               <l>Those first Originals of our copyed Prayers,</l>

               <l>The <hi>Tyrant</hi> Stork would here but justly pray.</l>
               <l>Thy Judgments, Mighty <hi>Iove,</hi> most just forbear,</l>

               <l>Thy gentle Reign had Banisht hate and fear.</l>
               <l>On Love they surfeited, free as their Common Air.</l>
