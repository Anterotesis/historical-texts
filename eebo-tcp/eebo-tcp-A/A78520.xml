            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now for this <hi>Rejoynder,</hi> (who profeſſeth himſelfe to be the ſame who
writ the <hi>Animadverſions</hi> on Mr. <hi>Chaloners</hi> Speech) though he would
have it granted that he gave a good accompt of himſelfe b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is yet worſe, as I ſhall make it appeare to thoſe who will
view the ſume and ſubſtance thereof: In which I am reſolved on much
brevity.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>He ſaith that the Scripture prefixed in the title of his Animadverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
For the tranſgreſſion of a Land, many are the Princes thereof. Pro.

            <p>1. Anſwer) this is a moſt falſe aſpertion, Mr. <hi>Chaloners</hi> words were
theſe, <hi>Firſt, ſettle the honour, ſafety, and freedome of the Common wealth,
and then the honour, ſafety, and freedome of the King, ſo farre as
the latter may ſtand with the former, and not otherwiſe,</hi> which is according

<hi>Scotchman</hi> himſelfe delivered his opinion 2. yeares ſince; That there is
no imaginable Compariſon betwix: one man with all his accidents of

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:113929:2"/>
2. <hi>The Rejoynder ſaith, that it is dangerous to have many voyd places in
Parliament, and ſo a frequent ſucceſſion of many new Members, or to have
the chiefe Officers civill and millitary put in many new hands, if the perſons
intrusted be not extraordinary well qualified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This is pleaded directly in the behalfe of thoſe Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
that have deſerted their truſt; for none elſe are outed the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
(except thoſe that dyed) and in their places new ones are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.
And for Officers, the Parliament chooſe none (neither civill or mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary)
but ſuch as they conceive are well qualified; Are ſuch aſperſions
as theſe for vindication of the Parliaments Honour?</p>
            <p>3. <hi>He ſaith that there is nothing in the Covenant, that obligeth him to
mentaine the Law of the Land, as well as the perſon of the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I conceive that the Rejoynder hath not taken the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
but let thoſe that have taken the Covenant, reade it; &amp; ſee what they
have ſworne.</p>
            <p>The King cannot but be ſubject to the Coactive power of fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Lawes: This is a fundamentall Law, that the free eſtates lay upon
the King, that all the power that they give to the King, as King, is for the
good and ſafety of the people; and ſo what he doth to the hurt of his
ſubjects he doth it not as King, <hi>Qui habet poteſtatem conſtituendi, etiam
&amp; jus adimendi, l. nemo 37. l. 21. de reg jure.</hi> Is this paper then of his,
to maintaine the Lawes of the Land?</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Some things the Rejoynder refuſing to diſpute, I ſhall wave, and come
to the next thing he layes hold on, where I finde him traducing the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as if any man may as well tell any notoriou, lie, if he do it to aſſert the
votes of Parliament; As Mr.</hi> Chaloner; <hi>or any other Member may
deliver their opinions</hi> (<hi>upon the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>otes</hi>) <hi>in the Houſe.</hi> (And is this for the
Honour of the Parliament?</p>
            <p>5. <hi>He ſaith that the Speech without doores</hi> (as he calles Mr. Chaloners)
<hi>houlds forth that the Kingdoms are contending, who ſhall not have the Kings
Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that this inferreth by conſequence that the Parliament either did not

            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> When the Parliament heard that the King was come to
the <hi>Scots</hi> Army in <hi>England;</hi> they voted their diſpoſall of him, to prevent
that harme which might befall His Maj. in the Army. But afterwards
this perſonall being of the King with the Scots begets a nationall diſpute
of his diſpoſall betweene the Kingdomes. The <hi>Scots</hi> claiming a right of
Coacting with the Parliament therein; yet declaring their opinions that
his going into <hi>Scotland</hi> is not the ſafeſt; Mr. <hi>Chaloner</hi> (in his Speech)
<pb facs="tcp:113929:3"/>
puts the Houſe in minde of ſo much of their reſolution, as conceiving it
uſefull to take notice of; that ſeeing they approve beſt of his being in
<hi>England;</hi> who ſhall take care for the good of the Kingdome, and the
ſafety of his perſon therein, but the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> in whom the
power is of treating and concluding for the good and ſafty of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
though the King be with their Army in <hi>England,</hi> and propound o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe;
when <hi>Maccolumbut</hi> the 92. King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> would have
admitted a treaty to the hurt of that Kingdome, the Eſtates of <hi>Scotland</hi>
ſaid, <hi>non jus eſſe Regi, niſi omnibus ordinibus conſentientibus.</hi> And <hi>Robert</hi>
the 100. in a Parliament held at <hi>Scoone,</hi> was told by the Eſtates of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
when he would have made a treaty, that he could not <hi>judices face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

            </p>
            <p>6. <hi>The Rejoynder Recanteth for reporting ſomwhat ſpoken by Mr.</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loner,
<hi>in the Houſe, but not printed: confeſſing it was onely a ſimple narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And was not this bravely done of him to aſperſe the Parliament, and
traduce their proceedings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. <hi>He will not be convinced how it can be, that a King of one Kingdome
can be a ſubject in another, except he ceaſe being a King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> (being in league with <hi>England,</hi>)
comes into <hi>England, His Office, Scepter, Sword,</hi> and all his whole power
remaines ſtill in <hi>Denmarke,</hi> though his Perſon be here, he is King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi>
but a Subject of <hi>England;</hi> but this poynt hath been ſufficiently
cleared already to thoſe that are reaſonable men. And for the power of
the King in <hi>Abſtracte,</hi> and the man in <hi>Concreto,</hi> Lex, Rex; is large upon
it, in his 29. <hi>Queſtion.</hi>

            <p>8. <hi>The next thing the Rejoynder falles upon, is about Commiſſioners of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
ſent to another State; who he ſaith are exempt from the Lawes, and
Iuriſdiction of that State where they are Commiſſioners, and all his reaſon is,
that he will acknowledge them neither Princes, nor private men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> All the world may ſee, that this is meere <hi>Sophiſtrie,</hi> and
that he uſeth theſe querkes, and inſinuations to traduce the people. Have
Commiſſioners no rule to be ordered by in another State? then they
are Princes abſolute: have they a Rule? then they are not exempt from
that Rule. Is not this a wiſe Stateſman to write in vindication of the
Parliament?</p>
            <p>9. <hi>He ſtill denyes that Prince</hi> Charles <hi>is at the ſole diſpoſe of the State of</hi>
France, <hi>and affirmeth that it is like Treaſon to ſay that the Parliament cannot
by their lawfull Authority recall him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The Rejoynder might tell us how, and by what Law,
the Parliament can controule the State of <hi>France</hi> in demanding the
<pb facs="tcp:113929:3"/>
Prince. The Parliament is very ſenſible of the ill conſequence of his being
there, and would fain have him in <hi>England</hi> again. And ſhall this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
accuſe the Parliament that they have a power to recall him and do not,
(and yet pretend to write in the vindication of the honour of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,)
I appeale to all Lawyers and Stateſmen to judge, if this be not falſe
and ſcandalous.</p>
            <p>As for the inſtances of that King in <hi>England,</hi> as alſo of <hi>Embaſſadors,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he waves it, as being ſomthing convinced;) I ſhall not reply to thoſe
things. For that of <hi>Livius,</hi> concerning the Embaſſadors of King <hi>Tarqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and ſo of actions of States <hi>de facto,</hi> no wiſe man will ſtumble at it,
that hath his eyes fixed on what is <hi>de jure:</hi> for ſo the caſe is argued.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>From Mr. Chalenors words of the Lawyers in England, concerning
King John, if they ſhould have yeelded to the French, they knew well enough
what would become of the King of England. The Rejoynder argues, that in
like manner if the Parliament of England ſhould juſtly diſpoſe of our King,
they ſhould in ſo doing diſpoſe of the King of Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Had King <hi>John</hi> been perſonally in <hi>Normandy,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi>
would not (probably) have ſent into <hi>England</hi> about it. But hee was freed
from that power by his perſonall being in <hi>England.</hi> The perſon of the king
of <hi>England</hi> is in <hi>England.</hi> Is this for the honour of the Parliament, to give
them no more relation to their Kings perſon in <hi>England,</hi> then a King of
<hi>France</hi> hath?</p>
            <p>11. He moves for ſome overtures; as the King to come to London, the Scots
to goe home, and the Parliaments Army to bee disbanded, or ſent into Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The Parliament out of their great deſire to have the king
to come and remain with them, ſent to his Majeſty propoſitions from both
Kingdomes, and agreed for their pay and marching home. But for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding
of the Parliaments Army, that muſt be left to the wiſdome of the
Parliament. For ſo the Law, ſay wiſe men and the Law. <hi>Argu. l. Aliud</hi>

was to proſtitute the chaſtity of that affection which we owe unto the
Cauſe of God, and could be no better then a bribe that blinds the eyes

               <p>The deep apprehenſion of their ſouls danger, moves us ſeriouſly, and
in the bowels of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to intreat all Temporizers, and Back-ſliders
to remember whence they are fallen, and to repent: Let it not
be a light thing unto ſuch, that they have deſpiſed the Oath of God,
undervalued the pretious Truth of the Goſpel, and drawn upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the guilt of their Brethrens blood, by forſaking them in their juſt

that the Lord of Hoſts ſhall avenge the quarrell of his Covenant upon

liberall in the offer of his love, yet few have beleeved the Goſpel, and
ſtudied to walk worthy of the ſame: <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath neither been known

execute Juſtice without reſpect of perſons: Let Officers and Souldiers

then their own advantage: Let Paſtors feed the flock of Chriſt in love, bee
zealous in advancing the work of reformation, and purging of the Houſe of
God: And let every one in his ſtation, mind thoſe things whereunto the
Lord hath called him. Though we be afflicted and ſore broken, yet if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
unto the Lord, he will have mercy on us, and heale us: Hath he not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

               <p>It is a mercy worthy to be had in everlaſting remembrance, that in the
day of the power and pride of our cruell and inſolent enemies, the Lord
ſhould ſhew himſelfe glorious and mighty, to give victory and ſalvation
to his people, when our hopes were neer gone. We were in a low conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not only at the weakeſt, but even at the worſt, under the guilt of many
provocations, repining againſt the Lord, and haſting to the paths of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer:
Yet the preſerver of men had regard unto us, to keep us from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
and to eaſe and avenge us of many of our adverſaries, whoſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes

the Lord, and again to ſubmit unto, or comply with the enemies of his
truth, they could not but ſin againſt their own ſouls, and provoke the eyes
of his glory untill there were no remedy. We beſeech all the Lords people
throughout the land, nay we charge them before God; and the Lord Jeſus
Chriſt who ſhall judge the quick and the dead, to hold faſt the truth in
love, to have regard to the glory of the Son of God, the excellency of the
Goſpel, the ſacred and inviolable bond of the Covenant, the beauty of the

the ſtout heart of the proud enemy, and bring down the glory of his high looks.</hi>
Then ſhall all the haters of Zion be aſtoniſhed and confounded, but the
