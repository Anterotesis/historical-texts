            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

1678, I being in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> and one
<hi>Hobſon;</hi> in Diſcourſe had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, they both then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
That their Deſign in Carrying on the
Plot, was to kill the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> as
well as the KING; which Horrid Acts the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48960:3"/>
Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> about the ſame time propoſed
for me to do: And that one <hi>George North</hi>
(who was Nephew to <hi>Pickering,</hi> and Servant
to my Lord <hi>Aſton)</hi> declared to me, that they
had lately taken his ſaid Uncle (who was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
one appointed to kill the King), and put
him in <hi>Newgate;</hi> which if true, he ſaid he
thought the King deſerved an Execrable
Death, as was intended him, by reaſon of
his Whoring and Debauchery.</p>
            <p>That in <hi>September</hi> 1678, Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> told
me, That Mr. <hi>Beningfield</hi> had a Pacquet of
Letters delivered to him from the Poſt-houſe,
which he feared the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Danby</hi>
had notice of; therefore he delivered them
to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who delivered them
to His Majeſty, who was pleaſed (after he
had read them) to give them to the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
not much Crediting them, for that they
had after ſuch manner been tranſmitted to
him; by which unwarineſs the Deſign was
undiſcovered, which the ſaid Pacquet of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
wou'd have Confirmed of the Plot.</p>
            <p>That I have received many Pacquets of
Letters for <hi>Evers,</hi> ſome of which I have broke
open, and found them to be, and tend to the
Eſtabliſhing of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion here:
As alſo ſeveral Sums of Money, which by
ſeveral perſons imployed to put forth, was for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48960:3"/>
the Uſe of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> to carry on the Deſign.
To which end Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> told me, That there
was ſeveral Gentlemen in the County of <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
had Monies in their hands, though they
were ſhy of being ſo known; but neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
had entered into Covenant to do it at
St. <hi>Omers:</hi> To confirm which, I received a
Letter from Mr. <hi>Warner</hi> a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> that the
money ſhould be ſpeedily returned to Mr.
<hi>Harcourt</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> here.</p>
            <p>That in another Letter directed to Mr.
<hi>Evers,</hi> which I broke open, and found the ſame
to be my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s hand-writing: The
Contents of which was, <hi>That things went
well on beyond the Seas for carrying on the Plot,
and hoped it did ſo here in</hi> England; and for the
Pardoning of thoſe that were concerned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> told me, That there were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Indulgencies, which he believed came from
Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> to whom they were tranſmitted
from <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the night before I went away from
my Lord <hi>Aſtons</hi> upon Diſcovery of the Plot,
I took ſeveral Letters and Papers which related
thereunto, and burnt them, fearing the ſame
wou'd detect me, if found; not then having
thoughts to diſcover my ſelf; which if I had
happily kept and preſerved, wou'd have much
more Evidenced the whole Deſign in carrying
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48960:4"/>
on the Plot: In ſeveral Letters relating to the
ſame, I have heard the Names of <hi>Oates</hi> and
<hi>Bedlow,</hi> named as perſons therein imployed;
but I did not then know them.</p>
            <p>That I very well remember, that the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi>
had a Meeting in <hi>London,</hi> in <hi>April</hi> 1678.
for that Mr. <hi>Evers,</hi> and other <hi>Jeſuits</hi> went up
from <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> unto it, who deſired me
when I went to eſcape, to be ſecret; and that
I ſhould, if I were ever brought to Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
deny my knowledge in every particular,
which I then, and when I burned my Papers,
was reſolved to do: And the ſaid Mr. <hi>Evers</hi>
at ſeveral times told me, That the Pope out of
his Revenue had granted ſeveral Sums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
in order to put the <hi>Iriſh</hi> into a Condition
of oppoſing the now Eſtabliſh'd Government;
for it was his Gracious pleaſure, to conſider
what a Tyrannical Government they lived
under. To which purpoſe I opened a Letter
from <hi>Paris,</hi> which was directed to Mr. <hi>Evers,</hi>
the perſons Name I have forgotten; but it
was to this purpoſe, That he had lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a Letter from <hi>Rome,</hi> to confirm, that
the Pope did ſtill hold his good purpoſe, for
the relieving the poor <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and that they
were conſidering how to procure them Men
as well as Money: but as to that and other
things, there wou'd ſhortly be an Expreſs
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48960:4"/>
from thence to <hi>England,</hi> which wou'd be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the latter end of <hi>March</hi> 1677/8, as I beſt
remember; and that Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> company,
with Mr. <hi>Cottons,</hi> Mr. <hi>Vavaſors,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gavens,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> were requeſted to be at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
whither Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> and Mr. <hi>Peters</hi>
went; and when Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> came home
again into the Countrey, he told me, That
Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> and Mr. <hi>Simons</hi> wou'd be in the
Countrey the latter end of <hi>June,</hi> for conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the beſt way and means, for the
carrying on the <hi>great Work,</hi> as they called
it.</p>
            <p>That it was always agreed at our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
That to diſturb the Peace in <hi>Ireland</hi>
and <hi>Scotland,</hi> wou'd be a means to weaken
<hi>England</hi> ſo much, that their attempts might
be eaſier managed, which cou'd not be done
without a good Aſſiſtance beyond the Seas,
which Mr. <hi>Gaven</hi> ſaid, we needed not to
fear; for though they had great troubles
with them both in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and
thoſe Countries, yet there wou'd not be
men or money wanting to carry on their
Deſign, for the Glory of God: And if ſo,
their Endeavours ſhou'd be no ways want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here; which was not only to kill the
King, but the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> alſo,

If they were aſſured, that the Gentlemen
were all true to them in Aſſiſting them with
money? for if that ſhould fail, our own
Stock will ſerve us little. Upon which I
told them, I wou'd give them One hundred
pound more, to the Four hundred pound I
had before ſetled on them, which was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
very thankfully, with promiſes that I
needed not to fear to have a free Pardon
procured for my Sins paſt, and to be a
Saint in Heaven, placed to all Eternity,
for that I had been ſo much Inſtrumental
in ſo Pious a Work: and Mr. <hi>Vavaſor</hi> ſaid,
That the monies which was out at Uſe to

that end, one Mr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> was Choſen by

it being then asked, Who was to ſpeak

ought to be looked on accordingly: To
which Mr. <hi>Vavaſor</hi> replyed, That it was

I did ſeem very content; and told me he
wou'd ſpeak to <hi>Groves,</hi> that I might have
notice how the Deſign went on, for then he
cou'd not tell, till he had ſpoken to my Lord
<hi>Bellaſis,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Arundell</hi> of <hi>Warder,</hi>
who would prove the Loyal'ſt men of Truſt
and Council of any perſons in the World;
but before I received my Letter from Mr.
<hi>Ireland,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Groves</hi> was in <hi>Newgate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I ſaw a Letter from Mr. <hi>Harcourt,</hi>
who told Mr. <hi>Evers,</hi> That he had lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a Letter from Mr. <hi>Warner;</hi> wherein
was mentioned, That Mr. <hi>Warner</hi> had uſed
all care imaginable for the helping on the
deſign in hand, and that there was Four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pound of the ſaid money in Mr. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s
hands for that purpoſe; and I heard
Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> tell Mr. <hi>Evers,</hi> that he was very
glad that Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> was made Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> for that he wou'd be very
careful in carrying the deſign on, and a cloſe
man in his buſineſs; and they then agreed
that my Lord <hi>Arundell</hi> of <hi>Warder</hi> was the
only man we had to truſt to, being a Wiſe
man, and much in favour with the Duke of
<hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:48960:6"/>
That in a little time after this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
had; I received in a Letter of
mine, 3 Letters incloſed from Mr. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningfield,</hi>
one from <hi>Paris,</hi> and one from
Mr. <hi>Harcourt;</hi> that from Mr. <hi>Beningfield,</hi>
was to let Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> know, that he had
ſpoken with my Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and that my Lord was very willing
to aſſiſt in what was requeſted by Mr.
<hi>Evers</hi> and Mr. <hi>Vavaſor,</hi> which Letters I
intercepted, and I never let Mr. <hi>Evers</hi>
know, to whom they were directed,
that I had received them; but being
not long after in Diſcourſe with him
in his Chamber, I asked him what
Perſons of Quality or Note did (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
thoſe he had mentioned to me)
countenance our Deſign, to which he
anſwered, that there were ſeveral in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places, where the buſineſs went on
aſwel as here, and at the ſame time told
me, that he had Writ to Mr. <hi>Bening<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi>
to requeſt my Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of
<hi>Warder</hi> to be aſſiſting in the matter
which then was in hand, and I deſiring
to know of him whether my Lord was
concerned in their Deſign, he told
me, that his Lordſhip was to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the moſt part of the Deſign, and
with my Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi> to give Order,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48960:7"/>
both as to the taking the King's Life
away, and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s; and
for the Eſtabliſhing the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
here.</p>
            <p>That about the middle of <hi>September</hi>
1678 a Letter came to my hands, of
Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> (which I opened) the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
whereof were to this purpoſe,
that he had been with my Lord <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi>
and my Lord told him, that he
ſpoke to the perſon he was requeſted,
and it was both their Opinions, that
it was the beſt way to ſpeed their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.
The perſons name, which ſent
the Letter I know not; for there was
two Letters for his name, which were
<hi>I. W.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That when the Deſign was ſet on
foot, it was not for the taking the
King's Life away, but to provide for
themſelves Money and Arms againſt
the King died, for it was always
thought amongſt us, that the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>M.</hi>
would ſtand for the Crown after the
King's Death; and then our hopes
would be fruſtrated for ever having
here the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>But the perceiving and ſeeing it
was his Majeſties whole Endeavours,
to Eſtabliſh and ſecure the Proteſtant
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48960:7"/>
Religion ſo firm, that it ſhould not be
removed for the future. It was by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
thought fit, that this way that
is now deſigned and endeavoured to
be carried on, would moſt anſwer their
wicked ends, and for thoſe that had
bin active therein, they agreed ſhould
have Rewards, and thinking that I
(amongſt the reſt) had deſerved ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
Ordered I ſhould have an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
ſhare with one Captain <hi>Aderley,</hi>
who was an Agent in the ſaid Plot;
but how much it ſhould be, and in
what, after the Deſign took effect, was
not then declared, but was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Y.</hi> and my Lord
<hi>Arundel</hi> and ſome other perſons; but
it ſhould be ſuch a ſhare, as ſhould
make me, and my Poſterity happy.
Which I accepted with great thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
to Mr. <hi>Evers, Mr. Gavan, Mr. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
and <hi>Mr. Leviſton,</hi> who then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to ſee it fulfilled to me, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the ſame time, that there would
be lands enough of the Proteſtants, to
reward every one, that had been active
in the ſaid Deſign.</p>
            <p>That in the Summer 1678, I met
with one <hi>Humphry Elliot,</hi> who fell into
Diſcourſe with me about <hi>Mr. Ireland,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48960:8"/>
who, ſaid he, had told him, that I was
to go up to <hi>London,</hi> upon an occaſion
that would alſo oblige him to come
up, which Diſcourſe ſomething ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
me, which he perceiving, told me
I need not fear him, for if I ſuffered,
he was like to ſuffer as well as I, and
begg'd of me not to impart my mind
to any one except my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> or
<hi>Mr. Evers,</hi> or whom they ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.</p>
            <p>That for the carrying on the whole
Deſign in ſeveral other Counties, Mr.
<hi>Peters, Evers</hi> and <hi>Pool</hi> told me, that there
was for a part of <hi>Worceſter</hi> appointed
one <hi>Mr. Turner,</hi> and three more whoſe
names I have forgot: and for a part
of <hi>Darbyſhire,</hi> and a part of <hi>Nottingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>
was appointed one <hi>Mr. Turner, Mr.
Bennet,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Pool</hi> of <hi>Spnikehill,</hi> and
one Mr. <hi>Heaton,</hi> which were to take
care of their ſeveral Liberties, as well
for engaging perſons in the Helliſh
Deſign, as for raiſing of mony of the
Gentlemen to carry it on, and to give
in their ſeveral accounts to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial,
who was then appointed for
that purpoſe, to ſee which was the beſt
Benefactor, though at the ſame time
Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> told me, that he thought
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48960:8"/>
Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> was no ways fit for ſuch an
Employ for that, though he was a Prieſt
he was given to Drinking.</p>
            <p>That being ſent to Dr. <hi>Richard Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
with a Letter, and diſcourſing him,
found him very Zealous to promote the
Plot, who told me he had been 200 Miles
about it, and that his pains he thought
were well beſtowed in ſo good a work,
and that it ſhould fall out in his days,
that might be ſpoke of in after Ages:
That honeſt <hi>Dick Needham</hi> was a Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and one Entruſted for the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of the Heretical Government.
And being ſent at ſecond time to Dr.
<hi>Needham's</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pool's,</hi> and going firſt
to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Needham</hi>'s at <hi>Satton</hi> in <hi>Scarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>
in <hi>Darbyſhire</hi> with letters, in order
that Mr. <hi>Needham</hi> might tranſmit them
from place to place, according as he was
thereby directed to the Gentlemens
houſes near adjoyning, the purport of
which letters were for the promoting
and carrying on the Deſign of ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Proteſtant Religion. And Mr.
<hi>Pool</hi> being there, I diſpatched my buſineſs
with him, which was to the ſame purpoſe,
and Mr. <hi>Needham</hi> being to receive orders
from Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> and <hi>Mr. Bennet,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pool</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48960:9"/>
after Maſs gave him further Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as to what buſineſs he was to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
who made this reply, that both
he and his Son ſhould be at their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
to ſerve in ſo good a cauſe, in
the deſtroying of the Proteſtants, and
introducing their own Religion, and
having received his letter from me, and
what I had to Communicate to him by
word of mouth, the Content of which
Letter was, that he ſhould go to <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallam</hi>
to acquaint <hi>Mr. Pawdrels,</hi> that
<hi>Mr. Evers, Mr. Vavaſor</hi> and <hi>Mr. Peters</hi>
would be at <hi>Weſthallam,</hi> within a ſhort
time, and deſired that one <hi>Mr. Buſby</hi>
might be at home, for they and ſome
other Gentlemen would be ſure to be
there at the time appointed about the
great work they knew of which ſo
much concerned them all.</p>
            <p>That I have Intercepted ſeveral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that came to <hi>Mr. Evers</hi> from <hi>St. Omers,</hi>
and <hi>Paris,</hi> wherein was mentioned, that
they were in good forwardneſs, and
that they had disburſed 500<hi>l.</hi> upon Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for Arms, as alſo 700<hi>l.</hi> was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in other Letters to be laid out for
the ſame purpoſe, in ſome of which Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
it was preſſed to Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> for return
of Monies for diſcharging thoſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48960:9"/>
And I have likewiſe ſeen Letters
to <hi>Grove, Ireland, Beningfield</hi> and <hi>Harcourt,</hi>
for the ſending mony over to thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and that Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Vava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor</hi>
differed in their accounts about the
ſame, the laſt time <hi>Ireland</hi> was in the
Country.</p>
            <p>That about <hi>July</hi> 1678 a Pacquet came
directed to me from Mr. <hi>Evers,</hi> which
came to 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> which I open'd and
there it was expreſſed, that all things
were ready which were beſpoke, and all
paid off, but how it was Ordered I never
knew, and when I have been in buſineſs
with them, it hath been often given out,
that the King of <hi>France</hi> did know of this
Deſign, and would be Aiding and Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therein, which I was ever of another
opinion, and they then declared that
there was in <hi>England</hi> above 200000 men,
which would prove true, if occaſion
were, with ſome ſupplies, which they
ſaid they were ſure of from other parts
beyond the Seas.</p>
            <p>That about <hi>Auguſt</hi> or the beginning
of <hi>September</hi> 1678 Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> and Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſor</hi>
told me that there was to be a great
meeting of the Jeſuits and Secular
Prieſts at <hi>Boſcobel,</hi> beſides ſeveral private.
Gentlemen that were to be there, to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48960:10"/>
receive the Oath of Secrecy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
<hi>Mr. Gavan</hi> was appointed to Adminiſter
to about forty perſons, particularly at
that time, it was given to Sir <hi>James Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
Mr. Gerard, Mr. Fitzherbert, Mr. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſor,
Mr. Lewſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Broadſtreet,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
Mr. Manley. Mr. Francis Lewſon,</hi>
and ſeveral others, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi>
at the ſame time publiſhing an Act of
Indulgence, which he lately received
from <hi>Rome</hi> to thoſe that were active in
promoting the wicked Deſign of killing
the King, and the Subverſion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion, I promiſed to be there,
but went not, for which they were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
and <hi>Mr. Peters</hi> and <hi>Mr. Vavaſor</hi>
both told me, that the occaſion of their
meeting was to Conſult means how to
carry on the Plot.</p>
            <p>That preſently after I had made my
Diſcovery to the Juſtices of the Peace,
they Iſſued out their Warrants for the
apprehending of <hi>George Hobſon</hi> and <hi>George
North</hi> beforementioned, who were both
thereupon apprehended, which my
Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> hearing of, it was Reported
that his Lordſhip ſhould ſay in great
Paſſion, That he was ſorry he did not
run me through before I went out of
his Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:48960:10"/>
That about the beginning of <hi>September</hi> 1678.
Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> told me in great ſecret, that my Lord
<hi>Aſton</hi> was to go in <hi>October</hi> next following to St.
<hi>Omers,</hi> and probably from thence to <hi>Paris,</hi> which
my Lord afterwards told me, he was to go over,
in order to diſpoſe of the Arms, which were
provided there; the number whereof were as
my Lord and Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> told me 30000. which
were to be landed here and in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diſcourſing Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> in that Affair, he told
me, that ſome out of caution to themſelves,
would have their names entred at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> as it
had been before, the better to diſguiſe their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
and that about two years laſt paſt, he with
Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> went over to enter their names, and
that ſeveral of them had continued to do the like
in this Affair and Deſign: But after the news was,
that the Plot was diſcovered, I never heard my
Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> ſpeak to me more of his going over.</p>
            <p>That in addition to what I have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
concerning my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> is, That his
Lordſhip in <hi>September</hi> 1678. in the great Parlour
at <hi>Tixal</hi> diſcourſed Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> and me, and told
us, That the reaſon of his diſſatisfaction againſt
his Majeſty, towards whom he had always car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
himſelf with all ſort of Loyalty, as he had
done towards his Father, whereby not only he,
but others and their Families had been hereby
ruined, and that in particular, of the old Lord
<hi>Aſton,</hi> who had been a great Sufferer, and his
Father the Ambaſſador had ſpent 30000<hi>l.</hi> out of
their own Eſtate, was for all this no hopes of
any Recompence, for he plainly ſaw, as any
thing fell to be given, it was rather diſpoſed of
to Rebels and Traytors, than to thoſe that had
ſerved him, and that were Loyal; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
theſe things had wrought with him, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48960:11"/>
were ſufficient to change his mind againſt the
King, if there were not the matter of Religion
in queſtion, which was a Conſideration above
all others; And his Lordſhip alſo took notice,
that at any Seſſions of Parliament when there fell
out any thing to the prejudice of the Catholicks,
the King was always willing to expoſe them to
the Parliaments mercy, both in Eſtates and in
any thing elſe, that might befal them.</p>
            <p>That at a general Meeting in <hi>September</hi> 1678.
had at <hi>Tixal</hi> aforeſaid, where there was preſent

Mr. <hi>Broadſtreet,</hi> and to the beſt of my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
Mr. <hi>Dacot;</hi> upon a full debate had of
all their precedent Tranſactions and Inſtructions
in carrying on their Deſign; It was then by them
ſeverally agreed and reſolved upon, to perform
the Oaths they had ſeverally before taken, which
was to Kill the King, and to Eſtabliſh their Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
Religion here in <hi>England;</hi> and they did there

            <p>HAving given in this Information, by Memory, at
the Bar of the Honourable Houſe of Commons;
which when I peruſed, as it was taken in Writing from
my mouth, I found that I had miſplaced many Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs
as to Order of Time: For inſtance. I begin with
<hi>Sept. 1678,</hi> and afterwards give an Account of things
done in <hi>March 1677/8,</hi> and in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>July 1678:</hi> it
was not thought convenient to alter it in the Printing,
but to Publiſh it as delivered. Of this I thought good
to give the Reader notice.</p>
