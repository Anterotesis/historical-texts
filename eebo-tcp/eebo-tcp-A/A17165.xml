         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

vertue and good fame to destruction: Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly before this gentle <hi>Philip</hi> did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent himselfe vnto the king with his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, Letters were sent to king <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> containing, that the said <hi>Philip</hi> was corrupted so with money from king <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> that he had put most deadly poison and vncurable venom into <hi>Alexanders</hi> medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin. The king perusing the letters, kept them secret vntill he had drunke his medicin, and immediatly hee tooke his phisition by the hand, and deliuered him the letters that he might reade them, hauing in him so great confidence, that he did in no maner of case mistrust him.

to euerie good man, for the preseruation of their liues, by the true rules of the Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of health, which here I am so bold to present vnto your worship. For whereas there lacketh gouernment in a common wealth, the people doe eftsoones fall into ruine. The ships that lacke good gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, oftentimes be cast away vpon sands and rocks. And therefore there is nothing vnder heauen that hath life, but if it lacke good gouernment, it will quickly fall into vtter decay. For like as the Creator of all things hath formed the bodies of all men, into the goodliest shapes of euery liuing thing that euer was, or euer shall be: euen so hee hath ordained for man, hearbes, fruits, rootes, seeds, plants, gums, oyles, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious stones, beasts, foules fishes, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of health, to be moderately vsed with discretion, which peserueth the bodie in good estate, without whose vertues the bodies cannot liue, for they bee the nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shers of life. But misusing or abusing them, bringeth to the bodie many diseases, as rheumes, cathers, dropsies, impostumes, gowts, flixes, opilations, vertigoes, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, ruptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fransies, with many mo noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some diseases, which come thorowe the


<pb facs="tcp:7409:4"/>
corruption of meats and ill aire. For what auaileth riches, honours, costly buildings, faire apparell, with all the pompe of this worlde, and to bee honoured of the people, and in the meane time to bee eaten with wormes in the breast, or in the bellie, consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with Agues, tormented with gowtes, sorenesse, bone-ach, &amp;c.

And seeing that to possesse health, is better than to gouerne golde, insomuch that health maketh men more happie, stronger and quieter than all maner of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, lacking health: as example. Great princes, noble men, men of great substance, when they be wrapped and enclosed with many and sundry sicknesses, and in dayly daungers of death, in their extreme paines and passions, they do more greatly couet one drop of health, than a whole tunne of gold, crying out for the helpe and counsell of the Phisition.

               <p>Members be simple and also compound, the simples be ten in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the cartillages, the gristles, the bones, veynes, and synewes, arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, pannicles, lygaments, cordes, and the skinne. Members compounded,<note place="margin">A definition of members.</note> bee those that be ioyned and builded together of simple members, as the handes, face, feete, lyuer, and heart, and so compounded members be made of simple.</p>
               <p>Some of the compounded members be called principalles: as the heart from whence the arteries springs, the braine, from whence the sinewes springes, the liuer which is the well of the bloud, from whence the veines doe spring, and the stones of generation from whence the seed of life springeth: but those compounded members that bee principall bee all the other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers except the simple, as the nose, the eares, the eies, the face, the necke, the armes and legges, and the braines and chiefe substaunce of our flesh, bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded members of sinewes, and couered with panacles which bee of a

                  <hi>Iohn,</hi> to make a large description of Anatomie, it were too long for mee, but shortly I will say some thing. And first, the definition thereof is, when the bodie of a dead man or woman, is cut and opened and the members diuided,<note place="margin">What Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomie is.</note> or for the want of dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to reade good bookes, as <hi>Galen, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicen, &amp;c.</hi> And it behooueth them that cutteth a deade corpse, to note foure things.

Of these said members, with the bones, is all the bodie compounded. And like as euerie trée and hearbe, haue their rootes in the earth, and their braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches springeth vpward, euen so the rootes of mankinde, haue the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the braine, and the sinew and branches groweth downeward: in the which braine, dwelleth the vertues of imagination, fantasie, memorie, &amp;c.

               <p>Certainly the occasion of this most feareful sicknesse commeth many waies, as the change of the aire from a good vnto an euill qualitie, taking his venemous effect of the vital spirits which incontinent with all spéede cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth the spirituall blood. And soden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as it were) an vnmercifull fire, it quickly consumeth the whole bodie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto death, vnlesse the wholsome medicine doe preuent and come to the heart, before the pestilent humor. And because it is a very strong sicknes, it is requisite to haue a strong curing medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. For weake things will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uail against so strong a matter. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray you note these six sayings, as aire, diet, sléepe, or watch, quietnes, or trouble, and finally medicine. First, walk not in stinking mists,<note place="margin">Good aire.</note> nor by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt marrish ground, nor in extreme hot weather, but in fair cleare aire vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on high ground in swéet fields or gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, hauing fire in your cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, with swéet perfumes of the smoke of <hi>Oliba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> or <hi>Beniamen Frankensence,</hi> being


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7409:92"/>
cold weather. And in hote weather, ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, willow branches sprinkled with vineger, &amp; often shifting the chamber is wholsom, fléeing the South winde. Secondly, diet, moderate eating meate of good digestion, as all that haue pure white flesh, both of beasts, and foules, good bread of wheate, partly leauened. Eate no raw hearbs, purslein, Lettise,<note place="margin">Yong lettise</note> yong Lettish, or sorrel, except with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger. Drinke of cleare thin wine, not chaunged and vse often times vineger with your meates, and mingle not fish and flesh together in your stomacke, &amp; to drinke a tisant of barly water, rose water, &amp; sorrell water, betwene meals is good, eight spoonfuls at once. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, beware you sléepe not at noone, it bringeth many sicknesses,<note place="margin">Noone sleepe</note> and giueth place to the pestilence, and abateth memory. For as the marigold is spred by the day, and closed by the night: euen so is man of nature disposed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though through custome otherwise al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered vnto great domage and hurt of body. Eight hours sléepe suffiseth well to nature,<note place="margin">Sleepe.</note> but euery complexion hath his proper qualities, to sléepe vpon the


<pb facs="tcp:7409:93"/>
right side is best, euill vpon the left, and worse vpon the backe. Fourthly, vse moderate exercise and labor for the euacuation of the excrements,<note place="margin">Exercise.</note> as swift going vp hilles, stretching forth armes and legges, lifting weightes not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ponderous, for by labour the first and second digestion is made perfite, and the bodie strengthened, and this is a mightie defence agaynst the pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and many mo infirmities, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as through idlenesse be engendered all diseases both of the soule and bodie, whereof man is compounded &amp; made. Fifthly, aboue all earthly thinges, mirth is most excellent,<note place="margin">Mirth.</note> and the best companion of life, putter away of all diseases: the contrarie in plague time bringeth on the pestilence, through painefull melancholie, which maketh the body heauy &amp; earthly. Company, musicke, honest gaming, or any other vertuous exercise doeth helpe agaynst heauinesse of mind. Sixtly, medicine, the partie being chaunged in nature and condition, trembling or burning, vomiting with extreame paine in the day,<note place="margin">
