            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Euen as the wisedome and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the notable men of later ages, haue giuen greater honor to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of men in all Artes and Sciences of former ages and greater antiquitie, than to themselues; not onlie acknowledging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be inferiours vnto them, but also, that the greatest skil and knowledge which they haue attained vnto, hath (in the greatest part) proceeded from such notable men, either by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and obseruing their opinions, or by reading of their works, or els by reading of others that haue written of the iudgements and actions of such excellent men: Euen so, the vanitie and ouerweening of yong men, and chieflie of our Nation in this our time (I meane within these twentie yeares) haue so excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and superabounded, that they haue not been ashamed, not onlie to attribute vnto themselues greater wisedome and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie in all Arts and Sciences, and speciallie in the Arte Militarie, than to the notable men and great Captaines of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages and greater antiquitie, but also to dishable them in respect of themselues and their sufficiencie, and all others also yet liuing, that are men of greater yeares and antiquitie, than they are, both of our owne Nation, as also forraine, that haue
<pb facs="tcp:18222:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
seene and serued in the well ordered warres of Emperours or Kings, in times past; saying, (to make the same more probable) that their warres are now growne to greater perfection, and greatlie altered from the warres of times past; vnder pretence whereof, they haue of late sought both by publique and priuate perswasions and inducements, to reduce all our auncient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in matters Militarie, which they are vtterlie igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, to their owne errors and disorders, procuring also (as much as they can) by their vaine and friuolous obiections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Archerie, to suppresse and extinguish the exercise and seruiceable vse of Long-bowes. But now, let vs come to consider, who are these of our Nation that doo attribute vnto themselues greater wisedome and sufficiencie in all Arts and Sciences, and especiallie, in the Art Militarie, than to the excellent men of former times and ages, and to the auncient experienced men yet liuing. Are they newlie fallen from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with some diuine instinct and gift, to renewe, reforme, and teach vs the Arte Militarie? No, no such matter, but euen such as we knew children, or very yong men within these twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares. What then? are they Noblemen themselues by title, or descended of noble and excellent fathers, or themselues of great sobrietie, continencie and worthines of mind? No true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, for such as are Noblemen by birth, or descended of noble fathers, or themselues worthie, doo knowe by good education and instruction, that experience is the mother of Science, and therefore, will not neglect nor contemne the wisedome and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie of former ages, nor the opinions and iudgements of the auncient and experienced men of this time; but will (with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility) yeeld themselues to heare and learne by their experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. What then? are they endued with anie such rare gifts, or corporall presences, wisedomes and vertues, as I haue in my time knowne diuers, and doo yet knowe some verie fewe yong Gentlemen endued withall, that therefore we may admire, and thinke them to bee extraordinarie and notable men? No in troth, but some yong, and some now growne to be of the middle age, all which, are but after the common sort, both in their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall presences, and in their wisedomes and vertues, vnlesse
<pb facs="tcp:18222:3"/>
(peraduenture) somtimes, when they fall into argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of some such matters, that they would seeme to haue great skil of, then indeed, they shew themselues to be extraordinarie: for in steade of alleadging reasons and examples, according to the vse of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, with quietnes and courteous phrase of speach, they argue for life and death, with hastie and furious wordes, as though there were no more in the experience of men of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter yeares, but that which they say: which in the opinions of all men of any iudgement, that are of wise and braue Nations, is thought more meete for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon sort of such as are chiding wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, than for men that do professe any knowledge in Arts &amp; Sciences, and chiefly Militarie. What? is the number great of these controllers of Antiquitie in matters Militarie, that are infected with so great an ouerweening? Certainely, no, the number of the chiefe of them is very small and fewe, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, sauing for Arithmetikes sake, not woorthie to be called Number. And those that are possessed with this ouerweening, are such as do presume of their long experience in such warres as they haue serued in, all which are more addicted to selfe-will, newe fashions and fancies, than to any reason and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence Militarie. What, haue they no imitators? Yes, many, that are abused by their perswasions: but yet they are such, as I doo thinke may bee easily perswaded and reduced to better iudgement vpon sound reasons and demonstrations vnto them shewed, or vpon the experience of some newe and well ordered warres. But now, I pray you, in what warres of Emperours, Kings, or formed Common wealthes haue these our such men of war serued, and learned their great pretended skill and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie? by the which they may with the more reason and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience assume vnto themselues, to condemne the ancient or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and proceedings Military of diuers forren warlike Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as also of our most valiant and wise ancestors; or the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in the Art Military, of many both forren as also of some auncient men, yet liuing of our owne Nation, in respect of the warres that they haue serued in; and therefore, that vpon their greater experience and iudgement, they should seeke to reduce all our auncient proceedings and orders Militarie, to their
<pb facs="tcp:18222:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
owne opinions and fancies, and therewithall, to procure the vtter suppressing and extinguishing of our auncient and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar weapon the Long-bowe? Certainelie, all men knowe, that the chiefest warres that they euer serued in, where they haue learned anie experience, hath bene in the disordered and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuarie warres of the Lowe Countries vnder the States, or (peraduenture) some litle diuers yeres past, in the intestine &amp; licentious warres of <hi>France.</hi> Well, if it be so (without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther question) I doo not then meruaile, that they doo alleadge to set foorth and beautifie their owne sufficiencies, and to disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all others both auncient and moderne, that haue serued in the well ordered wars of Emperours or Kings, that their wars are now growen to greater perfection, and greatlie altered from the wars of times past, in the which I do concurre with them, and the rather because they verifie the olde Prouerb, which is, That such as were neuer but in Hell, doo thinke that there is no other Heauen. For true it is, that the ciuile and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wars of <hi>France,</hi> and the tumultuarie and disordered wars of the Lowe Countries, which haue beene their schooles, and the chiefe warres that euer they sawe, haue beene altogether without anie formed <hi>Milicia</hi> and discipline militarie, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore farre different from the well ordered wars that haue bin in former times, betwixt Emperors, Kings, and formed common wealthes.</p>
            <p>And now, because I intend in this Proëme vnto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, as brieflie as I can, to shewe by what meanes our Nation hath verie much decaied, or rather forgotten all our auncient orders and exercises Militarie, with the wonderfull euills that haue in other ages, and do now (through long peace) threaten vs againe to happen, as also that it hath been impossible for them, or any others, to learne any Art or Science Militarie in the ciuill warres of <hi>France,</hi> nor in the disordered warres of the Lowe Countries vnder the States, but rather the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that is, disorder and confusion. I therefore will first make manifest by diuers examples, by what meanes and accidents, the Art and Science Militarie hath in many Empires, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Common wealths, as also in this Kingdome, come
<pb facs="tcp:18222:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sometimes, to be vtterlie forgotten; and at other times, to growe to great disorder and confusion: and so finallie, that it is most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, that such of our Nation as haue seene and serued in no other wars, but in such confused and disordered wars, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, could no wayes attaine to anie such vnderstanding in the Art and discipline militarie, that they may be anie wayes dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or thought worthie to controll or finde fault with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and proceedings of our wise and worthie auncestours, nor of the olde and auncient Noblemen, Gentlemen and Captains yet liuing, that haue bene trained vp in matters of armes, as it shall euidently appeare by a fewe of their infinite vnsoldiorlike proceedings and disorders, which I will set downe in the end of this Preface. I thinke it is euident to all men of wisedome and discretion, that haue read diuerse notable Histories, with consideration and iudgement, as also that haue well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered of this our age, that there are two thinges of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are the greatest enemies to the Arte and science Militarie, and haue been the occasion of the great decay, and oftentimes, the vtter ruine of many great Empires, Kingdoms &amp; Common wealths: of the which, the first is long peace, which ensuing after great warres to diuers Nations that haue had notable <hi>Milicias</hi> and exercises Militarie in great perfection, they by enioying long peace, haue so much giuen themselues to couetousnes, effeminacies and superfluities, that they haue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a great part, or els vtterlie forgotten all orders and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises Militarie, in such sort, that when they haue been forced to enter into a warre defensiue for the defence of their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions against any forraine Nation or Nations, that haue had a puissant and formed <hi>Milicia,</hi> they haue been so voide of the orders &amp; exercises of war of their forefathers, that either they haue bin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered by their enemies inuading, or at least, haue been put in hazard of the losse of their estates and dominions, as it may verie well appeare by the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who being one of the first Nations of the world, that had the Art and sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence Militarie in great perfection, by the which they <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tained many victories and conquests. And thereby finding no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that durst assaile them, they did after by enioying long
<pb facs="tcp:18222:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
peace and prosperitie, so giue themselues to their delights, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse and effeminacies, neglecting all orders and exercises Militarie, that being in processe of time, and in diuerse ages assailed and inuaded by diuers other warlike Nations, that had the Arte and Science Militarie, in great perfection, and were allured thereunto, partly by the wonderful fertilitie of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> but chiefly, because the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were growen effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate without anie orders and exercises Militarie, they came to be by them subdued and conquered, and euer since haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in subiection, and seruitude to diuers other Nations. The <hi>Macedonians</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> also, that had vnder that notable conquerour, <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, and other notable Princes and Captains of those Nations, the Arte Militarie in great perfection, whereby they atchieued many notable victories and conquests, did after, by liuing in long peace, accompanied with great dissention, couetousnes and superfluities, so forget al their orders and exercises Militarie, that they came to be conquered by the Romanes: and of late yeares by their like negligence in matters of warre, were vtterly subdued and brought into ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude by the <hi>Turkes.</hi> The Romanes also themselues, after that they had by their notable <hi>milicia,</hi> atchieued wonderfull victories and conquests, through the peace but of a few yeares, did growe so to decay in their discipline Militarie, that <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball</hi> that notable Captaine of <hi>Carthage,</hi> atchieuing diuerse victories in <hi>Spaine</hi> against the Romanes, and marching with his army through <hi>France,</hi> and passing the mountaines of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> did (before that the Romanes could renue and reduce themselues to their auncient <hi>Milicia</hi>) inuade <hi>Italie,</hi> and woon diuers notable battailes, and killed diuers of their Consuls and their whole Armies, and put <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe in great feare to be sacked and conquered. And if we list to consider of our owne Countrie and Nation in diuers ages, omitting infinite numbers of other examples of greater antiquitie, as also of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ages; we may see, that our auncestours the <hi>Saxons,</hi> that conquered and expulsed the <hi>Britans</hi> (the auncientest inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this Realme) by reason that they found them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without any orders and exercises Militarie, wholie giuen
<pb facs="tcp:18222:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to idlenes, vitiousnes &amp; delights, the same <hi>Saxons</hi> after, by lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g peace with forren Nations, being giuen to couetousnes, vice, and superfluities, as also to ciuile dissention amongst themselues at home, did so confound and forget their Arte and Science Militarie, by the which they in former times had bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours, that they themselues came after to be conquered by the <hi>Danes,</hi> and shortly after by the <hi>Normans.</hi> All which examples of conquests, and daungers of conquering, with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit others of great Empires, Kingdoms and Common wealths haue proceeded chiefly through the negligence of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Rulers and Magistrates, who through long peace, and ouermuch securitie, did gouerne their subiectes onely by lawes politike, neglecting and contemning all orders and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Militarie. And this dooth most manifestly appeare by many notable Histories that doo containe great actions.</p>
            <p>The second cause which doth confound and disorder all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and orders Militarie, is, intestine and ciuile warres, as we may see by many examples, of the which for breuities sake, I will only alleage two; the one ancient, &amp; the other of this time. The first is of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> which nation, vnder <hi>Mahomet</hi> that false prophet, &amp; his successors, <hi>Halifas,</hi> conquered a great part of <hi>Europe, Affrike</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> &amp; were (so long as they had but one supreme <hi>Halifa</hi> or Prince, to gouerne the <hi>Arabians</hi> and al their dominions by them conquered) so mighty through their excellent <hi>Milicia,</hi> that no forren Nation durst assaile them. But after, by their long liuing in peace and great pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie; in the end, through the viciousnes and insufficiencie of one of their supreme <hi>Halifas,</hi> that at that time raigned ouer them, fell into reuolt and intestine wars amongst themselues, striuing for the supreme throne and gouernement; in such sort, that in few yeres, they did so corrupt and confound their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent discipline Militarie, &amp; so weaken themselues by many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused battels, sackings and spoiles; and by diuiding their great Empire into diuers partes, vnder diuers <hi>Halifas,</hi> that the <hi>Turkes</hi> (a new Nation, who had an excellent <hi>Milicia</hi>) did inuade their dominions, and within few yeares brought them into subiection to the <hi>Turkie</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18222:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>Now the other example, which is of our time, is <hi>Fraunce,</hi> which kingdome (vntill <hi>Lewes</hi> the eleuenth did serue himselfe with mercinaries) had a well ordered <hi>Milicia,</hi> offensiue and defensiue, and that chiefly on horsebacke, and yet diuers yeares had some reliques and remnants of the same; but nowe in this later time, the French Nation, hauing continued seauen or eight and twenty yeares in ciuile warres amongest themselues, they haue so corrupted and confounded all their ancient orders and proceedings in matters Militarie, that they haue at this present, no shew, token, nor mention of the same, but disorder, disobedience and confusion; which hath proceeded of the like causes that brought the <hi>Arabians</hi> and many other Nations (through intestine warres) to corrupt and confound their Arte and Science Militarie, as it shall more particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by that which followeth. I think all men of experience &amp; iudgement in matters of warre, do know, that the first &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall thing that is requisite to assemble and forme an armie, or armies, and to keepe the same in obedience with good effect, is treasure, to maintaine pay and reward, with seuere execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of excellent Lawes Militarie. Which, what Prince soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he be that hath, with sufficient Generals, &amp; other Officers, to commaund and gouerne, may very well haue a well ordered <hi>Milicia</hi>; by reason that no souldiours well payd, and chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing subiects to the Prince that they serue, can vse any excuses not to obserue all lawes and orders Militarie, of Sea or Land, Towne, Campe or Field. Besides that, vpon any transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of orders, it is lawfull for the Captains and higher Officers, to correct, reforme and punish, according to the lawes and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances Militarie: from whence it commeth to passe, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as the Citizens of a wel ordered Citie, through the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good lawes, ciuil and criminall, by excellent gouernors, doo liue in great order, quietnes and prosperitie, without any ciuile dissention: Euen so, an Armie in the field, being well payed, prouided for and gouerned, doo liue as orderly in towne, campe and field, without robbing, spoiling, or otherwise iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any other, but the common enemie.</p>
            <p>Now to maintaine, and continue the same, it dooth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houe
<pb facs="tcp:18222:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a King in his kingdome, and chieflie in the bodie of the same to be well obeyed; that by the quiet obedience of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, he may receiue all his customes, rents and reuenewes, with all other subsidies and aides, that of antiquitie his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors haue accustomed to receiue; with newe supplies of men and munitions from time to time to ranforce his Armie or Armies. All which, the French Kings (through their subiects so often taking Armes, and such intestine warres so manie yeares) haue so come to want, that they haue not had anie meanes possible to maintaine any other but a deformed and disordered <hi>Milicia</hi>; by reason that the Nobilitie and Princes of the bloud, vppon diuers legitimate causes by them pretended, with their friends and followers, taking Armes against them, a great part of the reuenewe of the Crowne, with all other customes, subsidies and aides, haue in diuers Cities, Townes and Prouinces, come to cease, and the same to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed by the Kings enemies armed: by meanes whereof the French Kings, that haue liued in the times of these intestine warres, haue not had treasure to pay their Armies, whereby to keepe their men of warre in any discipline; Besides that, by those continuall dissentions, they haue lackt a great part of their Nobilitie and subiects, to ranforce their Armies. The Nobilitie also, and Princes of the bloud, that haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in Armes against their Kings (notwithstanding their vsurped reuenewe and treasure of the Crowne) haue beene as little, or lesse able to pay their men of warre; so that, all the intestine and ciuill warres, that haue continued so manie yeares in <hi>France,</hi> with the slaughter and destruction of such infinite numbers of all sorts of people, haue beene maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and continued tumultuaritie, more by spoyle, sedition, passion and faction; than by any pay, order, and discipline Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie.</p>
            <p>Whereof it hath come to passe, that such Armies as haue serued vnder the French Kings, or vnder the Nobilitie, that haue continued in armes against them, (how good Officers &amp; gouernors soeuer they had) could not haue any certen nor orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:18222:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Milicia</hi>; by reason, that through the lacke of certaine pay, and no hope of reward for extraordinary deserts, it hath come to passe, that the souldiors thereby being made voluntary, haue obeyed their Captaines no otherwise than hath pleased them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, altering and changing their weapons, as also themselues out of one band into an other, and sometimes horsemen to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come footemen, and footemen to become horsemen; besides their forraging and stragling from their Ensignes without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; as also their negligence and lacke of vigilancie in their watches, bodies of watches and centinels, and by disordering themselues vpon euery light occasion both in battallion, squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron and troupe. Captaines also, haue oftetimes formed, or rather deformed their bands, both on horsebacke and on foote, with armors and weapons, new inuented by themselues, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controlment, different from all orders Militarie. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, and whole armies also, both of the one side and of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue very seldome, or neuer, according to the Arte Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, lodged themselues in any campe formed, but dispersed and scattered by bands in many Townes and Villages with great disorder. Besides that, both Captaines, Souldiors and all other men of warre, for lacke of ordinary pay, haue liued a great deale more vpon the spoile, and misusing of the common people, their fellow-subiects and friends, than vpon any spoile, or annoying of the enemy armed: through which great disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and lack of pietie, contrary to all diuine &amp; humane lawes, it hath come to passe, that such Officers, Captains and Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours that haue serued any long time in such licentious and tumultuarie wars (be they subiects or mercenaries) can very hardly after be reformed and reduced to containe themselues, and liue vnder any discipline Military, where Iustice without fauour is executed, because they neuer before liued vnder any seuerity of lawes Martiall; but haue spent their times, &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their chiefe soldiorie, in such disordered &amp; licentious wars, where in respect of spoile and gaine, they haue accounted and holden both friends &amp; enemies al in one reckoning and degree. Now the ciuil wars of <hi>France</hi> hauing growen to be so disorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, &amp; without any discipline through their intestine dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:18222:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(as I haue before mentioned) with many other disorders, a great deale more orderlie, and particularlie set downe by that braue soldier, <hi>Monsieur de la Noüe</hi> in his discourses: how farre of further, then is it euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that the tumultuarie, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused warres of the Lowe Countries haue been from all order &amp; discipline Militarie, where both mercenaries and subiects, haue serued vnder subiects, called by the title of States? which gouernment hath been popular, and consisted of sundrie heads, and of those verie fewe Noble; but Merchants, Citizens and Burghers; whose pay as it was manie yeares to the English, French and other mercenaries more by words and promises, than by any good performance: so the seruices of such hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, were as disordred, and voide of all discipline Militarie; as it hath most manifestlie appeared by their proceedings and actions; some part of the which, (by the helpe of almightie God) I will set downe, that thereby it may be apparantlie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, what kind of men of warre those disordred warres of the Lowe Countries haue bred and brought forth, and of what experience and sufficiencie, they may bee esteemed to be, that doo with such an ouerweening disesteeme, and condemne the great Captaines of times past, as also the old men of warre of diuers Nations yet liuing, in respect of themselues; saying fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that their warres of the Low Countries doo farre exceed and excell the warres of times past in all perfection. And therefore, I will set downe and compare part of the opinions, proceedings and orders Militarie, of the great Captaines and men of warre, both auncient and moderne; with the straunge opinions, newe kinds of <hi>Milicias</hi> (or rather <hi>Malicias,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderlie proceedings of our such men of warre. And in al those things which I in this Proëme will mention concerning them and their wonderfull errors and disorders Militarie, I will not set downe anie thing of mine owne knowledge, nor inuented, nor deuised by me, but a verie few of the smallest of an infinite number of their disorderlie proceedings, contrarie to all pietie, and discipline Militarie, which I haue heard manie, &amp; manie times publikelie reported by manie valiant Gentlemen of our Nation, that haue detested the same; diuers of the which are
<pb facs="tcp:18222:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of verie good houses, and not anie one of them but that hath serued in those warres, some of them fifteene or sixteene yeares past, in the time of the <hi>Commendator major Requesenes,</hi> others of them a dozen yeares past in the time of <hi>Don Iuan de Austria,</hi> and others at the Earle of <hi>Leicesters</hi> going ouer, and also before. All which Gentlemen hauing been eye witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of those wonderfull disorders (which haue redownded to the consumption and losse of many thousands of yong Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Yeomen, and Yeomen sonnes, and others of the most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>post and lustie sort of people of our Nation) haue mooued me (not vpon any hate, I protest, that I beare vnto any of them in respect of my selfe, but onlie for the great loue that I beare to my Prince, Countrie and Nation) to commit those things with great blame of writing, to the intent that hereafter the same may be some kind of terror to all others to take such barbarous and base proceedings in hand. And therefore will proceed to the matter.</p>
            <p>First, it is very well knowne to all men of experience and iudgement in matters of Armes, that all such great Captaines as haue been Lieutenants generalls to Emperours, Kings, or formed Common wealths, or that with regiments of their owne Nation haue serued forraine Princes, as mercenaries (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Iustice is the Prince of all order and gouernment both in warre and peace, by the which God is honoured and serued, and Magistrates and Officers obeyed) haue at the first form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Armies or such Regiments, by great aduise of Counsell established sundrie lawes both Politique and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, with Officers for the superintending and due execution of the same, which haue been notified to all their men of warre, as also at euerie incamping or lodging haue been set, written or printed in certaine tables in conuenient places for all soldiers and men of warre to behold, to the intent that none might transgresse through ignorance: All which by some of the chiefe of our such mercenarie men of warre haue been so vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, or by them not vnderstood, that they neuer vsed anie such matter, but in stead of the same, haue onlie set downe a verie few written lawes, altogether cunningly and artificiallie,
<pb facs="tcp:18222:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tending to terrifie their soldiers from demanding of their paies due; as also from complaining of the misusages of their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and higher Officers: but to terrifie them from spoyling, robbing, and taking by force from the common countrie people their friends, with many other great offences, there was no prohibition, nor penaltie of lawes set downe; they often terming those to be best soldiers that could liue without pay, by stealing and spoyling most; saying further, that to forme and establish many lawes politique and Martiall, it was the manner of old dunsicall Captaines in times past, who did not vnderstand their excellent discipline of this time, and that all lawes of Towne, Campe and Field should bee in the wisedome and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Generall; which their grosse and ignorant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites, through their lacke of iustice, cost the liues of a great sort of braue men; for in stead of proceeding orderlie vppon lawes Militarie established (as aforesaid) they proceeded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to such lawes as they conceiued in their owne simple braines. Whereof it hath come to passe, that manie of honest parentage haue been condemned to death vpon diuers offences, that the transgressors themselues haue not knowne to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions of death, and others that haue committed as great, or greater offences, haue escaped with verie little or no punishment at all.</p>
            <p>Also, whereas in all ages and times, all Emperours, Kings, and formed Common wealthes, that haue employed their Generalls with Armies either in warres offensiue or defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue, haue established a Counsell of men of great sufficiencie both in warre and peace to assist their Generalls; of the which some of the chiefe Officers of the Armie, by the right and due of their Offices, were alwaies of the same counsell, as also some others, according to the choise and liking of such Princes; and this, to the intent that their Generalls in all important mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters should consult with them: The conclusion, and resolution of such consultations notwithstanding to remaine in the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, iudgement and valour of the Generalls. And that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it hath bin alwaies the vse of all mercenarie Coronels both <hi>Almanes</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> that haue been hired into the seruices
<pb facs="tcp:18222:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of forraine Princes vpon all important occasions to consult with their Sergeants Maiors, and certeine other Captaines and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers for the well ordring and gouerning of their Regiments. Euen so contrariwise, some of our chiefe men of warre that haue had great charges in the Lowe Countrie warres, haue not onelie contemned and disdained to haue anie counsell about them, or to take counsell of some of their Captaines and other Officers, but haue also spoken to the blame and reproach of some notable and very sufficient Generalls of this time, because they haue vsed in all important matters to consult with their Counsellors, saying, that they were therefore verie simple men, and that they were able to doo nothing of themselues, but onlie by the aduise of Counsell. By the which, our such men of warre haue not onelie shewed a wonderfull ouerweening, and lacke of discretion in those their vaine and fond opinions; but also haue in the gouernment of their charges (which was altogether of their owne heads) shewed themselues as fond and voide of all reason and order Militarie. Also, whereas all wise and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Generalls and Coronels haue alwaies had speciall regard, when the Enemie hath not been neere at hand; that their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants Maiors, Captaines, &amp; other Officers, should oftentimes in the field reduce their bands &amp; regiments into diuers formes, and to teach their soldiers all orders Militarie, with the vse of their weapons in euerie degree, time and place, as also how to lodge in their quarters orderlie, and therewithall to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the orders of watches, bodies of watches, centinells, rounds, and counterrounds, with many other matters Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, whereby they might be made prompt and readie to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the Enemie: so contrariwise, our such men of warre in the Lowe Countries did very seldome, or rather neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct nor teach their soldiers any such matter, whereby it hath come to passe, that their old soldiers Piquers with their piques, Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers with their weapons of fire, haue in certaine trainings here in <hi>England</hi> shewed and vsed such <hi>Matiches,</hi> as they haue giuen occasion to bee scorned and laughed at, by such old Captaines of experience as haue seene their doings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18222:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>And whereas also all men of warre in times past haue had speciall care that all their soldiers should be fitlie apparelled and armed, according to the different weapons that all sorts of their soldiers did vse, and that they should not lacke any of their weapons, nor any part or peece of their armours, but that the same should be by them fitlie and aptlie worne, and from time to time kept cleane and neate: So contrariwise, some of our such men of warre haue holden these matters for such trifles, that they haue had so little care thereof, that they haue been contented to suffer their soldiers to goe euill weaponed, and worse armed, and many of them without any kind of armour at all, and in their apparell all to be totterd and torne, and some of them bare legged, or bare footed like roges: a thing neuer before heard off in any age, that men of warre, and chieflie the English nation, going to the aide of a forraine Nation, and the countrie and people wonderfull rich and plentifull in all abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and their Captaines themselues verie gallant in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and their purses full of gold; that their soldiers should be in such poore and miserable estate. Also, whereas it hath been the vse of all great Captaines and Chieftaines, vpon anie long march &amp; enterprise intended, with all foresight &amp; prouidence to prouide plentie of victuall, and all other things necessarie for the sustenance of all their soldiers, euen to the meanest &amp; least of accompt; as also of great store and plentie of powder &amp; shot, with some ouerplus of weapons of diuers sorts for al accidents &amp; employments, with al other things requisite: So some of our such men of warre vpon their occasions of marches and enterprises, haue prouided plentie of victuall onlie for themselues and their followers, suffering their bands &amp; regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to straggle, &amp; spoyle the people of the Countrie oftentimes to their owne mischiefe, &amp; in the rest to take their aduentures, and sometimes to starue, or at least to be driuen to great extremitie of hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger. Besides that, for powder, shot, and ouerplus of weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, they haue prouided no more than that which their soldiers haue carried about them, which haue been with great scarcitie; which doth argue their small care of the health &amp; safetie of their soldiers, &amp; their little intention to doo any great hurt to the enemie, and therewithall
<pb facs="tcp:18222:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a great ignorance in the Art and Science Militarie. And whereas also in all well ordered <hi>Milicias,</hi> the commendation and sufficiencie of all Generalls, Coronells, Captaines and other Officers, hath consisted in knowing how to command, gouerne, and order their Armies, Regiments, bands and companies, and to winne the loue of their soldiers by taking great care of their healths and safeties, as also by all examples of vertue and worthines, not onlie by instruction, but also by action in their owne persons, venturing their liues in all actions against the enemie amongst them, and therewithall accompting of them in sicknes and health, or wounds receiued, as of their owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and that all Coronells and Captaines of horsemen, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all discipline, haue vsed to serue amongst their horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men on horsebacke, and that all Coronells and Captaines of footmen, yea euen the verie Lieutenants generalls, and Kings themselues (if their Armies and forces of the field haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted more of footmen than of horsemen) haue alwaies vsed by all discipline Militarie, vppon the occasion of anie battaile, to put their horses from them, and to serue on foote, and to venter their liues in the former rankes. Euen so contrariwise, the new discipline of some of our chiefe men of warre of the Lowe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries hath been, neuer to winne nor procure the loue of their soldiers by anie affabilitie or fauour shewed vnto them, nor yet by anie care taking for their healthes and safeties, and vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie accidents of sicknes, or wounds receiued, they haue present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie disesteemed them, as base and vile creatures, neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming amongst them neither in sicknes nor health, but onlie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon occasion of seruice: and for anie instruction or examples of vertue and worthines in the actions of their owne persons to be shewed amongst their soldiers, it hath not been their delight nor profession; and for them to haue imitated the great and famous Captaines of al other times, both ancient and moderne, in venturing their liues amongst their soldiers (as aforesaid) according to their <hi>Milicia,</hi> that hath consisted more of foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men than of horsemen, it hath been contrarie to their newe discipline, which hath not permitted that they should learne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing of anie great Captaines, but onelie of themselues:
<pb facs="tcp:18222:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whereof it hath come to passe, that some of our such chiefe men of warre in the Low Countries, whose strength in the field hath consisted of farre greater numbers and forces of footmen than horsemen, and that some other ordinarie Captaines also, whose charges haue consisted onlie of footmen, haue (presentlie vpon their squadrons formed, and approach or sight of the Enemie) mounted vppon horses of swift <hi>Carrires,</hi> and either haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied their footmen vpon the flankes or rereward, being so well mounted, or els haue put themselues into some bands of horsmen; as though it were against their reputation to serue on foote amongst their soldiers; or rather (as it may be thought) that vppon anie hard accident they might be readie (leauing their soldiers to the slaughter) to saue themselues rather with the force of their heeles and spurres, than with any of sword, which amongst manie other, hath been one special cause that there haue been so great numbers of soldiers at diuers times consumed and slaine, and neuer anie Chieftaine, nor any other of our such men of warre. Which their newe discipline is such a mockerie, and so contrarie to all order Militarie, as that such are not to bee accoumpted worthie to take the charge of men, nor yet to bee reckoned amongst the number of soldiers.</p>
            <p>And whereas also all great Captaines, Chieftaines, and men of charge haue holden for a <hi>Maxime,</hi> to preserue by all meanes possible the liues of their soldiers, and not to employ and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard them vppon euerie light occasion, and therewithall to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme the preseruation of the liues of a verie fewe of their sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, before the killing of great numbers of their enemies: Euen so contrariwise, the new discipline of some of our men of warre in the Lowe Countries, hath been, to send, and employe their soldiers into manie daungerous and vaine exploites and seruices, without any reason Militarie, hauing sure regard to their owne safeties; as though they desired and hoped to haue more gaine and profite by the dead paies of their soldiers slaine, than encrease of reputation by the atchieuing and preuailing in anie such enterprises.</p>
            <p>Besides that, it hath been sometimes a practise by some of
<pb facs="tcp:18222:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our such men of warre, when they haue borne anie hatred or malice to such as haue serued vnder them, to deuise some dangerous enterprise of purpose to employ the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in, from whence they might hardly escape with their liues, to the intent that they might hit two markes at one shoote, that is, take reuenge of such as they hated, and gaine the dead paies of such as were there slaine; which was an infernall inuention. And this I would not haue set downe if I had not heard it most constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie affirmed by some of those themselues, that haue been of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose sent to such banquets, and haue with great daunger esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out of such enterprises. And whereas there is nothing more requisite to keepe men of warre in obedience and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, than pay and good vsage of their Chieftaines, Coronells, Captaines, and other Officers, (which hath been the cause that in all well ordered warres both ancient and moderne, the Generalls, Chieftaines and Captaines, haue alwaies vsed to procure and liberallie to pay, or to see the same paied to their soldiers, without defrauding them of any part thereof:) so some of our such men of warre haue in those warres procured pay for their soldiers; but when they haue obtained and receiued it, they haue vsed diuers waies to defraude them of the same, but chieflie two, speciallie to be noted; of the which the first hath been, that presently vpon the receipt of their pay, (or els that they haue been assured that they should receiue the same) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a day or two daies after, they haue presentlie deuised some verie daungerous enterprise to employ their bands and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in, to make proofe how manie in such exploytes should leese their liues, that they might enrich themselues by their dead p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ies; during which employments, some of our such chiefe men of warre that deuised the same, remained in great townes fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, banquetting, and carowsing with their dames. And their second policie and practise hath been, that they haue plainlie kept and conuerted (or rather peruerted) a great part thereof to their owne vses, lodging their soldiers dispersed and strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Villages, and in stead of pay haue suffered them to goe <hi>alla picoree,</hi> that was, to robbe and spoyle the Boores their friends: whereupon it came to passe, that the Boores fearing
<pb facs="tcp:18222:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
such mercenaries more than their enemies, did arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and stoode vpon their gardes, in such sort, that at times it cost the liues of a great number of our braue Nation. And for Captaines, diuerse wayes to become Merchants, and chiefly in selling their bandes one to an other, as also in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to farme for a yearely rent vnto their Lieutenants, as if they were flockes of milch Ewes, it hath beene too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten put in practise. And whereas also, all Generalls and Chiefetaines of all Nations of anie iudgement, vpon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch of any Citie, Towne, or place fortified, haue vsed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch the same with trenches, crosse-trenches, gabions, and diuerse other ordinary and extraordinary inuentions, (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the scituation of the ground) for the preseruing, and sauing of the liues of their Souldiors, and that they haue not offered to giue any assault, vntill by the battery and effect of great Ordinaunce, planted vppon <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

            <p>Besides that, in this later time (I meane within these very fewe yeares) most grosely and ignorantly in the time of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with some thousandes of our braue English people, they laie
<pb facs="tcp:18222:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
shooting off gunnes diuers weekes against some great Towne well fortified, with a broad and a large riuer nauigable being betwixt them, without anie other wayes besieging of it, their Campe lying in a wet moorish ground, where their soldiors in their watches and centinels stoode to the mid legges in dyrt &amp; myre, with frost, snow, raine and mysts, and small store of victuall, and at their dislodging from thence, did dislodge stragling by bands, without any chiefetaine to direct and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne them. All which disorders cost the liues of some thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of our gallant English Nation, the dead payes of the which so great numbers of souldiors so fondly and wilfully cast away, did redound greatly to the enriching of some of our such men of warre. And now in the same later time, when all things should by all reason haue beene reduced vnto order and discipline, because the nature of the warre was altered from mercenary and voluntary, to princely authoritie; I meane the Sommer before the Earle of <hi>Leicester</hi> went ouer, our such men of war that had serued diuers yeares before in those parts deuised a newe inuention, neuer heard nor read of before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst any men of warre, but onely vpon some great lackes and extremities, and that was, that their Soldiors, in steade of pay with money, should be payed in <hi>Prouand,</hi> which was bread and cheese, and other such victuall of the best cheape and basest sort, and that taxed by measure; saying, that it was not conuenient that their Souldiors should receiue their owne payes, because they knewe not how to lay out their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but that they would spend it idlely; which simplicity and ignorance, if it had beene in them (as it was not) they, and their officers, by good instruction should haue reformed the same. But such couetous men of warre, vnder that pretence (as though their Souldiours had beene either naturall fooles or children) did contrarie to all Militarie order put the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of their Souldiors pay into their owne purses, allowing them great scarcity of <hi>Prouand.</hi> By which means it came to passe, that diuers thousands of their Souldiors in those plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Countries, partly by hunger, and partly by euill lodging, &amp; altogether by the small care and misuse of our such men of
<pb facs="tcp:18222:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
warre did perish. Besides that, great numbers of such their sicke and starued Souldiors, by the order of the Earle of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> were in those partes embarked, and transported into <hi>Essex, Kent,</hi> and other partes of <hi>England,</hi> to recouer health, of which foresaid great numbers of miserable &amp; pitiful ghosts, or rather shadowes of men, the <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Kentish</hi> carts and carters (that carried them) can testifie; of which, scarce the fortieth man escaped with life. Also, when any of their Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors, through the naughtines, or scarcitie of their victuall, or by their euill lodging, or by the pestering, or lying of two or three hundred of them together in some one Church, and so in diuers Churches, vpon the bare pauements, or vpon diuers other disorders, and misusages of some of our such men of war, fell sicke; our such men of warre presently did casse, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them out of their bands for dead men, turning their <hi>Prouand</hi> money with all ouerplusses into their owne purses, procuring newe supplies of well apparelled, and lusty yong men out of <hi>England,</hi> to the intent to serue their owne turnes, and to consume people after people. All which marueilous disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of some of our such men of warre against their Souldiors, contrary to all discipline Militarie, by them practized and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, with infinit others (which to rehearse would make a huge volume) were the occasion that manie thousands of the lustiest and dispost sort of our English people, were in those warres (as it were) wittingly and willingly cast away; besides great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that at diuers times did choose rather to flie to the enemy than to serue vnder such cruell and disordered chiefetaines; And these wonderfull disorders, with innumerable others did continue and increase vntill such time as diuers yong No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen lately comming to take principall charges in those wars, as also diuers knights and Gentlemen of Noble and of Worshipfull houses, and themselues of great valour and woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines did complaine of, and discouer those most strange and wonderfull abuses, vnto the Queene, and to her Counsell; who vnderstanding thereof, did very nobly reforme and redresse diuers of those disorders, taking further order, that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said newe deuised <hi>Prouand</hi> should be abolished, and that in
<pb facs="tcp:18222:13"/>
steade thereof, the Souldiours should receiue their owne payes in money; which, with the wise and worthie proceedings and courses of the aforesaid Noblemen, Knights and Gentlemen, that began with great order and Discipline, to serue in those warres, some at, and others since, the going ouer of the Earle of <hi>Leicester,</hi> hath of late greatly preuailed and redounded to the reformation of diuers of those strange inuentions, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, inuented and brought into those warres by the aforesaide newe fantasied men of warre.</p>
            <p>But now, for excuse vsed by some of our such men of war, for the casting away and losse of such great numbers, and many thousands of our gallant English people in those Lowe countrie warres, as also in later wars, (I meane not in <hi>France,</hi> where I neuer heard any blame, but great honour imputed to the Chiefetaine, and commendation to the Captaines; but in a very short warre of a great deale further distance, but of a wonderfull consumption of our braue Nation, through great disorder, and lacke of discipline Militarie: the particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whereof, because I haue not hitherto handled, I omit) some of our such men of warre haue not beene ashamed, manie times to report and say, that all those braue people that haue beene consumed and lost in the Lowe Countries, and those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fore-mentioned warres, by their disorders (as aforesaid) were the very scomme, theeues, and roges of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore haue beene very well lost, and that the Realme (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too full of people) is very well ridde of them, and that if they had not beene consumed in those warres, they would haue died vnder a hedge, with diuers other such brutish and infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall speaches, euen like vnto themselues, and to the newe disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline by them inuented and practized, rather to dispeople a kingdome of <hi>England</hi> of the youth and floure thereof, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie wayes to doo anie hurt vnto the enemie. Whereas contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise it is very welknowen vnto all the Iustices of peace in al shires of <hi>England,</hi> from whence those Souldiors did go volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, or otherwise, euen from the beginning of the first volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie warres, vntill this day, (sauing such as were leuied in the Citie of <hi>London</hi> by commission, and some fewe roges in one
<pb facs="tcp:18222:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yeare leuied in other shires) that they were in a verie great part yong Gentlemen, and in a farre greater part of Yeomen and Yeomens sonnes, and the rest of the brauest sort of Artificers, and other lustie yong men, desirous of a gallantnes of mind, to aduenture themselues, and see the warres, many thousands of the which (being the verie floure of <hi>England</hi>) did farre exceed, and excell our such men of warre both in goodlines of perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and worthines of mind; and these were no roges, nor theeues, nor the scomme of <hi>England,</hi> as those our such men of warre doo ofttimes report: for it is verie well knowne in all shires by experience, that such malefactors and base minded people, neuer had any desire, nor will to go into anie warres and actions Militarie, but haue hidden and absented themselues away during the times of musters and leuies, and when the same haue been past, they haue againe followed their vile occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of robbing, pilfering and stealing. Besides that, it is most manifest, that before some of our such men of warre tooke those voluntarie warres in hand, there were verie few theeues and roges in <hi>England,</hi> in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison that there are now, that haue come out of their discipline; for it is certaine, that this new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <hi>Milicia</hi> and euill gouernment of our such men of war, by suffering their soldiers for lacke of pay in those warres to go a robbing and spoyling the countrie people their friends (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid) hath brought many of them from good to euill, and made most of those that haue returned into <hi>England</hi> impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent roges and theeues, that were true men before they went ouer. By which their merueilous disordered, and deformed discipline, it is come to passe that many, and many thousands of the brauest and lustiest sort of people able to weare armes, and to serue in any warres either offensiue or defensiue, are (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid) consumed in those warres, and the number of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised and expert soldiers, meete vpon any occasion to serue the Prince and Realme, by those seruices no waies increased; by reason that all such as haue come out of those seruices (vnlesse it be the Captaines, and a fewe Officers of bands) are almost all turned from miserable soldiers that they were in those Lowe Countries, to most impudent roges and theeues, that by no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb facs="tcp:18222:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nor pollicie can be reformed and reduced to any honest course of life, all which hath come to passe through the extreme euill gouernement of some of our such men of war (as aforesaid.) And whereas they talke and boast so much of their new dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline Militarie, and of their owne sufficiencies, and that they doe exceede and excell all the ancient men of war of times past, as also such as are yet liuing: Certainely, all men that list may beholde their newe <hi>Milicia</hi> of their owne forming, as aforesaid, of theeues and roges that doe swarme in all the high wayes, and gaoles of <hi>England.</hi> Which doth make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest the great insufficiencies of such as haue beene Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, actors and performers of that infernall discipline: some of the which also haue not contented themselues to worke the aforesaid great euills to their Countrie and Nation (before declared) but haue of late yeares, since they came out of those Lowe Countrie warres sought to bring to passe two other such notorious and deformed effectes amongst the English Nation, as may in time to come, be the vtter ruine of this most noble kingdome and people; euen as the like hath beene of diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Monarchies: of the which two effects, the one hath beene to celebrate; the other to abolish and extinguish. That to celebrate, hath been to the feasts of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> with carow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and drunkennesse. Which most foule and detestable vice, is enemy to all Discipline and Exercises Militarie, and to be short, to all vertues and excellencies both of bodie and soule, and in the rest is the very mother and nurse of effemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, of cowardice, of sensualitie, of rebellion, of couetousnes, and all other vices that can be imagined; as we may euidently see by our next neighbours the Flemings, and Dutch, whose vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and imperfections (sauing onely their pollicie to grow rich, and gather goods) for breuities sake I ouerpasse. And this forren vice hath bene brought out of those Lowe Countries by some of our such men of warre within these very fewe yeares, whereof it is come to passe, that nowadayes there are very fewe feastes, where our said men of warre are present, but that they doo inuite, and procure all the companie, of what calling soeuer they be, to carowsing and quaffing; and because they wil
<pb facs="tcp:18222:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not be denied their challenges, they will with many new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ceremonies and reuerences, drinke to the health and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie of Princes; to the health of Counsellors, and vnto the health of their greatest friends both at home and abroad; in which exercise they neuer cease till they be dead drunke, or as the Flemings say, <hi>Doot dronken.</hi> Which their quaffings, and carowsings, with all their ceremonies, is no other but a blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming and offending of God in the highest degree, a touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the honour of the Princes, vnto whose healths they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowse, and a very offering of sacrifice vnto <hi>Satanas,</hi> or rather to <hi>Belzebub</hi> himselfe the Prince of feendes. Certainely, a wonderfull pitifull case, that anie of our such men of warre or nation vnder the pretence of souldiorie, and warlike Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, should nowadayes in steade of praying to God, for the health of Princes, which hath beene alwayes very commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly vsed amongst all good subiects, Christians, drinke and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowse drunke to the health, &amp; prosperity of Kings, Kingdoms, and States; And that men that haue beene created by God to his owne similitude and likenes, should contrarie to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, by such filthie disorder make themselues farre inferiour to most brute beasts. And this aforesaid detestable vice hath within these sixe or seuen yeares taken wonderfull roote amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest our English Nation, that in times past was wont to be of all other Nations of Christendome one of the soberest; And this is one of the fruits and merchandize of their discipline that our such men of warre haue brought in amongst vs.</p>
            <p>Now, the other effect that they haue sought most blindlie and maliciouslie to bring to passe, to the great daunger that vppon diuers accidents may hereafter happen to the Crowne and Realme of <hi>England</hi> and English Nation, hath been, and is to seeke to abolish and extinguish the notable exercise and vse of our Long-bowes and Archerie; by which weapons our auncestors, with many miraculous victories, haue made our Nation famous both in <hi>Europe, Affrick</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> so that in stead of Archerie, which is the soberest exercise of all others to auoide drunkennes and other euills, and a most manlie exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise and wholesome for the health of the bodie, and to encrease
<pb facs="tcp:18222:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
strength; and for battailes and victories of farre greater ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, than any other weapon that euer was or shall be inuented; our such men of warre vnder pretence of the excellencie of the weapons of fire by them misreported, would bring in carowsing and drunkennes: which two things, I meane of the neglecting and suppressing of the vse and exercise of Bowes and Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and bringing in of superfluities and drunkennes, hath been the ruine of manie great Empires, Kingdoms and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthes, as it is apparant by the testimonie of many notable histories. As for example, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> (before mentioned in this Proëme) vnder their most valiant and mightie King <hi>Sesosis</hi> or <hi>Sesostris,</hi> and other their notable Princes, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer a great part of <hi>Asia, Europe</hi> &amp; <hi>Affrick</hi> by their notable <hi>Milicia,</hi> which did consist most of Archerie and Bowes: but after, through long peace, and the negligence of some of their effeminate Kings, the same warlike Nation did growe to such drunkennes and gluttonie, that thereby forgetting the vse and exercise of their Bowes, they were conquered and subdued <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, the greatest part of whose Armie did consist of Archerie, and after that many times subdued and kept in seruitude by the <hi>Milicia</hi> and force of Archerie of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other sober Nations. The Empire of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> also at such time as they were vnder one Empire, and that the Emperours held their imperiall seate in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> as carefull as some of those Emperours were to keepe their subiects the <hi>Grecians</hi> in exercise of Armes, and chieflie of Archerie, yet after in the time of other Emperours that were careles and effeminate, their subiects giuing themselues, through long peace, vnto feasting and drunkennes, and neglecting the exercize of Bowes and Archerie, did so forget the vse of that most excellent weapon, that they were many times vanquished by the <hi>Milicia</hi> of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> that consisted most of all of Bowemen: which conquering Nation at that time gaue themselues to labour and trauell, and to the exercise of their bowes, with great sobrietie, and not to drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes. And the subiectes of the very same Empire of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> long after the time of their great ouerthrowes by
<pb facs="tcp:18222:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>Arabians,</hi> through the negligence of some of their effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Emperours, as aforesaide, were by the constraint of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine imperiall statutes and ordinances of some other wise and valiant Emperours, reduced in a great, part from their drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes to sobrietie, and from idlenes to their ancient exercize of Archerie, by the which they did defend themselues against the <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Sarazins</hi> (during the time of those woorthie Emperours) very valiantly; but after againe in processe of time, through the effeminacie and negligence of other Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of no valour nor worthines, the said <hi>Grecians</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe to their former drunkennes, superfluities, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter forgetting of the vse, and exercize of their bowes and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie. Whereby it came to passe, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> the second of that name of the house of <hi>Otoman,</hi> with his notable <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> of <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Ianissaries,</hi> that consisted most of Bowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (a Nation no wayes giuen to drunkennesse) did vtterly subdue and conquere that Empire. Besides which examples, I coulde (if it were not too long) alleadge many others of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kingdomes, and mighty Nations, that through the dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable vices of drunkennes, couetousnes and superfluities, haue giuen themselues to effeminacie; and forgetting of all vse of their Bowes and Archerie, and other exercises Militarie: by meanes whereof they haue bene after conquered, and brought into seruitude by other sober and valiant Nations, that haue had the vse of the Bowe in great perfection. And to be briefe, there is no man that hath read many notable histories of great antiquitie, as also of later ages with obseruation, but hee shall most manifestly see, that drunkennes, couetousnes and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, haue caused the forgetting and contempt of the vse of Archerie, and all other exercises Militarie, which hath beene the ruine of most of all the Empires, Kingdomes and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that haue beene knowne, or written of in <hi>Europe, Affrick,</hi> or <hi>Asia</hi>; And if any of our such men of warre be so obstinate, that they wil not beleeue such notable Histories, let them then resorte to the Bible, which is the Booke of God, and then (if they be not possessed with some infernall spirit, that doth breed in them infidelitie) they shall not onely there see the great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb facs="tcp:18222:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that King <hi>Dauid</hi> that holie prophet made of that wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon after the ouerthrow and death of King <hi>Saul,</hi> slaine by the Philistines, great effectes perfourmed with that weapon by the <hi>Iewes</hi> vnder <hi>Iosuah</hi> their most excellent Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that did depose so many Kings; with many other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities: by the which it may be iustly gathered, that God gaue such excellent effects to that weapon, that when he diuers times promised helpe to the <hi>Iewes</hi> against the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> hee made speciall mention of that weapon. And when it pleased him to punish the <hi>Iewes</hi> for their idolatrie gluttonie, by the handes of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they receiued diuers ouerthrowes, by the effect of Bowes. Besides that, King <hi>Dauid</hi> dooth call Bowes a mightie power, and in his Psalmes, the vessells of death. By which examples before alleadged (that drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and neglecting of the exercize, and vse of Bowes, hath bin the ruine of many Empires and kingdomes) I thinke all men of consideration and iudgement may euidently see what pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and dangerous matters our such men of war haue by their euill and foule examples, and sinister perswasions, sought to drawe, and perswade our Nation vnto. Which with their innumerable disorders Militarie by them committed in the Lowe Countries, as also elsewhere, to the consumption, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of many and many thousands of our Nation (as is before declared:) may, I thinke, euidently shewe how vnfit and vnable such men of warre are to compare themselues with the great Captaines of former times, or with the ancient men of war yet liuing, that haue bene trained vp in matters of armes in the warres of Emperours or Kings, as also how much more insufficient they are to erect and innouate anie new Discipline Militarie amongst vs, or any wayes to suppresse or find fault with the exercise, vse, and effectes of our peculiar, and most victorious weapon the Long-bowe.</p>
            <p>And now that I haue in this Proëme laid open many foule &amp; detestable proceedings &amp; disorders of some of our such me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of war, practised and put in execution by them in the Low cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, as also some here at home, greatly to the hurt &amp; preiudice of our country &amp; Nation: I thinke it good to notifie vnto your
<pb facs="tcp:18222:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lordships, that I haue not taken it in hand, &amp; performed the same any waies moued therunto vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any priuat hatred or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice by me to anie of them borne. For I protest, that if they were all my verie neere kinsmen, the cause being publique, I would respect them no more than I haue respected these; but as for those men whosoeuer they be, to my remembrance, I haue had verie little or no conference with anie of them. Besides that, there is none of them, to my knowledge, that euer gaue vnto me (in respect of mine owne particular) anie occasion of offence: but the verie originall and principall cause that hath mooued me to set downe my discourses following, as also this my Proëme to your Lordships in this forme and phrase, hath been the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding loue, and extraordinarie zeale that I beare vnto my Prince, Countrie and Nation. That seeing and foreseeing the wonderfull euills that haue alreadie, and are likelie daylie, and from time to time more and more to ensue (if the same bee not speedilie prouided for and remedied) to no lesse in processe of time, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the ruine or great hazard of this most noble Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie; I therefore thought it my duetie, all priuate passion of feare, of loue, of hatred and affection set aside, to make manifest vnto your Lordships those great disorders and euills before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; that by your being put in remembrance, and knowing of them your Lordships (being the Nobilitie and <hi>Magnates</hi> of the Kingdome, and the verie eyes, eares, and of the King, and the bodie of the watch, and redresse of the Common wealth) may prouide for, preuent, and reforme the aforesaid great euills that doo threaten hereafter to ensue: al which haue come to my knowledge by the certaine and assured reports of verie many both wise and gallant Gentlemen of principall houses, and others of verie good sort, that haue serued some of them at one time, and some of them at other times, euen from the first voluntarie going ouer into those warres, till within these two yeares and a halfe, and within these three yeares last past; all which Gentlemen haue greatlie detested those afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said infinite disorders.</p>
            <p>And now, because that no Chieftaine, Coronell, nor Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that haue in those warres gouerned themselues and their
<pb facs="tcp:18222:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
charges with great care, reputation and worthines (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deserued great praise, and commendation) shall iustly think themselues any waies reproached or touched, by any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this my Proëme or discourses following; I notifie vnto them that no part of my intention nor meaning, nor any word to my knowledge in these contained, doo any waies sound to the touch or blame of any such worthie men, but altogether to their praise and commendation: for I would be sorie to erre so great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, as any waies to touch with blame anie men of worthines, but rather with my word, writing and action, to encrease their reputations; for if I haue in respect of the publique cause tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched our such men of warre aforesaid, with reproach, they themselues vpon a guilty conscience, will discouer who they are, by blaming and detesting my Proëme and discourses, by the which the honor and vertue of such men of worthines shall shine, and flourish the more through the cleerenes of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences not touched, according to the old saying, that <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching of vice is the honoring of vertue</hi>: for in troth, mine intention in this my Proëme, and discourses, hath been onlie to discouer the great disorders, and euils that some men of charge of our Nation (vnder pretence of a new discipline Militarie by them inuented in the Lowe Countries) did with great coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes practise, and exercise, to their owne gaine and profite in that their disordered <hi>Milicia,</hi> neglecting and contemning all true honor, reputation and worthines, to the great dishonor of our Countrie, and Nation. That thereby all yong Gentlemen that haue mispent their times in those tumultuarie, and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered warres without anie discipline, as also all other yong Gentlemen that are desirous to followe the profession of Armes may reiect, and detest such newe disordered, and detestable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines, and reduce themselues, and followe the true discipline Militarie of all warlike and worthie Nations both ancient and moderne, which do all concurre and conforme in one; and that is, that all true and vniuersall disciplines Militarie doo (as I haue learned by hearing the opinions of diuers great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, as also by reading diuers histories) brieflie consist as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth. That be he Emperour King, or a Lieutenant generall of
<pb facs="tcp:18222:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an Emperour, or of a King that doth commaund and gouerne an Armie.</p>
            <p>First of all, that he doo make God to be loued, feared and serued throughout his whole Armie: the second, that he doo knowe how to commaund and gouerne, with great prouidence, care, order and iustice, and by rewarding the good, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bad, and by keeping his whole Armie in discipline to make himselfe to bee no lesse loued than feared. The third is, often to consult with his counsell, and to know, how of himselfe (after the opinions of his counsell heard) with valour to resolue and performe, and in the rest, himselfe to know vpon all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full occasions and acccidents, how to preuent, remedie and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, as also to direct others with great skill and dexteritie. And these are the most principall poynts that doo belong to the Generall of an Armie.</p>
            <p>The sufficiencie of Coronells doth consist in the gouerning of their Regiments with all care, valour, affection and diligence; and that they doo make their Regiments as well in particular bands, as in the whole bodie of the same, to obserue all orders Militarie in lodging, dislodging, in marching, and in fighting, as also that they doo liue in great order, without stragling, spoiling or any waies iniuring: And in the rest, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronells themselues doo with all obedience.</p>
            <p>The sufficiencie of Captaines, doth consist in knowing how to gouerne and order their bands and Companies, &amp; to winne the loue of their soldiers, by all examples of vertue and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, not onlie by instruction, but also by action in their owne persons, accompting of their soldiers as of their owne children. And in the rest to be obedient, valiant and resolute, as also of sufficiencie to performe and execute all commandements and directions with discretion, valour and iudgement.</p>
            <p>The duetie and sufficiencie of soldiers, doth first and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallie consist, to be obedient to their Captaines, and all other their superiour Officers. The second, that they doo knowe how
<pb facs="tcp:18222:18"/>
to apparell and arme themselues fitlie, and to handle and vse their weapons in euerie time and place, and to knowe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue al orders Militarie. The third is, to be sober, patient, and able to endure labours and trauells.</p>
            <p>The sufficiencie of all higher and lower Officers of Armies vnder the Generall, is to knowe how to performe their Offices with all care, fidelitie, diligence and obedience.</p>
            <p>And such a Prince or Lieutenant generall of an Armie, as hath those sufficiencies in him (that I haue before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) cannot faile to frame good Officers of his Campe &amp; Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, as also good and sufficient Coronells and Captaines. And such Officers, Coronells and Captaines cannot faile to make good soldiers: All which, with the seruing of almightie God, tendeth to the orderlie proceeding and managing of a warre in all affaires and actions to the end of the same with victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
            <p>And this that I haue aboue set downe, is a principall part of a <hi>Milicia,</hi> and discipline Militarie of all warlike Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and the contrarie is tumultuarie, and cleane opposite to all Arte and Science Militarie. And this I haue written in the end of my Proëme for a note and remembrance, for all yong Gentlemen of our Nation, that haue a desire to winne honour by following of actions of Armes. And now I proceed to my discourses.</p>

            <head>Certen Discourses concerning the formes and effects of diuers sorts of weapons; and other very important matters Militarie, greatlie mistaken by diuers of our men of warre in these daies; and chieflie of the Mosquet, the Caliuer, and the Long-bowe, as also of the great sufficiencie, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, and wonderfull effects of Archers, with manie notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and other particularities. Composed by Sir <hi>Iohn Smythe,</hi> Knight. 1589. And printed 1590.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He straunge opinions, so won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfullie mistaken in these our daies in al matters Militarie, by diuers of our chiefe men of charge and warre, (as they are accompted) that haue learned their greatest skill in matters of Armes, seruing vnder the States, in the tumultuarie, licentious, and staruing warres of the Low Countries, or peraduenture some little in the ciuil warres of <hi>France,</hi> haue moued me to take in hand this discourse, to discouer their straunge and erronious opinions Militarie, by them published to our Nobilitie and chiefe Magistrates, as also to all the better sort of our people and Nation; which vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon anie important warre, either offensiue or defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue, may greatlie redound to the losse and daunger of our Prince, Countrie and Nation. In the which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
<pb facs="tcp:18222:20"/>
my meaning is not to touch the reputation of diuers of our auncient braue Captaines and Soldiers, who were men of good skill and sufficiencie before they entred into those warres, nor yet the reputation and honor of diuers Noble men,<note place="margin">No Noble nor worthie men, anie waies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be touched in this discourse.</note> as also Gentlemen, of noble or worshipfull houses, that of very late yeres haue entred into those seruices, rather to win reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, knowledge and honor, than for anie hope of gaine, or spoyle; of the which there be diuers that by the testimonie of their honorable actions, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of themselues, and the charges vnto them committed, haue deserued great praise and honour; but onelie to touch with blame and discommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, such, as attaining (I wot not how) to the highest places of office &amp; charge to commaund our English Nation in those parts, haue through their couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and lacke of loue towards the soldiers of their Nation, so corrupted, or rather (as much as in them hath lien) subuerted all discipline Militarie, to the great losse and dishonor of our Countrie and Nation, that neither they themselues, nor anie of their imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, are worthie to bee accompted in the number of men of warre, and much lesse to be esteemed by men of experience and iudgement in actions Militarie, to bee anie waies worthie to commaund and gouerne soldiers. In this discourse (also) I meane not at this time to meddle with the infinite nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of disorders Militarie by them committed in the Lowe Countrie warres, where they made a farre greater warre vpon our people &amp; Nation, than vpon the Enemies of our Countrie; but to handle diuers abuses of theirs, and chieflie, the abuses that they haue sought to bring our
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18222:20"/>
Nation into by mistaking of fortification, and of the effects of diuers weapons out of their due times and places, attributing to some weapons such effects as are not to bee performed with them, and detracting (most ignorantlie) the excellent effects of our peculiar and singular weapon the Long Bowe, seeking by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling the effects by them misreported and mistaken of the Mosquet and Caliuer, to make our Nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that our Long Bowes haue vtterlie lost their auncient effects, and therefore no more to be vsed, but to be vtterly suppressed and extinguished, with diuers other grose errors, contrarie to all reason and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience Militarie of all auncient and moderne warlike Nations. The most of the which that shall fall into my memorie, I will (with the help of almightie God) answere in such sort, as all men of experience and iudgement in matters of Armes, that haue serued in Armies and Campes formed, either of Emperours, Kings, or Common wealths, shal easilie discouer their lacke of experience and knowledge in matters Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie. And therefore I will begin with one of their toyes, and so proceed to greater matters.</p>
            <p>These our such men of warre before mentioned, in a manner, vtterlie ignorant of all our auncient dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and proceedings in actions of Armes, haue so affected the <hi>Wallons, Flemings,</hi> and base <hi>Almanes</hi> disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, (as some of them terme it) that they haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to innouate, or rather to subuert all our ancient proceedings in matters Militarie, and therefore haue left nothing in a manner vntouched, without seeking to alter and chaunge the same: as for example; They will not vouchsafe in their speaches or writings to
<pb facs="tcp:18222:21"/>
vse our ancient termes belonging to matters of warre,<note place="margin">Vaine innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient termes of warre.</note> but doo call a Campe by the Dutch name of <hi>Legar</hi>; nor will not afoord to say, that such a Towne, or such a Fort is besieged, but that it is <hi>belegard:</hi> Their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes also they will not call by that name, but by the name of <hi>Colours,</hi> which terme is by them so fondly &amp; ignorantly giuen, as if they should be apposed as yong scholers in their accidens, and should (in stead of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes) be asked how manie Colours of footme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there were in the Armie by <hi>Remenen</hi> vnder the <hi>Count Boissu</hi> against <hi>Don Iuan d' Austria,</hi> they must then either an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, a hundred, or more or fewer, as white, black, blewe, greene, yellowe, russet, &amp;c. or els forsake their newe terme of Colours, and say so manie Ensignes, Bands, or Companies, which in troth is no direct an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to the question. The bodie of the watch also or standing watch (as we were wont to terme it) they now call after the <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Wallons, Corps du gard,</hi> with manie other such Wallon and Dutch termes, as though our English Nation, which hath been so famous in all actions Militarie manie hundred yeres, were now but newlie crept into the world, or as though our language were so barren, that it were not able of it selfe, or by deriuation to affoord conuenient words to vtter our minds in matters of that qualitie.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">They fondlie scorne our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient manner of arming.</note>But that which is more strange, these our such new fantasied men of warre doo despise and scorne our auncient arming of our selues both on horseback and on foote, saying that wee armed our selues in times past with too much armour, or peeces of yron (as they terme it). And therefore their footmen piquers, they doo allowe for verie well armed when they weare
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18222:21"/>
their burgonets, their collars, their cuirasses, and their backs, without either pouldrons, vambraces, gaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, or tasses.</p>
            <p>Their Horsemen also, and themselues seruing on horsebacke with Launces, or any other weapon, they thinke verie well armed with some kind of head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peece, a collar, a deformed high &amp; long bellied breast, and a backe at the proofe; but as for pouldrons, vam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, gauntlets, tasses, cuisses, and greues, they hold all for superfluous. The imitating of which their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soldierlike and fond arming, cost that noble &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Gentleman Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> his life, by not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his cuisses, who in the opinion of diuers Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that sawe him hurt with a Mosquet shot, if he had that day worne his cuisses, the bullet had not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his thigh bone, by reason that the chiefe force of the bullet (before the blowe) was in a manner past. Besides that, it is a great encouragement to al forraine Nations their Enemies that are better armed, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with them and their soldiers that they see so ill armed. And as their ill arming is an encouraging to the Enemie, so it is vnto them a discouragement, and a great disaduantage. For in case anie horseman or footman piquer so ill armed, should bee wounded on the thigh, or chieflie on the arme or hand, either with Launce, Pique, Sword, or any other weapon, his figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for that day were marred; besides that, by such wounds receiued, he is put in hazard either to bee slaine or taken. And to the same effect it hath been a <hi>maxime</hi> in all ages amongst all great Capraines, and skilfull soldiers, that the well arming of horsmen and footmen is a great encouragement vnto them to fight

            <p>And as they doo mistake the conuenient arming of horsemen and footmen, so they also mistake the weaponing of them: for whereas Swords of conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient length, forme and substance, haue been in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges esteemed by all warlike Nations, of al other sorts of weapons the last weapon of refuge both for horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and footmen, by reason that when al their other weapons in fight haue failed them, either by brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, losse, or otherwise, they then haue presentlie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken themselues to their short arming Swords and Daggers, as to the last weapons, of great effect &amp; exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for all Martiall actions: so our such men of warre (contrarie to the auncient order and vse Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie) doo now a daies preferre and allowe that armed men Piquers,<note place="margin">Their mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of swords</note> should rather weare Rapiers of a yard and a quarter long the blades, or more, than strong short arming Swords; little considering (or not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing) that a squadro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of armed men in the field be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing readie to encounter with another squadron, their Enemies, ought to streighten and close themselues by frunt and flanckes, and that after they haue giuen their first thrush with their Piques, and being come to ioyne with their enemies frunt to frunt, and face to face (and therefore the vse &amp; execution of the piques of the formost rancks being past) they must present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie betake themselues to the vse of their Swords and Daggers; which they cannot with any celeritie draw,

In the which they shewe that they doo verie little consider or knowe, that when two squadrons doo encounter, and that the first thrush of piques being past, they doo presentlie come to ioyne with short weapons, as with Swords, Battleaxes, and daggers, and that then, weapons that are with long poynts, long staues, and short edges doo worke no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, by reason that the rancks being so close, and nere by frunt and flankes in their distances, and the presse on both sides so great, as in such actions it is, they can haue no roume, to stand thrusting, and foyning with long Halbards, nor Piques, as our such men of warre doo imagine: but then is the time that the ranckes of short Halbards, or Battleaxes of fiue foote and a halfe long, with strong short poynts, short staues, and long edges in the hands of lustie soldiers that doo followe the first ranckes of Piquers at the heeles, both with blowe at the head, and thrust at the face, doo with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issant and mightie hand, work wonderfull effect, and carrie all to the ground.

Now peraduenture some not skilful in matters Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie may happen to say, that such opinions in wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons mistaken is no great matter: howbeit they are much deceiued; for in matters Militarie there is no mistaking so small, that in true vnderstanding is not great, and chiefly the mistaking of weapons, with the which al effects &amp; executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of warre are performed.</p>

            <p>Now, some of our such men of warre that were of great offices and charge vnder the Earle of <hi>Leicester,</hi> that was Lieutenant Generall of the Queenes Armie at <hi>Tilburie</hi> this last sommer 1588. seeing the <hi>Essex</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of 4000. footmen reduced into great bands of 400.500. and 600. to an Ensigne, vnder the charge and gouernment of Knights and Esquires of great worship, discretion, and desire to doo seruice to their Prince &amp; Countrie, they perswaded him with great vehemencie, that it was verie meete and conuenient that all that whole regiment should bee reduced into bands of 150. soldiers to an Ensigne,<note place="margin">Their mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of small bands to bee better than great.</note> or into 200. at the most, and therewithall that all those small bands should bee committed to the charge of our trained Low Countrie Captaines (as they call them) of the which there were a great number attending, some of them more hungrie after charge, spoyle and gaine, than skilfull to do anie great seruice, or to win repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or the loue of their soldiers. And the chiefest reasons that they did alleage for reducing them into such small bands, were, that the Enemie by seeing so great numbers of Ensignes in the field, would iudge the Armie to bee verie huge, and great in numbers of men, and therefore redoubt them the more; besides that, by the imployment of such a number of trained
<pb facs="tcp:18222:25"/>
Captaines, the regiment, and so consequentlie all the whole Armie assembled and reduced into such small bands, should bee the more full of men of seruice and skill: which their reasons may seeme pretie to such as knowe verie little of matters Militarie, and that do not fall into the reckoning of their second meanings, which I omit. Howbeit, how vnsoldierlike perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and opinions these were, how vnprofitable for the Prince, and vnfit and vnreadie for seruices in the field, I will (by the helpe of almightie God) make eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
            <p>When the great Princes of <hi>Germanie,</hi> vppon anie occasion or iniurie offered, are disposed to make warre one against another, or vpon an imperiall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie assembled to inuade, or resist the <hi>Turke,</hi> being bound (as they are) by their tenures Militarie to the Empire, some to finde horsemen, and others to finde footmen at their owne charges, they then vpon such occasions haue alwaies vsed, and do still vse, to forme their regiments of footmen into great bands of 500. to an Ensigne, and that they vse especiallie for two causes, the one thereby in their regiments, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentlie in their whole Armies to saue the pay of a great sort of Captaines,<note place="margin">The reasons and causes wherefore the Princes of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie doo vse great bands of 500. in their seruices of the Empire.</note> Lieutenants of bands, Ensign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers, and other Officers, which would bee greatlie encreased, and so amount to a farre greater charge and pay, in case they should compose smaller bands of 300 to an Ensigne, or vnder that number: the other cause that doth mooue them to forme their bands so great, is, that their <hi>milicia</hi> consisting of Harquebuziers, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers, and some Halbarders, with a fewe slath swords for the gard of their Ensignes, that those sorts of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18222:25"/>
by reason of the greatnes of the bands being in great compertiments and diuisions, may be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie and easilie drawne out and separated, and with a great deale more celeritie incorporated with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great compertiments of the like weapons of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great bands, to forme their squadrons with sleeues, wings, troupes, or forlorne hopes (according to the order and direction of the Coronells, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants Maiors) than if their bands were smaller either of 300. or vnder that number, whereby the comperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of weapons should be also the smaller, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in number the greater, and so consequently would require a longer time, not onlie to drawe out, but also to incorporate compertiments with compertiments for the forming of battailes with sleeues, wings, and forlorne hopes, as aforesaid. Besides that, such great bands, both by reason and experience are as readie, or rather more readie to bee employed either in whole companies vnder their Captaines and Lieutenants, or diuided into parts and Corporolates vnder their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals and Sergeants for watches, bodies of watches, Centinells, and all other ordinarie, and extraordinarie employments &amp; actions Militarie in Camp, Towne, or Field, than anie small bands are. Now, peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture some such as doo not vnderstand this order Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie of the Princes of <hi>Germanie</hi> aboue mentioned, will say, that all the Regiments of footmen <hi>Almanes,</hi> that either the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> or the <hi>French</hi> King haue hired and imployed anie waies in their warres, haue been but of 300. to an Ensigne, which is verie true; howbeit the cause thereof hath been, that when such Princes haue occasion to employ anie Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
<pb facs="tcp:18222:26"/>
regiments of <hi>Almanes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The cause wherefore the mercinarie Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells doo vse small bands of 300. in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of forrain Princes.</note> they do send their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missaries into <hi>Germanie,</hi> to hire so manie Coronells as they will haue Regiments, in case that they had none before in their ordinarie stipends and pay; and those Coronells doo make choise of Captaines for the leauie of their Regiments, at their owne pleasures, and therefore will accept of no Captaines, but of such as will compound with them and buy their Captain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, so as the more bands the more Captaines, and the more Captaines the more compositions and profite; which peraduenture was the cause that moued some chiefe officer, or officers vnder the Earle (as imitators of the <hi>Almane</hi> Mercenaries) to perswade him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all the great and honorable bands aforesaid, into little bands of 150. or 200. thereby to haue the more compositions and sommes of monie at our Lowe Countrie Captains hands, some of the which would not let to giue largelie to obtaine Companies, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding after by fleecing and ransoming of their soldiers being men of wealth, to pay themselues againe with great interest, which two or three daies before the breaking vp of the Campe, they verie pretilie did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. Howbeit, it seemeth that such great Officers and perswaders, had little regarde to the profite of the Prince, nor yet to the reducing of the Armie with ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leritie and dexteritie into squadrons and battailes, and other formes Militarie as aforesaid, considering that those small bands of 150. or 200. soldiers to an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, did consist of fiue different sorts of weapons, <hi>viz.</hi> Piques, Battleaxes, Mosquets, Harquebuzes, and Long Bowes, and that therefore euerie one of them was to bee reduced into fiue diuers diuisions, which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18222:26"/>
besides the vncomely sight to see so many small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertiments in euerie such little band, it would haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a farre longer time vpon the dailie &amp; ordinarie dislodging of an Armie reduced into <hi>Vaward, Battle,</hi> and <hi>Rereward,</hi> to haue drawne out so great a number of compertiments out of such a number of little bands, than out of bands of 500. to haue drawne a few great compertiments, and to haue encorporated and reduced them into anie forme Militarie. Now, whereas our such men of warre perswaded with the Earle, that the Enemie would iudge the greatnes of the Armie by the greatnes of the number of Ensignes, and therfore redoubt the more, &amp; that by the number of such little bands vnder so manie trained Captains, the Armie should be so much the more full of men of seruice, it argueth the insufficiencie and lack of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of such perswaders. For there is no Enemie skilfull in the Arte Militarie, that will iudge of the greatnes or smalnes of an Armie in the field, by the great or small number of Ensignes or peeces of Taffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, but by the frunts and flancks of the squadrons mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and chieflie by good espialls, or by prisoners taken. And as for the dismissing and cassing of the Knights and Esquiers that were Captains of such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Companies, that such Lowe Countrie Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines might haue supplied their places, vpon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding of those great bands into hundreds and fifties, or into two hundreds, I thinke it had been a great deale more meete for the reasons before alledged, that all the whole Armie (if it had been farre greater than it was) for the defence of the realme, should haue been reduced into great bands of fiue hundreds, vnder the
<pb facs="tcp:18222:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
charge of Knights and Esquiers, well chosen, and of great worship in their Countries, and that a great part of our such Lowe Countrie Captaines (<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> neuer knewe what discipline Militarie ment, nor yet what it is to command and gouerne, as it may well appeare by their infinite disorders in the Lowe Countries) should haue been distributed, and placed throughout those great bands as Sergeants, or Ensigne bearers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such discreet and worshipfull Gentlemen, to the intent that they might first learne to obey, before they should haue authoritie to commaund and gouerne the Yeomanrie of England.</p>
            <p>Now, whereas I haue heard of some of our aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and most sufficient Captaines, that our English <hi>milicia</hi> of footmen manie yeares past, did consist of bands but of 100. to an Ensigne; and that I haue like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise heard by diuers old and notable Captaines <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> that the <hi>Italian milicia</hi> also before the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> as also in the beginning of his time, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of bands of footmen but of 100. to an Ensigne, and that those bands of hundreds did consist euerie one of them but of one sort of weapon, as amongst the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> of a hundred Piques, (sauing that of that number there were a verie fewe partisans for the garding of their Ensignes) and of a hundred Harquebuziers: so our bands of hundreds did also consist of 100. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, &amp; of 100. Battleaxes, without composing them of diuers sorts of weapons, according to the moderne vse, which certainlie (in mine opinion, sauing onelie for the encrease of the charges of the Prince) was a verie conuenient order, considering that euerie sort of weapon being reduced into bands by themselues,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18222:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
without compertiments of diuers sorts of weapons in anie one band (vnles it had been of Battleaxes with Piques, because those two sorts of weapons are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the bodie of a squadro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) would haue wrought that the Sergeants Maiors, and other Officers of the field, might with great facilitie and celeritie haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced anie meane Armie into manie formes of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes both to march and fight, as also that they might haue been lodged in their quarters with great order and readines in a Campe, or Campes formed.</p>
            <p>Now, whereas our such men of warre did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade with the Earle for the reducing of the great bands of footmen into small companies of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fiftie (as is before declared:) so did they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise perswade with him to reduce all those small bands into little Regiments of one thousand vnder e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie Coronell;<note place="margin">Their mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of small Regiments to be better than great.</note> by which their perswasions they did verie manifestlie shewe that they vnderstood verie little, for what causes and reasons Regiments were first instituted, and since amongst manie Nations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued: howbeit, I doo perswade my selfe by that which I haue heard, partlie from their own speaches, partlie also from others of verie great credite, that in all their proceedings in matters of warre, they do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther followe the newe fashions of the disordered warres of <hi>France,</hi> and the Lowe Countries vnder the States, than anie reason and experience Militarie. For in troth, bands of horsemen and footmen, of which Armies doo consist, were at the first reduced into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments for diuers causes, and chieflie for fiue.</p>
            <p>The first, that they might be the better &amp; the more orderlie gouerned, and the more readie vpon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
<pb facs="tcp:18222:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be commaunded and imployed.</p>
            <p>The second, that they might be the better, and the more conuenientlie lodged in their quarters.</p>
            <p>The third, that they might bee the more orderlie and readilie placed in their watches, bodies of wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Centinells.</p>
            <p>The fourth, that they might for the defence of their Camp be the more readilie reduced into diuers puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant bodies of squadron by themselues, with sleeues and wings in the places of assemblie.</p>
            <p>And the fift, that vpon the dislodging of an Armie reduced into <hi>Vaward, Battle,</hi> and <hi>Rereward,</hi> diuers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments might the more orderlie and readilie incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate, and reduce themselues into three mightie bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, or more, according to the order and direction of the Lieutenant generall, or high Marshall of the field, or els of the Sergeant Maior <hi>Maior,</hi> by some called the Sergeant Maior generall.</p>
            <p>Now, the Launce-knights <hi>Almanes</hi> (which is the Nation of Christendome most skilfull of all others that euer I sawe, to performe these actions and effects before declared, with manie other matters Militarie both for the Campe &amp; field) to the intent to performe al such actions with the more celeritie and dexteritie, haue vsed of great antiquitie to forme all their Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of footmen of tenne Ensignes to euerie Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and so they did vse manie yeares past, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one of their Regiments did consist of fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand soldiers, at which time their bands did consist of fiue hundred to euerie Ensigne.

            <p>Now, if our such perswaders before mentioned were of so great consideration and iudgement, as they would seeme to be, they would verie well know that great Regiments of fiue, foure, or three thousands that doo consist of great bands of fiue, foure, or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, are a great deale more readie to be commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and gouerned, and therewithall to performe all actions Militarie, with a great deale more celeritie and dexteritie, than if they were reduced into little Regiments of thousands, &amp; small bands of hundreds and fifties. And that may be with great facilitie consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the like comparisons and reasons, which I haue before alleaged, that great bands of fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, and so consequentlie by the like reasons of foure or three hundreds are more readie to bee redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into forme, and imployed in all important serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with more celeritie &amp; dexteritie, than small bands of hundreds and fifties, or two hundreds are: Besides all which, by forming of such small Regiments of one thousand, the Prince doth consume a farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pay, than by forming of great Regiments of fiue, foure, or three thousand, by reason of the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of officers, which are encreased by such great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of little Regiments. And for further proofe and confirmation of euerie forementioned particularitie, I were able to alleadge manie more reasons, if it were
<pb facs="tcp:18222:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not to auoide prolixitie. Howbeit, peraduenture it may now be said vnto me, that the <hi>Tercios</hi> of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> that haue serued manie yeares in the Lowe Countries, doo consist some of them but of twelue hundred, and others of fifteene hundred, and some of more, and others of fewer, which I confesse to bee true, but that hath proceeded of this, that they are not entire <hi>Tercios,</hi> nor neuer were since they were drawne out of such principalities where they before were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident, as for example: when the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> was to come out of <hi>Italie</hi> with his Armie, to suppresse the intestine tumults of the Lowe Countries, the whole <hi>Tercios</hi> of <hi>Sicilie, Naples, Sarden<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Caliuers and Mosquets for seruices in the field they extoll and magnifie,<note place="margin">Their vaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of the effect of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuers &amp; Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets.</note> and chieflie Mosquets, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading as much as they can all Magistrates, and men of accompt, that battailes and victories in these our daies are to bee obtained chieflie by the force and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of those weapons; and that the forraine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie seeking to inuade vs in anie Hauen with a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie and Armie royall, should with foure or fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Mosquettiers and some Caliuerers, bee repulsed

And that certen Sconces by them deuised without anie Bulwarks, Flanckers, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uesses, Mounts, Platformes, wet or drie Ditches in forme, with Counterscarps, or any other good forme of fortification, but onelie raised and formed with earth, turfe, trench, and certen poynts, angles, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, should bee able to hold out the Enemie landed some three or foure daies, vntill the force of three or foure shires were assembled.

To the weapon of Caliuers before mentioned, they also giue exceeding commendation for skirmishes and encounters in the field, saying that they may skirmish with that weapon 10. or 12 scores of, to the great ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and hurt of the Enemie.

            <p>Now, for answere to some of these vnsoldierlike opinions, I say, that if anie such as doo hold that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull opinion of the effects of Mosquettiers (how good soldiers soeuer they thinke themselues) were at anie Hauen in England with fiue or sixe thousand of

               </gap> of horsemen and foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of other weapons to backe them, I thinke they would worke verie small effect against the Enemie landing, although they had ensconsed themselues (as they terme it) in such Sconses as they and their Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners formed this last sommer 1588. vppon the Sea coasts of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> and in <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Kent,</hi> on both sides of the riuer of <hi>Thames.</hi> For if they should see a Nauie with an Armie of thirtie or fortie thousand men (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides seamen, and such as should be left for the gard of the shipps) vnder some notable and sufficient General enter into anie capable Hauen of England, with wind and weather fit for their purpose, with intention to inuade (which God forbid) they should finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in their opinions wonderfullie deceiued. For this they are to knowe, that such a Generall being with his whole Nauie entred into such a Hauen, doth take order before, that proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be made through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all his shipps and vessells, that no man vpon paine of death being landed, shall straggle or stray abroad, but all soldiers to reduce themselues with all celeritie vnder their Ensignes; which done, a Cannon is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged out of the Generalls ship, which is a warning for all Captaines, Officers and Soldiers to arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and to take their weapons. And vppon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cannon discharged, the Captaines, and Ensign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers with their Ensignes in their hands, with such co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient numbers of Mosquettiers, Harquebuziers, Piquers, and Halbarders, as the long boates, <hi>Shallops, Fregatts, Azabres,</hi> and other such vessells of oares ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing readie at the shipps sides are capable of, doo enter
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18222:30"/>
into them, euerie long boate hauing two Bases afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship readie charged, and gunners readie to discharge them. Then vpon the third Cannon discharged, all the long boates and vessells of oares for the landing of men, do rowe with all furie towards the land with a wonderfull terrible noise of trompets &amp; drommes. Now, if our such men of warre with their Mosquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers would giue their volees of Mosquet shot vppon these shipboates full of men, with intent to destroye great numbers of them being so thicke and so manie, they shall finde that discharging their Mosquet shot from higher grounds downwards into the sea, which by the <hi>Italians</hi> are called <hi>Botti di ficco,</hi> accompted of all other dischargings most vncertaine, as also by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermuch distance, and continuall motion of the ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boates rowing, and with the swelling of the salt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (how calme soeuer it bee) made more vncertaine, they shall shoote verie vncertainlie, &amp; therefore work verie little or no effect to the destroying of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or anie waies to keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from landing. Besides that, the Enemies out of such their shipps as are neerest vnto them, will discharge Cannon, Culuerin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker shot to the terrifying of them; so as their ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boates in despight of their Mosquets comming to land, and they presentlie sending certen troupes of Harquebuziers, with some Halbarders vnder their conductors, to skirmish and entertaine the Mosquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, whilest the Piquers and other weapons doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce themselues into forme vnder their Ensignes, they shall finde in the space of three or foure houres aboue twelue or fifteene thousand men landed; who then taking some ground of aduantage to fortifie, and
<pb facs="tcp:18222:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to place their victuall, powder, and all sorts of muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they with all speede possible do proceed to the landing of their Artillerie and Munitions, with all the rest of their Armie both of horsemen and footmen. Which being by them performed, they presentlie make their approach vpon their indented Sconce, not with anie crooked or crosse trenches, gabions, nor mounts, according to the order of approaching, and battering of places in forme fortified, but with other inuentions gardable against Mosquet shot (that perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture our such men of warre are ignorant of) as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so with Mosquet and Harquebuze shot, with piques, and halfe piques, swords and targets, and with ladders if it be needful, in such terrible sort, as that great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our vnskilfull Mosquettiers and Caliuerers within their Sconce, would be found scarse able to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the first charge and assault, seeing so puissant an Enemie landed. And I doubt rather when they should see with what terrour the Enemies doo approach the land, and the small annoyance that they with their Mosquet shot should worke vppon them, that they would scarse abide the landing of the first boates full of soldiers, without abandoning both Sconce and shore to the Enemie.</p>
            <p>And whereas our such men of warre the last som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer had manie deuises in their heads of ensconcing of Sconces for the defence of diuers Hauens;<note place="margin">A vaine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sconsing of Sconces in the drie grounds of England.</note> if they were men of vnderstanding in fortification (as they would seeme to be) they might verie well know that there is a great difference betwixt the scituations and natures of the drie grounds of <hi>England,</hi> and those of <hi>Holland, Frizeland,</hi> and other such low and flat Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18222:31"/>
full of riuers, great ditches, marishes, and wet grounds, where they may ensconce themselues with small cost within little Ilands, or vpon poynts &amp; mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of riuers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or elswhere, by the opening of sluces and dykes, or cutting of banckes and trenches, they may enuiron themselues with water on euerie side. The best sort of which Sconces being more strong by nature and scituation, than by anie arte or forme of fortification, may in those parts resist and hold out a weake or an vnskilfull Enemie some long while: but such their ensconcings in the drie grounds vpon the Hauens of <hi>England,</hi> are to small purpose to hold out a puissant Enemie, if he should land, or anie waies to keepe him from landing. And therfore I conclude, that such fortifications in <hi>England</hi> are verie skornes and mockeries, and would be rather profitable for the Enemie landed, than anie waies to annoy or to resist the Enemie. Besides all which before alleaged, it is further to bee noted, that a puissant and mightie Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie that in the time of sommer intendeth the inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of forraine dominions by sea, to the intent to giue battaile and subdue, doth not alwaies binde himselfe to land his Armie in a Hauen, but sometimes vpon an open coast and shoare, if the sea (without hidden rockes and flatts) be deepe, and the wind and weather faire, hauing commoditie by the depth of the sea to approach his Nauie, and to cast ancker in open roade, neere vnto a commodious shoare &amp; countrie to land and march vpon. So as it behoueth all such Princes, as doubt the inuasion of their dominions by sea, not onlie to expect and prouide for the resisting of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie in their Ports and Hauens, but also to haue as

And this I haue heard of diuers auncient Captaines both <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who did rather allowe of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of those great Captaines, than of the Duke of <hi>Albas</hi> so great encreasing of that weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

to a farre greater number (as I haue heard) than the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> euer had. Howbeit, I knowe that the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> had more cause to vse Mosquettiers in seruices of the field vpon diuers occasions, than anie of his successors gouernours of those Prouinces euer had, by reason of the often inuasions of Counte <hi>Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and others; and therefore he being (as he was) a great Captaine, and of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and skill in all discipline and science Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, did vse to conferre with his Coronells, and <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stros de Campo,</hi> and Sergeants Maiors of the vse of all weapons in their due times and places, and of their distances in euerie sort, as of verie important matters belonging to the Arte Militarie; in such wise as there was not anie Captaine, <hi>Alferez,</hi> Sergeant of band, or <hi>Cabo de Esquadra,</hi> that did not knowe (both by instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and practise) the particular operations and effects of all weapons, and chieflie of the Mosquet and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuze, in which two weapons the <hi>Spaniards</hi> haue been accompted of manie yeares to bee most perfect and skilfull, in such sort as there were not anie Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines or Leaders in his <hi>Milicia</hi> so ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that would permit their Mosquettiers to giue anie volees from their restes, either at horsemen or footmen in march, or anie motion, aboue 8. or 10. scores at the farthest, because they knewe (both by instruction and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience) that with that weapon (being for diuers causes verie vncertaine) they should in discharging farther of, haue wrought verie small or none effect to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance of their Enemies.

            <p>And therefore beginning with Harquebuzes, by many miscalled Caliuers: which Harquebuzes if they bee well ranforced, and the Cannons of them not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue a yard in length, and the bore &amp; bullets not too great, with stocks of good forme, I think them to be verie maniable weapons, for such soldiers as are well practised,<note place="margin">The proper times and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers.</note> &amp; do know how to vse them, &amp; do worke most effect in woods, and whereas vines or shrubs do grow, &amp; from behind old ruined walls, as also where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there be trenches, deepe waies, bancks, hills, rocks,
<pb facs="tcp:18222:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or hedges, or anie other couert, where they may lie close, and finde anie thing to serue them for rests to discharge their peeces from, and so vpon the sodaine giuing volee after volee are of great seruice, &amp; chiefly for ambushes, being faire weather ouer head. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the plaine fields two or three ranckes of them being placed almost close to the frunt of a squadron of piques, and likewise vpon the flanckes and backe of the same squadron, are of good effect to giue their volees at a squadron, or diuers squadrons of Launces charging the piques; and that they must performe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vpon their right knees fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder the piques, which must garde them against the charge of the Launces. But they must take heede that they doo not giue their volee at the horsemen till they come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in eight, tenne, or twelue <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and not eight, tenne, or twelue scores, as our such men of warre do fondly talke and teach; and in that sort they may worke ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good effect, if their peeces bee charged as they ought to be. If two squadrons of Piquers also should come to ioyne and charge the one the other, certeine nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of Harquebuziers being reduced into sleeues. wings, and troupes, vpon the flanckes and corners of a squadron, are of good effect, giuing their volees not too farre off, so long as there are no horsemen in the field to breake them.</p>
            <p>Harquebuziers also being reduced into wings, and little squares and troupes in the field, aduanced and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired with some societies, or <hi>Cameradas</hi> of loose shot are of good effect for skirmishes against the like wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and against Mosquettiers, so that they be backed with Piques, Halbards, or Battleaxes, and that in that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18222:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
kind of action, they doo not discharge their peeces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue thirtie, fortie, or fiftie yards, or three score at the most, and that with great order and discretion. And these are the chiefe effects of that kind of weapon.</p>
            <p>Now, as for Mosquettiers with their long ranfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and heauie peeces of great munition and bullet, they doo worke verie good effect in the like places and seasons, sauing that they are not to be imployed as loose shot in skirmishes: howbeit, the verie proper and apt places for Mosquettiers in the field, is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into sleeues, wings, broad squares or troupes, to flancke a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

And to vse their peeces without restes (as some of our such men of warre doo permit them, when they come newe to the field lustie and strong) is contrarie to the vse of that weapon, because they performe no effect against the Enemie, by reason they are not able (how strong soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they bee) to beare their Mosquets with their left armes at anie point and blancke, being in continuall
<pb facs="tcp:18222:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
motions; besides that, it is the next way to make them lame in their armes, shoulders, and backes. Two ranckes of Mosquettiers also beeing reduced before the frunt of a squadron of piques, kneeling vppon their knees, and encouered with piques, and vsing their Mosquets as skilfull soldiers should doo, maie worke the like effect, or better against a squadron of Launces charging, than three ranckes of Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers can doo. But they must take heed that they giue not their volee of shot at the Launces anie greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance off, than fifteene or twentie yards, because they may shoote the more certeinlie, and not faile to light either vpon the horses or men. And now hauing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the chiefe effects of both those sorts of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, I will proceed to the imperfections and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon accidents of them both, as also of the better sort of such soldiers as do handle and vse those weapons, of what Nation soeuer they be.</p>

The Harquebuze &amp; Mosquet also being discharged but seuen or eight shootes in hast, doo growe hote, and then doo worke small effect, but daunger to the soldiers that doo oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie them.</p>
            <p>If the powder also with the which they are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged bee not well corned, and with sufficient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of saltpeter, and kept verie drie, it furreth the peeces, and carrieth the bullets poynt and blanke but a little way, and manie times goe not off at all.

The Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buziers and Mosquettiers also, charging their peeces in anie actions of the field, if in mouing or trauersing their grounds, they do not looke well to the keeping vp of the mouthes of their peeces, but that by anie chaunce the ends of them doo goe anie thing down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the bullets that are smaller by <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

Besides all which defaults &amp; defects, neither the Harquebuze nor the Mosquet in wet weather in the field doo worke anie effect. All which so manie imperfections of Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers (as are before declared, with manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18222:37"/>
that I omit) are the causes that vpon manie great skirmishes and encounters that haue been verie hot, and continued manie houres, with newe supplies on euerie side, it hath often happened, that in discharging on both sides manie thousands of bullets within three, foure, or fiue scores, and neerer, there hath not been on both sides slaine and hurt with bullets thirtie men,<note place="margin">Verie few hurt in skirmishes with Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buze shot in the field.</note> which greatlie argueth the insufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of those kinds of weapons for battailes and great encounters. So as it is to bee noted, that such of our men of warre as doo giue so singular commendations and praises to the effects of Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to those weapons, and doo not knowe all their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections and failings before declared, with manie more, doo shewe that they haue had verie little expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of those weapons in the field, nor yet that they themselues doo knowe how to handle and vse them, and therefore doo talke like nouices they wot not what.<note place="margin">Another great insufficiencie of Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers and Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quettiers in the field.</note> Moreouer, concerning the insufficiencie of those weapons of fire, it is farther to bee noted, that if there be anie number of horsemen either Launces or Stradiotts in the field, where Mosquettiers or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers are in action, and that they haue no horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men on their side to answere them, that it doth then behoue the shot with al celeritie to reduce themselues vnder the gard of their squadrons of piques, or if the number of them bee so great that the squadrons of piques cannot encouer them, the ouerplus must retire themselues to some such grounds of aduantages, as the horsemen may not be able to come to charge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for in case they should abide in the plaine field, not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered with piques, nor garded with anie ground

            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:18222:38"/>And now hauing before in this discourse declared all the greatest and most perfect effects of Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers and Mosquettiers for seruices in the field, and but a part of the imperfections of them, and their weapons of fire; because there are many more, which for breuities sake I haue omitted, and that I haue last of all declared that the imperfections of the Bowe do consist onelie in the breaking of the Bowe and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string; because that Archers, if they bee well chosen, and sound of limbes, their weapons doo not permit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie such accidentall imperfections and failings in them, as the forenamed weapons of fire doo in the soldiers that doo handle and vse them; which hath alreadie appeared, and shall after in this discourse bee made more manifest. I will now therefore proceed to the consideration and examining of three most important things,<note place="margin">Archers doo farre exceede and excell all Mosquettiers and Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buziers in three most principall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</note> in the which al effects of Mosquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, Harquebuziers and Archers, and their weapons do consist; and that is, whether Mosquettiers or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers with their weapons of fire, or Archers with their Bowes and sheafes of arrowes, vpon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions in the field, bee most readie with all dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and celeritie to execute the effects of their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, by discharging and giuing volees at their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. The second is, whether the Archers with their weapons, or the other soldiers with their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of fire, doo faile least to shoote, discharge, and giue their volees. And the third is, whether by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and common experience the bullets of weapons of fire in the field, or the arrowes of Archers doo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noye the Enemies most, bee they horsemen or foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18222:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>To the first I think, that there is no man of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the aforenamed weapons, that will denie, but that Archers are able to discharge foure or fiue arrowes apeece, before the Harquebuziers shall bee readie to discharge one bullet; I meane the Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buziers beginning to charge when the Archers doo begin to take their arrowes to shoote. The reason is this, because good Harquebuziers are first to charge their peeces with powder by one of three waies: the first (which is best) is out of the mouthes and charges of their flaskes: the second is by certeine charges fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with powder, which Harquebuziers doo weare, or carrie diuers waies: and the third is by cartages, with the which they doo charge their peeces both with powder and bullet all at one time, and yet by which of all these waies soeuer, or anie other they do charge them, they must (if they bee good Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers) vse with their scouring sticks to thrust a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of paper or felt, or something els both before, but chieflie after their bullets, to keepe them close to the powder; to the intent that their bullets vpon no acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents may fall out, or at least lie loose vnrestrained from the powder, as also that their peeces may carrie the further poynt and blancke, and their bullets giue the greater blowes; which done, they must presentlie put touchpowder into their pans, and their matches into their cocks or serpentines; al which to performe requireth a good time. Whereas the Archers in the field continuallie hauing their Bowes bent, haue no more to doo but to drawe their arrowes out of their cases and sheafes, to nocke them in their Bowes, to drawe them to the heads and shoote; all which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18222:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
almost in an instant. Now to the second; Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers haue no accidents nor impediments to hinder them from the performance and execution of their dischargings and volees, whereby they should anie waies faile to discharge the same, vnles their Bowes or bowstrings should breake: whereas Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers haue not onlie the same let, in case their peeces by ouercharging, or ouerheating, or crackes, or rifts, doo breake, but also if that through the negligence of the Harquebuziers, the powder with the which they charge their peeces, by anie accident haue receiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie wet, or moysture, or that through the lacke of the closenes of their flaskes, the ayre of some moyst wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath penetrated and entered into the flaskes, and caused the powder to giue and danke, by meanes whereof the Harquebuziers giuing fire with their matches <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> serpentines to the touchpowder, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their peeces doo not discharge, or sometimes lieth sissing in the touchhole or peece, vntill the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers haue lost their poynt and blanke, and then peraduenture in vaine doo goe off. The touchpowder in the touch-boxes also, if either by the negligence of the Harquebuziers (as aforesaid) or by the fault of the touch-boxes, through the moystnes of the weather, the powder hath giuen, and become dancke, then of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the powder will take no fire; whereby the Harquebuziers doo not onlie faile of their discharge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but also become vnprofitable, till they haue dried or chaunged the same. Harquebuziers and Mosquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers also in powring touchpowder into their pannes, the winde (if it bee great) will blowe and disperse the same, in such sort, that they shall verie often faile to
<pb facs="tcp:18222:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
discharge their peeces; and so likewise if Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers in putting their matches into their serpentines do faile to set them of a conuenient length, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may strike iust in the powder and pannes, but that they doo set the same too long, whereby the matches, if they be anie thing too lythe, do hang downeward, and with the comming downe and stroke of the cockes they fall double and short of the pannes and powder; or if the same matches by anie accident haue receiued outwardlie anie wett or moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, then the coales doo burne inward, leauing a beard outward, so as thereby although the endes thereof doo light in the middest of the pannes and powder, yet the same doo giue no fire to the towch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder. By all which aforesaid meanes and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes, with diuers others both Mosquettiers and Harquebuziers, do faile to discharge their peeces: of all which imperfections and other accidentes, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers with their Bowes are voyde. So as by all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and experience, it is most manifest that Archers are foure tymes more readie to giue their volees of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, than Harquebuziers, or Mosquettiers their volees of bulletts. Besides all which vnreadynesses, and failings before mentioned, if in the tyme of anie battle, great encountre, or skirmish, the weather doth happen to raine, haile, or snow, the aforena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med weapons of fire can worke no effect, because the same doth not onelie wett the powder in their pannes and touch holes, but also doth wet the match, put out, or at least dampe the fire, and doth marre the powder in their flaskes and towchboxes; vnlesse the souldiours haue very good prouision, and besides;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18222:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be wonderfull carefull with their saltenbergs or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dillions to encouer and preserue the same. Whereas contrariwise, neither haile, raine, nor snowe, can let or hinder the Archers from shooting, and working great effects with their arrowes. All which argueth &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a singular aduantage and excellencie of Archers and their weapons, aboue al Harquebuziers and Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quettiers with their weapons of fire. Now, peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture some not skilled in the perfections and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers, will say that they haue seene the soldiers of those weapons of fire, charge and discharge with a great deale more ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leritie than I haue before mentioned; whereunto I answer, that although it be verie commendable for all Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers to knowe how to charge and discharge apace, with all other particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties belonging to weapons of fire, yet such Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers or Mosquettiers as do vse to charge &amp; discharge so fast, are the worst of all others. For by often expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, such soldiers for hast do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly charge their peeces with vncertaine charges of powder, &amp; do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vse with their scouring sticks to thrust paper nor anie thing els betwixt their powder &amp; bullets, nor yet after their bullets to restraine &amp; keepe close the same, whereby their dischargings against the enemie might be the more effectuall: besides that, in their discharge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, they take no kind of sight at poinct &amp; blank, nor yet at the ends of their peeces, but doo discharge at a venture; wherby it commeth to passe, that such quick and hastie Harquebuziers, doo worke no other effect but spend powder, match &amp; shot, and heate their pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces oftentimes to their owne mischiefes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (in troth) are more meete to scarre Crowes in a

corne field (vnles they reforme themselues) than with anie weapons of fire to be employed against the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</p>
            <p>And now to the third, and last; which is, whether by reason and commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> experience, the bullets of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of fire in the field, or the arrowes of Archers doo annoye the Enemies most, be they horsemen or foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. I thinke it superfluous againe to reiterate, and set downe the different aduauntages and chiefe effects of Harquebuziers, Mosquettiers, and Archers; because I haue alreadie made them so manifest, as also that the Reader hereafter shall see in manie parts of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course diuers reasons, &amp; manie notable examples and experiences, that Archers in the field doo farre exceed and excell all Mosquettiers and Harquebuziers in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying, wounding, and killing both horses and men. And therefore wil onlie in this place answere one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, which I haue diuers times heard alleaged in commendation of the effects of weapons of fire, and the dishabling of the effects of Archers, and that is; there are manie that haue reported that the blowes of the bullets of Mosquets and Harquebuziers, are no lesse than death to such as they light vpon; whereas contrariwise the blowes of arrowes doo but onelie gall, or lightlie wound: which in troth is greatlie mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken by all such as doo hold that opinion. For that by common experience it hath been seene in all skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes and great encounters, that for euerie one that hath been slaine dead in the field by the shot of Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer or Harquebuze, there haue been foure that haue not died by the hurts of such weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of fire, although some of them haue remained euer after maimed, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18222:41"/>
some not. Whereas by true experience, Archers with their arrowes doo not onlie greatlie wound, but also sometimes kill both horses and men, in such sort as they neuer depart out of the field aliue, as it shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after appeare by diuers auncient as also moderne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. Besides that, I, and diuers other Gentlemen of our Nation yet liuing, that were in <hi>France</hi> in King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the sixts time, and also diuers times since, haue manie times heard French Captaines and Gentlemen, attribute al the former victories of the English against themselues &amp; their ancestors the French, more to the effect of our Archers, than to anie extraordinarie va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancie of our Nation; and therewithall further report and say, that they did thinke that the English Archers did vse to poyson their arrowe heads;<note place="margin">A wrong opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the French Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and Gentlemen of our English Archers.</note> because that of great numbers of the French Nation that many times had been wounded or hurt with arrowes, verie fewe had escaped with their liues; by reason that their wounds did so impostume, that they could not be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. In which their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipts they did greatlie erre; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in troth those impostumations proceeded of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but of the verie rust of the arrowe heads that remained ranckling within their wounds; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the common experience of our auncient Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, (that we haue so often vanquished) not onlie the great, but also the small wounds of our arrowes haue been alwaies found to bee more daungerous and hard to be cured, than the fire of anie shot vnpoysoned.</p>
            <p>Besides all which, it is to bee noted, that horses in the field being wounded, or but lightlie hurt with arrowes, they through the great paine that vppon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie motion they doo feele in their flesh, vaines,
<pb facs="tcp:18222:42"/>
and sinewes by the shaking of the Arrowes with their barbed heads hanging in them, do presentlie fall a yerking, flinging and leaping as if they were mad, in such sort, as be it in squardron, or in troupe they do disorder one an other, and neuer leaue vntill they haue throwne, and cast their masters. Whereas contrariwise, horses that are in their vitall partes hurt with bulletts, or that the bones of their legges, shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or backs be broken, they do presently fall down, or otherwise, although they be strike<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cleane through, or that the bulletts do still remaine in them, they after the first shrinck at the entring of the bullett doo passe their <hi>Carrire,</hi> as though they had verie litle or no hurt: And this of the hurting of horses with bulletts, both I my selfe, and all others do know, that haue seene any actions performed in the field. And the other of the great disordering of horses with the hurts of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish arrowes I haue read in diuers histories, and also heard reported by diuers Gentlemen of our nation that haue seene the same. But now because I haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers times heard manie vaine obiections obiected by some of our Captaines of the Low Countries against Archers, to the disgracing, and dishabling of them, and their weapons in comparison of Mosquettiers and Harquebuziers and their weapons of fire: I will (with the helpe of almightie God) answere as manie of them as shall fall into my memorie; and therefore will begin with one of their litle fancies that they doo alledge against the Longbow, and so proceed to their greater, and greatest obiections.</p>
            <p>Among manie other their fancies they do alledge, that the Archers bowes, being by them vsed against

               </gap> employed and vsed in the open fields, by skilfull Conductours and Leaders; by reason of the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full failings and vncertainties of those and all other weapons of fire maniable: diuers of the particularities wherof: I haue before in this dicourse made manifest.</p>
            <p>Also they do further alledge,<note place="margin">Another vaine obiection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and vse militarie.</note> that vpon an inuasion of foraine dominions beyond the seas, the weapons, and furniture of Archers, as of Bowes, sheafes of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and bowstrings, can not be found and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded where Archerie is not vsed; whereas contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, all kinds of munition belonging to the weapons of fire, are easie to be found and prouided in all foraine dominions. Which is as much, as if they should say, that if an Armie of fiue and twentie, or thirtie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of our English nation vnder some sufficient Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall were sent to inuade <hi>France,</hi> and disembarking in <hi>Normandie,</hi> and winning <hi>Newhauen</hi> and <hi>Roan,</hi> should straight march to <hi>Paris:</hi> (which is no more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diuers Kings of <hi>England</hi> and their Generalls haue done) where after some encountres and skirmishes the Armie comming to lack powder and shott, they

should with facilitie for money prouide the same in the hart of the Enemies Countrie, where all the Townes in which that prouision is to bee had are fortified, which is a verie mockerie and dreame to bee thought on. But some of our such men of warre peraduenture will further alledge, that they might haue the same prouision by the way of conuoy, either from <hi>Newhauen</hi> or <hi>Roan,</hi> in case they were possessed of those Townes: whereunto it is to bee answered, that first the conuoy had need to bee verie strong; besides that, there is no man of anie consideration and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that doth verie well knowe, that Mosquets, Harquebuzes, powder, match and lead, are as heauie, and a great deale more heauie to bee carried, than Bowes, sheafes of arrowes and bowstrings are. Besides that, by such their ignorant obiections, they doo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlie shew that they haue not read, nor heard, or els for lacke of reason not beleeued, the proceedings of the notable Kings of <hi>England</hi> in their inuasions of <hi>France,</hi> and other Dominions; for if they had, they would not then doubt, but that a King of <hi>England,</hi> or his Lieutenant generall inuading forraine dominions, would vpon such an enterprise carrie all sorts of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, belonging to Archers, to serue them for many battailes and great encounters, as well as King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and <hi>Henrie</hi> the fift, and their Lieutenants ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall did, whose Armies did sometimes consist of nine, or ten thousand al Archers, and not aboue foure or fiue thousand armed men on horsebacke and on foote; which Princes, and their Lieutenants did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer omit (according to their <hi>milicia</hi>) to carrie great plentie of sheafes of Arrowes, Bowes, and all other

things requisite aswell for their Archers, as for their armed men,<note place="margin">By this obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer that they neuer sawe any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie royall march in the field.</note> and all other effects. Besides that, by that their simple and fond obiection, they do discouer that they haue very seldome or neuer seene an Armie roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all march in the field; for if they had, they then would verie well know, that there is no puissant Armie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med either to inuade or defend, that doth consist of a well ordered <hi>milicia,</hi> that doth not in the publique carriages of the Camp, ordinarylie carrie all kindes of munitions of weapons and armours offensiue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue, with all other munitions and necessaries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite for all purposes, for the publique employments and vse of Camp, Towne, and field.</p>
            <p>Now, whereas some of our aforesaid men of warre do further alledge, rather vpon fancie than vpon anie souldiourlyke reasons and experience, manie vaine and friuolous obiections, partlie against the Bowes (as aforesaid) but chieflie against the Archers that do vse them,<note place="margin">An obiection that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect against Archers.</note> how good soeuer they be, saying that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers when they haue lyen some long tyme in Camp in the field, will become so decayd in strength either by sicknes, or otherwise, that they will not be able to draw their Bowes, and worke that effect that Archers should do; whereas contrarywise, Mosquettiers and Harquebuziers will giue as great blowes with their bulletts out of their peeces being decayd in strength by long lying in Camp, or sickenes, as if they were whole.

            <p>Now, whereas our such men of warre do further dishable our Archers, saying, that they are to worke in a maner no effect neither against horsemen nor footemen, and that Archers are not able in the field to abide the terrour of the shot of Mosquettiers nor Harquebuziers, with manie other vaine and fond obiections, contrarie to all reason and experience: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenlie, it is not to be thought strange in them, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that as their ouerweening and presumption hath extended to shew their lacke of skill in manie other matters militarie before mentioned, that they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to haue most knowledge of, as namely in the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the conueniencie of diuers sortes of weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in their due times and places, with manie other verie important matters before mentioned; so in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our Archerie, it is not to be meruailed at, that they do so groselie erre in their fond opinions concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and alledged, against the excellent effects of that weapon, of the which they neuer had any experience, nor yet doo know how to order them; as it did verie euidentlie appeare to all men of iudgement, that saw their disorderlie placing of Archers in the battles they

shot, some were of nine and twentie in a rancke, other of fifteene in a rancke, and the smallest sleeues of eleuen in a rancke, which to all men of anie iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in matters Militarie, might bee a wonderfull scorne and mockerie. For in case that they should in that forme haue marched against the Enemie to haue giuen battaile, they themselues, by their fond and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull placing of the Archers, had taken away the whole effect of the volees of their arrowes. For it is to bee vnderstood, that when anie squadrons of Piquers doo approach, with intent to giue battaile and ioyne with other squadro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Piquers, or to receiue a charge of horsemen, they all vpright their piques, and doo close themselues by frunt and flanckes; then the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers are to giue their volees of arrowes at the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, approaching within eight, nine, tenne, or eleuen scores; and to performe the same, they ought not to haue anie other weapon placed before them, that may anie waies take away their sights to direct their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes towards the Enemies faces; but as they were placed, their sights had not onlie been taken away vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon such an action with the smoake of the shot, and with so manie ranckes and Ensignes closed in frunt and flanckes as were before them, but also the most of their volees of arrowes should haue flien through the taffaties of the Ensignes, and haue glaunced or lighted vpon the piques, either cleauing them, or bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them downe: besides that, (to the Archers great disadua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage) they should haue lost a great part of their ground, in giuing their volees of arrowes at their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, by reason of the distance, so manie ranckes of other weapons being before them: which most grosse

Now therfore, I will proceede to the ancient and orderlie forming &amp; vse of Archers that hath been vsed of great antiquitie by the notable Kings &amp; great Captaines of our English nation, who with the grace of God and merueilous effect of that most singular weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, haue atchieued so manie and so wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfull victories against both Pagans &amp; Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The auncient order of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Archers in the field.</note>The ancient order of reducing Archers into forme by our most skilfull and warlike ancestours, was into hearses, that is, broad in frunt, and narrow in flanck, as for example, if there were fiue and twenty, thirtie, fiue and thirtie, or more or fewer Archers in frunt, the flancks did consist but of seuen or eight rancks at the most: and the reason was this, that if they had placed anie more ranckes than seuen or eight, the hinder ranckes of Archers should haue lost a great deale of ground in the volees of their arrowes at their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, considering the conuenient and proportionate distances betwixt rancke and rancke, and ranckes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, as also that the sight of the hinder ranckes should haue bene taken away by so manie former ranckes from directing their volees of arrowes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes their Enemies faces. And whereas the small skil of our such me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of warre at <hi>Tilbury</hi> did (as it were) locke vp all the Archers, depriuing them of all vse and effect of their arrowes, our auncestours had so great experience of the wonderfull effect of that weapon,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18222:49"/>
that they placed their hearses of Archers either before the frunt of their armed footmen, or ells in wings vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the corners of their battailes, and sometymes both in frunt &amp; wings. And in this sort, they placed them in the face of the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at armes of <hi>France,</hi> &amp; all other braue horsmen of foraine Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, who in those dayes were far better armed tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in these our daies are. And yet with this good order, the wonderfull effect of our Archerie and arrowes was such, that flying in the ayre as thick as snowe with a terrible noyse, much like a tempestuous wind preceding a tempest, they did leaue no disarmed place of horse or man vnstriken and wounded, as may well appeare by manie battailes and victories;<note place="margin">Froissart, and the Frenche Chronicles.</note> and namelie by the battaile of <hi>Crecy,</hi> that kind <hi>Edward</hi> the third and Prince <hi>Edward</hi> his sonne wonne against king <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> where the said king <hi>Phillip</hi> had eight or ten thousand men at armes, and fifteen thousand <hi>Genoüeses</hi> Crossebowers (which were no wayes inferiour for seruices in the field to the Mosquettiers of this tyme) with so puissant an Armie also on horseback and on foote, verie well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and appointed of diuers Nations, that they were six at the least, for euerie one of the English, in which battaile were slaine eleuen Princes, and twelue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Knightes, besides thirtie thousand soldiers of all Nations.<note place="margin">The notable effect of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers at the battaile of Crecy.</note> And the wonderfull effect and terrour of the shot of arrowes was that day such, as neither the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch king with his men at armes, nor yet anie other of his great Captaines with their braue and well armed bandes of horsemen of diuers Nations, were able to enter and breake the Archers although they had no piques, stakes, banckes, nor trenches to gard the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but
<pb facs="tcp:18222:50"/>
being in the plaine and open fields, the Archers with their volees of arrowes did breake both horsmen and footmen, wounding or killing both horses and men; in such sort, that the French King himselfe being in great perrill,<note place="margin">The French Kings horse slaine vnder him with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes.</note> had his horse with the shot of arrowes slaine vnder him. By which example, and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that I will hereafter alledge, it may be appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to anie man that is possessed with the grace of God, and therefore of sound iudgement, that Archers being in great numbers, and reduced into the forme of hearses, or double hearses, as wings to a battaile, or squadron of piques (that they may the more conuenientlie giue their volees of arrowes) need not to bee garded with piques, nor yet stakes (as some talke of the battaile of <hi>Agincourt</hi>) but they themselues are most braue Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers; for as a squadron of Piquers well formed doo with their piques in their hands worke great effect in resisting a charge of Launces, or by encountring with another squadron of Piquers their Enemies: so the arrowes of braue Archers reduced into hearses, being deliuered out of their Bowes, doo become so terrible piques in the eyes and sight of the horses, as also in lighting vppon their shafrons, cranets, or steele pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells; or being not barbed, vpon their bare faces and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie disarmed part, that the horses with the huzzing, striking, and vnaccustomed noise, &amp; with the blowes and wounding of the arrowes doo flie backe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart the one the other, in such sort, as no force of spurres can make them to goe anie further against the Archers, but that they doo disorder and ouerthrowe one another. Besides that, against squadrons of armed footmen, the volees of arrowes flying in the ayre, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18222:50"/>
comming in their eyes and sights as thick as haile, and lighting vppon their faces, and euerie other disarmed part, doo so amaze them, that they come to loose their ranckes &amp; disorder themselues, before they can come to ioyne with another squadron of armed men their Enemies: and also with their terror doo wonderfully confuse and confound the greatest and brauest Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in their directions and commandements. As it may verie well appeare not onelie by the battaile of <hi>Crecy</hi> before mentioned, but also by the battaile of <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiers,</hi> where certeine yeares after the same Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> that was at the battaile of <hi>Crecy</hi> with King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> his father, hauing not in his whole Armie aboue eight thousand <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Gascoignes,</hi> (of the which there were sixe thousand Archers, and two thousand armed men) ouerthrewe King <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>France</hi> that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Prince, who at that battaile was accompanied with a great part of the Nobilitie of <hi>France,</hi> and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, as Dukes, Princes, Earles, &amp; other great Captaines, and had in his Armie aboue threescore thousand horsemen and footmen, of the which there were aboue ten thousand men at armes, and of horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of all sorts aboue thirtie thousand; where a little before the battaile,<note place="margin">Froissart, and the Chronicles of France.</note> the Prince with his notable Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines considering the small number that he had to make head and resist the French King with so huge an hoast, did take a ground of some strength and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage for the gard of the flanckes and backe of his small Armie, and placing a great part of his Archers in frunt, in the open place where the French horsmen and footmen were to enter and giue battle, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers with their wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful volees of arrowes (through

carriages into a conuenient forme, and placing conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient numbers of Archers in the two open places of the carriages before and behind, and forcing all other places betwixt carriages and carriages with Archers, where the French Launces might haue anie entrance; after a long fight and many charges by the men at armes of France and their shot giuen, the terrible effect of the volees of arrowes was such, that a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their horses were wounded or slaine,<note place="margin">A notable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Archers</note> and one of their chief Captaines, called Monsieur <hi>de Plessis</hi> lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp his sword to strike, was with an arrowe shot in at the arme hole through his gusset of maile, and there slaine, with many other men at armes, &amp; French Gentlemen of good accompt: In such sort, that the French, which did farre exceed the English in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, were that day repulsed and ouerthrowne by the excellencie of Archers.

horses also that are a little vsed to their fire, crackes and smoake, are not anie thing amazed nor afraid; but three or foure volees of arrowes lighting amongst a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie number of Mosquettiers or Harquebuziers (how old and braue soldiers soeuer they bee) will so amaze and terrifie them, that they shall faile to charge their peeces, to put touch powder into their pannes, &amp; their matches into their serpentines.

But the Earle at that time hauing no Archers on that side the sea, sent vnto him a supplie of sixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred braue Harquebuziers, with some armed men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, which he very thankfully receiued, but therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all signified vnto the Earle that he had rather haue had two hundred Archers,<note place="margin">The Admirall <hi>Chastillons</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</note> and that he would haue perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med greater seruice with that small nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Bowes, than with all those braue Harquebuziers.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18222:55"/>
verie hot, with many volees of Harquebuze shot, and newe supplies on euerie side, but at the length the French and Almans exceeding the English farre in multitude, forced them to retire with disorder euen to the verie gates of <hi>Newhauen</hi>; during which action, it happened that fourescore tall Archers (Hamshire men) did at that time land in the Hauen, who taking their Bowes and sheafes of arrowes, with their other furniture, did presently march without any tarriance through the towne into the field where the skirmish was; vpon whose comming, the English bands that a little before were forced by the often charges and great multitude of the shot of their Enemies, to retire euen to the verie town-ditches and gates, taking cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage a fresh, they and the Bowmen entered againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to skirmish with the Almans and French, where the fourescore Archers did behaue themselues so nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly against the enemies with their volees of arrowes, that with the braue and valiant charges which they and the rest of the English bands gaue vppon their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, but chieflie with the excellencie of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, they forced them not onelie to retire, but to turne their backes: in such sort, as putting a great number of them to the sword, they became masters of the field. Vpon which notable effect of those fewe Archers, as also vpon diuers others that the <hi>Reingraue</hi> had before time seene in seruing against the English, he shortlie after vppon the returne of a message that had been sent vnto him by the Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> (Sir <hi>Edward Horsey</hi> being the messenger) did most highly commend the notable effects, that he long before in diuers seruices had seene performed by the English

it may be answered with great reason and experience of diuers auncient Captaines both <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:18222:57"/>
of their owne training, did the last sommer most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderlie performe before my Lord <hi>Treasurer</hi> at <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie,</hi> where they discharged one in anothers necke, and hauing discharged their peeces, did run out of their troupes and stand still, and charge their peeces againe, and returning to giue newe volees, did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their peeces at their fellowes hammes, legges and backes, running together thicke and threefold so disorderlie, that it was a scorne to behold them: and this in the opinion of many Gentlemen, &amp; some old Captaines of good seruice and experience that were there present and beheld the same, who concluded the insufficiencie of our such men of warre of the Lowe Countries, by the lack of skill, imperfections, and insufficiencies of their trained souldiers, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the old prouerbe; <hi>In discipulis magister vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> like masters like men.

opinions and friuolous obiections of our such men of warre, as also to induce all such as are of any right consideration and iudgement, to acknowledge the sufficiencie &amp; excellencie of that weapon; &amp; that it is further euident by all forren Histories that haue made any mention of the differences of Bowes, vsed by many Nations, as also by such as haue trauailed in many parts of <hi>Europe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Our English Archers and Bowes are the most excellent of all other Nations.</note> 
               <hi>Affricke,</hi> or <hi>Asia,</hi> that our English Bowes, arrowes and Archers do exceed and excell al other Bowes vsed by all forren Nations not only in substance &amp; strength, but also in the length &amp; bignes of the arrowes: I will now further shewe the wonderfull effects that hath bene wrought by diuers sorts of forren Bowes, as <hi>Gothian, Parthian, Arabian, Turkish,</hi> and <hi>Tartarian,</hi> all which (as aforesaid) are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour vnto ours: that by such notable effects by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> performed, all such as are of sound iudgement, not caried with toyes, fancies and new fashions, may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well knowe, that God hath giuen such exceeding and excellent effects vnto that weapon, that of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers it hath euer bene, and yet may be iustly accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the chiefe weapon of battells and conquests.</p>
            <p>I thinke it is most manifest by all Histories, that haue written of puissant and conquering Nations, that in many and diuers ages vnder their great and notable Captaines, haue giuen themselues to enlarge their dominions, or with force to possesse the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of other forren people, that they haue erected some kinde of <hi>milicia</hi> and discipline militarie, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieue and performe the same. And as the best kinds of weapons in the handes of well disciplinated, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and exercised souldiers, is a principall part of a
<pb facs="tcp:18222:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>milicia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Al conquering Nations haue vsed the Bowe as their chiefe weapon.</note> to atchieue victories; so I thinke it is most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, that all those conquering Nations haue made chiefe choise of the Bowe, as of the most excellent kind of weapon for victories and conquests.</p>
            <p>And although they haue not vsed in their armies that weapon alone, but other weapons also incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with them, yet it is most manifest, that the greatest number of such mightie armies haue consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted more of Archers either on horsebacke or on foote, than of any other sorts of weapons, and by their excellent effects chiefly, haue beene atchieued most notable and wonderfull victories; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Were not diuers Emperors and great Captains Romains with puissant armies many times inuading the <hi>Parthians</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">All great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, next vnto God, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the force of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes.</note> sometimes ouerthrowne, and many times repulsed by them, and that chieflie by their Archers? Were not <hi>Crassus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> with a mighty armie which did consist of many legions of olde soldiers Romaines, ouerthrowne and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished in the plaine fields with the force of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> arrowes? And was not <hi>Valerian</hi> the Emperour ouerthrowne and taken prisoner, in a great battaile by the <hi>Persians,</hi> and that chiefly by the great effect of their arrowes? Besides all which it is most euident by diuers Histories, that neither the notable Consulls of the ancient Romanes, nor yet after them the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Romans with their conquering <hi>milicia</hi> were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer able to conquere the <hi>Parthians</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending themselues chiefly with that excellent wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon of Archerie on horsebacke.</p>
            <p>But now to speake of foure mightie and conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Nations, that of later yeares, but in diuers ages,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18222:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
haue vanquished and subdued diuers great partes of the world. It doth appeare by many Histories, that the <hi>Gothes, Vandalls, Alans,</hi> and other septentrionall Nations, vnder their notable Princes, &amp; great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, making warre at diuers times vpon the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Romanes,<note place="margin">The Gothes, Vandalles, and other Septen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trionall Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s did atchiue all their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries chieflie with their Bowes.</note> and inuading <hi>Greece,</hi> did besiege the imperiall citie of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and did spoile the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonias,</hi> now called <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and <hi>Austria,</hi> with <hi>Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, Dalmatia,</hi> and many other prouinces.

And in diuers notable battailes woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and killed many great Captaines, and some Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours &amp; their Generals with their arrowes. After which they passed through &amp; spoiled <hi>Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> inuaded and conquered <hi>Spaine,</hi> and caried their armies to the straights of <hi>Hercules,</hi> now called <hi>Gibraltar.</hi> Also the same <hi>Vandalls</hi> and <hi>Alans</hi> passed the straights, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded <hi>Affrike,</hi> and conquered in a maner all the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant</hi> sea coasts of the same now called <hi>Barbarie.</hi> And it is most euident, that they did performe &amp; atchieue al those their battailes, victories and conquests, more with the effect of their Archers and Bowes, than with all the rest of their weapons.</p>

Also, they did win <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and many other Cities and Prouinces, and brought the Emperour <hi>Heracli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and some other of his successours to be tributaries vnto them.

weapons of fire: the iudgement whereof, (because this mine opinion may seeme strange to such as doo not knowe the imperfections of those weapons of fire on horsebacke) I referre vnto any Captaines or Conductors of those weapons either <hi>Italians, Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> or <hi>French</hi> that haue bene vsed to receiue the pay of Emperours or Kings: and if it be of the Pistolet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, then to the <hi>Reisters</hi> themselues.<note place="margin">Harquebuze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry more vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe than on foote, with the imperfections thereof.</note> Besides whose iudgements, by all reason it may appeare, that if the shot of Harquebuzrie on foote in their distances in the field be so vncertaine, as I haue in my former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course declared, then of necessitie it must be a great deale more vncertaine vpon horsebacke, where, by euery motion &amp; stirring of their horses (although they be very quiet) they shall in a manner as often hit Barnacles flying in the ayre, as hurt or kill any horses or men, vnlesse they be very thicke and wonderfull neere. Besides that, the charging of their peeces on horsebacke (be it with flaskes, cartages or charges) is so vncertaine as they shall as often spill their powder besides the mouthes of their peeces, and faile of their chargings, as charge the same. And also put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their touch-powder into the pannes of their peeces, although there be no winde to disperse the same, yet vpon euery motion of their horses, they are ready to powre the powder beside their pannes. And if their peeces be Petronells, then if their stones should happen to breake, or not to stand right in their cockes, whereby they should faile to strike iust vpon the wheeles being fire-lockes, or vpon the hammers or steeles, if they be Snap-hances, or being of match, if their matches be not good and stiffe, and well set
<pb facs="tcp:18222:66"/>
in their serpentines or cockes, they also shall faile in their discharging; besides the difficultie that they shall finde at one time to charge their peeces, to haue an eie to their enemies, and to gouerne their horses, vsing also their scowring sticks as they ought to do: which imperfections of weapons of fire, with manie more, in the experience of all olde and skilfull sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors, are the cause that the shot of them doo terrifie and scare newe soldiors and nouices of warre a great deale more with crackes, smoke and noyse, than with any often hurting with the bullet. All which vnreadinesses, disaduantages and imperfections of <hi>Argolettiers, Carabins, Pistolettiers,</hi> or <hi>Reisters</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with the readinesses, aduantages and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Archers and Crosse-bowers for all seruices in the field. I come to conclude, that Crosse-bowers on horsebacke vsed by many forren Nations of great antiquitie, and that Archers on horsebacke vsed by our auncestours many yeeres past, as also at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent by the <hi>Turkes, Tartars, Persians, Arabians,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mightie Nations, do farre exceede and excell all weapons of fire on horsebacke.</p>

               <p>Now therfore, those our men of warre being such as I haue before declared, and that notwithstanding there haue been such wonderfull opinions concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued here at home of their sufficiencie, that they haue been not only compared with the greatest Captaines of this age, but also thought to bee the onlie men of warre of Christendome: certeinlie, it is greatly to be meruailed at how any such opinion should bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of them, considering that they neuer serued in any imperiall or royall warres of Emperors, Kings, nor formed Common wealths within the continent of <hi>Europe, Affricke,</hi> nor <hi>Asia,</hi> where they might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to any such knowledge in the Art Militarie, but onlie in the disordered and tumultuarie warres of the Lowe Countries vnder the States (where the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne gouernment and commaundement hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of a broken and vncertaine authoritie, all things tending (with great disorder and confusion) more to the spoyle, than to any discipline or Martiall seruice)

<pb facs="tcp:18222:68"/>
there hath been such credite giuen to their fond spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and ignorant perswasions, by the better sort of our Nation, that they haue not onelie since our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion began first to go ouer to serue as mercenarie sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in the Low Countries vnder the States, brought in great numbers of disorders and abuses Militarie, farre different, or rather cleane contrarie to the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and moderne experience, vse, and proceedings of all warlike Nations, but also in a great part defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and decaied the accompt, vse, and exercise of our most excellent weapon the Long-bowe; which in short time to come (if it be not verie speedilie proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for by the execution of such penall statute lawes, as haue been in times past ordained and established for the exercise and maintenance of the same) will growe to bee forgotten, and in a manner vtterlie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished; which, if through the negligence of the better sort of our Nation, imitating and following the simple and ignorant opinions of our such vnskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men of warre, it should come to passe, it doth in mine opinion argue nothing more, than that God hath withdrawne his hand, and all right iudgment in matters Militarie from vs, and that in time to come, vpon any great warre either offenciue or defenciue, we shall, when it is too late, repent the same, greatlie to the hazard and perill of our Prince, Countrie and Nation.

as in my power and small abilitie is) the Nobilitie, Magistrates, and better sort of our Nation, with all care and diligence to reuiue, and put in execution the auncient statutes prouided and established, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and exercise of the youth of <hi>England</hi> in Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that as God of his great goodnes hath blessed our Nation with a wonderfull aptnes and dexteritie in that weapon,<note place="margin">The English, of all other Nations the best Archers.</note> more than any other Nation that I haue seene, heard, or read of throughout the vniuersall world: so that wee may not through the friuolous and vaine perswasions of a fewe vnskilfull and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant men in these our daies, as vnthankfull, neglect that great and especiall goodnes of almightie God, and singular gift that he hath endued vs withall: but that wee doo with all care and diligence beleeue, and imitate the great experience of our most worthie Auncestors, that in diuers ages, with the aduauntage of that most excellent weapon, haue atchieued such and so many wonderfull and miraculous victories a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst diuers Nations, both Christians and Pagans.
