         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Secondly, my loue vnto the Authour, a man deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing loue of all, but ſpecially of me, vnto whom I am beholding (next vnto God) for that health which Ienioy. Thirdly, the woorth of the worke it ſelfe; wherein, looke not for hyperbolicall phraſes, or curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affectation: for as in his life he preferreth deeds before words, ſo in his writings ſhalt thou finde more ſubſtance than ſhewes.

I haue named the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part <hi>Healths Preſeruatiue,</hi> and the latter, <hi>A Diſcourſe of Empiricks and vnlearned Phyſicians.</hi> I wiſh as much good to come vnto thee by this my friends labour, as was meant vnto my ſelfe.

This warrant of ſo great a Phyſician, to liue vntill extreame olde age without any diſeaſe, may moue you to a carefull and diligent obſeruation of the rules required to this happy ſtate of life. Theſe outward things are in number ſix: The aire, meat and drinke, exerciſe and reſt, ſleepe and waking, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling and retaining of ſuperfluities, and the affections of the mind.

Of theſe ſix, the aire hath the firſt place, becauſe our life beginneth with that, and we haue a continuall vſe of it as well by night as by day, both ſleeping and waking: it is of it owne nature bot and moiſt; but it is ſubiect to many alterations from the earth, from the waters, from the windes, and from the heauens: it mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth nouriſhment to the ſpirits and cooleth them, and receiueth their ſuperfluous fumes: it paſſeth by the mouth, noſe and arteries, into the braine, lungs, heart, and all parts of the body: what ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or qualities ſoeuer be in it, thoſe it infuſeth firſt into the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, then into the humours, and ſo into the whole body.

But many take it, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that it doth inable them in ſome actions.

Therefore Tabacco; though neuer ſo ſparingly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, can not be good for you, nor for yoong and ſound bodies: and the often vſe of it in ſuch bodies, driueth them <hi>lentis gradibus</hi> into their graue long before that time that nature had aſſigned them. <note place="margin">It ſhortneth life.</note>

On the contrary, the learned Phyſitian (though he haue no religion) will not, for his credit ſake, be found to vtter any vntrueth; is very ſparing in reporting his owne cures, thinking it a part of high wiſdome, that another ſhould praiſe him, and not his owne lips: and knowing how coniecturall in his Art many things are, dares not promiſe more than he can iuſtifie by Art, leſt he make himſelfe ridiculous: and not being ignorant of the deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſome, and how incurable many diſeaſes are, doth freely and ingenuouſly profeſſe (though he be many times diſmiſſed for his labour) that they admit of no perfect cure, and will not feed

Therefore are they called in the beginning to the cure of ordinary ſickneſſes wherein is no danger at all; whereas the other is then ſent for, whenas either by medicines, not fitting the diſeaſe, the ſicke perſon is brought to the pits brinke, or at the leaſt by trifling away the opportunity of time with medicines that doe no good, the diſeaſe becommeth incurable. Heere if the ſicke perſon dies, all the fault will be layed by thoſe that fauour theſe Empericks vpon the laſt Phyſitian, that they cannot ſee but that moe die vnder the hand of the learned Phyſitian than vnder o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that they haue no good lucke, becauſe they often times die to whom they come. By theſe and the like ſpeeches, ſicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are diſcouraged from ſending for any other Phyſitian than him whom they firſt imployed for feare they ſhould die. But it were wel if theſe ſilly perſons knew how dangerous a thing in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe a little delay is: for then would they conſult with the moſt able Phyſitian in the beginning of any infirmity how ſlight ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it ſeemed to be. For it is not ſo in this buſineſſe as in matters of law, where if any error be committed in the firſt proceeding by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:9677:12"/>
the ignorance or inſufficiency of him that was imployed, it may be reuerſed or (to vſe their owne terme) trauerſed, and come to a new triall, by which it will plainly appeare what difference there is betweene the learned and ignorant lawyer: But in this matter of greater importance where the life is in queſtion, the opportunity of time that is let ſlip can not be recalled, and therefore though the learned Phyſitian knoweth what things ſhould fitly haue beene vſed at the firſt, yet when he is called to the cure, there is no place for him, becauſe remedies are good in their ſeaſon only, and then are they Gods hands: but when the opportunity of vſing them is paſt, then either they are nothing or hurtfull. And here kinde neighbours alſo, eſpecially thoſe of the better ſort, come now to be cenſured as faulty; who viſiting a ſicke perſon perſuade him to ſuch a courſe, or ſuch a medicine, as formerly they haue had experience to haue done good to others in the like caſe. Here if they miſtake the diſeaſe or the nature of it, who conceiueth not what hurt may enſue, though altogether againſt their wils? But admit the thing preſcribed be not hurtfull, yet whileſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is vſed, the ſeaſonable time ſlippeth away, and the diſeaſe groweth deſperate: and thus by their vnſeaſonable good will they hurt them more than if they hated them. Notwithſtanding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that which they do, is in vnfained deſire of their welfare, &amp; of a compaſſionate affection they haue of the diſtreſſed eſtate of their neighbor; they are rather friendly to be admoniſhed that hereafter they deſiſt and aduiſe nothing without the direction of a Profeſſor of that Art, than to be ſharply reprehended. As for the Empericks (amongst whom alſo you may recken our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Apothecaries) becauſe they haue not ſo much humanity in them as to mourne in the miſeries of others; but all that they hunt after is how they may inrich themſelues, though it be with the loſſe, not of the goods alone, but of the liues of men alſo, they muſt be proceeded againſt with all rigour and extremity, as we do with members that haue the Gangrene and are now come to perfect mortification, wherunto we apply nothing either to clenſe or comfort the part, but cut it off that it corrupt not other ſound parts.

                  <hi>Guanerius</hi> ſetteth forth the deadly error of another in the cure of a ſicke man, who after extreme &amp; intolerable paines, ended his life. A learned Phyſician hauing a melancholike patient depriued of the right vſe of his inward ſenſes, amongſt other things in the cure, appointed his head to be ſhauen, and then to be anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and bathed according to arte: <note place="margin">Senſeleſſe. imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note>an Empirike hearing of this cure, gat the receit of the outward medicines vſed in it; and not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, lighting vpon one ſicke of a phrenſic or inflammation of the braine, thought it to be the ſame diſeaſe with the former, becauſe both the patients were madde: therefore he followed the ſteps of the other, with great confidence of the cure: this grieuous error in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking both the diſeaſe and the cauſe of it, brought the miſerable man to a ſpeedy and of his life, farre more cruell to himſelfe, and more terrible to the beholders than the ſickneſſe could haue done. The reaſon of this is plaine and euident to euery meane Phyſician. The cauſe of rauing in the former, was a cold humor; in the latter, a hot: therefore hot medicines, which were fit to cure the one, were as fit to kill the other. But admit the Empirike had beene called to the cure of the ſame diſeaſe, proceeding from the ſame cauſe, yet he could not haue obſerued the circumſtances which arte required, and therefore his receit was vaine and vnprofitable. If the courſe of theſe blinde practiſioners could be obſerued, it would be found to be like to this in euery diſeaſe. Our books are full of ſuch wofull examples. A huge volume will not conteine all the tragicall hiſtories of the ſicke of this age, manifeſtly killed by the ignorance of Empiriks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to diſcerne one diſeaſe from another, or to diſtinguiſh

And doubtleſſe the learned Phyſitian hath as great aduantage ouer Empiriks in diſcerning of diſeaſes, as they that iudge of the eyes obiect by the ſunne, ouer thoſe that iudge of it by the ſtarres. They do the oftener fall into this errour, becauſe ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes agree in two or three ſignes, and yet are farre different. The perfect examining and comparing of ſignes, and referring of them to their ſeuerall cauſes, can not be performed without Arte. But ſuppoſe they could diſtinguiſh of moſt diſeaſes, whereof they come farre ſhort; yet to know the diſeaſe is not one ſtep to the cure, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the method and maner of proceeding in it, be as well knowen. But to proceed in diſcouering their errours: the two moſt effectuall and vſuall meanes for the cure of moſt diſeaſes, are opening a veine and purging. The ſpeciall obſeruations that are required in both theſe, are farre aboue the apprehenſion of vnlearned Empiriks; therefore they can not vndertake any thing fitly and ſafely in either of them. <note place="margin">Of opening a veine.</note>What a great regard is to be had in preſeruing bloud in his naturall quantity and qualities, is euident in that it giueth nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſtrength to the whole body: and it is as it were the meat whereby the natiue heat is fed, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſayth:<note place="margin">Pabulum natiui caloris. de natur. facult. lib. 2. </note> therefore it may not  be drawen out of the body without mature deliberation. <note>Gal. de ſang miſs. cap. 6.</note>The things that are to be obſerued in opening a veine, are reduced vnto ten heads: theſe I muſt not mention, becauſe I labour to be ſhort.

The anſwer to this is eaſie: There are many things in law which belong meerely to Atturneys, and require no learning: alſo they follow preſidents and vſuall formes, and many things wh ch they doe, are plaine tranſcripts, written out of bookes <hi>verbatim,</hi> wherein they cannot erre, if they follow their paterne. But it is farre otherwiſe in Phyſicke: there is no vſuall forme to follow in iudging or curing of diſeaſes; things ſeldome fall out after the ſame maner; the Phyſician muſt alter and change his courſe, as the diſeaſe and accidents require, wherein experience can not guide him, but the rules of the Arte.

But in this boaſting of ſecrets the common ſort are carried into a double errour: for Firſt, Empiriks haue no ſuch ſecrets: Secondly, if they had, they cannot make a fit and ſafe vſe of them. For the former, no man of iudgement can imagine that they haue them by their owne reading, that reade ſo little, &amp; vnderſtand farre leſſe: and (that which is much more) that are ignorant of the languages, wherein it is moſt probable theſe ſecrets ſhould be incloſed. Neither is it credible that any learned man ſhould diſcouer them rather to this ignorant brood, than to thoſe of their owne ranke, learned and ingenious. All the ſecrets contained within the Art of Phyſicke are ſooneſt found out by the profoundeſt ſcholers &amp; greateſt ſtudents. Therfore if any be in the hands of Empirikes: the ſame, yea many more are knowen to the learned. Touching the latter, it is euident (as hath beene partly prooued before) that diſeaſes are not cured by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines &amp; receits, but by a learned and methodical vſe of them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Empirikes cannot attaine.

Medicines therefore do oftner hurt then helpe, be they neuer ſo excellent, if there be not Art in the giuing of them, to fit them to the cauſe of the diſeaſe, and other circumſtances required. But to impart to you my confident opinion of theſe ſecrets grounded partly vpon my own obſeruation, and partly vpon intelligence from learned and honeſt Phyſitians: they are but triuiall and common things knowen to euerie meane Apothecarie, or of baſer account than the meaneſt drugge. One of theſe ignoraut and vaine glorious fellowes hauing ſpent a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths in following the warres beyond the ſeas, and being deſirous to liue at home with more caſe and leſſe perill, reſolued to become a Phyſitian. To the effecting heereof he procured ſome common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits from an Apothecarie and returned hither. Heere he gat ſome ſhifting companions to him, promiſing them part of his gaine, if they would extoll his skill and magnifie his medicines as rare and admirable ſecrets, farre fetched, and bought at a great price. <note place="margin">An admirable ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret diſcouered.</note>Thus he obtained great fame.

Thus ſubtill and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptfull Empirikes grace their vile &amp; contemptible medicines with the name of ſecrets, that they may the eaſier allure and illude the ſimple people, who are delighted with the ſuppoſed nouelty and rareneſſe of them.

By this tricke, that ſauoureth of coſenage, and requireth a falſe tongue to purchaſe credit to it, many of our Empiriks extoll their fame and increaſe their wealth.

In this caſe, he that giueth medicines out of the vrine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangereth the life of the ſicke. For the deceitfull vrine purſueth hot medicines, which in a frenzie are deadly: alſo the vrine is ſometime red and high coloured as well in the weakeneſſe of the liuer, as in a vehement ague: if in the former, the Empirike truſting to the water (as many haue done in this caſe) openeth a veine, he ſendeth the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient headlong to the graue, <note place="margin">Quò melior, ed peior.</note>whom Arte might eaſily, or peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nature would alone haue recouered.

If it pleaſe you to conſider what manner of men moſt of theſe Empirikes are, (ſuch as haue forſaken that occupation or laſt and laborious courſe of life wherein they were brought vp in their youth, and addicted themſelues to profeſſe that Arte whereof they are vtterly ignorant) you may eaſily perceiue that they are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to vſe all ſtaudulent and deceitfull meanes to eſtabliſh their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. Ignorance cannot purchaſe eſtimation, vnleſſe it be couered with the cloake of knowledge. Craft and ſubtilty will preuaile when ſimple and honeſt dealing ſhalbe of no account. Large and ſtrange talke, be it neuer ſo fooliſh and falſe, is pleaſing to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, but bare and naked truth, vttered in few words, is lightly regarded. <note place="margin">Falſe diſcourſe out of vrines.</note>This allureth the common people to flocke to Empirikes and leaue learned Phyſicians: for there they ſhall heare that the braine is periſhed, the hart is ſwelled, the lungs are conſumed, the liuer is dried and the ſpleene waſted: and in all theſe they will war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the cure: whereas firſt it is certaine, they can diſcern none of theſe by the vrine:<note place="margin">The facilitie of iudgeing of vrines as Emperiks doe.</note> and then it is as certaine that they can cure none of them.

In pale vrines they haue another leſſon: there they pronounce the ſtomacke to be weak, flegme to abound, want of digeſtion, heauineſſe after meat, inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſleepe, the body full of winde and ſubject to ſtitches.

The Phyſician marking the heauie countenance of the fellow, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectured thereby that the patient was ſome deere friend of his, and very ſicke. And hauing viewed the vrine, he ſaid, is not this your wiues vrine? I perceiue ſhe is very ill.

The ſubtill Empirike ſeeing the vrine to be well colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and to giue no ſuſpition of any inward diſeaſe, geſſed it to be ſome outward thing. The credulous and fooliſh man ſaid, I wonder at your cunning: go on I pray you and tell me how her ſide came to be blacke and blew. The Empirike taking hold of theſe plaine words, imagined that it happened by ſome fall or blow, and asked him if ſhe had not a fall. He taking this queſtion to be an abſolute and vndoubted aſſertion, ſtill magnified his skill, and ſaid further vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, if you can tell me where and how ſhe fell, I will hold you to be the onely Phyſician in this land. The Empirike ſmiling at his ſimplicity, and conſidering with himſelfe the manner and faſhion of poore country houſes, anſwered, it was like ſhe fell off a ladder. This ſimple fellow admiring the anſweares as proceeding from rare and extraordinarie skill, asked further if he could ſee in the vrine from how many ſtaues ſhe fell. He preſuming that the poore mans houſe was low, ſaid, from eight ſtaues: the clowne not ſatisfied with this, ſhaked his head, and deſired him to looke better in the vrine, and he ſhould find more. This crafty impoſter perceiuing that he had geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed too few, and remembring that which he had ſpied before on the pot, demanded of him, if he ſpilt none of the water by the way, which being confeſſed, he ſaid, there you may finde the reſt of the ſtaues, for I am aſſured there are no more to be ſeene in this vrine.

Euen as a plaine countrie fidler is thought by his neighbours not to be inferiour to cunning Muſicians.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</note>the great enemy to nature, as the men called <hi>Andibatae</hi> did againſt their enemies. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a ſtory of a blind woman famous for her skill in Phyſicke, by whoſe dore a porter paſſing with a heauy burthen vpon his back, fell downe and cried out for helpe: the compaſſionate woman came ſpeedily with aqua vitae, and feeling for his mouth, offered to powre in ſome, whereas halfe an eie would haue ſerued her to haue eaſed him of his burthen. <note place="margin">All Empitiks are blinde.</note>It is vſuall with Empirikes, for want of the eie of learning, to bring as ridiculous and ſenſeles meanes of helpe to their patients: for when they ſee not the cauſe of the diſeaſe (as they do very ſeldome ſee it fully) they cannot fit a medicine to it. They may fondly purpoſe, fooliſhly conſult, and largely promiſe to performe great matters in Phyſicke:<note place="margin">Hermogenes apes.</note> but in execution they will be found like to <hi>Hermogenes</hi> his apes, who aſſembled themſelues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take counſell how they might be ſecured from the violent incurſions and aſſaults of greater beaſtes, they concluded to builde

a ſtrong fort: they agreed vpon the matter and forme thereof. Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry onè was aſſigned to his ſeuerall worke: ſome to cut downe tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſome to make bricke, other for other offices. But when they met to begin this great building, they had not one inſtrument or toole to worke withall, ſo their counſell was ouerthrowen. So Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirikes may attempt to build vp health in a ſicke body: they may promiſe the cure of diſeaſes; but what can be expected at their hands ſith they want all the tooles of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> neceſſarie for ſo great a worke? <note place="margin">Empiriks as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull pilots.</note>The conſideration of all theſe things hath often moued me to compare their patients to them that croſſe the ſeas in a ſmal leaking boate with an vnskilful pilot: they may arriue ſafe at the wiſhed hauen: but wiſedome truſteth to the ſtrongeſt meanes, which alwaies promiſe, and commonly performe greateſt ſecuritie. One thing I will adde more of this odious generation: the multitude of them in this country is incredible. Out of one rotten and maligne ſtocke ſpring many riotous branches. <note place="margin">Mali corui ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum ouum.</note>One maſter ſendeth foorth many iourneymen, which haue beene his apprentiſes. If theſe old breeders be maintained, we ſhall haue, within theſe few yeeres, more Empirikes, than butchers; more killers of men, than of oxen. <note place="margin">The great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Empiriks.</note>The number of them is ſo increaſed, that they are at enmity one with another. It is a ſport to heare one of the moſt eminent of them (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed in a chaire for his great skill) raile vpon vnlearned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, <note place="margin">The hering man mockes the fiſher man.</note>and yet he himſelfe was neuer admitted vnto Grammar ſchoole. But this doth exempt them from all ſuſpition of ignorance amongſt the vulgar, and procureth them many patients. But the more they are admired, and the greater number of patients they haue, the more they exceed in craft and falſhood. <note place="margin">Ignorance can not purchaſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. </note>For ignorance  cannot purchaſe admiration, vnleſſe craft and ſubtilty be ioint-pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers with her. But to draw to an end, ſith Empirikes are vtterlie diſabled by the difficultie of the Arte of Phyſicke: <note place="margin">The concluſion.</note>by their educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their youth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the want of grammer, logicke and philoſophy: by their palpable ignorance in the theorie and ſpeculation of that they profeſſe: by the manifold errors they fall into. Sith experience cannot teach them the methode and order of curing diſeaſes: nor reading of Engliſh bookes affoord them any mediocrity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Sith moſt of their cures are naturall, or caſuall: all their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets triuiall and common <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their diſcourſe out of vrines, grounded vpon ſubtiltie and deceit: their fame and multitude of patients ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from fraude and falſhood in themſelues, or from follie in the vulgar. Finally, ſith there is a full conſent of all learned Phyſicians iuſtlie condemning them. I may firmly conclude that their practiſe is alwaies confuſed, commonly dangerous and often deadly. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whereas <hi>Ludouicus</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">De indic bonum medicamentum eſt &amp;c.</note>
                  <hi>Mercatus</hi> ſaith, it is a good medicine ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to take no medicine at all. And <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>Foreſtus</hi> affirmeth, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the whole worke is to be left to nature, which when Empiriks
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:9677:28"/>
ſee not, they often kill the ſicke. In my opinion this diſtinction of time may be cut off, and both theſe ſayings made generall; for where the pactiſe is wholly ingroſſed by theſe men, there the beſt medicine is alwaies to take no medicine at all: <note place="margin">No medicine to be taken of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piriks.</note>and the whole worke is euer to be left to nature, rather then to be committed to any of theſe. For though they cure ſome, yet they kill many: the way of erring in the practiſe of Phyſicke is ſo ample and broad, and the path, leading to the methodicall cure of diſeaſes, ſo narrow and ſtraight. Thus, Sir, you haue that which you required, directions for your health, and my opinion of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirikes. God almighty bleſſe you with the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the former, or preſerue you from the perill of the latter. </p>
