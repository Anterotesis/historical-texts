            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I wyl (by goddes grace) fyrſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the ſignification of this worde
Elementum, which we maye verye
well call in our tonge a begynnynge
of any thynge: and thereof it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Alphabete letters be called ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes,
bicauſe they are beginners of
al maner of languages, &amp; the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
alſo of euery arte be called Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
bycauſe they are begynners
of the ſame. The Phiſitions alſo do
<pb facs="tcp:9836:12"/>
call the veynes pulſes, and bones, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
all other ſuche partes as the Latyne
men call similares, ſenſible elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:
bycauſe they are the fyrſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of mannes bodye, as moche as
maye be perceyued by ſenſe. For the
fyre, ayer, water and earth, (of the
which all thynges vnder the moone
be made) can not be perceyued by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſence: wherfore as they are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyrſt
begynners of mannes bodye, ſo they
are not the fyrſt ſenſyble begynners.
For yf they coulde be perceyued by
ſence, then euerye man as he paſſeth
other in quyckneſſe of ſence, ſo ſhuld
he ſe, and feale mooſt fyne elementes
as the Aegle, bycauſe his ſyght is
mooſt perfyte, ſhoulde eaſelyeſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
the leaſt Element, but percaſe
ſome wyll ſaye vnto me, that there
is no man ſo madde to ſaye, that the
fyre, ayre, erth, and water, can not be

felte, and perceyued by ſenſe: But
whoſoeuer ſhal moue this doubt, I
wyll anſwer hym, of thys faſſyon:
that yf he meane our fyre, our water
or our earth, I wyl ſaye as he ſayth
which is, that they may be felte and
perceyued by ſenſe. For in dede they
are no Elementes, but thinges mixt
and corruptyble: hauyng theyr com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of dyuerſe thynges, where
as the pure element is a body mooſt
ſimple, withoute all generation or
corruption. Nowe be it, of fyre made
thycke, commeth ayer: and of ayer
made thycke, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth water: and of
water made thycke, commeth earth.
And yet here is neyther corruption,
nor yet generation of the whole, for
this is a mutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the partes only.
Then as I ſayde before, Elementu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in this ſignification is a body mooſt
pure and ſimple, and the leeſt parte
<pb facs="tcp:9836:13"/>
of the ſame, wherin it is: whiche can
not be deuyded into any other kinde,
and of it all thynges naturall haue
theyr originall begynnynge. This
definition is taken both out of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
and Ariſtotle: therfore I truſte,
no man wyll be ſo impudent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
or impugne it. And there be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
as is aforeſayd .iiii. Elementes, of
the whiche the fyre is extreme hotte,
and moderatly drie: the ayer extreme
moyſt, and moderatly hotte: the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
extreme colde, and moderatelye
moyſt: the earth is extreme drie, and
moderatelye colde. In heate the fyre
with the ayer, and in dryneſſe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the
earth, in moyſture the ayer w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter,
&amp; in heate with the fyre, in colde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
the water with the earth, &amp; in

the water, doeth conſent and agree.

And as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyre is extreme

               <p>Now that I haue ſhewed howe by

differences of the bodye may eaſe lye
be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there remayneth behynde
to declare how to fynde out the ſame
wythoute compariſon. Where as
I ſayde before, that euery qualitye,
myght be taken thre dyuerſe wayes
as heate in the hygheſt degree, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:9836:18"/>
in the fyre, and in a naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
myxt of the Elementes, it is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
referred to an other, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon:
as hotte for hotter, or els it is
ſo of nature, whyche maye be taken
two maner of wayes, as hotte in
acte or in power. Thynges that be
hotte in acte, maye eaſelye be iudged
by ſence of fealynge: for who hathe
ſo dull ſenſe in fealynge, that he can
not perceyue the fyre to be hotte: yf
he put hys fynger in it. But to know
whych is hotte in power is a thynge
of more difficultye. For it can not at
the fyrſt brunt be perceyued by anye
ſence, neyther of fealyng, ſmellynge,
hearynge, ſeinge, nor taſtynge. For
who can perceyue by anye of theſe,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> caſtoreu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or euphorbiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or naſturciu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is hotte, or that Mandragora, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamandra
or Papauer is colde. But
in caſe ye take any parte of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlye,
<pb facs="tcp:9836:19"/>
eyther as meate, drynke, or
medicine: then ye ſhal eaſely diſcerne
whiche is hotte and whiche is colde.
But peraduenture ye wyl condemne
this profe as noughte, bycauſe it is
daungerous medlyng with poyso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s:
I graunt that, &amp; therfore it is moch
ſafer, to laye them as a playſter, to
ſome vtter part of your ſkyn, where
as they can not hurte, and after that
they haue lyen there a whyle, they
wyll ſhewe theyr power and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which ſhalbe perceyued quycklye
by ſenſe in felyng. But to iudge thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
moyſt, or drye, I can ſhewe you
a mocheſurer rule, what ſoeuer thing
is ſoft, and moderately hotte, that of
nature is moyſt: whatſoeuer is harde
and moderatly hote, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of nature and
power is drye: and this is alwayes
true, as well in lyuely bodyes, as is
other thynges.</p>

haue neade of meane inſtrumentes,

<pb facs="tcp:9836:52"/>

iuice, neyther in the mawe, nor in the
ſmall veynes about the liuer, leſt the
ſame be ſnatched into euery parte of
the bodye, before it be made mete or
profitable to the ſame by concoxion.
Therfore bycauſe it doth clenſe and
purge the lytle pores, and alſo expel
the experimentes, it maye well be
taken before meate. For Hypocrates
ſayth: Yf thou nouryſhe vncleane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes,

that the beſt and meteſt tyme for

at anye other tyme, eyther before
<pb facs="tcp:9836:75"/>
or after, it muſt eyther fyll the bodye
full of crude and rawe humours, or
els augment pale, and citrine choler.
Doubtleſſe, the true marke of thys
tyme is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the vrine. For whyte
water betokeneth cruditie, readde,
ouermoche concoction, and that, that
is ſomewhat pale, and a lytle turned
to yelowe, is a token that the ſecond
concoction is nowe alreadye downe:
and ſo longe as the water or vryne
is not infected wyth choler, it is ſtyll
whyte: and when it hathe taken to

putrifye, whereof there maye enſue
moche inconuenience. Therfore ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that exercyſe (as we ſayd before)
is a vehement mouynge, it is verye
mete and neceſſary to ſhew for what
bodyes exercyſe is mooſte conueny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and holeſoome: for Hypocrates
counſayleth them, whoſe bodyes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
in heate, to beware of all vyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and vehement mouinges. Then
ſhall ſuche bodyes lyue in ydleneſſe,
wythout exercyſe? or any mouynge?
no. For althogh Hypocrates forbyd
ſuche to vſe any exercyſe that is vyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent:
yet neuertheleſſe he forbyddeth
them ydleneſſe, commaundyng them
to vſe thoſe kyndes of exerciſe which

but ſuch as be colde of nature,

and do not ſodeynlye, and
at the fyrſt brunt, excercyſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelfes

as ye ſe lute or harpeſtringes, if they
be ſodeynely and vehementlye ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,

ſo the ſynowes, and the fyne

and alſo of the ſynnowes, whyche be
the inſtrumentes of mouynge, and
that the foreſayde vapours whythe
doo fume vp to the brayne maye not
be crude or rawe, the hearte plucketh
in to it bothe the blood and naturall
heat, that is in the vtter partes. And
thys ſame reſt is good for .iii. cauſes,
fyrſt to moyſter the brayne, and then
to the generation of ſpirites, &amp; laſte
of all, to make an ende of the conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
bothe in the ſtomake and liuer.
The materiall cauſe of ſleepe, are the
ſweete vapours, the whyche whan
they be made moyſt, ſtyllyng doune,
do ſtoppe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duytes of the ſenſis.
For they be not cla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mye or groſſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
ſuch as hurte the brayne, but

to the floude Euripus, bycauſe in
theyr goinge vp they turne backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne,
and other folowe, and come
after, but the efficient cauſe is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more darke and obſcure. For it
is certayne that the heat and blood of
the vtter partes, is (as Hypocrates
ſayeth) drawenin to the hearte, and
though the body then be hotter with
in, it is colde without: therfore when
we ſlepe, we haue nede of manye clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes.
The heate and blood is drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in bycauſe that when the concoction
is begone, the vapours do fume vp,
naturally: and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be diſolued
they come downe fulbut on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heate

is dryuen ſtyll more and more to the

<pb facs="tcp:9836:80"/>
doth make an ende of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the vapours which aſcende

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull

fyrſt prouydeth for him ſelfe, and
thys naturall inclination is gyuen

the herte eſpecially for his owne
cauſe, draweth to hym ſelfe heate,
bycauſe he hath neade of bloode, and
bycauſe his ſpirites be almoſt ſpent.
And therefore he alſo healpeth the

that it maye cheryſh it ſelfe, &amp; bryng

to all the partes, that after defatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

whych ſlepe gyueth to euery vertue

bycauſe it maketh an ende of

more certayne tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the crudities
whych come for lacke of ſleape is vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>curable,
bycauſe not onely the meate

partly by the burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and weyght of

bycauſe the ſynowes be hurte by

And byſyde theſe the naturall

maye be perceyued, how moche nede
we haue of ſlepe, to the conſeruation

it, whiche is the ſame kynde, that
prophecyeth of thynges to come, by
reuelation from God, inſomoch that
they whyche haue ſuche dreames,
knowe that they come from God.
Iacob and Ioſeph knewe that their
dreames came from God, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they knewe the ſignification of
them. Also god doth adde a noble te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony

vnto Daniel, that it ſhoulde
be knowen, that it came from hym.
Therfore this kynde of dreames is
<pb facs="tcp:9836:90"/>
except from that rule which forbyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs to giue credite vnto dreames
For when they come from God, and
when God teſtifyeth that he is the
authour of them, then it is neceſſary
to beleue them: of the other dreames
there ought nothyng to be affirmed.
And as concernyng the .iiii. kynde of
dreames, it is vtterly to be abhorred.
Dreames of the ſeconde kynde, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
theybe coniectures, yet there
ought to be no affirmation of them:
wherfore we ought to gyue no credit
vnto them, and for the mooſte parte,
they be full of ambiguitie. Therfore
manye kynges and capitaynes haue
bene deceyued with ſuche dreames.
