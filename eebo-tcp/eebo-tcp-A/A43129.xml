            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE KING's MOST Sacred Majeſty.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dread Soveraign,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe following Sheets were written before the Death of Your Majeſties Royal Brother King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, (of ever Bleſſed Memory) And I had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign then, to ſhew to His Majeſty, that ſeveral <hi>Jews</hi> to whom His Majeſty had been Graciouſly pleaſed to Grant <hi>Letters Patents of Denization,</hi> with a Clauſe inſerted, <hi>That they ſhould pay no more Cuſtom than</hi> Engliſh, <hi>(non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante</hi> the Statutes,) Had Owned and Coloured the Goods of other <hi>Jews</hi> that had not ſuch a Clauſe in their Patents, and of ſome <hi>Jews</hi> who had no Patents at all; By means whereof their own Pattents were at His Majeſties Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>But while I was preparing Arguments and Proofs thereof, it pleaſed God to put a period to His Majeſties days, and the Act of <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> with the Articles annexed, which Granted the <hi>Alien</hi> or Petty Custom to His Majeſty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived alſo there by its determination.</p>
            <p>A few days after, Your most Excellent Majeſty ſending forth Your Royal Proclamation for the continuation of the Receipt
<pb facs="tcp:93835:3"/>of Your Majeſties Cuſtoms, and declaring Your ſpeedy calling of a Parliament; I forbore the expoſing my Sentiments to publick view, till God ſhould permit Your Majeſties meeting with them.</p>
            <p>And now, that being moſt Happily Accompliſhed, and the Act of <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> with the Articles annexed, being paſt, for and during Your Majeſties Life; I humbly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to aver, that the aforeſaid Clauſe inſerted in thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> Patents, had an end with the ſaid late King, and that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Act Grants to Your Majeſty the <hi>Alien</hi> or <hi>Petty Cuſtoms</hi> in as full manner, as if that Clauſe had never been Inſerted.</p>
            <p>I therefore humbly beg Your Majeſty to direct, that all <hi>Jews,</hi> from the <hi>6th.</hi> day of <hi>February</hi> laſt, do pay the <hi>Alien</hi> Duty, as by Law they ought to do; which will not only be many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands <hi>per Annum</hi> advance to Your Majeſty in Your Cuſtoms, but alſo be extream grateful to all Your Majeſties fair dealing <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants.</p>
            <p>Nor can I forbear to aſſert, that the greater any perſons Poſſeſſions are in <hi>England,</hi> the more is their loſs by the Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Trading of the <hi>Jews</hi> in Your Majeſties <hi>Plantations</hi> in <hi>America:</hi> For the larger their Lands are, the more is their Growth and Product, and the Advantagious Vendition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, depends much on the Conſumption the Plantations make of them. Whereas the <hi>Jews</hi> here, together with other <hi>Jews</hi> their Co-partners living in <hi>Holland,</hi> making their Outward Cargoes at <hi>Holland,</hi> thereby leſſen the Conſumption of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Growth and Manufacture, which not only Affects Your Majeſty, but alſo all Your Subjects of what degree or quality ſoever in the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>My Endeavours (however) have not been for a total Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or their Trade here, (as ſome have aimed) but only to oblige them to pay Your Majeſties Cuſtoms, and act according to Law, that thereby the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants might be Enabled to Sell as Cheap as themſelves.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:93835:3"/>
            <p>Which deſign only being (as the <hi>Jews</hi> conceived) of Grand Diſadvantage to them, they conſulted (as I have reaſon to believe) their firm Friends at <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> how to deal with me; and from thence proceeded the Offers of large Bribes to me, on one hand; which being rejected, a Torrent of Threats followed on the other, <hi>viz. Perpetual Impriſonment, Rotting and Dying there; and</hi> (which they thought moſt prevalent) <hi>Starving to Death:</hi> They not knowing (it ſeems) that my most Noble Friend, the Honnourable Collonel <hi>Strangways</hi> loved me too well to ſuffer that, to whom only, on all emergent Occaſions, I wrote for Supply, and never failed of ſpeedy and ſuitable Returns.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as Your Majeſty ſhall be pleaſed to demand <hi>Alien Duty</hi> from thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> having Patents with the aforeſaid Clauſe, Your Majesty will find that they will fall in with ſome of Your Majesties Subjects in <hi>London,</hi> as well as in the Out-Ports, to cover their Trade: I cannot ſo much blame the <hi>Jews</hi> as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in this matter; For to one, 'tis Natural, to the other <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-natural and a great Shame and Reproach to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Alſo I am certain their Old Friends at <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> dare not leave them, though (conſidering Your Majeſties Pay, together with the Oaths and Sacraments they take the more firmly to tye them to their Duty) in them it be Diabolical; ſome whereof I have been forced for Truths-ſake to Name; And if it diſpleaſes any one of them, I beg a fair Hearing; whereon I am ſure to let them know I have not been yet as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrical as I might, or as their baſe Actions deſerve.</p>
            <p>The grand thing then for the future will be, how to diſtinguiſh <hi>Jews Goods</hi> from <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and Settle it ſo, that no further Cheats be put on Your Majeſty in Your Cuſtomes, Your Subjects in their <hi>Staple,</hi> and the Merchants in their <hi>Trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis much eaſier to prevent future Frauds, than diſcover paſt: However, I ſtill affirm, that I can make good my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals <hi>Fol. 29.</hi> (including <hi>London</hi> too, by the way of future
<pb facs="tcp:93835:4"/>prevention.) And beſides that, make it appear that of late years the wholeſom Acts of <hi>Navigation, Frauds,</hi> &amp;c. Are like a Noſe of Wax turned at the Pleaſure of ſome now at Helm, who pretend a ſmall Duty taken contrary to Law, is more grateful to Your Majesty, than the due Execution of thoſe Beneficial Statutes.</p>
            <p>My Sufferings both in Body and Purſe have been ſolely for my Zeal in the Service of my King and Country; and no opportunity (in my thoughts) did ever happen, ſince it began, till now, to expreſs the Truth of it ſo, that it might with Power repel the fury of my Enemies. But now, (that God having ſeated Your Majeſty on the Throne of Your Anceſtors that the Laws recover Life, that all my Actions have been Legal, that I have not made one falſe ſtep in my Duty; and that the Subſtance of this Diſcourſe hath relation to the benefit of Your Majeſty and the whole Nation.) I have great hopes of Your Majeſties Favour and Pardon for my Boldneſs in making this publick Addreſs; and that Your Majeſty will believe, I will never Swerve from my conſtant practice of Loyalty to the Crown, and Obedience to the Eſtabliſh'd Laws both in Church and State, whatever my future Condition may happen to be.

            <p>ALmoſt as ſoon as <hi>Trade</hi> it ſelf began to Flouriſh in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Aliens</hi> endeavour'd to be Sharers in it; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they might have the ſame Freedom therein that <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> had, they (by ſome good Intereſt or other,) got Patents of <hi>Denization,</hi> and by that means paid no greater or higher Cuſtoms than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants: But they (it ſeems) being formerly in Co-partnerſhip with other <hi>Aliens,</hi> (who ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſo,) could not be contented with the Benefits they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for themſelves, but Clandeſtinly covered the Stocks and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of the others. The Perniciouſneſs whereof appearing, it was thought fit to put a thorow ſtop to ſuch Proceedings. And at a Parliament held in the firſt year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh it was thus Enacted, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <hi>Where in time paſt divers Grants have been made by King</hi> Edward, <hi>as well by his Letters Patents, as by Acts of Parliament, to divers</hi> Merchants Strangers <hi>born out of this Realm, to be</hi> Denizens; <hi>whereby they have, and enjoy ſuch Freedoms and Liberties as do</hi> Denizens <hi>born within this Realm; as well in abatement of their Cuſtoms, which they ſhould bear if they were no</hi> Denizens, <hi>as in Buying and Selling of their</hi> Merchandize; <hi>to their great Avail and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre; and oft-times ſuffer other Strangers not</hi> Denizens, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93835:5"/>to ſlip and carry great and notable ſubſtance of Merchandize in their Names, by the which the ſaid Goods be free of Cuſtom, in like-wiſe as they were Goods of a</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizen, <hi>where of Right they ought to pay Cuſtom as the Goods of</hi> Strangers, <hi>by which they be greatly advanced in Riches and Honour: And after they be ſo Enriched, for the moſt part they convey themſelves with their ſaid Goods into their own Countries, wherein they be naturally born, to the great Impoveriſhing this Realm, and to the great Hurt and Defraud of the</hi> Kings Highneſs <hi>in payment of his Cuſtoms: Wherefore, it is Enacted, Eſtabliſhed and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, by the Advice of the Lords Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and Commons in the ſaid Parliament Aſſembled, and by Authority of the ſame; That any perſon made or hereafter to be made</hi> Denizen, <hi>ſhall pay for his Merchandize like Cuſtom and Subſidy as he ought or ſhould pay as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he was made</hi> Denizen, <hi>any Letters Patents, or other Ordinances by Parliament, or otherwiſe contrary to this made notwithſtanding.</hi>

            <p>However, the ſhifting Humours of thoſe Times (correſponding much with our preſent Age,) found out another way to Defraud the King of his Due, and his Loyal Subjects of their Trade: For find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the aforeſaid Act, exactly put in Execution; The <hi>Aliens</hi> then, by Rewards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Procured <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> to enter their Goods in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Names, which Un-natural practice was alſo ſoon found out; and to prevent any further Progreſs therein, it was Enacted the third year of the aforeſaid King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh: 
<q>
                  <note place="margin">3 Hen. 7.</note>
                  <hi>That no manner of Merchant,</hi> Denizen, <hi>or</hi> Stranger <hi>do take upon him to Enter, or cauſe to be Entred, in the Books of any Cuſtomer in any Port within this Realm, any manner of Merchandizes coming into the ſaid Realm, or going but of the ſame, in any other Merchants Name, ſaving only the Names of the true Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant owner of the ſame, upon pain of Forfeiture of all ſuch Goods and Merchandizes ſo Entred: And every of the ſaid Merchants which ſhall ſo take upon him to cauſe ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true Entry to be made, to have Impriſonment, and make Fine therefore at the Kings pleaſure.</hi>
               </q>

            <p>So that by this Act that ſhift alſo was cut off; and 'tis reaſonable to believe, that due Proceſs was made againſt all <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> who
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93835:5"/>became in any manner Trangreſſors thereof; for that the <hi>Aliens</hi> did not thenceforth ſeek farther Protection from them, but returned to their Old Co-partners that were made <hi>Denizens;</hi> with whom they drove ſo vaſt a Trade, that it became obvious to all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants: And in regard the Statute of the Firſt of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh was by that time grown ſomewhat old, another was made to the ſame purpoſe in the Eleventh year of the ſaid King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, in theſe words,
<q>
                  <note place="margin">11 Hen. 7.14.</note>
                  <hi>Where the King our Soveraign Lord is greatly Deceived in his Cuſtoms and Subſidies by Merchants and</hi> Strangers, <hi>ſuch as the King our Soveraign Lord hath Granted by his Letters Patents to be</hi> Denizens, <hi>and to pay no other Cuſtom or Subſidies for their Merchandize In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or Outward, but as a</hi> Denizen; <hi>under colour whereof they Cuſtom not only their own Merchandizes under the form aforeſaid; but alſo they colourably enter into the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers Books the Merchandizes of other</hi> Strangers, <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſaying the ſaid Goods of other Merchants to be the Goods of them ſo made</hi> Denizens, <hi>to the great Loſs and Defraud of the King our Soveraign Lord: Wherefore be it Enacted by the King our Soveraign Lord, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this preſent Parliament Aſſembled, and by Authority of the ſame, that all Merchant</hi> Strangers, <hi>and others that be made</hi> Denizens <hi>by the Kings Letters Patents, or otherwiſe, pay from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth ſuch Cuſtoms and Subſidies for their Goods and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes Inward and Outward, as they ſhould have paid, if ſuch Letters and Patents had never to them been made.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee what great care was taken for the Advance of <hi>Trade</hi> in the days of that Good King; And if you look into the <hi>Chronicles</hi> of his Time, you will find what vaſt Treaſure he left behind him; and no doubt but that a great part thereof aroſe from the greatneſs of the Subjects <hi>Trade,</hi> and the due payment of His Majeſtie, <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms</hi> and <hi>Subſidies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though almoſt the whole Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth was accompanied with Wars and Diſturbances, either with the <hi>French, Scots,</hi> or the <hi>Pope;</hi> yet was not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of <hi>Trade</hi> laid aſide;

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93835:6"/>the Firſt and Eleventh years of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh were in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Confirmed, and all <hi>Subſidies, Cuſtoms, Tolls, Duties,</hi> and other Sums of Money were continued on the ſaid <hi>Aliens</hi> made <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizens,</hi> as they ſhould or ought to have paid before they were <hi>Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,</hi> any Grant or Grants to them made, or hereafter to be made, or any Act or Acts, Statute or Ordinance, to the contrary made or had not withſtanding.</p>

                  <hi>The Penalty of Cuſtoming other mens Goods, whereby the King looſeth his Duty; is the Forfeiture of all the Goods and Chattels, and perſonalls for ever: The Informer half; to be Proſecuted within three Years, elſe void.</hi>

            <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was ſo entangled in Religious Matters, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments in her dayes ſeem'd to wave all other concerns; and it was but very ſhort alſo, which perhaps might be the Reaſons we hear ſo little of <hi>Trade</hi> therein.</p>
            <p>But no ſooner came that Mirrour of her Sex Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to the Crown, but a review was made; and in the very firſt year of her Reign it was Enacted, 
<q>

                  <hi>That from and after the firſt day of</hi> September, <hi>no perſon</hi> Denizen, <hi>no</hi> Stranger <hi>do take upon him to Enter, or do, or cauſe to be Entred into the Books of any Cuſtomer, or any other Officer or Officers of any Port or Haven within this Realm, or his, or their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty or Deputies, Servant or Servants, any manner of</hi> Goods, Wares <hi>or</hi> Merchandize <hi>whatſoever, coming or brought into your Highneſs's Realm, from any the parts beyond the Sea; or faom the Realm of</hi> Scotland, <hi>or going to be Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported out of the ſame your Highneſſes Realm into any the Parts beyond the Seas, or into the Realm of</hi> Scotland; <hi>in the Name or Names of any Perſon or Perſons, than the very Owner or Owners of the ſame</hi> Goods, Wares <hi>or</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes, <hi>being not Sold, Bargained or Contracted for, to or with any Perſon or Perſons, before ſuch Entry, or before the Arrival of ſuch</hi> Goods, Wares <hi>or</hi> Merchandizes <hi>in the parts beyond the Sea, upon pain of Forfeiture of the value of the Goods ſo Entred.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So that by this Act, neither <hi>Alien</hi> or <hi>Denizen</hi> is permitted to Enter any other mans <hi>Goods</hi> in his own Name; which Statute without
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93835:6"/>doubt was effectually put in Execution: For that in all her Reign, as well as King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, no farther Proviſion is made againſt them, or Rehearſal made of any of the foregoing Statutes.</p>
            <p>The Unnatural Wars coming on, gave liberty to every man to Act his pleaſure in <hi>Trade,</hi> as well as in Religion; But no ſooner was the Grand Pilot of the univerſe pleas'd to bring our moſt Gracious King that now is, to His own Kingdoms again, but that he ſteers the wholeſom courſe of his Anceſtors, and in the very firſt year of his Reign, the twelth Article annexed to the <hi>Book of Rates</hi> ſpeaks thus, 
<q>
                  <note place="margin">12 <hi>Article</hi> Book of Rates.</note>
                  <hi>The Merchants</hi> Strangers, <hi>who according to the Rates and Dalues in this Book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, do pay double Subſidy for</hi> Lead.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>None of theſe Acts have in general been Repealed, but by an Act of Parliament in the twenty fifth year of His Majeſties Reign <note place="margin">25 Car. 2.</note>all <hi>Alien</hi> Duties upon Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of the Growth, Product and Manufacture of this Nation (except <hi>Coals</hi>) is taken off, and the <hi>Alien</hi> pays no more then <hi>Engliſh:</hi> But the <hi>Alien</hi> Duty is continued on all <hi>Foreign</hi> Commodities.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have treated of the Antient and Modern Statutes which have relation to <hi>Trade</hi> in general, and by all of them it appears that from time to time, <hi>Aliens</hi> have been obliged to pay an higher Duty than an <hi>Engliſh-man;</hi> And there is good reaſon for it, for otherwiſe the Ballance of <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Commerce</hi> could never be held upright: We <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> pay more Duties in <hi>Foreign</hi> Parts to any Prince or State, than their own Subjects do; And if they were not obliged to the ſame here, they might Under-ſell us, and yet be Gainers; And what would become of our <hi>Trade</hi> if this were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And theſe Acts ſeem to ſay, <q>
                  <hi>That the</hi> Alien <hi>made</hi> Denizen <hi>here, continued his Co-partnerſhip with his former Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner who was a</hi> Denizen <hi>in ſome Foreign part, and one owning the Goods here, and the other there, paſt as free</hi> Denizens <hi>on both ſides; by which means they could Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93835:7"/>either</hi> Engliſh <hi>or</hi> Alien, <hi>who are neceſſitated to pay</hi> Alien <hi>Duty either here or there.</hi>
               </q> Beſides, that 'tis very much to be feared, that many an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant wilfully covers the Goods of <hi>Aliens</hi> in his own Name: Alſo that the <hi>Jews</hi> who have Patents of <hi>Denization,</hi> with a Clauſe inſerted, That they ſhall pay no more Cuſtom than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do, <hi>non obſtante,</hi> all the Precedent and ſubſequent Acts of Parliament recited in this Treatiſe, do make uſe of them in Covering, Entring and Owning other <hi>Jews</hi> Goods which have no ſuch Patents, or any Patents at all, (for though many of the <hi>Jews</hi> have Patents of <hi>Denization,</hi> yet few of them could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to have that Clauſe inſerted,) and I am told that none for the future muſt ever expect the like Favour again, our moſt Gracious King having declared <hi>He will Govern by Law:</hi> And how ſome of them have abuſed His Majeſties great Favour to them, will appear by the Encroachments they make on our <hi>Plantation Trade</hi> in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica:</hi> A brief account whereof follows.</p>
            <p>Before I come to declare matter of Fact, I think it proper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite as much of the ſeveral Acts of Parliament made to ſecure our <hi>Plantation Trade</hi> as may be neceſſary for Information of the Readers, (ſome whereof perhaps ſeldom have the conveniency of looking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Statute Book) and will begin with the Act of <hi>Navigation</hi> made in the twelth year of the King, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>Alſo in the twenty ſecond and twenty third years of the King, the due Obſervation of the ſaid Acts is again En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced,
<note place="margin">22, and 23. Car. 2.</note> by an Act Entituled, <hi>An Act to prevent the Planting of</hi> Tobacco <hi>in</hi> England, <hi>and for Regulating the Plantation Trade.</hi> And by another Act in the five and twentieth

               <note place="margin">25 Car. 2.</note> So that it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears by the multiplicity of the Acts made in this Kings Reign already, (there having been no leſs than ſeven) and the great Penalties laid on <hi>Merchants, Owners of Ships,</hi> and <hi>Officers of the Cuſtoms</hi> who are concerned therein, that no care hath been wanting to oblige us to a due Obſervance thereof: Yet if we take a ſtrict view of the preſent Practices of the <hi>Jews,</hi> we ſhall, find that, they not only break through theſe Laws made with a particular Relation to our <hi>Plantation Trade,</hi> but alſo through all the former made to oblige them to the payment of <hi>Alien</hi> Duty; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, (as I ſaid before) no true Ballance of <hi>Trade</hi> can poſſibly be kept.</p>
            <p>And in regard the <hi>Jews</hi> are a ſort of Perſons admired at, by moſt Trading People all the World over, as well as here in <hi>England,</hi> for their great Wealth and that they all know it flows from the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their Trade and Commerce; and yet that they carry it on with ſo much Subtilty, covering all in other mens Names, that none but a perſon deſigned to dive into their Ways and Methods of <hi>Trade;</hi> and leaving almoſt all other Concerns behind his back; together with a reſolution to ſtand his Point, come what will on't, Poverty, Impriſonment, or (rather than fail) Life it ſelf, is fit to attempt ſo Crabbed a concern, as to touch them to the quick: It came into my thoughts to endeavour it; and really the true value I have for our Nation in General, and for the Merchants thereof in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, I have adventured to begin it, and beg the <hi>Readers</hi> pardon for a ſmall digreſſion, to ſhew that I was in ſome meaſure prepared for it, before I began. And it thus was, before I was 16 years of Age, which was in the year 1661. I was Clerk Aſſiſtant to <hi>Joſeph Aſh</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Collector for the Cuſtoms of <hi>Plymouth</hi> and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> with whom I remained about ſeven years, then turned Adventurer at <hi>Sea,</hi> and particularly to the <hi>Plantations</hi> in <hi>America:</hi> When the laſt <hi>Dutch</hi> War came on, I had Employs at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> both in the <hi>Prize-Office</hi> and <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty;</hi> And after that was ended, I Traded into <hi>France,</hi> till the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition Act came on; and leaving that endeavoured for an Imploy in the Cuſtoms again: Which was granted mein the Month of <hi>June</hi> 1680. To be riding Surveyor for the Cuſtomes in the Counties of <hi>Devon</hi> and <hi>Cornwall:</hi> My old Mr. <hi>Aſh</hi> alſo gave me another Commiſſion to be Surveyor of the Act of <hi>Navigation</hi> in thoſe Counties, and was ſo kind
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93835:9"/>alſo, to joyn with my my Noble Friend Sir <hi>John Coryton</hi> Baronet, in a Bond for my Fidelity.</p>
            <p>Being thus furniſhed with Commiſſions, having all the precedent Laws at my Fingers end, General Notions of the uſual Actions of thoſe whoſe Magazine of our <hi>Plantation Trade</hi> lyes at <hi>Amſterdam, Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam,</hi> &amp;c. I ſet on with a firm Reſolution to put all the foregoing Acts of Parliament in Execution againſt every Perſon, <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, Merchant</hi> or <hi>Officer,</hi> that I could meet with who were wilful Offenders therein, in my Diſtricts with hopes alſo that my Brethren who had the care of other Places ſubject to the ſame evil practices, would in time follow my example: And the reaſons which moſt of all animated me thereunto were. <hi>1ſt.</hi> The Removal of the <hi>Staple</hi> of <hi>Commerce</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> had done, and continue ſtill to do, from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Holland,</hi> moſt of their Cargoes for the <hi>Plantations</hi> being made up of the Growth, Product and Manufacture of thoſe parts, and none of <hi>Engliſh;</hi> So that the <hi>Act of Trade</hi> recited, <hi>fol.</hi> 7. is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly controverted, which directs, <q>
                  <hi>That as the People of thoſe Parts are</hi> Engliſh, <hi>ſo then ſhould be Fed, Cloathed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by the Product of</hi> England: <hi>And if any Foreign Commodities, either for Neceſſity, Ornament or Curioſity were proper to be vended there, yet they ſhould come from</hi> England:</q> No doubt, intending thereby that every ſort of <hi>Trade</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> ſhould be ſomewhat Gainers by what they ſupply the <hi>Plantations</hi> with. And here it will not be amiſs to conſider how much difference may ariſe betwixt a Cargo made up altogether of <hi>Forreign</hi> Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities here in <hi>London,</hi> and the ſame quantity in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> or <hi>Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam;</hi> an inſtance only in <hi>Linnens,</hi> for Example, Becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbadoes</hi> Sell more <hi>Hollands</hi> there, than all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants do; and the <hi>Alien</hi>-Duty amounts to a great ſum of Money yearly, which the King is wholly Cheated of. The Merchant here imploy; his Factor in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to buy it, and allows him his Commiſſion for it, who Ships it there; the Ship arrives here, and the Maſter hath his Fraight paid him, alſo the King is duly paid his Duties, and the Officers their Fees, the City Duties of <hi>Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fage,</hi> &amp;c. alſo is duly paid, and thence is conveyed to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Ware-houſe by <hi>Porters</hi> or <hi>Carmen.</hi> where it remains till the Merchants can meet with a <hi>Draper</hi> to buy it, his Ware-houſe-room is valued according to the time it lyes, and all contingent Charges added to the prime Coſt by the Merchant; then the Merchant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding alſo ſo much <hi>per cent.</hi> for his Adventure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As the Market will
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93835:9"/>bear; parts with it to the <hi>Draper,</hi> who is at Charge to carry it home, and of Shop or Ware houſe room till he diſpoſe of it again; to which he alſo adds ſo much <hi>per cent.</hi> for Disburſe of his Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then comes a Merchant Adventurer to him to buy what ſorts of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen</hi> he hath occaſion to furniſh his Factor with in the <hi>Plantations,</hi> afterwards comes other Charges on, as <hi>Cartidge, Porterage, Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidge, Cuſtom Officers Fees,</hi> &amp;c. All which muſt be added in his Envoyce to his Factor in the <hi>Plantations:</hi> And you ſhall commonly find abundance of Entries and Coequets to be had here in <hi>London,</hi> and many out-Ports too on any conſiderable Ship going for the <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> which much increaſes the Officers Fees, and Imploys abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of poor Labouring perſons, as well as Merchants and Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. On the contrary, you ſhall have a ſet of <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſharers with the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>London, Barbadoes, New-york, Jamaica,</hi> &amp;c. who paſs every where paying no more Duties than Natives of that place where the Goods at any time are, joyn in a lump together; and at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> or <hi>Rotterdam</hi> make up their Cargoes; when all is on board, they either agree with the Commander of the Ship to come and Enter all, or have private Correſpondence with ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant in an out-Port, (or their Partners here in <hi>London</hi> have,) who direct their Correſpondent in ſuch out. Port to make ſuch Entryes as they before-hand have concluded at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> or <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> the moſt uſual Ports which they frequent, are <hi>Dover, Cowes</hi> and <hi>Falmouth,</hi> though ſometimes ſome other Ports betwixt <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Falmouth,</hi> and there the whole Cargo is Entred together in ſome <hi>Engliſhmans</hi> Name, to avoid payment of their <hi>Alien</hi> Duty due to the King: The Detection and prevention whereof was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Reaſon that moved me to endeavour ſo Vigorouſly to put the Antient Statutes in Execution, knowing that the King hath already loſt many thouſands thereby; and that it is alſo a very great Abuſe in the Ballance of Trade, and that both goes on in the ſame Channel to this day, is the main reaſon that I now appear publickly in Print, thereby to let every one ſee how they are Impos'd upon. And now conſidering what hath been ſaid of the difference betwixt making up a Cargo here, and at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> or <hi>Rotterdam</hi> for theſe <hi>Plantations,</hi> and the Cheats the <hi>Jews</hi> alſo put on His Majeſty in His Dutie, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently affirm the Cargoes from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> or <hi>Rotterdam</hi> are made at leaſt 10 <hi>per cent.</hi> cheaper than thoſe in <hi>London</hi> can be, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently may be Sold ſo in the <hi>Plantations;</hi> let us then look into their Actions back again, and compare a Ship Loaden by many particular
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93835:10"/>Merchants at <hi>Barbadoes</hi> for <hi>London;</hi> and ſuppoſing her whole Cargoe might meet with a better Market in Forreign Ports than here in <hi>London,</hi> and that accordingly all goes off for <hi>Holland.</hi> You will find that any Ship at <hi>Barbadoes</hi> which comes to ſeek a Fraight (for ſuch generally the <hi>Jews</hi> take up) will go for <hi>Amſterdam</hi> or <hi>Rotterdam</hi> for the ſame Fraight they will for <hi>London;</hi> (except a <hi>Winter</hi> be coming on.) for if they do well in their Home Voyage, 'tis ten to one but they meet with further Imploy back again; or in failure of that, are nearer the <hi>Sound</hi> or <hi>Norway,</hi> &amp;c. to fetch home a Cargo from thence to <hi>London,</hi> And on this ground compute, that every one of the Merchants concerned pay <hi>Cuſtom Officers Fees,</hi> Unload all, (<hi>Bona Fide</hi>) according to Law pay <hi>Lighterage, Wharfage, Portridge, Cartage, Cooperage</hi> and <hi>Sellerage,</hi> &amp;c. Till they Sell them, and then diſpoſe of them to a Merchant Adventurer to <hi>Holland,</hi> who before they arrive into his Factors hands there, payes the other Merchant here, is at all other particular Charges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Till they are Ship'd on Board, and of Fraight from hence to <hi>Holland,</hi> adding thereto ſo much <hi>per Cent.</hi> as the Merchant Adventurers from the <hi>Plantations</hi> may in reaſon expect, together with the other Merchant who buyes them for an <hi>Hollands</hi> Market, for laying out of his Money, and Riſque thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; And judge whether, on the other hand the <hi>Jews,</hi> as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, carrying on their <hi>Trade</hi> in a Lump, Enter a multitude of mens Goods in one <hi>Engliſh-mans</hi> Name, come into ſome ſmall Out-Port, and only Unloading part of the Cargo which lyes topmoſt, leaving the ground Tyre, and all other parts ſubject to Breach and loſs intire, to paſs by Computation, and thereby preſerve not only the goodneſs of thoſe <hi>Sugars</hi> which commonly lie in the bottom, but alſo preſerve great quantities, which by removal of broken Butts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becomes loſt, and many times under them conceal Goods of great value from the Eyes of any Officer, (whoſe Perjur'd Actions guides to ſuch Diabolical Condeſcentions;) may not thereby be enabled to Sell when the Ship arrives at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> or <hi>Rotterdam</hi> aforeſaid for 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Lower than an <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> in his uſual way of <hi>Trade</hi> at this day can do.</p>
            <p>So that if this be granted, (which I Challenge all the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>America</hi> to deny if they can,) they may in every voyage from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> or <hi>Rotterdam</hi> to <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and back again to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> or <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> Sell 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Cheaper than the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And this is the main, if not only Reaſon, our Merchants have to complain of the ſmall Advance they make in our <hi>Plantation Trade,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:93835:10"/>our Markets are generally govern'd by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-ſell us there, and yet grow rich by it, and will do; ſo as long as they are permitted to <hi>Trade</hi> contrary to our <hi>Laws:</hi> On the other hand, let them be obliged to pay <hi>Alien</hi> Duty according to the Antient Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and fully obey the Acts of <hi>Navigation</hi> and <hi>Trade</hi> made 12, and 15 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. and then let them be able to under-ſell the <hi>Engliſh</hi> if they can; for I affirm, 'tis their breach of the Laws of the Nations they <hi>Trade</hi> in, and not their Frugality only, that is the cauſe of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in Wealth.</p>
            <p>And our Officers in ſome out-Ports, are ſo kind as to admit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited Goods amongſt others to an Entry from <hi>Holland,</hi> and thence to <hi>New-York.</hi> The firſt and only Entry that hath been made by any <hi>Jew</hi> in his own Name in any out-Port of <hi>England,</hi> follows, <hi>viz.</hi>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93835:12"/>Sir <hi>Peter Killigrew</hi>'s; I ſtayed but few hours at <hi>Penryn</hi> (the Wind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Northweſt,</hi> which was fair to ſet Sail for <hi>Holland,</hi>) but went that night for <hi>Falmouth;</hi> where I found that my Information was true, and it being <hi>Sunday</hi> the next day, I intended only to have an Eye upon the Ship, and on <hi>Monday</hi> to examine into the Truth of the whole.

               <abbr>Eſqrs</abbr> Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> appeared there as Solicitor for the <hi>Jews;</hi> and in the Council Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I produced my Opinion of Council, and 'twas concluded the Law was clear on my ſide: Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> Argued that a great part of the Goods did belong to <hi>Jews</hi> who were made Denizens, and produced two Patents of Denization, which were read by Mr <hi>John Sanſon;</hi> and in the firſt of them, the Clauſe, that they ſhould pay no more Cuſtom than <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was not Incerted and Mr. <hi>Sanſon</hi> told them, 'twas not for their purpoſe; then the other was read, in which Mr. <hi>Anthony Gomaſera</hi> and Mr. <hi>Anthony Loſado</hi> were Named and that Clauſe Inſerted; and 'twas ſaid, That would do. I immediately demanded how much of her <hi>Cargo</hi> belonged to them, but could have no anſwer: Than I was left to try the Title at Law at my own Riſque and Charge; Indeed my Lord <hi>Cheyne</hi> ſaid, That their Purſes were too Heavy for me, and that they would be too hard for me, if the Commiſſioners did not ſtand by me: But Mr. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pton</hi> (then one of the Commiſſioners) appeared openly againſt me, ſaying, <hi>I was too pe<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, and that I aimed to grow Rich at once:</hi> And at another time, few days after, when I acquainted the Board that I was told the <hi>Jews</hi> did deſign to Arreſt me, Mr. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pton</hi> ſaid, <hi>He wondred that they let me alone ſo long</hi> and would not agree to Protect me, though my Lord <hi>Cheyne</hi> offered it again.</p>
            <p>Being thus left to the wide World, I returned to <hi>Falmouth,</hi> and Mr <hi>Sutton</hi> was again come for <hi>London,</hi> leaving the Managery of his Concerns with Mr <hi>Bryan Rogers;</hi> my Attorney ſent me down a Wait of Appraiſement naming the Officers of <hi>Falmouth</hi> for Commiſſioners. Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> by Directions from <hi>London,</hi> deſired me to admit of an
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93835:16"/>Appraiſement; and that adding thoſe Goods Sworn to be on Board, beſides thoſe Entred; to thoſe which were Entred, I would conſent to paſs it, without the Charge of unloading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which (by advice) I conſented; and becauſe it ſhould be done as exactly as poſſible, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fired that the Land-wayter and Tydes-men who had been concerned in her Unloading before-hand might be Appraiſers, and then Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> giving in good Security according to Law, he might go on his Voyage as ſoon as he pleaſed; which I verily thought, as did Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> alſo, would be the ſafeſt and cheapeſt way on all ſides: But when it came to that, the perſons named for Commiſſioners would not ſtand; they had diſpatch'd the Ship Legally (as they ſaid) and would not be concerned in any other manner. So I was forced to nominate other Commiſſioners and Appraiſers, who would not Act without they ſaw the Goods, and that could not be done without unloading the Ship, which proved a very great Charge for me: In the mean time (almoſt three Weeks after my Seizure) the Commiſſioners here, order'd their Collector and Surveyor of <hi>Falmouth</hi> to admit the Guns to an Entry, which they did without my conſent, or knowledge when I came to hear it; I Proteſted againſt it, and wrote to the Commiſſioners thereof; But inſtead of an Anſwer according to Law (for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pton</hi> himſelf had ſaid the Seizure of the Guns was good) down comes a Letter to the ſaid Collector and Surveyor, with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to impart it to me, which intimated, that the former Entry was not right, either in quantity or quality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being in my Hand, they ſhould get the Merchant to make a Poſt Entry according as I ſhould adviſe them: They came to me about it, I told them the Guns were Forfeited, and the King ſhould have his Moyety of the true value, or the Guns themſelves: And I would not conſent to an Illegal Entry, come what Order there would from the Commiſſioners; On which I ſent for a Writ of Appraiſement a part for Them, and on Oath they were Appraiſed at 871 <abbr>

                  <hi>Be it Enacted by the Authority aforeſaid, that no Writ of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery ſhall be granted out of the Court of</hi> Exchequer <hi>for Goods ſeized, but upon good Security, and that for Goods

               </q> Now all men know, that <hi>Copper-Guns</hi> are not Periſhable; And 'twas the midle of <hi>Hillary Term</hi> before they were taken out of the Ship, or ſeen; and no Tryal could be brought on before the date of the Writ of Delivery, which was the laſt day of that Term; alſo many times on ſuch occaſions, ſuch Writs are diſobeyed. However I being Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, the Collector of <hi>Penryn</hi> was threatned by the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners to be caſhier'd his place, if he did not take off his Lock; which he for fear did, and mine was broken open, and the Guns forceably carried away before any Tryal was brought on for them; If any queſtion the Truth thereof, I refer my ſelf to the Commiſſioners own Letters, written to the Collector and Surveyor of <hi>Falmouth,</hi> and the Collector of <hi>Penryn</hi> on that occaſion. All the reſt of the Ships Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe (as well as Guns) was unloaden and ſecured in divers Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes at <hi>Penryn;</hi> and both ſides preparing for a Tryal againſt the next Aſſizes, and about the time half the Ships load was on ſhoar, I was Arreſted coming on Shore at the <hi>Strand</hi> of <hi>Falmouth,</hi> at the Suit of <hi>Henry Sutton</hi> in an Action of 2000 <abbr>

               </abbr> And Parties being preſently taken, I was like to be pluck'd in pieces betwixt my Friends and Foes, till Mr. Mayor came and ſecured the Peace; Then I deſired an hours time to ſend to <hi>Penryn</hi> for Bail; But 'twas denyed me, and the County Priſon being at <hi>Bodmin,</hi> almoſt 40 Miles thence; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect way was through <hi>Penryn</hi> and <hi>Truro;</hi> I was within Piſtol ſhot of my Lodging, but was not permitted by Sir <hi>Peter Killigrew</hi> (who Headed the Bailiffs and their Followers, being about 25 in number) to have my own Horſe to ride on, nor my Boots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to put on, but was ſet on an hard going Jade, with an heavy Bailiff behind me; and after ſome ſmall ſtay in the Street, Sir <hi>Peter</hi> ordered us to ride down to the Rump end of the Town, and in that going down to his Key, the Fellow by the ſteepneſs of the deſcent was forced to lean on my back, that I was hardly able with all my Strength to keep my ſelf from tumbling over the Horſes Head; thence I was conducted into a Boat filled with Bailiſſa, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Land-way being thought impaſſable by Sir <hi>Peter,</hi> and indeed (if I was not afterwards miſ-informed) he conjectured right, for the Love of the Country was ſo Much for me, and ſo averſe to the <hi>Jews</hi> and their Agent Sir <hi>Peter,</hi> that much Blood might have been ſpilt, if I had been carried in the direct way, and it had been impoſſible for me to prevent it:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93835:17"/>After I was put into the Boat, as aboveſaid, Sir <hi>Peter</hi> thought it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent either to let me ſtay there by his Key any conſiderable time, or to adventure me off without a ſtrong Convoy, he ſaw my Friends aſſemble ſo thick at his very Face on the ſhoar, that he durſt not let me come on Land again, but with all imaginable ſpeed, got two Boats loaden with men more to guard me; My Friends ſeeing it, ſent ſome in a ſmall Boat to know of me if they ſhould attempt my Reſcue on the Water: I gave them for Anſwer, that I thank'd them for their Zeal to me; but withall, that the Law muſt have its courſe; that I was ſorry ſo much trouble had been already given on either ſide, and that they could not demonſtrate their Kindneſs to me by any way more, than to let me go quietly to Priſon, and there let me hear from them: All my Friends accordingly ſubmitted, but Sir <hi>Peters</hi> jealouſy remained, for doubting the Fidelity of all thoſe men, he ſent one of his own Principal Servants to over-ſee them, and to direct Mr. Under-Sheriff at <hi>Bodmin,</hi> and the Keeper of the Goal there, to take ſuch care of me as they ought to do in caſes of the higheſt Crimes imaginable. But as ſoon as we were out of Sir <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s ſight, all my Guardians proteſted Friendſhip to me, and pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied my hard uſage, excuſing themſelves, by the Obligation their Duty and Sir <hi>Peter</hi>'s Commands bound them to; and indeed at <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony,</hi> where we Lodged the firſt night, and all our way to <hi>Bodmin</hi> we cheerfully paſt the time, having for my ſelf a juſt cauſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven me, and my Guards no doubt of an Eſcape intended by me. The next day about noon we arrived at <hi>Bodmin,</hi> where I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Keeper, but by ſo numerous a Train, that neither the Keeper, (though about 70 years old,) or any of that Town or Country, had ever ſeen the like; and every one almoſt had a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar fancy to know the reaſon thereof: Sir <hi>Peter</hi>'s Man (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Inſtructions he had of his Maſter) having ſpoke to the Under-Sheriff and the Keeper, and ſo left me.</p>
            <p>Almoſt as ſoon as they were gone, the Keeper came to me, and on my asking him, told me what directions he had from Sir <hi>Peter</hi>'s Man; But withall told me, he valued it not, neither look'd he on me as dangerous, but very frankly offered me liberty to go to the Tavern there, without any Keeper; and accordingly taking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and another old man with me of his old acquaintance, we went to the Tavern; at our coming home again, I met a ſupply of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from <hi>Falmouth:</hi> The next day Mr. Sheriff came and gave me a viſit, and the day after I was Bailed out, and immediately return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93835:17"/>to <hi>Falmouth,</hi> totally diſcharged the Ship of her Loading, and then cleared the Ship from any farther ſtop; ſoon after I was told more Writs were Iſſued out againſt me, and againſt every one that had acted by my Order, and that wherever we were in that Country no coſt would be ſpared to catch us; which indeed I concluded to be true, becauſe Sir <hi>Peter</hi> had formerly proteſted the ſame; and two of thoſe I imployed were taken, <hi>viz. John King</hi> and <hi>Thomas Chapman;</hi> who were carried to <hi>Bodmin,</hi> and there lay 10 Months in Priſon, at the Suits of Mr. <hi>Gomaſera, Loſad<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> and <hi>Sutton, King</hi> for 7000 <hi>l. Chapman</hi> for 11565 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> Some fled for fear, and others by making Friendſhip with Sir <hi>Peter</hi> were ſpar'd, though Writs had been taken out againſt all of them, and the leaſt I ever heard of, was 5000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> Therefore I thought it my beſt way to come for <hi>London,</hi> there to prepare for the Iryal; when I was come thither, the <hi>Jews</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, and treated me both with fair Offers and Threats; if I would not carry on the Tryal, they offered me 150 <hi>Guineys</hi> by Mr <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Levy</hi> the Jew hath ſince told me, would have been made 200, if I would take it: I anſwered, that I would do nothing without leave from the Commiſſioners, and that the King ſhould equally have ſhare in any Compoſition I made, but Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> preſt the contrary, ſaying, If I made an end for my ſelf, none would proſecute the Caſe any further; But I would not do it, knowing it to be contrary to Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though almoſt daily practiſed in this Port of <hi>London:</hi> On which came on our Tryal at <hi>Lanceſton</hi> the following Aſſizes, my Information being grounded on the Act of <hi>Tunnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> and the 12 Act of the <hi>Book of Rates,</hi> &amp;c. For not paying His Majeſties <hi>Alien Duty;</hi> and in caſe that point ſhould be over-ruled, I entred alſo about 30 C. weight of Ginger in the ſame Information, which had not paid any <hi>Duty</hi> at all, either by <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> to be ſure of a Verdict. All along the Goods were wholly claimed by Mr <hi>Sutton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Skinner,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Mate of the ſaid Ships till at the Tryal the aforeſaid Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of <hi>Gomaſera</hi> and <hi>Loſado</hi> was produced and read in Court, and a <hi>French man</hi> and a <hi>Jew</hi> Servants to them, Swore the whole Cargo belonged to the ſaid <hi>Gomaſera</hi> and <hi>Loſad,</hi> contrary to the Seamens Affidavit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They alſo produced a Certificate from the Cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe <hi>London,</hi> which was read, and by a Jury compoſed of one Principal and eleven Talismen, I was caſt. And I cannot but hint that it was about the time when <hi>Ignoramus</hi> Juries were in faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that to aſſiſt the King with Money was Voted a Crime.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:93835:18"/>
            <p>On which all the Goods Tryed, I ordered to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which was done; but ordered that the <hi>Guns</hi> which were not Tryed ſhould remain; however they were by force got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as I have afore-mentioned. Then, though all the Goods were thus delivered, yet the <hi>Jews</hi> Spleen was further Exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; they took out more Writs againſt me, that I could no longer remain in the Country, ſo I came for <hi>London,</hi> and Lodged in the Precincts of the <hi>Temple;</hi> thence I frequently wrote to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the Cuſtoms, giving them an Account of what had paſt, and that I was aſſured I ſhould be Arreſted in a very great Action by the <hi>Jews,</hi> if I appeared abroad; except they would Protect me: But in fine, had for Anſwer, a day appointed to appear before them, without any Promiſe of Safety; which if I did not do, they would diſmiſs me, and that in the mean time I ſtood Suſpended: When the day came on, which was in the beginning of <hi>May</hi> 1681. I was again informed that I ſhould certainly be Arreſted if I came there, I declined appearing, giving the Commiſſioners my reaſons for it; but they proceeded to diſmiſs me, according to the Reſolutions they had taken among themſelves. Then <hi>Sutton</hi> came on hard againſt my Bail; to whom, by conſent, I yielded my ſelf Priſoner, in an Action of 8000 <abbr>

               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p>And the laſt day of <hi>Trinity Term,</hi> came into the <hi>Fleet Priſon</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> where I had not been many days but ſome earneſt buſineſs called me abroad again: Mr. <hi>Warden</hi> gave me leave to go with a Waiter, and I went to the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> where I met with Sir <hi>Peter Killigrew,</hi> who appeared juſt as became a Champion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and of their Cauſe, telling me plainly, <hi>That he would make me Rot in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that I muſt never expect to come out thence till Death,</hi> &amp;c. And in the Evening I returned to the <hi>Fleet,</hi> where, in a day or two the ſaid <hi>Jews Gomaſera</hi> and <hi>Loſado</hi> lodged Writs of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> againſt me for 5000 <abbr>

               </abbr> more; ſo all that long vocation I was continued a Priſoner: But when ever I had buſineſs abroad, and applyed my ſelf to Mr. <hi>Warden,</hi> he freely gave me leave to go. When the Term was approaching, one Mr. <hi>Moraſſe</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> coming to ſpeak with a <hi>Jeweller</hi> then in the <hi>Fleet;</hi> with whom Accidentally I was in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: The ſaid <hi>Jew</hi> told me, He knew how my buſineſs had gone; and adviſed me to make Peace with the <hi>Jews</hi> at any rate; aſſuring me, <hi>That they were reſolved not to ſpare their Purſes, and that he knew when that</hi> Frenchman <hi>and</hi> Jew <hi>went down to</hi> Lanceſton <hi>to mannage the Tryal againſt me there; they carried out</hi> 1000 Guineys <hi>along
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93835:18"/>with them, and did not bring back five.</hi> Which Vaunting Speech I was not daunted at, But the Term being on, I had ſix Hearings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Barons</hi> of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and in concluſion made an end betwixt our ſelves, they giving me about 50 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> in Money, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off all their Actions; and I giving a general Releaſe to them, to their Agent Sir <hi>Peter</hi> to the Collector and Surveyor of <hi>Falmouth,</hi> and to as many more as they would Name; who for their part offered the ſame to me; but I, (as Innocent) ſcorned any: Thus was I after above 600 <abbr>

               </abbr> Expence forced to make this end with them then, not without a perfect reſolution to have another touch at them the next opportunity I could meet with: Then I endeavoured to clear my ſelf from the Debts I had contracted in Priſon, and in the Law Suits, and found that I wanted about 30 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> to do the whole. And conſidering my Impriſonment aroſe only from my Fidelity in my Imploy, I thought on Petitioning for my Sallary during my Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment; and for a further Employ; in both which I was adviſed to get an Intereſt with Sir <hi>Nicholas Butler,</hi> and accordingly I did; but thought it moſt proper to purſue my Deſigns for an Imploy firſt: And I pitch'd on ſuch an one, as none ever had had before, <hi>viz.</hi> A Commiſſion to put in Execution the following Propoſals,</p>

            <p>Sir <hi>Nicholas Butler</hi> ſeemed to be much taken with theſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, and aſſured me of his greateſt Aſſiſtance, and ordered me to make three Copies thereof for him, two wereof, he ſaid, he would give to perſons of Honour at Court, and the other keep himſelf; which accordingly he had, and for about three Months time, fair Promiſes of full Authority attended me from him, on which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended.</p>

I, that had no further imparted my deſigns than to Sir <hi>Nicholas Butler</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sanſon</hi> proteſted Ignorance in the Caſe, but Monſigneur <hi>Parent</hi> believed the <hi>Jews</hi> beyond me. Some few days after, Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> told me, He found that the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of my Propoſals would be both hazardous and difficult, and in fine would not adviſe me to undertake it, or aſſiſt me in it; But ſaid, he had thought of another Imploy for me, and that was to be his Clerk, which I accepted, and about <hi>Midſummer</hi> 1682 came to him: Then I thought I ſhould not fail of an opportunity to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure my Sallary alſo during my Impriſonment, and in ſhort time I drew a Petition to the Lords of the <hi>Treaſury,</hi> Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> promiſing to get it Read and Referred: But I had not been above two Months in his Service before an Ancient Friend of mine told me, that I muſt not expect to tarry much longer with Sir <hi>Nicholas;</hi> I could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, knowing no reaſon for it; and deſired him to tell me who he had it from and he ſaid, it was from the chief Servant of a great <hi>Wine-Merchant;</hi> who alſo gave his reaſon for it, <hi>That I ſaw too much, and that they muſt rid me thence,</hi> &amp;c. And truly I ſoon found that ſuch a deſign was on foot; for Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> who had promiſed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93835:19"/>his Friendſhip in getting my Money from the <hi>Treaſury,</hi> delayed it, though I did perpetually preſs him to make good his Promiſe in that particular, for that my Charges continued running on at the <hi>Fleet;</hi> and that I was dayly called on for ſome ſmall Debts I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in my Impriſonments, all which, that Money would then clear, and leave me about 30 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> in my Pocket. Now uſually every week, or 10 days, Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> would give me a great many Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Papers out of his Pockets to fold and lay up, and for three times following I always met my Petition amongſt them, though he had been divers times at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and promiſed to get it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd: But when I ſaw it ſo delayed, I took out my Petition and Reference from the Lords of the <hi>Treaſury</hi> my ſelf, and ſhewed it Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> firſt; he demanded how I got it, I told him, by ſome Friendſhip I met at the <hi>Treaſury Chamber;</hi> at which he ſhook his Head and Frown'd; however, fed me with fair words, ordered me to give it to Mr. <hi>Sanſon,</hi> and ſtill promiſed he would be my Friend: Mr. <hi>Sanſon</hi> told me he would Read it the firſt opportunity he could meet with, but he ſaid Sir <hi>George Downing</hi> would be my Enemy, and he would get it done when he was Abſent: This was only a put off; and do what I could it was the <hi>28th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1683, before it was read, and Sir <hi>George Downing</hi> was not only preſent, but Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man too at that time, and he diſpatch'd it, by which it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared that Sir <hi>Nicholas Butler</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sanſon,</hi> on whoſe Friendſhips I wholly depended, were the only perſons that occaſioned this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, which proved of very ill conſequence to me; for my Debt dayly Increaſed at the <hi>Fleer;</hi> and other perſons being prompted to change their Words into Actions, they did ſo, and ſerved them on me always publickly at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> or Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> his Door; and in fine, gave opportunity for Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> to tell me, that he thought it Improper to have a Servant under ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and on the other hand I ſtill preſt him for diſpatch of the Money at the <hi>Treaſury,</hi> which would clear them all: But I found that was kept from me, on purpoſe to expoſe me in that nature, and thereby force me to ſpart from Sir <hi>Nicholas,</hi> which I did about <hi>Midſummer</hi> 1683. After I was gone from him, I went to ſome that I owed Money to, who ſcorned to meddle with me, knowing how ill I had been dealt with: But my Enemies at <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> ſeeing that, and that my Report was paſt in my Favour, gave out, that I had loſt my place, and was going beyond Sea; on which Mr. <hi>Warden</hi> ſent for me, and Confin'd me again for his Debt: I told
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93835:20"/>him how my Caſe ſtood, and how my Deſign was, but at that time could not prevail for any Liberty: Sir <hi>Nicholas Butler</hi>'s Clerk came to me often (from his Maſter no doubt) and proffered me to pay the <hi>Warden,</hi> and to furniſh me with Money to go to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and there I ſhould be aſſured of a very good Imploy; I thank'd him for his Kindneſs, but reſolved to try <hi>England</hi> a little longer: But deſired him to haſten up my Report to the Lords of the <hi>Treaſury,</hi> that I might thence raiſe Money to clear my ſelf; This being at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>September,</hi> the Lords of the <hi>Treaſury</hi> were Adjourn'd till the latter end of <hi>October;</hi> as ſoon as they ſat, and the firſt day the Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms went up to meet their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, my Report was carried up, and read, but (thanks to Mr. <hi>Sanſon</hi>) he had loſt both my Petition and Reference, ſo that their Lordſhips could order nothing thereon, which did fully demonſtrate where the ſtop lay, and no remedy for me but Patience. Yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> ſome conteſt happening betwixt the Collector and Surveyor of <hi>Plymouth;</hi> I was by order of the Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms, to appear at Cuſtom houſe <hi>London;</hi> Mr. <hi>Warden</hi> of the <hi>Fleet</hi> permitted it: And after I had diſpatch'd the buſineſs they had for me, I mov'd my own concern, on which they made an Order that I ſhould draw another Petition, and to that the foreſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſhould be Affixed and carried up to the Lords of the <hi>Treaſury</hi> the next time they went up; accordingly I drew another Petition and gave it to Mr. <hi>Sanſon,</hi> and by the 22 day of <hi>March</hi> following, I got a Warrant from the Lords of the <hi>Treaſury</hi> for 62 <abbr>

               </abbr> 0 <hi>d per Annum</hi> during my former Impriſonment. Then I thought my ſelf on the brink of Liberty, and Aſſigned over the ſaid Warrant to Mr. <hi>Warden,</hi> who ſent it by one of his Servants to the Commiſſioners of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, who inſtead of paying my Money according to the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, kept both Money and Warrant, and thereon continued me a Priſoner in the <hi>Fleet:</hi> However Mr. <hi>Warden</hi> ſeeing how baſely I was dealt with, was very favourable to me in letting me go abroad when I pleas'd.</p>
            <p>But the ſame day Mr. <hi>Culliford</hi> went away for <hi>Ireland,</hi> one Mr. <hi>Plumb</hi> Servant to Mr. <hi>Prowſe</hi> Solicitor of the Cuſtoms, invited me to drink a Glaſs of Wine with him at the <hi>Mitre-Tavern</hi> in St. <hi>Pauls Church-yard;</hi> I promiſed to meet him, and did ſo, the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 1684. (having my Wayter with me,) when I came to him, he began to diſcourſe about Mr. <hi>Culliford</hi>'s going to <hi>Ireland,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:93835:20"/>and about Writs of Delivery, Notes of Recovery, and Writs of Appraiſment, which are Inſtruments much abuſed by thoſe Intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by His Majeſty for the Mannaging His Moyety of Seizures, and did particularly appear of late by the diſcovery of the great Villanies committed by <hi>Levi</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> and this very Fellow <hi>Plumb;</hi> the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination whereof was before the Commiſſioners; and though the Fraud appeared ſo plain that <hi>Plumb</hi> was forced to Re-fund about 200 <hi>Guinyes</hi> which he had cheated the King of; yet he is not only continued in his place, but was thought on for the fitteſt man to Trepan me. After we had drank two Pints of Wine, we parted; and as ſoon as I was got into the Street with my Wayter, was Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted at the Suit of the King for 17 <abbr>

            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:93835:21"/>
            <p>By this Warrant you may ſee, That though I had been very hardly thought of by the Commiſſioners themſelves, and that I had obeyed the Laws before their Letters; yet they could not chuſe but give me a good Report, owning that I acted according to Law, and upon probable Grounds; and that the Ship was unduly Cleared by the Officers of <hi>Falmouth:</hi> And that I had done good Service in Searching the Ship, and making ſuch diſcovery as I did: And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they own there was a Forſeiture, but that they did not encourage the Proſecution thereof: Upon the whole, I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to make the following <hi>Quaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt <hi>Whether an Officer of the Cuſtoms in an Out-Port, who hath taken an Oath according to the Statute</hi> 14 Car 2 (viz.) <q>[<hi>Be it hereby alſo Enacted, that all Deputies, Clerks and Servants, which now have any place or Office in or about the Cuſtoms and Subſidies, by and under the Commiſſioners, or other the Kings Officers thereof: Shall before the 1ſt of</hi> June <hi>next, take their reſpective Corporal Oaths, for the True and Faithful Execution and Diſcharge, to the beſt of their knowledge and Power, of their ſeveral Truſts and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments committed to their Charge and Inſpection; and that no perſon or perſons ſhall hereafter be Imployed or put in Truſt in the buſineſs of the Cuſtoms, until he ſhall have firſt taken his Oath as aforeſaid.</hi>]</q> 
               <hi>Is obliged to Act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Oath, to his Knowledge and Power; or on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſubmit to the Pleaſure of the Commiſſioners grounded on falſe Suggeſtions, or Private Humour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I make this <hi>Quaery,</hi> becauſe the Commiſſioners firſt Letter was grounded on the falſe Allegations of the <hi>Jews</hi> and their Agents; and it was carried on, on the private Humour (and perhaps Intereſt too) of Mr. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pton</hi> and a certain Clerk Aſſiſtant.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Whether after Goods are legally Seized by an Officer, and conſequently are in the hands of the Law, can be admitted to an Entry by the Commiſſioners without the conſent of the Officer, and without Proſecution according to Law,</hi> 14 Car. 2. viz. <q>
                  <hi>And that no Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93835:22"/>or Officer ſhall be ſuffered to Compound under one Third of the Appraiſed value, upon loſs of his Office.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I make this <hi>Quary,</hi> becauſe the King loſt by the Commiſſioners admitting three <hi>Guns</hi> to an Entry a Month after I had Seized them, 428 <abbr>

                  <hi>d.</hi>
               </abbr> if the Commiſſioners or <hi>Jews</hi> do not make it good.</p>
            <p>Third, <hi>Whether the Commiſſioners are not both by the Law, and by their Places, obliged to Encourage and Aſſiſt their Inſeriour Offices in the due Perſecution of Forfeitures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I make this <hi>Query,</hi> becauſe by the Commiſſioners not Encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging or aſſiſting me in the Proſecution of the Forfeiture of all the <hi>Jews</hi> Goods in this Ship; the King loſt His Moyety, which was at leaſt 2500 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> more, and ſo much I loſt by it my ſelf.</p>
            <p>I expect that divers perſons whoſe Hands this may come to, will blame me for being ſo Severe with my Maſters; But I hope they will ſuſpend that, when they are aſſured that I have already been a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner almoſt 4 years, and on no other account, than for the Faithful Diſcharge of my Truſt; that the greateſt time thereof is occaſion'd by the Non payment of the Money ordered me, and that it hath coſt me about 800 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> beſides, in diſcharging the Ship of her Lading, in Law Charges, and Expences; and conclude with me, that 'tis more Reaſonable, as well as more Conſcionable for them to make me ſome kind of Requital for my Zeal in His Majeſties Service, than ſtill to Perſecute me for it.</p>
            <p>And though theſe Proceedings look like an Act of the whole Board, yet I am perſwaded that no particular Commiſſioner all along, except Mr. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pton</hi> and Sir <hi>Nicholas Butler,</hi> had, or hath any private diſ-reſpect for me, but that what they have Ordered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me, hath flown from the Character one of them, or Mr. <hi>Sanſon</hi> hath given of me: And I believe alſo, that none except the aforeſaid perſons, and ſome others uſually concerned with <hi>Levi</hi> the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93835:22"/>
               <hi>Jew,</hi> in abuſing the King in His Moyety of Seizures, do as much as know of my being taken from my Wayter at the <hi>Fleet</hi> and clapt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Compter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am only to add, that the way to prevent the Deſtruction of our <hi>Plantation Trade,</hi> is for the Commiſſioners, and all other Officers concerned to put our wholeſome Laws in Execution, and for all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants, and Maſters or Commanders of Ships, to make exact Entries or Reports; and then of neceſſity our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Traders thither will riſe as faſt as the <hi>Jews:</hi> On preſſing this Truth in many Companies, I never met more than one Objection, and that was this.</p>
            <p>Objection, <hi>The</hi> Jews <hi>are a very Rich ſort of People, their Trade is very great, they Imploy many Ships.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And ſhould that be cut off, abundance of People, both here and the</hi> Plantations, <hi>would ſoon feel the want of them. Moreover, the King would be much leſſened in His Cuſtoms, by breaking off their Trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> A multitude of <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> have Money lying by them, which they would w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>llingly Imploy in Merchandizing, had they any Encouragement; and you may be aſſured that the Vending of our own Product and Manufacture, as well as the Conſumption of Forreign Commodities would not be leſſened one jot, if there were not one <hi>Jew</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> Nay, if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> found Encouragement, it might be expected their Expence would be according; and ſo a greater Conſumption would follow, and conſequently an <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dvance of His Majeſties Cuſtoms.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Plantations</hi> will never want a Supply from <hi>England</hi> and from <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> if any Encouragement can be given to the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers thither, which can never be as long as <hi>Aliens</hi> are able to Under-ſell them both Out and Home; and the <hi>Plantations</hi> are Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified as much as <hi>England;</hi> For the Growth and Product of the <hi>Plantations</hi> equally ſuffer by their Sale in <hi>Europe,</hi> as doth the Growth Product and Manufacture of <hi>Europe</hi> in the <hi>Plantations.</hi> And for His Majeſties Cuſtoms they cannot be leſſened, for the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the <hi>Plantations</hi> (except what they make uſe of themſelves)
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93835:23"/>muſt be by Law brought into <hi>England,</hi> and Entred there: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did once arrive to this Encouragement, they would always ſupply the <hi>Plantations,</hi> with perſons as well as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, which would Increaſe the <hi>Planters</hi> there, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Bulk of their Product, the Imploy of Shipping, the Expence of <hi>European</hi> &amp; <hi>Aſian</hi> Commodities brought them from <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Negroes</hi> from <hi>Africa</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the Revenues of His Majeſty both in <hi>England,</hi> and in the <hi>Plantations.</hi>
