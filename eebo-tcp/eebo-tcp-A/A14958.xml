            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

other mens expectations, who spare not
to censure me, in point of duty, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
and question the reason, though
they apprehend not the true cause of my

to satisfie euery man) to deliuer vnto your
Lordships, and the rest of this Assembly,
briefely, (but truely) in what state I haue
liued, euer since my arriuall to the <hi>Colonie;</hi>
what hath beene the iust occasion of my
sudden departure thence; and in what
termes I haue left the same: The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because I perceiue, that since my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
into <hi>England,</hi> such a coldnesse and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolution
is bred, in many of the <hi>Aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi>
that some of them seeke to withdraw
those paime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which they haue subscribed
towards the Charge of the <hi>Plantation,</hi> and
by which that <hi>Action</hi> must bee supported
and maintained; making this my returne,
<pb facs="tcp:11959:3"/>
the colour of their needlesse backwardnes
and vniust protraction. Which, that you
may the better vnderstand, I must informe
your Lordships, that presently after my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riual
in <hi>Iames Towne,</hi> I was welcommed by
a hote and violent Ague, which held mee a
time, till by the aduice of my Physition,
Doctor <hi>Laurence Bohun,</hi> (by blood letting)
I was recouered, as in my first Letters by
Sir <hi>Thomas Gates</hi> I haue informed you.
That disease had not long left me, til (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
three weekes after I had gotten a little
strength) I began to be distempered with
other greeuous sicknesses, which succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuely
&amp; seuerally assailed me: for besides
a relapse into the former disease, which
with much more violence held me more
then a moneth, and brought me to great
weakenesse, the Flux surprised me, and kept
<pb facs="tcp:11959:4"/>
me many daies; then the Crampe assaulted
my weak body, with strong paines; &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Gout (with which I had heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
beene sometime troubled) afflicted
mee in such sort, that making my body
through weakenesse vnable to stirre, or to
vse any maner of exercise, drew vpon me
the disease called the Scuruy; which though
in others it be a sicknesse of slothfulnesse,
yet was in me an effect of weaknesse, which
neuer left me, till I was vpon the point to
leaue the world.</p>
            <p>These seuerall maladies and calamities, I
am the more desirous to particularise vnto
your Lordships (although they were too
notorious to the whole <hi>Colonie</hi>) lest any
man should misdeeme that vnder the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
name and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon excuse of sicknes, I
went about to cloke either sloth, or feare,
<pb facs="tcp:11959:4"/>
or anie other base apprehension, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
the high and Honourable charge,
which you had entrusted to my Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</p>
            <p>In these extremities I resolued to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
my friends, vvho (finding Nature
spent in mee, and my body almost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed,
my paines likewise daily encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing)
gaue me aduise to preferre a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
recouery, before an assured ruine,
which must necessarily haue ensued, had
I liued, but twenty dayes longer, in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia:</hi>
wanting at that instant, both food
and <hi>Physicke,</hi> fit to remedy such extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
diseases, and restore that strength
so desperately decayed.</p>
            <p>VVhereupon, after a long consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
held, I resolued by generall consent
and perswasion, to shippe my selfe for
<pb facs="tcp:11959:5"/>
               <hi>Meuis,</hi> an Island in the VVest Indies, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for vvholesome Bathes, there to
try what help the Heauenly Prouidence
would afford mee, by the benefit of the
hot Bath: But GOD, who guideth all
things, according to his good will and
pleasure, so prouided, that after wee had
sailed an hundred Leagues, wee met with
Southerly windes which forced mee to
change my purpose, (my body being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
vnable to endure the tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of a long voyage) and so sterne my
course for the VVestern Islands, which
I no sooner recouered, then I found
help for my health, and my sickenesse
asswaged, by meanes of fresh diet, and
especially of Orenges and Lemonds, an
vndoubted remedy and medicine for that
disease, which lastly, and so long, had
<pb facs="tcp:11959:5"/>
afflicted mee: which ease as soone as I
found, I resolued (although my body
remained still feeble and weake, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
backe to my charge in <hi>Virginia</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
but I was aduised not to hazard
my selfe before I had perfectly recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
my strength, which by counsell I
was perswaded to seeke in the naturall
Ayre of my Countrey, and so I came
for England. In which Accident, I doubt
not but men of reason, and of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will imagine, there would more
danger and preiudice haue hapned by my
death there, then I hope can doe by my
returne</p>
            <p>In the next place, I am to giue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
in what estate I left the <hi>Collony</hi> for
gouernment in my absence. It may please
your Lordships therefore to vnderstand,
<pb facs="tcp:11959:6"/>
that vpon my departure thence, I made
choise of Captaine <hi>George Pearcie,</hi> (a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of honour and resolution, and of
no small experience in that place, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
Deputie Gouernour, vntill the
comming of the Marshall Sir <hi>Thomas
Dale,</hi> whose Commission was likewise to
be determined, vpon the arriuall of Sir
<hi>Thomas Gates,</hi> according to the intent and
order of your Lordships, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill
here.</p>
            <p>The number of men I left there,
were vpward of two hundred, the most
in health, and prouided of at least tenne
moneths victuals, in their store-house,
(which is daily issued vnto them) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
other helps in the Countrey, late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
found out by Captaine <hi>Argoll</hi> by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vvith pettie Kings in those parts,
<pb facs="tcp:11959:6"/>
who for a small returne of a piece of Iron,
Copper, &amp;c. haue consented to trucke
great quantities of Corne, and willingly
imbrace the intercourse of Traffique,
shewing vnto our people certaine signes
of amitie and affection.</p>
            <p>And for the better strengthening and
securing of the <hi>Collony,</hi> in the time of my
weaknesse there, I tooke order for the
building of three seuerall Forts, two of
which are seated neere <hi>Poynt Comfort,</hi>
to which adioyneth a large Circuit of
ground, open, and fit for Corne: the
third Fort is at the <hi>Falles,</hi> vpon an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
inuironed also with Corne ground.
These are not all manned, for I wanted
the commoditie of Boates, hauing but
two, and one Bardge, in all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
which hath beene cause that our
<pb facs="tcp:11959:7"/>
fishing hath beene (in some sort) hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
for want of those prouisions, which
easily will be remedied when vvee can
gaine sufficient men to be imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
those businesses, which in <hi>Virginia</hi>
I found not: but since meeting with
Sir <hi>Thomas Gates</hi> at the Cowes neere <hi>Ports<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>
(to whom I gaue a perticular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
of all my proceedings, and of the
present estate of the <hi>Collony</hi> as I left it) I
vnderstood those wants are supplyed in
his Fleete.</p>
            <p>The Countrey is wonderfull fertile
and very rich, and makes good whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
heretofore hath beene reported of it,
the Cattell already there, are much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
and thriue exceedingly with the
pasture of that Countrey: The Kine all
this last VVinter, though the ground
<pb facs="tcp:11959:7"/>
was couered most vvith Snow, and the
season sharpe, liued without other fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
then the grasse they found, vvith
which they prospered well, and many
of them readie to fall with Calue: Milke
being a great nourishment and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our people, seruing also (in occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion)
as well for <hi>Physicke</hi> as for food, so
that it is no way to be doubted, but when
it shall please God that Sir <hi>Thomas Dale,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Thomas Gates,</hi> shall arriue in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi>
with their extraordinary supply of
one hundred Kine, and two hundred
Swine, besides store of all manner of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prouisions for the sustenance and
maintenance of the <hi>Collony,</hi> there vvill
appeare that successe in the Action as
shall giue no man cause of distrust that
hath already aduentured, but encourage
<pb facs="tcp:11959:8"/>
euery good minde to further so worthy
a worke, as will redound both to the
Glory of GOD, to the Credit of our
Nation, and to the Comfort of all those
that haue beene Instruments in the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of it.</p>
            <p>The last discouery, during my conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
sicknesse, was by Captaine <hi>Argoll,</hi>
who hath found a trade with <hi>Patamack</hi>
(a King as great as <hi>Powhatan,</hi> vvho still
remaines our enemie, though not able
to doe vs hurt.) This is in a goodly Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
called <hi>Patomack,</hi> vpon the borders
whereof there are growne the goodliest
Trees for Masts, that may be found else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
in the VVorld: Hempe better
then English, growing wilde in aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance:
Mines of Antimonie and Leade,</p>
            <p>There is also found without our Bay
<pb facs="tcp:11959:8"/>
to the Northward an excellent fishing
Bancke for Codde, and Ling, as good
as can be eaten, and of a kinde that
will keepe a whole yeare, in Shippes
hould, with little care; a tryall whereof
I now haue brought ouer vvith mee.
Other Islands there are vpon our Coasts,
that doe promise rich merchandise, and
vvill further exceedingly the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Plantation,</hi> by supply of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
helpes, and vvill speedily afford a
returne of many vvorthie Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>I haue left much ground in part ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nured
to receiue Corne, hauing caused it
the last VVinter to be sowed for rootes,
vvith vvhich our people vvere greatly
releeued.</p>
            <p>There are many Vines planted in
<pb facs="tcp:11959:9"/>
diuers places, and doe prosper vvell,
there is no vvant of any thing, if the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
can be vpheld with constancy and
resolution.</p>
            <p>Lastly, concerning my selfe, and my
course, though the VVorld may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that this Countrey and Climate,
will (by that vvhich I haue suffered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
any other of that <hi>Plantation</hi>) ill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
vvith the state of my body, yet
I am so farre from shrinking or giuing
ouer this honourable enterprise, as that
I am vvilling and ready to lay all I am
worth vpon the aduenture of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
rather then so Honourable a worke
should faile, and to returne vvith all the
conuenient expedition I may, beseeching
your Lordships, and the rest, not onely
to excuse my former wants, happened
<pb facs="tcp:11959:9"/>
by the Almighty hand: but to second
