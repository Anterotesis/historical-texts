            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So alſo do I eſteme it the dutie of the faithful in this perillous tyme, plainely to profeſſe the Lord the liueuinge God, to be the onely God in heauen a boue and in the erth beneth: leſte bi our ſilence for ſakinge hys cauſe here vpon erth, we be forſaken in his heauenly palace.

For if the hert and mouth go together, then is it ſing leneſſe, otherwiſe it is doubleneſſe and diſſembling. But there is one other ſimplicitie (as it hath bene comp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted, &amp; as the worde hath bene abuſed) which

is verie foliſhnes. This maye we cal the ſim<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plicitie, that Antichriſte woulde haue ſtyl to reigne amonge vs, and therefore his champi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, when he brought in the texte of Paulle: lefte out the principall wordes (Que eſt in chriſto) Whyche is in Chriſte, as their olde texte hath it. And thorowe out hys whole boke, he woulde driue vs to be ſimple. That is to ſaye, to folowe as we be led like blinde men: that the proude papiſticall prelates, ſtill leadeinge vs into the pitte of perdicion, abuſeing our wines and goodes, maye ſaye in their connentes. Let them alone, let them offer ſtill vnto Imeages, a pice of bread or any thinge elſe of a good intent, all is well done that is done of a good intent,</p>

For this ignorante opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that thei haue grounded in their hertes hath hitherto ſtopped the waie to all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and nowe letteth faith to be grounded and cauſeth men to continew ſtyll in their olde errowres, wythout any deſire to come out of blindneſſe. Conſider therefore (good reader) a gaynſte their blinde leſſons: that Saull was caſte from hys kyngedome, for his good intent, euen becauſe he intended to do ſacrifice vnto the Lorde, of the beſt and fatteſte of the Amalechites. And yet maye thys ſeme a gloriouſe intent.</p>
            <p>The biſhoppes of the Iewes and the I<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dolatours of al ages folowed theyr good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: euen when they put Chriſt and all hys prophetes and Apoſtles to death.

               <p>And is not thys a newe Goſpell, to teach a Sacrament to be a God? to teache that the bread (which is a vile creature) is very God, and that it ought to be worſhypped wyth all diuine honour &amp; worſhip?

That heauen muſte receyue and haue Ieſu Chriſte, vnto the tyme that all thinges be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. <note place="margin">Act. iii.</note> The wordes of that place are verie playne, for he doeth not onely make Ieſu

Chriſte a very man, as Moyſes was, whoſe nature was not to be in two places at once: but he addeth alſo theſe playne wordes. That the heauen muſte receyue thys ſame Ieſu Chriſt vnto the tyme that al thinges be reſtored. Que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oportet celum accipere vſque ad tempus reſtitutionis omnium.</p>
               <p>Thus do we procede therefore. Chriſte hath (by his departynge, his ſittynge at the ryghte hande of his father, and returnynge agayne at the tyme appoynted) ſo playnely appoynted by the ſcriptures, one onely place where we ſhall ſeeke his naturall bodie: that, ſo many of vs as wyll not ſtryue agaynſte the manifeſt trueth can not double, but that his bodie remayneth there onely, where he ſheweth hym ſelfe to be. We conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that it is contrarie to Chriſtes religion to ſeeke him vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth encloſed in a box.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſte hath ſhewed where he wyll be vntyll the daye of iudgement, that is to ſaye, at the right hande of God his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tyll that he hath made all his enemies his fote ſtole. Wherefore we can ſeeke hym in none other place, wyth ſure fayeth to fynde hym.</p>

For what ſo euer is borne of the fleſhe, is fleſhe, and therefore carnall, and no parte of our ſpiritual religion and ſpiritual byrth. You adde theſe gloſes, that inuiſibly we muſte haue this fleſhe preſent in the fourmes of breade and wine, and ſo muſte we eate the fleſhe of Chriſte really, but yet inuiſibly you ſaye. And ſhall we by inuiſible fleſhe (but yet very fleſhe) brynge lyfe vnto oureſelues, and be borne a newe agaynſte the leſſons of the ſpirite?

But here ariſeth the doubte, howe this fleſhe geueth lyfe. You ſaye by eateinge the ſame reallye, and naturally in the breade wythout any ſcripture.

And likewiſe, whan you ſaye that this fleſhe geueth life alwaies, becauſe it is inſeparably adioyned to the ſpirite: you muſt acknowledge the proprieties of theſe. ii. in ſunder, grauntinge it to be the properietie of the ſpirite onely, to geue life, according to thys text ſpiritus eſt qui viuificat: though it do (by the fleſh and dodie of Chriſte, as the onely inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and peculiar ſacrifice wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the wrath of God myght be pacified) worke in vs that be faythfull, the ſame lyfe.

Truely, the prieſtes of the olde lawe were manye becauſe death dyd take them awaye. But Chriſt becauſe he remayneth for euer, hath an euerlaſtinge prieſthode. And becauſe theyr prieſthode was vnperfect, therfore was Chriſt appoynted to be a prieſt after the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Melchiſedech, without any ſuche ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of other prieſtes, to folow in his ſteade and therfore ſayed the prophete. Thou art a prieſte for euermore, after the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedeche.</p>
               <p>The lawe of Moyſes made men prieſtes but the worde of the oth whiche was aboue the lawe, did ordein the ſonne a prieſte, made perfect for euermore. He made this preſthode perfect and fulfilled all his ſacrifices at once when he offered him ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thus do we perceiue it to be a lyeynge powre that biſhopes do chalenge in makyng theyr prieſtes.</p>
