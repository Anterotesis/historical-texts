            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>WHat miſeries the Fanatick Faction (ſo long lying like the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> as Thorns in the ſides of our <hi>Iſrael)</hi> would bring upon this Nation, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> wanted not <hi>Ezechiels</hi> Watchmen to foretel? and the Story of theſe Times hath proved their Propheſies wanted no Truth; but, <hi>Quos per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere vult Jupiter, eos dementat prius:</hi> Otherwiſe it were ſtrange to think, that of two Factions, <hi>viz. Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> mortally hating each other, diſtinctly incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated from the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and both of them deſtructive to it; the one like cunning Pick-pockets, ſhould ſet the Eyes of the people ſo buſily to look after the <hi>Religion</hi> of the other, and in the mean time rob them of their own; and by the ſame Principles (like Firebrands in the Tails of <hi>Sampſons</hi> Foxes, looking divers ways) alike endanger the <hi>Eſtabliſhed Religion.</hi> The one Faction was made moſt odious to the people, the other ſeemed moſt Religious; and the due execution of <hi>Penal Laws</hi> againſt <hi>Popiſh Recuſants</hi> hath been accounted Zeal and Juſtice: but any <hi>legal Penalties</hi> inflicted on <hi>Fanatick Recuſants,</hi> was cryed down for Cruelty and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and made the Judges reproach; nor would the people endure to hear the name of <hi>Fanatick Diſſenters</hi> mentioned in a Pulpit; which now to drown, together with their own folly in countenancing or non-conceiving the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> deſigns, the more <hi>Loyal Party</hi> have invented the new name of <hi>Round-head)</hi> the Nobility, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and generally all ſorts of people accounting the <hi>Fanatick Faction</hi> a ſimple incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate Party, well meaning People, tender Conſcienced Chriſtians, ſuch as deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved pity rather than puniſhment; little remembring our Saviours Caveat againſt Wolves in Sheeps clothing: which in <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> Fable, laying all the breach of publick Peace between them and the Sheep, upon the Dogs which were ſet to watch the Sheep-folds; till the ſeduced Sheep (for quietneſs ſake) delivering up their Keepers for a Sacrifice to the Wolves, too late found their own Folds expoſed to ſuch danger as Wiſdom might have eaſilier prevented, than it could afterward remedy.</p>
               <p>What elſe have the cauſeleſs clamours of the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> meant for this many years againſt the Biſhops and the Clergy of <hi>England?</hi> who in our Saviours phraſe of <hi>Paſce oves,</hi> watched over the Flock of Chriſt; but to ſmite the Shepherd, that ſo the Sheep might be ſcattered: Like that of <hi>Tully, Civium perditorum ſcelere pulſus à De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubris is qui illa ſervarat, Religionum Jura polluta, &amp; in Larium ſedibus edificatum eſt Templum licentiae.</hi>

till ſo well Arm'd) are become the only and moſt bloody Perſecutors, having ſlain more thouſands of Proteſtants in <hi>England,</hi> under colour for fighting for the Proteſtant Religion, than Queen <hi>Mary</hi> condemned Scores within the like compaſs of years. The truth is, the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> of <hi>England</hi> have long conceited themſelves to be the only people of God, like the <hi>Jews,</hi> (and a man might ſwear by their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they are <hi>Jews</hi> indeed, and not <hi>Chriſtians)</hi> and all other men not of their Tribe, to be the wicked of the World, and Gods Enemies, <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Amalekites:</hi> That ſo whatever favour was done to any of their Faction, they thought themſelves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beholden to any man for it; but they would ſay God Decreed them to do it, ſo that they could do no otherwiſe; and what ever Juſtice was done to any of their Tribe, was accounted cruelty and perſecution of Gods people.</p>
               <p>But whatever Injuſtice or Cruelty they acted upon their Neighbours, (better Chriſtians in good ſooth than themſelves) they called it Juſtice and Zeal for Gods Glory, fulfilling Gods Decree; and can in their Canting Language (the Language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as they ſtiled their abuſing of Scripture phraſe) flatter themſelves, that they muſt waſh their Feet in the Blood of the ungodly, and <hi>binding Kings in Chains and their Nobles with Links of Iron,</hi> ſit ſmiting their fellow Servants and fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects againſt the Law, while they pretended to Judge according to the Law: (this being the Old Character of A Fanatick, a Strangers Angel, a Neighbours Plague, a Saint Abroad, a Devil at Home) <hi>but his Children ye are</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>whoſe works ye do:</hi> The Devil was a Lyar from the beginning, and the Accuſer of the Brethren; and who have done the works of ſuch a Father you may here know, by a taſte of the Firſt Fruits (Sower Grapes of their long promiſed <hi>Canaan,</hi> a glimpſe of their Clergy-hating, the Foundation of <hi>Fanatick-Babel-Reformation:</hi> and what an Harveſt of miſery to this Nation hath followed ſuch beginnings (when Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment begins at Gods Houſe) may be gathered into Volumes by better Pens. It's enough from a private Hand (in ſuch Times as theſe) if any ſhort Copy can be ſet forth for others to follow; and to ſhew the Fanaticks that all men do not ſleep, but ſome ſtand watching ſtill to give the World warning of ſuch Hypocrites; eſpecially conſidering that is no Records of the particulars of the Tyranny of theſe Times hath been extant to the World, though all honeſt Proteſtants have much deſired it; Time indeed not bearing Truth from a Proteſtant hand.

               </head>
               <p>PRivate Intereſts and Advantages are ever the grounds of uſurped Power, and why Lay-men in this Parliament have preſumed to intermeddle with matters of Religion, and to monopolize all executive and judiciary Power in Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church (which God knoweth they never underſtood) under pretence of <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hampden</hi> (one of the prime Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees of the <hi>Fanatick Faction)</hi> hath ſatisfied the World, in his <hi>Anſwer to a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Friend,</hi> asking him why they ſo much pretended <hi>Religion,</hi> when indeed <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> and <hi>Temporal Matters</hi> were by them chiefly intended? Should we not (ſaid he) uſe the pretence of <hi>Religion,</hi> the people would not be drawn to aſſiſt us. And truly it were pity that Poſterity ſhould be left without ſome <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento</hi> of the private <hi>Intereſts</hi> and <hi>Deſigns</hi> of all ſorts of people in this Kingdom, in themſelves different, yet all concentring in this one word <hi>Reformation,</hi> to build the <hi>Babel</hi> of this Generation: Not much unlike the hatching of the <hi>Belglek</hi> Troubles, <hi>Nobilitas cum Plebe conſpirant, &amp; rem ſuam curant, dum publicam cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re videntur.</hi>

                  </note> Such deſires in calling the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> have been tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to  an Engliſh madneſs and ſuperſtition in longing for this Parliament, which all men fanſied ſuch a <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>medicamentum</hi> to each private Malady, that not any Humour in the Body Politick, or itch in the Breech of the Kingdom, but was kept clawed by Mr. <hi>Speakers</hi> Thanks, and large Promiſes of Redreſs of their Grievances: Even the <hi>London Porters Petition</hi> received much Thanks from the Parliament, and proffers of eaſing them of their Burdens. A fair opportunity had the Great Ones to work their ends over other mens Shoulders.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Court emulation (for even the Kings Houſe and his Council were poyſoned with <hi>Fanaticiſm)</hi> thought by a Parliament to remove the Favourites, that ſo upon their Ruines, themſelves (next in place) might be advanced. What alſo was the ſin of the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Strafford?</hi> (againſt whom this Parliament was ſet on fire with heat of Envy) but they being greatly loved of their King for their faithful Service to his Majeſty, the Church and their Country.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Country Nobility long diſcontented with their Court-Baniſhment, (as it were) hoped by a <hi>Parliament</hi> to new model the Court, and exchange places. To this end the Propoſitions continually clamour, that all the Privie Council, and all Officers of State may be in the diſpoſal of Parliament, that is, of Lord <hi>Say</hi> and his Faction.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:93437:4"/>
3. The Gentry of <hi>England</hi> by a Parliament (into which the Gentry uſed to be called, till of late) beſides their private Preferment and Revenge, thought (as did the Free-holders and all ſorts of people) to be eaſed of Monopolies &amp; Taxes (never remembring that they paid no Subſidies) and eſpecially of an intended Tyranny, which the Fanatick Faction, with continual Alarums, ſo drummed into the Peoples Ears, even to a Frenſie of ridiculous Fears and Jealouſies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Lecturing Houſe-creeping-Miniſters, prayed zealouſly for a Parliament; thereby hoping to ſet up their new-fangled Doctrines and Diſciples: Indeed, to divide the Church-lands amongſt their Tribe (as the pretence was of taking away the Biſhops Lands, to maintain preaching Miniſters) and to invade other Mens Livings, and to have the ſole Government of the Church in their Hands, (this is that which they call ſetting up of Jeſus Chriſt in his Throne) the World now ſee what their aim was at firſt in calling this the Parliament of their Prayers.</p>
               <p n="5">5. All ſorts of Sectaries in <hi>England,</hi> were earneſt for this Parliament, becauſe they had conſpired to pack it for their Deſigns againſt the King and the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as hereafter will be ſhown.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Common Lawyers pleaded for a Parliament, that themſelves might ſnatch an Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction into their Courts, to advance their Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Goſpel (as they have done) crying up their Idol-Law to be above the King (a Creature above his Creator:) then what are the Lawyers, who have the Law in their own Hands, the Breaſt of the Judge, or the Breaſt of the Court (as they phraſe it) is the ſupreme Power? And truly for theſe many years laſt paſt, have the Lawyers enſlaved both King and People by the Charm of Law, Law.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Country People generally fancied, that a Parliament would free them from paying of Tythes, which produced ſeveral Petitions to that purpoſe, from ſeveral Counties.</p>
               <p n="8">8. All ſorts of Trades and Companies in <hi>London,</hi> hoped for Iome encreaſe of their Trading, if a Parliament were called, and yet who more crying out againſt Monopolies and Patents, than theſe Citizens? Who are the greateſt Monopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizers in this Kingdom, and ſcarce any Incorporation in <hi>London,</hi> but had ſome Petition ready for this Parliament, with confidence that nothing muſt be denied for the advance of Trade.</p>
               <p>And all ſorts of People dreamed of an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi> and Infinite Liberty, eſpecially in Matters of Religion; nay, ſcarce any man but had ſome Deſign of Private Intereſt, excep the Ancient, Orthodox Clergy, who foreſaw what a Miſery the heighth of a Faction would bring on the Church, by a Parliament.</p>
               <p>And yet after 5 years Sitting in this ſo Idolized Parliament, no ſorts of men but have miſſed their Ends; their Miniſters eſpecially verifying that Propheſie of Dr. <hi>Bancroft:</hi>

                  <hi>by wounding the King through the ſides of the Church,</hi> as knowing well, that if they could deſtroy Monarchy in the Church (Epiſcopal Government in <hi>England,</hi> being indeed the King's Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Militia,</hi> and that moſt povverful, as commanding the Conſciences of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) by planting in Rebellion for Religion, they ſhould ſoon vveaken the Povver of the King's Temporal <hi>Militia,</hi> as vvoful Experience hath taught us; this made the Maſters of the Faction alvvays ſet up the Church as the Butt, and the Biſhops Sleeves as the White, chiefly aimed at by all ſorts of People, to ſhoot their Bolts againſt, that to have the Bovv ready bent, and the Quiver full of ſharp Arrovvs, even bitter vvords againſt the Church, grevv to be the only Wiſdom and Religion in faſhion: O ye ſcandalous Clergy, and O ye bringers

The firſt and main Engine buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into the people long before this Parliament was, That the Biſhops and the Clergy were the Inſtruments for the Kings intended Tyranny, the common ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>in Terminis</hi> was, that the <hi>Clergy are all for the King,</hi> that is, the Clergy ſeeing your Fanatick Spirit of Darkneſs, working in the Children of Diſobedience, would by their Preaching <hi>to fear God and the King,</hi> according to the Scriptures, have prevented the ruines, which they foreſaw this Faction would, and now have brought upon this Kingdom; to this purpoſe what a fiery pair of multiplying Spectacles, did the Faction put on the Noſes of the people, furiouſly looking on Dr. <hi>Manwarings</hi> Sermon, till the Face of the Body Politick began to fire, in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Parliament, not quenched even to the beginning of this, but continually kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt him, and ſome others (not above three more Divines) who preached the <hi>Kings Prerogative</hi> like Divines, if Scripture (which they ſo cry up, for their own ends) in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. or the practice of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> may be Judge, more than the Supremacy of the Lawyers would brook, or the jealous Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> could endure ſhould be true. This was the kindle-coal that the Faction bellowſed to that flame, that muſt conſume not only thoſe particular men, but even the whole Clergy, Root and Branch; as in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Feud of ſome diſcontented Lords, againſt ſome particular Biſhops, vowed revenge on the whole Church: this fire of malice, was the <note place="margin">Biſhop <hi>Roſs</hi>'s <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, 1648.</note>

ſome portion might come to their ſhares: Which publick hatred of the Clergy was not a little increaſed upon a Jealouſie, occaſioned by the Activeneſs of ſome Biſhops, and others of the Clergy, in ſeeking by Law to recover ſome Church-revenue out of the Uſurpers clutches, (otherwiſe mentioned in this Book) that they began to argue, if the Clergy ſhould advance in the Favour of the King, and the People their preaching againſt Sacriledge, may prevail to the touching of their Copyholds; and it's the unhappineſs of the Clergy, that moſt of their Lands are occupied by Men, grown too great by their Leaſes, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Farmers, and as much regreating the name of Tenants to ſuch Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords, whom they think they may command: And this bred the like hatred in <hi>London,</hi> and other Incorporations, and Neſts of the Faction againſt the City-Clergy, upon their ſuit for increaſe of Tithes in City-Livings (which are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of very ſmall value, and depend upon peoples Benevolence, a thing of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence in a Kingdom) upon the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. allowing two ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling nine pence <hi>per</hi> pound of the Rent of houſes (which Statute to evade, the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers and Scriveners have invented a plain Cheat, by a Leaſe and a Leaſe, that Houſes of 50 <hi>l.</hi> Rent <hi>per Annum,</hi> ſhall ſcarce pay 5 or 10 <hi>s.</hi> Tithe <hi>per Annum)</hi> which ſo netled the <hi>Purſe-proud Londoners,</hi> accounting Tithes but as Gift, or Alms, that they would rather ſpend at Law, or give a Lecturer of their own choice twice as much as their full Tithe came to, than pay their Dues to the Parſon (a Word made their Scoff) that <hi>Two ſhillings nine pence</hi> was an uſual Nick name for any Divine, as he walked through the Streets, though the Clergy in their moderate Rates demanded not above twelve pence per pound, and this ſeeking by <hi>Law</hi> to recover their due, was call'd (by the covetous World) <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>It is not to be imagined that the Fanaticks would conceal the ſhame of any Clergy-man, when they ſo raked each Dunghill and corner to diſcover it; but that ſuch an inſtance (if proved) ſhould have been triumphantly ſtretched, to further their glorious <hi>Reformation;</hi> and whether the party ſo accuſed, was not ſome years before this Parliament, cleared by the Juſtices of the Peace for <hi>Suſſex,</hi> who ſifted out that Fanatick Plot againſt him (as one of thoſe Juſtices told me) I refer the <hi>Reader</hi> to the then Juſtices of that County; but for a general Anſwer to that ſcandalous Libel, this Truth without queſtion may be ſaid, <hi>That not any one perſon in that Century, hath had any legal Tryal at all;</hi> but <hi>condemnati quoniam ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſati;</hi> and the Juſtice of theſe times is, <hi>ſatis eſt accuſare,</hi> otherwiſe what man in his Wits could believe, that Adulteries, Fornications, and ſuch deeds of Darkneſs could be proved (as this <hi>John White</hi> affirmeth in the Margin of his <hi>Epiſtle)</hi> by <hi>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom leſs than ſix or ſeven Witneſſes?</hi> unleſs ſo many ſaw what this vvorthy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber did with his Neighbours Wife in <hi>White Fryars,</hi> which made his ovvn Wife ſo jealous of this Mr. <hi>White</hi> her Husband: But why ſuſpition of incontinency on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from looks, as in that Century <hi>Example</hi> 49. or from leading vvomen into dark places, as <hi>Example</hi> 18. by one vvhoſe houſe ſtandeth in a dark Alley in <hi>London,</hi> or vvhy to be ſeen in company vvith <hi>Papiſts</hi> (vvhich the Lavv requires of Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) as in <hi>Example</hi> 75. and 88. ſhould be ſuch Charges and Crimes as to ruine a man and his vvhole Family, or uſed as an Argument to make the whole Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy odious, let any Chriſtian judge. I have been preſent, vvhen a grave and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Divine hath been accuſed at a <hi>Committee</hi> for an Adulterer and a Drunkard, the proof of the former was only <hi>kiſſing a Woman in the preſence of Company,</hi> and the other, was <hi>the drinking of only one half Pint of Wine;</hi> and ſo unchriſtian a ſcruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hath been made for accuſations, and pretended proofs of Crimes againſt the perſons of the Clergy, that (beſides Accuſers, and thoſe known Schiſmaticks, and Adverſaries allow'd to be both Parties, and Judges, and Witneſſes alſo.) Agents in Pariſhes have baen employed in going from houſe to houſe with Parliament Warrants, ſummoning and terrifying all Men and Women, nay Servants, (I have knovvn it) vvhom they could hear vvere acquainted vvith ſuch Miniſters; and at Committees the Neighbours and familiar Friends ſo ſummoned, have been urged <hi>ex officio,</hi> to ſpeak not only to Articles laid in <hi>Petitions,</hi> but alſo have had their Conſciences ſifted, to make them confeſs ſome Crime or Report, or ſuſpition of a Crime. If the Pariſh afforded no Evidence, nor their old Acquaintance, down they ſent (in ſome mens Cauſes) to the Univerſity to hunt out ſome Scandal, in the time of their Miniſters abode there: nor have ſome Clergy mens Lives and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93437:9"/>
Converſation from their Cradle been left unſearched (I could name particulars) to get ſomething, vvhereof to accuſe a Clergy-man at the Parliament: So that any Report of a Crime committed tvventy years before this Parliament, (as in that Century <hi>Example</hi> 58.) or before taking of <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> or being poſſeſſed of a <hi>Church,</hi> or any <hi>Crime</hi> which Juſtice had long ſince taken cognizance of, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, as <hi>Example</hi> 72. or any raſh vvords never ſo privately ſpoken, have been novv reaped up to make a Miniſters ſcandal, and the whole Miniſtery ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous. Another trick of falſe Accuſing accounted a juſt way of charging Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, vvas a fallacious vvreſting of Words, quite contrary to the ſenſe of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher: A Reverend Doctor (whom I could name) vvas accuſed in Parliament, that he had Preached about fourteen years before this Parliament, that the <hi>Biſhops when they took away the Maſs, took away all Religion;</hi> upon hearing, the Doctor produced the Sermon, and made it appear, that he Preached at that time, (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the publick Aſſizes at <hi>York)</hi> that men muſt not think that the Biſhops, when they took away the <hi>Maſs</hi> took away all <hi>Religion.</hi> Another Divine was accuſed of Popery, <hi>viz.</hi> that he had Preached, that the intention of the Prieſt, was of the <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Sacrament;</hi> when he Preached it only <hi>Hiſtoricè,</hi> and confuted the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion at the ſame time.</p>

               <p>THeſe are the Grapes of this long-promiſed <hi>Fanatical Canaan,</hi> gathered from ſuch pretended holy-Thiſtles; at whoſe growth while ſome labourers in Gods harveſt (too late repenting) connived, doubting that they were ſome weak and tender Vine-branches, and others of more diſcerning ſpirits ſeeking to weed them out, pricked their own fingers; they grew like <hi>Jothams</hi> bramble;<note place="margin">Judges 9.</note> ſuch Kings over the Trees, that they have baniſhed the Vine, and the Olive, peace and

plenty; and to plant in the ſtinking Elder, have burned up the goodly Cedars of the Church, root and branch; and the field of Chriſts wheat choaked with the tares which the envious man hath been long ſowing in this Land, now grown to their harveſt, to whoſe ſheaf (like <hi>Joſephs</hi> dream) muſt every ſheaf make obeiſance, elſe the upſtart bramble-King ſends fire to devour them, as it hath already torn the whole coat of the Clergy, as many thouſands of them can witneſs; the ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the woful premiſes of this Book: yet this Tyranny and perſecution of the Clergy is ſtiled the <hi>juſtice of Parliament,</hi> and the power of Reformation of Religion; whereof the Reader may here ſee a pattern, in the cruel ſufferings of the Clergy of <hi>London,</hi> preſented in a general Bill of Mortality, to which theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers may ſerve for a ſhort Commentary, till God ſend better days of enlarging the ſtory by a more full Collection; the very naming of the perſons in that Bill (being generally men of known honeſt Lives, and conſtant painful preaching (that the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> diſcourſing with Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> (for ſo have the engaged Nobility proſtituted their honour to the Courting of each <hi>Fanatical</hi> Lecturer and <hi>Pedant,</hi> of whom indeed they ſtand in awe) about the ſupplying of above fifty Churches in <hi>London</hi> void of Miniſters, told Mr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> that they muſt reſtore ſome of the Sequeſtred Clergy of <hi>London;</hi> to which Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> replying, God forbid; the Earl ſaid, unleſs they did ſo, the Parliament could not find men of abilities to preach in <hi>London:)</hi> The naming (I ſay) of thoſe men were enough to ſhame <hi>the Father of Lyes,</hi> and his <hi>Fanatical Sons</hi> (were not both paſt ſhame) and to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the reſt of the abuſed Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> (as well ſure as the Perſonal faults of ſome few (and thoſe very few) be made the ſcandal of the whole Function) and yet who ſo cruelly perſecuted as theſe <hi>London-Divines?</hi> will ye know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof? The <hi>Fanatical</hi> deſign growing high, pitched upon three main en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines to compleat their work, <hi>vid.</hi>
the ſetting up the Militia, the ſeiſing of the Navy, and the planting in of Lecturers, and it's hard to ſay which of theſe three have done their new Maſters beſt ſervice; this laſt being the ready way to obtain the two former; whereunto much conduced the feigned <hi>fears</hi> and jealouſies rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Faction in the City; as alſo by ſeveral Votes and Declarations of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of Forreign invaſions from abroad, and ſecret dangers at home, no ſooner bruited abroad than believed, by a people deceiving and willing to be deceived; whereby the Faction in Parliament deſiring a Guard, refuſed the Trained Bands of <hi>Middleſex</hi> (profer'd by the King to ſatisfie their fears) confiding rather in the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> purpoſely to engage that City to maintain them in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wickedneſs they ſhould act; their chiefeſt care being to make ſure of <hi>London,</hi> (the head and fountain of this proud and cruel blood-thirſty Faction:) therefore to keep and encreaſe this power in the City, they knew <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Calf-policy in altering Religion, and the Prieſthood, would be neceſſary for their plot of a new Government: to which purpoſe they at firſt invented theſe tricks and formalities of Juſtice againſt the Clergy, till having got the power, their Sword ſhould make good the Sequeſtring and Removal of thoſe (eſpecially in <hi>London)</hi> who were not like to Apoſtatize from Religion and Loyalty, in ceaſing to preach to the people to fear God and the King, according to the Scriptures; hereby making way to plant in their own Creatures, and Miniſters to deifie the Calves of their own ſetting up; this made the Faction in the Houſe of Commons never to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any Bills againſt any particular accuſed Clergy-man to the Houſe of Peers (where indeed lay judiciary power) to a Legal hearing; but knowing well ſuch foggy charges would ſoon vaniſh at the face of Juſtice, theſe evil ſpirits kept on their courſe of caſting miſts before the peoples eyes, to make them think that the lights of the Church burned ſo dimme, that it was neceſſary to ſnuff them, or quite put them out: This is the true reaſon of their cruelty towards the <hi>London-</hi>Clergy, and indeed to the whole Clergy of <hi>England;</hi> and this wicked policy drew on this ſad ſtory following.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of Parliamentary changes in Religion. Of the Policy and ways for the deſtruction of Religion by this Parliament, wrought by the long conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy and combination of the Puritans of</hi> England, <hi>here laid open.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BUt what ſafety can be to <hi>England,</hi> when Lay-Parliaments ſhall preſume to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in Religion; hanging Reformation of Religion as a Curtain to the Parliament-windows, making it the Stalking-horſe to their temporal ends and by reſpects, the ruines of Three Kingdoms in our days, can ſufficiently witneſs; changes of Religion being ever the Laities puniſhment, as well as the Clergies affliction; as might be proved by the Engliſh ſtory, ever ſince Parliaments have been but inſtrumental or active thereunto. <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th begat the policy, to whoſe Luſt and Tyranny how ſoon did the Parliament turn Pander? covering many a foul fact under the fair face of Reformation; burning Papiſt and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant both at one Stake, by Bill in Parliament without any Tryal. <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th (of Nine years old) his Parliaments twice altered Religion, according to the two  Grandees <hi>Sommerſet</hi> and <hi>Dudley.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">R. Barns. T. Gerrard. S. Jeroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</note> In the firſt of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> the Parliament pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the ſame Religion by Fire, which themſelves had ſo lately eſtabliſhed. Upon coming in of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Parliament changed Religion again; and, within few years, made it death for a Prieſt to reconcile any man to that Religion; which Parliaments had ſo zealouſly reſtored, that in the ſpace of twelve years, four changes of Religion were made by Parliaments in <hi>Englond,</hi> more than ever were made by any Chriſtians throughout the world in 1500 years before. But what policy in the Laity drew on thoſe contrary changes, and what miſeries this Nation felt thereby, may afford more truth, than theſe times can bear, and therefore is omitted. Yet in all theſe Parliaments was the ſtamp of juſt, that is, Royal Authority, (though how juſtly executed I ſay not) and therefore ought to be obeyed <hi>active</hi> or <hi>paſſive;</hi> nor in any of theſe Parliaments (or ever ſince, till this Parliament) were the Clergy (one of the three Eſtates of the Realm, the beſt conſervators of Religion) quite excluded with convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Clergy, though legally choſen by the Kings Writ, (not forced up out of a Renegado houſe-creeping Miniſtry by Lay-votes) who had the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary cognizance of matters of Doctrines, as one hath obſerved in a diſcourſe to anſwer the Popiſh Slander caſt upon our Religion, that it is a meer <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Religion:</hi>
Though it cannot be denied but that fury againſt the preſent Clergy, becauſe they would not comply with the prevailing party, to extol the preſent Change, and in later Parliaments, the Puritan-policy having influence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon Court-counſels, have too much bound up the power of the Keys, and left the Clergy little liberty, but to grant Subſidies: But never did the Laity in Parliaments graſp at the power of the Keys, till the Puritans getting ſtrength in the Houſe of the Commons, nibled at the Church-power, under the name of a Lay-Committee for Religion, which King <hi>James</hi> connived at, little thinking whereto that ill example would grow in his Son's days, hanging St. <hi>Peters</hi> Keys at Lay-mens girdles, thereby (as we now ſee) locking up the Prieſts lips, and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up Church-doors to the ſequeſtring of Almighty God from his holy Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations; and by an Army of Subjects in rebellion againſt their King, taking away the daily Sacrifice out of the Temple, for the Reformation of Religion, the old pretence to colour politick deſignes, thereby to take away the ſhame of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

cruelty ſhall be acted to advance the ſame; never remembring that of St. <hi>Paul, We muſt not do evil that good may come of it.</hi> What fit Judges of Religion Parliaments have been, and are like to be, let us hear again Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Proteſtant Martyr, when it was objected to him that he ought to be a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, becauſe the Parliament had eſtabliſhed the Popiſh Religion: <q>Of what force (ſaith he) are Parliaments, which eſtabliſh contrary Decrees, condemning that for evil, which before they had eſtabliſhed as good? and the Parliaments of later times have been ruled by the fancy of a few. <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th eſtabliſhed what he pleaſed by Parliaments. In <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th, the Dukes of <hi>Somerſet</hi> and <hi>Northumberland</hi> bore all the ſtroke, and did not all things ſincerely.</q> And for the Parliaments of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> what by her politick moulding of the Parliament, and her infinite popularity, and her Armies, who durſt Vote againſt her pleaſure? Beſides (as one obſerveth) her Parliaments conſiſting of grave men did do the Queens work, and in that, the Kingdomes buſineſs; no thoughts of oppoſing Prerogative under pretence of Property, or diſtinguiſhing between the ſervice of the Crown, and of the Commonwealth, as two divers (yea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) things, till the Fanaticks began to make Parliaments as Cock-pits, and pitched fields for fighting againſt the King and the Church, under the notion of ſtanding up for the Subjects Liberty; which made King <hi>James</hi> ſay that <hi>he could never find any joy in his Parliaments,</hi> calling them in ſcorn and anger, <hi>Five hundred Kings:</hi> And the wiſe Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> (lately deceaſed) then propheſied, that <hi>Poſterity would have cauſe to curſe thoſe Fanaticks in former Parliaments, who upon ſuch undutifulneſs cauſed their breach;</hi>of which, as alſo of the Parliaments of King <hi>Charles,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Naunton</hi> hath obſerved, <q>That half a dozen of popular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented perſons, ſuch as (with the fellow that burned the Temple of <hi>Diana)</hi> would be talked of, have ſwayed all the Parliaments, as Lord <hi>Say,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pym, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bden, Stroud,</hi> and other Parliament-drivers, as the Army Declarations ſtiled the XI.</q> Presbyterian Impeached Members, who have lived to ſit in this Parliament, to ſee the flames of their own kindling almoſt conſume the Church, and theſe three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, by their reviving <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi>'s ſtrange Fire, by their preſumption in medling with matters of the Church, to the ſubverſion of Religion, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Reformation; which how politickly wrought by the long combination of an hypocritical Faction, we come now to ſpeak of, more particularly.</p>

than they deſerved, as we now ſee) that to permit the other, was counted the beſt way to cure this; and as it ſever hapneth, the common hatred of any Faction, gives great advantage to its contrary: So now the <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> full glad of ſuch an occaſion, began buſily to revive their ſuſpended hopes of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, ſtrengthned alſo by their united brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as that in all Parliaments ſince, through King <hi>James</hi>'s too much love of peace, and Archbiſhop <hi>Abbots</hi> affected popularity, upon ſome Court-disfavour, and by other Courtiers emulation, by the ſubtelty and hypocriſie of the Faction; they have gained ground, till they have driven the Church and the King out of Three Kingdoms, by the Engine and name of Parliament, to cover their Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Combination and Conſpiracy, which they have been ſo long contriving, to raiſe to its height by theſe means following: By incorporating themſelves into a Church as diſtinct from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the Papiſts have been; they have ſet up an upſtart Miniſtery of Lecturers; they made publick collections of Monies for their ſilenced Miniſters, under pretence of poor Miniſters; they have had their Feoffees intruſted with great ſums of Monies, raiſed among themſelves for furtherance of their deſigns; witneſs the plot of buying out of Impropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to plant in men of their own Tribe; to whom St. <hi>Antholins</hi> in <hi>London</hi> was the Nurſery: they had their mutual intelligence throughout the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ingroſſed almoſt all the inland Trade to men of their Faction; they took up a canting language to themſelves, which they called the Language of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> abuſing phraſe of Scripture, thereby to underſtand one another, to colour their ſeditious practiſes; they had their Emiſſaries (whereof ſimple <hi>Robin</hi> the Bible-Carrier was one) or Scouts to give notice where men of their Tribe preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that not any one of their Miniſters could come to <hi>London</hi> from the fartheſt parts of <hi>England,</hi> but found entertainment in the City; for whoſe Randevouz a Widow (whom Alderman <hi>Pennington</hi> Marryed) kept an Ordinary in <hi>White-Friars,</hi> where many of them lodged in Doctor <hi>Preſtons</hi> days; and when any of theſe preached in any place in <hi>London,</hi> or thereabouts, they wanted not a crowd of followers.

               <p>Theſe, and many other practices in the like kind, may ſhew the world, what a free Parliament this was from the beginning, and how God had infatuated this Nation, that they would not ſee this jugling, nor believe the Clergy, who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the miſeries this Faction would bring to this Church and State; but to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a ſmall number (the little flock of Chriſt, they were wont to call themſelves) to ride the whole Kingdom to deſtruction: for notwithſtanding all this ſhuffling and packing, when this Parliament firſt met, the <hi>Fanaricks</hi> for number made not above the third part of the Houſe of Commons; and I am confident, that in the City their Faction was not a fifth part, and thoſe of the younger and meaner ſort, but infinitely buſie at an Election of a Common-Councel-man in <hi>Langborne-Ward,</hi> wherein are above three hundred Houſholders (and from ſuch meetings none of the Faction would be abſent) yet could they not make up ſixty in all that Ward: Some years after, above 14000 Houſe-keepers in <hi>London,</hi> were liſted in the deſign of <hi>Tompkins</hi> and <hi>Challoner,</hi> though they wanted ways to communicate their ſtrength one to another.

But this trick made the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not yet abſolute Maſters of the Vote in the Houſe of Commons; which put their Members to wonderful pains and trouble, by continual attendance, ſitting in the Houſe till midnight to watch to carry a Vote, when other Members wearied out, were departed the Houſe, that ſo they might compaſs by diligence, what they could not obtain by their numbers of their perſons: [The firſt Remonſtrance of the Houſe of Commons againſt the King, voted in the Houſe at midnight,] this made divers of them let out their Houſes in their Countries, (which upon the Act of continuance they afterwards ſold) and take (ſequeſtred) houſes in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> that they might be near their work, having their Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries conſtantly attending the door of the Houſe of Commons, to call in Members of this Faction to vote what they pleaſed, to advance their deſign, upon notice of a ſmall appearance in the Houſe; but if any appointed buſineſs cauſed a fuller Houſe, their daily ſitting had made them expert in diſcerning the face of the Houſe, to know their own ſtrength, how the Vote would be at that time; the Faction having made Mr. Speaker (a Lawyer) ſure their own [by a Fee of 6000 <hi>l.</hi> voted to him, and made Maſter of the Rolls] would either by ſome pretended Forreign Letters, made by themſelves in <hi>London,</hi> or by ſome new diſcovery of a Plot againſt the Parliament, or elſe by long Speech-makings, defer the buſineſs of the day, till the abſence of the reſt of the Members; ſome following their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, others their private neceſſary affairs, little dreaming of making a Trade by ſitting in Parliaments, as in their Shops or Counting-houſes (whereas Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments like Phyſick purge, if ſeldom uſed, but deſtroy, when continued as food) ſhould make way for this vigilant Faction to carry the Vote, by the Major part preſent; having embodied themſelves in the Parliament and Kingdom for their work, and eſpecially in <hi>London,</hi> by daily Tavern-clubs in each Ward, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating intelligence to and from their Table-Juncto's, or Sub-Committees ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in divers private houſes in <hi>London,[Brownes</hi> houſe a Grocer neer <hi>Cheapſide</hi> croſs; alſo a Drapers houſe in <hi>Watling-ſtreet;</hi> as now the Saracens head in <hi>Friday-ſtreet,</hi> &amp;c.] to prepare Reſults of each days paſſages in the City, to report to Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> and his cloſe Committee; when they came from

By theſe and many other advantages, it's eaſie to conceive how a combined Faction may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome a far greater number, when ſingle and hood-wink'd from perceiving plots of deſtroying Religion and the King, by thoſe who by Votes, and Declarations, and Proteſtations, pretended to make the King a glorious King; and counted it a great ſcandal to them, that it ſhould be reported they intended to take away the Liturgy, which they deſired onely in ſome things ſhould be reformed, employing ſome Biſhops and others of the Clergy, to conſider of what things might be altered for ſatisfying tender Conſciences, that many of the Clergy alſo, as well as other Subjects well-willers to the King, were ſo poſſeſſed, that though they ſaw Arms raiſed againſt the King, and all his Forts, Ships, and Revenues ſeized on in defiance of his Majeſty, yet would they not believe that the Parliament intended the King any hurt or evil at all; yea, divers were not diſpoſſeſſed of this fond credulity, till the Votes of impriſoning and of no further addreſſing to the King were publiſhed: And now when they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther help themſelves, nor their King, cry out upon Hypocrites, and ſay, they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believe Parliaments any more; though it's not ſafe for them to ſay ſo, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere more they think, ſuch is now the liberty of the Subject; and indeed ſo willing were the major part of the Houſe of Commons to be lulled aſleep into a pleaſing dream of Reformation, by clipping the wings of Prerogative, and paring the Biſhops nails, and taking down the pride of the Clergy (as the Fanatick buzzed pretences were) to which all parties were marvelouſly ready (like the Horſe in the Fable, yielding his back to the Saddle to be rid of the Deer, that he might have all the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture) and by extolling the honour and authority of that Houſe, whereof themſelves were alſo Members, till the Faction by planting in their Inſtruments for Chair-men of Committees, and into all places of action, ſo rid the more moderate party of the Houſe beyond their own ſtay; who now grown weary, and feeling the Spur in their own ſides, began too late to take heed, and to think to ſhake off their hot-Spur-riders; but indeed threw themſelves out of their ſo-longed-for Parliament: for upon any Speech or Motion contrary to the ſence of the Faction, the parties moving were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led preſently to the Bar, or committed to the Tower, or expelled the Houſe; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were terrified hereby, or by the Tumults out of the City, led up by Dr. <hi>Burges</hi> and Capt. <hi>Ven</hi> to the Parliament-doors, to ſee that the <hi>Godly Party</hi> (for ſo their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was called) in the Houſe might not be out-voted.

The Biſhops and Popiſh Lords thus thrown out of the Parliament, and the reſt of the Royal Nobility terrified, were forced to withdraw themſelves from the Parliament, leaving the Vote of the Houſe of Peers to the Faction galloping in its fury: yet for all thoſe affronts done by the City-Tumults at the Parliament-doors (to ſhew how truely it hath been ever ſaid of the Fanatick, That he will not Swear, but he will Lie) as alſo the aſſaulting of that Loyal Lord-Mayor's houſe, by the ſame Tumults in the midſt of the City; <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Rich.

By theſe means the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical Faction in the Parliament having conquered the Vote of both Houſes, and forced the King to fly, began ſoon to declare their Legiſlative power, in publiſhing their imperative Vote, That the Subjects of <hi>England were bound to obey the Ordinances of both Houſes of Parliament as a Law, in caſe the King ſhould deny his Royal Aſſent.</hi> But knowing ſuch Votes were not like to find univerſal obedience, as their deſignes required, the next and laſt thing they entred upon, was power to execute thoſe Votes, which their ſucceſs (by the late Tumults ready for a War) heightned them to demand, under pretence of putting the Militia of the Kingdom into ſuch hands as the Parliament, that is, the Fanatical Faction, ſhould think fit; which to obtain, one would think it might ſpend the faith of a Chriſtian to believe, what ridiculous fears and jealouſies of Invaſions from abroad, and ſecret dangers at home, were ſuddainly bruited by the Faction up and down the Kingdom; [Fears of Invaſions by the <hi>Danes,</hi> by the <hi>French,</hi> by the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> fears of Papiſts in <hi>London,</hi> when the Faction knew they had ſcarce left one in the City but in Priſons: Mr. <hi>Pym</hi>'s Plague-plaiſter; the diſcovering of a Plot by a Taylor in a Ditch; fears of blowing up the <hi>Thames</hi> with Gun-powder to drown the City and Parliament; the Houſe of Commons fired by

It were endleſs to reckon up the multitudes of ſuch Lyes and ridiculous Fears] As alſo to think how ready people were to frame themſelves to a belief thereof, as given up to believe lies even with greedineſs, when indeed the deſigne onely was for this Faction, hereby to raiſe an Army, to execute whatſoever themſelves ſhould conceive would advance their Plots of ſubverting Religion and Government of this Church and State, under the ſpecious colour of Reformation of all grievances whatſoever, whereby they drew in to their aſſiſtance the Patriotical party alſo, who were the far greater number through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kingdom; whoſe pulſe beating wholly after Property (deſiring deſtruction nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of King, nor Biſhop, but onely reformation of conceived exceſs of power) was kept continually affrighted by alarms from the Faction, that the King would make his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects all Slaves; which to prevent, they thought themſelves neceſſitated to uphold this Parliament in any thing which they ſhould act, though never ſo abominable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, for fear if this Parliament ſhould be diſſolved, they ſhould never have any more Parliaments; and theſe men once unhappily engaged, eſpecially the <hi>Londoners,</hi> by vaſt ſums of money, which the Parliament had politickly drawn them to lend, were bound to follow the Fanaticks madneſs, onely to ſecure themſelves and their publick-Faith debts; inſomuch, that upon the burning down the Exciſe-houſe in <hi>Smithfield</hi> in the year 1647, by the rude Multitudes in the City, about the time of the King's coming to <hi>Holdenby,</hi> it's ſtrange to think, how theſe moderate men (formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to have the King come to <hi>London)</hi> were ſuddainly ſo affrighted with fears, that if the King came nearer <hi>London,</hi> ſurely the people would pay no Exciſe nor Taxes, then how ſhould their Publick Faith-debts be paid? and gave advantage to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in the name of the City, to petition the Parliament, that his Majeſty might not come nearer <hi>London,</hi> upon ſome pretences laid in that Petition; but Money was the bottom of the buſineſs; hoping by delay to make ſome ſurer bargain with their King: but now too late they ſee their folly.</p>
               <p>Thus by Hypocriſie, Fraud, and Violence, miſguiding the Patriotical party, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks of <hi>England</hi> grew ſo powerful, raiſing an Army, which of themſelves they could never have done, now commanded by moſt confiding Sectaries, which the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens at firſt thought ſo inconſiderable; ſuppoſing, though they let them run on to do the work, (which they alſo deſired, in reforming State-diſtempers) they could quell them at pleaſure; perſwaded alſo that the War ſhould laſt but one Moneth, (as Mr. <hi>Hamden</hi> told ſome Citizens) but now they have lived to ſee the Banners ſix years diſplayed, to plant in what Religion ſoever the ſtrongeſt party of Sectaries with their Sword ſhall make good, (upon hopes of gain, or fear of loſs, not likely by Citizens to be oppoſed) and all other men in proſecution of their own (diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent) ends, are forced to ſerve for Stales and Blindes for the Fanatical Maſters to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the King and the Church, by the loſs of the liberty and property of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, on which all parties ſo doted: and no ſooner had the Faction their deſires of an Army raiſed for their ſervice, but preſently they began to execute their long dormient Votes of ſcqueſtring the Clergy from their Livings; and by an inſolent thing, called an Ordinance of Parliament, (repealing five Acts of Parliament, made in ſeveral Kings Raigns) utterly aboliſhed the ſacred Liturgy, the whole ſervice of God out of the Church, planting in room of it, a new nothing, a ſenſeleſs Rubrical Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that will ſerve all ſorts of Religion, but the true Religion, which to deſtroy this new Engine was purpoſely invented; meerly upon this wicked policy (though other frivolous pretences are alleadged in the Preface to that new-fangled Directory.) <note place="margin">The poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy.</note> Firſt, becauſe in the Liturgy were more Prayers for the King than would conſiſt with their  Traiterous ends. Secondly, the aboliſhing of the Liturgy took away the daily ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God in Cathedrals, and made them of no uſe; a fair way to take away the

Land of Deans and Chapters. Thirdly, the <hi>Scots</hi> called in for their aſſiſtance in time of need, as alſo to engage all ſorts of Sectaries to their aid againſt the King.

               <p>Thus (as the State-Affairs) in the Church came this change, or rather deſtruction of Chriſtian Religion in <hi>England;</hi> like the great Beaſt in <hi>Daniel, to whom an Army was given, by reaſon of tranſgreſſion, whereby it took away the daily Sacrifice, and threw the truth to the ground, and it practiſed and proſpered;</hi> but what miſeries have followed ſuch policy, not onely the perſecution of the Clergy, but the ruine of the Laity of our times can ſufficiently witneſs, groaning under all ſorts of calamities, that War and Rapine, and Tyranny can bring upon a Nation, when like the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> there was no King in <hi>England,</hi> but a myſterious gunpowder-clouded King and Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Faction and Conſpirators fighting againſt God and the King, under colour of King and Parliament, the Riddle of this Generation; three times altering (they call it purging) the Houſe of Commons of Monopoliſts, Malignants, and Presbyterians, to obtain the Vote, and by a poſt-vote juſtifying three notorious Symptomes of a wicked Faction, <hi>viz.</hi> the publiſhing an Order of inviting accuſations againſt the Clergy, in the name of the Houſe of Commons, which the Houſe had not cognizance of; the keeping the King out of <hi>Hull</hi> by Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> which the Houſe knew not of; and the impriſoning the King in the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> by <hi>Hammond,</hi> for which he had no public korder, but the ſenſe of this Faction, or ſome private directions from the Army.</p>

And when the Faction had thus plundred and ſequeſtred the Clergy of all their Eſtates for ſome years, another fit of perſecution was raiſed againſt divers of them from Goldſmiths-hall and Habberdaſhers-hall, upon compoſition of their Temporal Eſtate, where the Clergy were ever moſt ſpitefully uſed by thoſe cruel Committees; the Laity compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for two years value, but the Clergy ſeldom came off without four or five years: purchaſe of their own Lands and Eſtate. And becauſe I intend not to ſwell into too big a Volume, I'll give you but one inſtance of the proceedings of Habberdaſhers-hall-Committee towards <note place="margin">To Dr. <hi>Martin</hi> they ſent a Ticket in Priſon at <hi>Ely-</hi>houſe, who deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to take the twentieth part, ſo that they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to ſend him the remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen parts of that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate which they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him to have.</note> a Clergy-man, to whom a Ticket was ſent for 240 <hi>l.</hi> as the  twentieth part of his Eſtate; he coming within the ten days limited in their Tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets to the Committee for Mitigation, proffering his Oath that all his Eſtate real and perſonal was not worth 200 <hi>l.</hi> could not be admitted to his proteſtation, but was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Committee of Lords and Commons for advance of Moneys; whither applying himſelf, the Door-keeper told him, that he muſt not enter in till he was called. Thus attending <hi>de die in diem,</hi> the ten days were expired, without his being called, or his obtaining leave to paſs the firſt or ſecond doors, which were duly locked by their Officers: Hereupon, according to the great Juſtice of Committee-Orders, and Parliament-Ordinances, he fell by courſe into their Meſſengers hands as their priſoner (though at large) for not making an end within the ten days. After ſome weeks dancing attendance, and feeing a Lawyer, his Petition was read; to which was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed an <hi>Affidavit,</hi> that his whole Eſtate was not worth 100 <hi>l.</hi> The Anſwer of the Committee was, That until he ſhould bring in the one moity of his Aſſeſſment, <hi>viz.</hi> 120 <hi>l.</hi> according to the cuſtom of that Committee, he ſhould not be heard; which he not able to perform, was ſent for by their Purſuyvants, and upon his Petition was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to bring in 50 <hi>l.</hi> and then to be further heard. After ſome delay, he moved again, and was ordered to give preſent ſecurity to bring in 20 <hi>l.</hi> the next Committee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, or elſe to priſon he muſt go preſently; which to prevent, he was forced to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row 20 <hi>l.</hi> and accordingly depoſited it, petitioning to be admitted to his proteſtation: But the Committee told him, they muſt obſerve Rules, and ordered him to give ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for the other 30 <hi>l.</hi> to be brought the next ſitting, or elſe he muſt go to priſon, telling him, that if he were not worth ſo much, when he came to hearing the money ſhould be returned to him again: whereupon he was again forced to borrow 30 <hi>l.</hi> more, which he brought in accordingly; but upon hearing was told, that though the Ordinance did admit all men, yet the cuſtom of that Committee did not admit of Malignants to their proteſtation: and ſo took all the borrowed 50 <hi>l.</hi> as the twentieth part of his Eſtate, which he by <hi>Affidavit</hi> gave in to them, was not worth 100 <hi>l.</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been long ſequeſtered, and plundered of his Goods, and by impriſonments and Egyptian years of Famine, forced to ſpend his long-provided Store. And juſt ſuch a Cheat doth the Committee for plundered Miniſters put upon the afflicted Wives and Children of the ſequeſtered Clergy, in their ſuing for the fifth part of their Husbands Living, which an Ordinance of Parliament pretended to allow them: If their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or Father hath two Livings, their firſt trick is to tell them, that they will allow them the fifth part of but one of them: The next is, that though the Ordinance run generally without any limitation, yet they have ſecret inſtructions whereby they grant Orders for a fifth part, with this <hi>proviſo,</hi> That if the ſequeſtrator (or Cutpurſe) ſhew not good cauſe to the contrary. <note place="margin">The Wife of Dr. <hi>P.</hi> hath been 3 years, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of almoſt 100 <hi>l.</hi> to obtain her fifth part, but could not prevail</note> This draweth on much travel, and charges on Lawyers, and Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and Committee-Officers; and the Parliament-Miniſter upon hearing, pretending that the Living is of value little enough to maintain him, or any frivolous Plea, breeds a demur; and although they grant Order after Order, yet all is to no purpoſe: for, ſay the Committee, we muſt not diſpleaſe our Friends; they mean their Maſters, who under pretence of long prayers, can devour whole houſes, and ſtarve other mens Wives and Children, by invading their poſſeſſions kept from the right Owners by Club-law. And truely their Ordinance for the fifth part doth generally prove but a meer mockery to the Wives and Children of the Clergy in the midſt of their heavy Perſecution, and a Snare to draw them into expence of their laſt groat, in hopes to get their ſo-fairly-promiſed morſel; that as I have known very few obtain it effectually, ſo have many of them after ſome years of chargeable and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious attendance been wearied out, buying at too dear a rate their Repentance of believing of hoping for any Juſtice or mercy from the Fanatical Faction: From whom may all Gods people pray, <hi>Good Lord deliver us.</hi>
