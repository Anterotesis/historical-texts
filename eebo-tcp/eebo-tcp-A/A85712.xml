            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF ever the Devil transformed himſelf into an Angel of light, or his Apoſtles and Ministers,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.13.14, 15.</note> transformed themſelves into the Miniſters of Chriſt, they have ſurely now in this apoſtatizing and back-ſliding age, which we (by meanes of a Toleration) have fallen into: And that glorious things, (to wit) liberty abuſed, to the diſhonour of God, and great ſcandall of the Goſpel; Yet ſincere Christians, (though they miſſed of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation they hoped, and endeavoured for) have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved their Goſpel-liberty, from Prelatical tyranny, (to a more humble walking before, and holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with their God and Jeſus Chriſt,) under which, many a godly Miniſter and private Chriſtian, did ſuffer trouble as evil doers, and that unto baniſhment,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.9.</note> confiſcation and bonds; but the Word of the Lord is not (cannot be) bound, though in a ſence under their Lordſhip it was. This is therefore to adviſe, yea, and perſwade you, that from all Seducers, and whatever tends to ſeduction, you ſtand off, and (as the Apoſtle ſaith) turn away,<note place="margin">Chap. 3. v. 5.</note> and keep cloſe unto your Cloſet-du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.12.</note> and thoſe publick known Ordinances and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,

by which your fellow Chriſtians, before you have through grace (in ſome meaſure) experimented the goodneſs of God to their poor ſouls.</p>
            <p>Now Chriſt himſelf adviſing, Take heed what, and how you hear: from this is my advice, Take heed whom you hear.<note place="margin">Mar. 4.24. Luk. 8.18. 1 Theſ. 5.21.</note> I have ſadly obſerved the abuſe of that Scripture, Prove all things. That is, ſay ſome, hear all, elſe how can we prove it? But this I have more ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved, That contrary to the words following, Hold faſt that which is good, they have let looſe (if not quite loſt) that which is good.

            <p>WHen I had compoſed the enſuing Narrative, and had fairly tranſcribed it for the uſe of my ſelf and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (as ſome very well know.) Some Chriſtian Friends, who peruſed it, know, that I never intended the publiſhing of it, and indeed, being conſcious to my own weakneſs and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility for ſuch a work, I need not be ambitious to be ſeen in the <hi>Preſſe,</hi> It being alſo contrary to my judgement, that men (under the notion of gifted Brethren) having not a call to, nor indeed ability for it, ſhould ſo oft be ſeen in <hi>Preſſe</hi> and <hi>Pulpit:</hi> conſidering what the Apoſtle ſpeaks,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.16.</note> Who is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for theſe things? But the practice of this preſent age ſaith, (ſuch is the high conceipt that impudence and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance hath of it ſelf.) Who is not ſufficient for theſe things? And truly Brethren, That which I ſhall ſpeak to, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the occaſion of this <hi>Narrative,</hi> will not be by way of teaching, (for I dare not) but only helping my ſelf and others, to lament the ſad effects of Toleration (falſly call'd liberty of Conſcience) which indeed long ſince, was moved for by many (and of late years too much yielded unto,) and in a Book called, <hi>The Compaſſionate Samaritan,</hi> it was deſired, That the <hi>Parliament</hi> would provide,<note place="margin">pa. 75, 76.</note> that private Congregations might have protection as well as publick, And that all Statutes againſt Separatists, might be repealed, and that the <hi>Preſſe</hi> might be free for any that writes, ſo he writes nothing ſcandalous or dangerous to the <hi>State:</hi> you have in it never a <hi>[So]</hi> if they write any thing dangerous. to Religion, and ſcandalous to the Goſpel. Ah Brethren! This liberty hath not been (I ſuppoſe) and he that ſpeaks by ſuppoſition, may ſometimes ſpeak truth, <hi>Luk. 7.43.</hi>) the leaſt cauſe of all our diviſions, nay of all our blaſphemies, errors and hereſies; nay, of all our looſe principles and practices ſuitable thereunto at preſent amongst us: all which is ſadly to be bewailed and
<pb facs="tcp:118898:6"/>
lamented by all that fear the Lord. For although a rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized man is pleaſed (in print) to ſay,<note place="margin">R. P. pa. <hi>66.</hi>
               </note> They do but dream, that ſay theſe are ſad times: So he ſpeaking to the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Miniſters</hi>; yet truly, (by his good leave) there cannot be a Soul, to whom Chriſt hath ſaid in the voice of the Goſpel, <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt,</hi> but, he being thus awakned,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.14.</note> muſt ſay, That ſince <hi>England</hi> was delivered from <hi>Paganiſm</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> there were never ſadder times: If Judgements (and that ſpiritual) upon a Nation, may be a cauſe of ſadneſs. God now dealing with us, as with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who being not humbled, but hardned under thoſe plagues that were upon him and his people, God threatens to ſend them all (the worst and ſaddeſt plague of all) upon his heart.<note place="margin">Exod. 9.14. In his Epiſtle to the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts, prefixed to his Quakers Catechiſm.</note> 
               <hi>For I will at this time</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>ſend all my plagues upon thine heart.</hi> And as that godly &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Divine, Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> certainly (ſaith he) ſuch ſpiritual plagues, as our eyes now behold, are as evident notes of Gods heavy diſpleaſure, as men can expect to ſee on earth. Brethren, is not this ſad? And is it not ſad, that men ſhould be ſo Jeſuited, as to take up ſuch principles, that (unleſſe God do mercifully ſtep in and prevent) will undermine and overthrow the Goſpel, Religion, Reformation, and all that is, or ſhould be dearer to us then our lives? Are not theſe ſad times? and doth it not call for mourning, and that (if it were poſſible) with teares of blood? And is it not ſad, when ſome that were, and would now be looked upon as high Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors above their Brethren, and yet now receive that for a glorious light, and true Doctrine, which before they would have abhorr'd as heatheniſh: (as indeed it is) inſomuch, that if a Chriſtian ſhould have ſaid ſome years agoe, that they would embrace ſuch Doctrine, they would have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as <hi>Hazael</hi> did in another caſe.<note place="margin">2 Ming. 8.13.</note>) <hi>What thinkeſt thou, thy ſervant a Dogge?</hi> And is it not ſad then, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how many packs there are in the Nation of theſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
<pb facs="tcp:118898:6"/>
Yea, ſee one thing more, my Brethren, which to me is very ſad, That many of thoſe who enjoy ordinances in a reformation way, walk no more holy and humble under them, and thankfully for them then they do. Truly, all theſe are ſad things. But hath it not been our gifted Brethren, (whoſe pride (to ſay no more) hath led them to that boldneſs in <hi>Preſſe</hi> and <hi>Pulpit</hi>) who have occaſioned moſt of all this? And good Friends, Do not all that fear the Lord think, (and that truly) that <hi>England</hi> will have cauſe to bewail the Toleration given, and the liberty taken in this kind? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſe Brethren! Is it enough, to make a man a Miniſter, that he can two or three houres in a week <note place="margin">As every ſound is not muſick, ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sermon is not preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> diſcourſe well (if it be well) and ſpeak Scripture-Language? in which time, many times many ſpeak non-ſence fluently (and blaſphemy without Book.) Why Brethren, conſidering the helps we have by <hi>Engliſh Authours,</hi> its an eaſie matter ſo to do, and its no hard matter to prove it the practice of gifted Brethren (as they are call'd) even amongſt us: Sometimes to bring ſome godly mens Sermons (as Doctor <hi>Sibs,</hi> &amp;c.) in a Pulpit, and with a bold face ſo deliver it, that the hearers ſometimes admire (as well they may) ſuch matter from ſuch men. Well Brethren, did our hopeful Plants, fitted in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities, receive ſo much incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as they ought: Sure the Church of God would not be at ſuch a loſſe for Miniſters, as to be beholden to ſuch men: and if Learning had that due incouragement it ought to have, through the bleſſing of God; from thence might come abroad thoſe that may pluck up thoſe tares, which this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration hath ſowed, &amp; ſow ſuch Seed, that may feed the Church of God with good bread, and not with chaffe. Oh ſhould I ſpeak what I could of ſome of theſe intruders, (for I know more then a good many) upon that honourable Calling of the Miniſtry,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.4.</note> (which (if we would keep to rule) none ſhould take upon him, but he that is called of God, as was <hi>Aaron:</hi>)
<pb facs="tcp:118898:7"/>
truly friends, I could tell you of ſuch groſſe ignorance, and that in fundamental catechiſtical points, of ſuch profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in converſation, of ſuch ſpotted dealing in (and with) the world, that a man (as a man, much more a Chriſtian man) would cry ſhame on; But Brethren, I forbear, and ſhall only give you inſtance of two Pulpit-brethren, (whom many of you know) in reference to the firſt, (to wit) igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: the one ſuppoſed God to be a man, (though more glorious than we) becauſe the parts of a man, are attributed to him in Scripture: Another reverend (Doct.) Brother ſpeaking of Circumciſion, ſaid, That being it was the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off of the fore-skin it is (ſaid he) the cutting off of the fore-skin of the fore-head. <hi>Frends,</hi> I do not ſhoot at rovers, but am able to black the white in my margin in this, as well as in other things;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.1.</note> but I forbear, and do wiſh, that if men finde their Spirits drawn out to deſire ſo great a work, and are godly and ſound in the truth; they would ſubmit to a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, by thoſe that are able to judge of their gifts, and ſo to be ſeparate to the work, and ſent forth according to rule, and then the Lord be with the good.<note place="margin">Obj.</note> But it may be objected, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I ſpeak ſo much againſt others, why I practice (and that without a call) printing my Self and this (all things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) a greater work then preaching or publick ſpeaking?</p>

till the buſineſs had been ended, I ſhould gladly (again) have lent my aſſiſtance unto him, from my notes there, and then you would have had it in better termes (he being far better able) then now you have; but he then being willing to haſten what he had done to the Preſſe, it came forth without it.</hi>

               <hi>4. I was moved by the earneſt requeſt of ſome godly friends, who had peruſed it (when in a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript) that I would let the world ſee the height of this impoſtor's blaſphemy, and his puniſhment.</hi>

ſpeak of it, its under foot, and all the ſhame that ſuch black mouths can foam out, I have learnt from my dear</hi> Jeſus <hi>(whom they daily crucifie) to deſpiſe,</hi>

            <p>My Fellow Citizens, If you conſider but that one peece of <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> which was in one of the papers found about <hi>Nailer,</hi> (to wit) That <hi>Chriſt</hi> that died at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was but a figure of that Chriſt in them; and from this it's ſaid, <hi>Nailer</hi> is Chriſt: So you will ſee in Doroth. <hi>Erbury,</hi> her Anſwer to the Magiſtrates, and upon this followeth, he muſt be honoured and owned as Chriſt: whereupon this wretch <hi>Nailor,</hi> takes and accepts of this honour from his Diſciples, contrary to that we find in Scripture, <hi>Matth. 21.15.</hi> For the Argument was right by the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> That none ought to have <hi>Hoſanna</hi> cryed to him, but the true <hi>Chriſt,</hi> either by old or young only,<note place="margin">His Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation before the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of <hi>Briſtol.</hi>
               </note> the application they made is denyed; he being the true <hi>Meſſias</hi> 'twas due to him. But what ſhall we ſay? with what words or teares ſhall we bewail it? that a wicked, vitious, and blaſpheming wretch, (a <hi>Jam. Nailor</hi>) ſhould give an Anſwer thus; <hi>If it come of God, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refuſe it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Brethren, you ſhall ſee the contrary practiſed by <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> when he was ſent unto, and had a fair opportunity to be cryed up for a <hi>Jeſus</hi>; when they put it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him,<note place="margin">Joh. 1.19, 20, 21.</note> and aſked him, <hi>Who art thou?</hi> He confeſſed and denyed not, but confeſſed I am not the Chriſt. And they ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:118898:8"/>
him, <hi>What then? Art thou Elias?</hi> And he ſaith, I am not. <hi>Art thou that Prophet?</hi> And he anſwered, No. (Alſo you may conſider that of <hi>Peter</hi> his practice, <hi>Acts 10.25, 16.</hi> But my work will not be Confutation, but deſire la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.) Now <hi>John</hi> anſwering No, though I would not be critical upon words, yet conſidering this <hi>Blaſphemer</hi> and his <hi>Diſciples</hi> are ſo ſingular, and do ſo tye themſelves to <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay</hi>; as if <hi>Yes</hi> and <hi>No</hi> were not ſometimes tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated in Scripture as well as the other; For as <hi>John</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers <hi>No,</hi> ſo <hi>Peter</hi> anſwers <hi>Yes,</hi> Matth. <hi>17.24, 25.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. <hi>10.18,</hi> &amp;c. I would not quarrel with words, but leave it as one evil mark of Seducers,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.4.</note> (ſtrifes of words.) But becauſe they make ſo much of it, and place much of their Religion in it, I offer to conſideration, that in <hi>1 Kings, 3</hi>d Chapter, from the <hi>16</hi>th verſe, to the end, where we have a Relation of two Women, that came to <hi>Solomon</hi> about a Child, and both lay claim to it; (but to the thing in hand) in ver. <hi>22.</hi> you have both words <hi>Nay</hi> and <hi>No,</hi> and it is obſervable, its the falſe Mother hath her <hi>[Nay.]</hi> Now you know that Scripture-Proverb. As is the Mother, ſo is her Daughter, and this you ſhall ſee made good by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the New Teſtament, like Mother like Daughter;<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.44.</note> 
               <hi>Saphira,</hi> who was privy to that hypocriſie of her Husband, in keeping back part of the price they ſold their poſſeſſion for; when the Apoſtle asked her, Tell me (ſaith he) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye ſold the Land for ſo much? And ſhe ſaid <hi>[Yea]</hi> for ſo much. So then here you have a fit pair of hypocrites, to make <hi>Quakers</hi>; and ſeeing the Scripture doth thus match them, let them go together. Well, here you ſee ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout words, but in my <hi>Narrative,</hi> you will ſee ſomething bad enough in practice: Therefore Friends, keep to hearing as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was adviſed, And beloved, ſeeing you know theſe things before,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.17, 18.</note> beware lest ye alſo being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſſe, but grow in

               <p>Here we ſee Blaſphemy in the higheſt: and now the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ſending a Letter to Mr. R. A. (their godly Town-Clark, and honourable Burgeſſe of Parliament) of theſe wretches Examinations: upon his report to the Houſe, the Parliament choſe a Committee from amongſt themſelves to take notice of it, and ſent a Meſſenger for <hi>Nailor</hi>: two of his Company, <hi>viz. Sam. Cater,</hi> and <hi>Rob. Crab,</hi> the laſt of <hi>October,</hi> were diſcharged (their examinations amounting not

                  </note> Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Satan, where the Quakers meet.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrates ſent <hi>Nailor</hi> for <hi>London,</hi> the 10th of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> with 4 of his Diſciples, <hi>viz. Stanger</hi> and his Wife, <hi>Martha Symonds,</hi> and <hi>Dorcas Erbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now leſt they ſhould deny (as much they did) what they confeſt here, Mr. <hi>Phil. Dorney</hi> their Clark, and (upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Magiſtrates) another with him, to evidence what here they ſaid, went for <hi>London,</hi> and upon the 15th of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> (being the firſt day of their hearing before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee in the Painted Chamber) made good againſt them what they here owned.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> following, the Committee met again, and then agreed upon ſome Reports to be made to the Houſe, but being not fully ſatisfied, upon <hi>Saturday</hi> following, ſent for <hi>Nailor</hi> again, and examined him fuller, ſhewing much patience in hearing his long-winded anſwers, which were framed with much craft and ſubtilty, and though he deny'd much of what he ſaid at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> yet owned there greater Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy than before.</p>
               <p>At that time was one of the Witneſſes call'd again, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the manner of his comming into <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and what he there confeſt before the Magiſtrates; upon this, when he that was call'd began to ſpeak, a Member of the Committee ſpake ſomething in <hi>Nailors</hi> behalf, but being ſatisfied by the reſt, the party call'd upon then to ſpeak, being deſir'd to ſpeak on, he directing his ſpeech to the Chairman, ſpake as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> If any Gentleman here preſent be not ſatisfied to what I ſhall ſpeak, becauſe I am not upon my Oath, I do here tender my ſelf to be ſworn, that what I ſhall ſpeak, ſhall be nothing but the truth: they anſwered, they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him without an Oath: he then ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> Upon the requeſt of the Magiſtrates of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoll,</hi> I do here appear, and the buſineſs I am now upon, is the Cauſe of God, yet I ſhall ſpeak to you in Scripture-Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,<note place="margin">Job 13.7.8.</note> If I tell you I dare not lie for God (being bid to ſpeak on, did) <hi>Sir,</hi> As to this wretche's comming in, I was not an

eye-witneſs. But that Teſtimony which the Magiſtrates have ſent up to your Honours, was affirmed by two Gentlemen, that were members of the Common-Councel of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> who were eye-witneſſes thereof.</p>
               <p>The Chair-man (who was godly Mr. <hi>Bamfield,</hi> Recorder of <hi>Exeter</hi>) deſiring him to ſpeak on, he told them, he was preſent at the examination of this Blaſphemer, before the Maior of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and noted his anſwers to what was there put to him in ſhort hand, and after tranſcribed them, and compared them with thoſe ſent up to your Honours (which the Maior hath firmed) and found them to agree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> The comming of this Blaſphemer into <hi>Briſtol,</hi> in ſuch a manner, perſonating the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, did ſo take with thoſe that fear the Lord (however others may deem it) that (to my knowledge) it did coſt many teares: and I do not know (in theſe dividing times) what did better take amongſt us then this, when we heard, that upon our Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes Report of it to the Houſe, the Parliament ſo reſented it, as to chooſe out from amongſt themſelves, your Honours to take notice of it. And truly Sir, though it be very ſad to us, that we are the Head Quarters of this generation of Quakers, that hath brought forth ſuch an Impoſtor, yet we look upon it as a providence, that it is in time of Parliament. And we have thus far witneſt againſt it, and ſhall leave it to your Honours wiſdom, to do as God ſhall direct you.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 25. of <hi>Novemb.</hi> the Committee met again, and then agreed to deliver their Report to the Houſe, which they did upon the 4th of <hi>Decemb.</hi> in 15 ſheets of paper. It being read in the Houſe, not one Member ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt any thing in it; but upon debate, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but it might concern his life, they generally agreed to hear him themſelves firſt.</p>
               <p>The ſixth of <hi>Decemb. Nailer</hi> was ſent for, and called to the Barre, the Report of the Committee was particularly read in parts, and his anſwer required to each Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether his anſwer before the Committee to theſe things, were thus? He anſwered to every head yea, and denyed not any part thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:118898:16"/>Whereupon the Houſe agreed upon all the matter of fact reported by the Committee, and adjudged it horrid Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and he a Grand Impoſtor and deceiver of the people, and ordered him cloſe priſoner.</p>
               <p>After 8. or 9. dayes debate, upon the 16th of <hi>December,</hi> the Houſe came to a Reſolution in <hi>Nailers</hi> buſineſs, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a diviſion of the Houſe, it being carried in the Negative, that the queſtion for death ſhould not be put; The Houſe then conſidered what the puniſhment ſhould be, if not death: So they voted his puniſhment to be as followeth.</p>

               <p>The next day being the 17th of <hi>December, Nailor</hi> was brought to the Barre, to receive his ſentence agreed upon.</p>

               <p>Now ſome mercy it is in theſe evil times (wherein every man almoſt doth what is right in his own eyes) that there are ſome Magiſtrates who have endeavoured (though in Parliament, and, you ſee elſe-where,<note place="margin">Iudg. 17.6. &amp; 18.7.</note> with great oppoſition) to put offendors to open ſhame. But though Juſtice, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices here, may be mock'd, God is not,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.7.</note> (and men ſhall one day know) will not be mockt. What anſwer will theſe wretches make,<note place="margin">Pſal. 4.2.</note> when God ſhall put this Queſt <hi>O ye Sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into ſhame?</hi> For God himſelf hath ſaid, <hi>I am the Lord, that is my name,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 42.8.</note> 
                  <hi>and my glory will I not give to another.</hi> And though wretches would take it, yet they muſt ſtand off, they ſhall not have it; nay, they cannot have it. For upon all the glory ſhall be a defence. If upon the Church the body,<note place="margin">Chap. 4. v. 5.</note> much more on Chriſt the Head.</p>
               <p>I have now done as to this Impoſtor, and his deluded ones: And ſhall ſay as the Apoſtle did to that Sorcerer (ſo to him.) Thy heart is not right in the ſight of God,<note place="margin">Acts 8.21, 22, 23.</note> Repent therefore of this thy wickedneſs, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee, for I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that thou art in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquity. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.31, 32.</p>
               <p>Here you have had a ſad, but a true account of Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the higheſt, and though <hi>Nailor</hi> himſelf, and ſome of the others, did juggle in their anſwers, yet <hi>Dorcas Erbury</hi> ſpeaks the ſenſe of them all.</p>
               <p>Now though the times may be ſuch as to queſtion, whether there be any Blaſphemy or no; yet God will one day ſay, I know the Blaſphemy of them which ſay they are Jewes,<note place="margin">Rev. 2.9.</note> and are not, but are the Synagogue of Satan: Will he not much
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118898:21"/>
more ſay it of this wretch, that ſaith he, is Jeſus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a Blaſphemy to be bewailed, if poſſible, with teares of blood;<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.9. Epheſ. 4.10.</note> for it reacheth to the Heavens, nay, to him that is exalted above the Heavens (I ſuppoſe in dignity.)</p>
               <p>And that my heart may be the more affected with him, my dear Lord and Saviour, againſt whom all this is, I ſhall deſire to call to mind two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. His Relation to me.</item>
                  <item>2. His ſufferings for me, and both upon the account of free grace.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And oh that my heart might, not only be affected with, but my ſoul afflicted for it, That all this ſhould be ſaid and done againſt him who is my head, the Lord my Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, my Advocate, my Mediator, my Saviour, my Chriſt, my Jeſus, my continual Interceſſor, my Wiſdom, Sanctification, and Redemption, my All in all.</p>
               <p>Now conſidering our Relation, methinks it ſhould ſoften the hardeſt heart, to wear it ſelf out with melting teares, What, is all this againſt my elder Brother? yea, my Lord and my God? What, all done againſt my loving and lovely Jeſus?</p>
               <p>But that it may (if poſſible) be more affected (as I am ſure it ought to be) let us conſider, And methinks Chriſt is now ſpeaking from Heaven to us,<note place="margin">Iohn 6.67.</note> in theſe apoſtatizing dayes, as he did to his Diſciples. Will ye alſo go away? And may not Chriſt ſay, as the Lord doth, wherein have I wearied you? te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie againſt me.<note place="margin">Mica. 6.3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He can ſay to us, I have unthroned my ſelf of my glory with my Father, and took upon me your nature, and ſo came in it nearer to you then others, and will ye go away? What you? If I had done no more, this had been enough to have kept you to me for ever, and not look after another. I took your nature upon me, not for any pleaſure I had in it, or eaſe by it: but that by ſuffering in it, you might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
               <p>What had I done might our dear Jeſus ſay, who can charge me with ſin? the Devil himſelf cannot do it, the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118898:21"/>
Prince of this world commeth, and hath nothing in me.<note place="margin">Joh. 14.30.</note> If all I did ſuffer was for you, ſtanding in your room, ſo to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, will you thus requite me? May not Chriſt ſay, as the Lord doth by <hi>Moſes</hi>? Do ye thus requite the Lord? Oh fooliſh people and unwiſe! Is not he thy Father,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.6.</note> (Saviour) that hath bought thee? Hath he not made thee, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed thee? Surely we may ſay as in the verſe before,<note place="margin">verſ. 5.</note> Their ſpot is not the ſpot of his children, that thus blaſpheme him, or, as it is (more emphatical) in the Margin, That they are not his children, that is their blot.</p>
               <p>But now ſay ſome of theſe ſpotted and blotted ones, what is Chriſt? what did this Chriſt at <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> We have an anſwer at hand, out of the word of truth (if you had grace to believe it.)</p>
               <p>As to what he is, I anſwer, He is the only begotten Son of God: and yet the Son of man, in this one Scripture both, And the Word is made fleſh, and dwelt among us,<note place="margin">Iohn 1.14.</note> and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.</p>
               <p>As to what he did?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this man, after he had offered one Sacrifice for ever, ſat down at the right hand of God.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.12.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But believing ſoul (to thee I deſire to ſpeak) ſee and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what he did, when he ſtood in our ſtead, to grapple with his Fathers wrath for us, And all we ſhall ſee it out of that Goſpel already preached and received; And if an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from Heaven,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.8.</note> preach any other (Goſpel) let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed.</p>
               <p>Conſider we then his firſt bleeding,<note place="margin">1. Bleeding. Luk. 2.21.</note> when for our ſakes he ſubmitted to (the painful Ordinance of) Circumciſion,<note place="margin">1. Bleeding. Luk. 2.21.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo we may receive much benefit, it by faith &amp; the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Spirit in our hearts (being circumciſed by the circumciſion made without hands:) we apply it to our ſelves, in putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh, by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of Chriſt. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.11. But I ſhall by and by let you ſee, no leſſe then eleven particular bleedings more, which I truſt, will help affect our hearts, and conſtrain us the more to love and obey him.</p>

This, this was his ſoul afflicting paſſion, praying, <hi>If thou be willing, let this Cup paſſe from me</hi> (three times) And being in an Agony (ſaith the Text) he prayed more earneſtly, and his ſweat (Mark O ſoul) was as it were great drops of blood,<note place="margin">2.

               <p>Conſider O my ſoul, alſo the willingneſs of thy Saviour, after this deep Agony, and great conflict with his Father, he knowing all things that ſhould come upon him, goes forth, and meets the traytor and his company, and ſaid unto them, <hi>Whom ſeek ye?</hi>

               <p>Then if we conſider his Executioners, they are not men of an effeminate ſpirit; but ſaith the Text, Theſe things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Souldiers did,<note place="margin">Joh. 19.24.

               <p>Oh ſoul! to help thee, yet further to mourn over thy dear Saviour, conſider theſe men, (Souldiers) are not only skilful to deſtroy, but its a paſſe-time to them, witneſs that ſaying of two great Souldiers, <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Joab</hi>; And <hi>Abner</hi> ſaid to <hi>Joab,</hi>

And after this, none comes
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118898:22"/>
to waſh &amp; ſupple his ſtripes; but immediately delivered into the hands of theſe mercileſs men (Souldiers.) And concerning his whipping, Hiſtories tell us, That their whips were of ſmall cord &amp; wires, that ſo every ſtroak might tear the fleſh. (Ah my dear Jeſus) Soul, canſt thou think his ſweet body was not torn to purpoſe by them, when that wretch (<hi>Pilate</hi>) deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him up to their will? Do what you will with him: was ever any Malefactor ſo delivered up? Mark what St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, And he releaſed unto them, him that for ſedition and murder was caſt into priſon, whom they had deſired,<note place="margin">Luk. 23.25.</note> but he delivered Jeſus to their will, to do with him what they would. (So one Tranſlation.)</p>
               <p>After this, the Souldiers took Jeſus into the Common Hall, and they ſtript him (the Souldiers did.<note place="margin">Mat. 27.27, 28. 4 Bleeding.</note>) Soul doſt thou think it was gently done? no, no, this fetcht (I ſuppoſe) bloud, Holy Jeſus! from thy ſweet (but very ſore) body again.</p>
               <p>After this, they put on him a Roab (as they call it) and when they had platted a Crown of thorns, they, (the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers) put it upon his head: Soul,<note place="margin">verſ. 29.</note> doſt thou think it was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly done? It may be they handled it ſo, but they did not head it ſo. Now behold the bloud of thy Saviour,<note place="margin">5. Bleeding.</note> from his ſacred head (thy head) running down every way. And when they had faſtned the Crown, then they put a Reed in his right hand, and they bowed the knee before him, (who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was worthy to be worſhipped, though they mocked him,) ſaying, Hail King of the Jewes, And they ſpat upon him (the Souldiers did) and ſmote him with their hands,<note place="margin">Joh. 19.3. Mat. 27.30.</note> and took the Reed, and ſmote him on the head. Ah dear ſoul, freſh bleeding with a witneſs;<note place="margin">6.

(oh heart, harder than the neather Mill-ſtone) again.</p>
               <p>After they had mocked him, they took the Roab off from him, Gently? no,<note place="margin">verſ. 31.</note> no (the Souldiers did it) and did not the plucking off of this woollen Garment (by ſuch men)

               <p>When the Queſtion was put to <hi>Mary,</hi> Woman, why weepeſt thou? Oh ſaith ſhe!<note place="margin">Joh. 20.11, 13.</note> (ſpeaking as a woman undon) they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</p>
               <p>Now though Warre be gone, and what the Souldiers have not taken away, we yet keep, yet do not men (Devils incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate) ſeek to take away Sabbaths, Scriptures, Ordinances, Miniſters, yea, our Lord Jeſus his perſon, were he within their reach? and we know not where they would lay him. And may not we ſay again, theſe things the Souldiers did. And one of the Souldiers pierced his ſide,<note place="margin">Joh. 19.24, 34.</note>) and was not <hi>Nailor</hi> a Souldier, as well as a famous infamous Quaker and Blaſphemer?</p>
               <p>And now Brethren, let none take offence, before it be given, becauſe I have in ſetting forth the ſufferings of Chriſt, the Captain of our Salvation, ſo oft mentioned the word Souldier; for its frequent in all our four Evangeliſts, and my practice hath declared, that I own Warre, as an Ordinance
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118898:25"/>
of God, when rightly ſtated, but let me ſay this to them, and to my own ſoul, to help us to lament, let us look upon <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> an eminent inſtance, who, though he was a Souldier, a man of much bloud; he was alſo a Saint, a real Saint, a man of many teares,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.136</note> (ſaith he) Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, becauſe they keep not thy Law.</p>
               <p>Truly, if we can ſay as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> (that good man) did of himſelf (as to the Kings Diſcerning) I had not [ſaith he] been before time ſad in his preſence.<note place="margin">Nehem. 2.1, 2, 3, 4.</note> Yet now [if ever] we have cauſe of ſorrow of heart, and ſadneſs of countenance, as he had.</p>
               <p>Conſider we <hi>Nehemiah's</hi> cauſe of that ſadneſs, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the ſpeech of the King. Wherefore the King ſaid unto me, Why is thy countenance ſad, ſeeing thou art not ſick? this is nothing elſe but ſorrow of heart, oh that it were ſo with us! Then I was very ſore afraid, and ſaid unto the King, Let the King live for ever. Why ſhould not my countenance be ſad, when the City, the place of my Fathers Sepulchers lyeth waſte, and the Gates thereof are conſumed with fire? Then the King ſaid unto me, For what doſt thou make requeſt? So I prayed to the God of Heaven [I ſuppoſe ſome ſecret ejaculation at that time] the application I leave to thoſe to whom more properly it belongs; the perſons, Miniſters, whom we are now ſpeaking of, and calling upon our ſelves, more to pray for. But to return,</p>
               <p>O that we could pray more! Yea, and methinks we ſhould, you ſtanding in ſo much need of prayer, as indeed you do, For, you, you who are the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, are the mark ſhot at, its you who are the more able, and more god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, amongſt you, which is the white in that mark, at which they aim, and level their malice.</p>
               <p>And then conſidering how earneſtly you beg it of us, as you do,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3.1.</note> in one place Brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free courſe, and be glorified. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> we ſhall ſee, Never did any man beg for an Alms,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.30.</note> with more earneſt intreaties, than he did for the Saints prayers, Now I beſeech you Brethren, for the Lord Jeſus Chriſts ſake, and for the love of the Spirit, that you ſtrive to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118898:25"/>
with me, in your prayers to God for me. And Jeſus Chriſt hath not only taught us to pray,<note place="margin">Luk. 22.44.</note> but by his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample hath taught us to put up earneſt Supplications, He being in an Agony, prayed more earneſtly. And this was a little before his ſufferings, a little before his lifting up upon the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>Now this lifting up, was to draw all men unto him,<note place="margin">Joh. 12 32.</note> and the Pole, upon which our Lord Jeſus is thus lifted up, is the Goſpel. (He is the true Serpent indeed lifted up, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth on him, ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life.) <note n="*" place="margin">As a godly Divine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.</note> Now thoſe that do bear this Pole, or Standard, whereby we come to ſee what he hath done, and how he hath bled for us, were the four Evangeliſts, and then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and ſo onward their ſucceſſive Brethren the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, with whom he hath promiſed to be always,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.19, 20</note> even to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>So then, by vertue of this promiſe, we have encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to pray; for though men and Devils band together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, yet a ſtanding Miniſtry he will bear up, and that to the end, (not of that age, as ſome would have it, but) of the World; And bear them up he will ſure, for they are Stars, and that in his right hand, and who ſhall, nay, who can,<note place="margin">Rev. 1.2.</note> pluck them thence?</p>
               <p>But now that we may make up what, and wherein we have been wanting in this duty, we have a promiſe alſo to enable us, and let us turn that promiſe into a prayer, and earneſtly beg of God to make it good, which is, That he will poure down the Spirit of grace and Supplication upon us,<note place="margin">Zech. 12.10.</note> and then ſhall prayers and teares be poured out from us with accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Which that we may, let us talk leſſe of them, leſſe then that againſt them, and let us up, and be doing, in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more frequent, and earneſt for them. And let one and the other put up this joynt prayer, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did,<note place="margin">Chap. 1.11.</note> O Lord I beſeech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy Servant, and to the prayer of thy Servants, who deſire to fear thy name; And proſper good Lord the ſtudies and labours of thy Servants, that all error and blaſphemy, and

               <p>Now my Fellow Citizens and Chriſtian Friends, and all you that are ſanctified by God the Father, and preſerved in Jeſus Chriſt, and called, even you that are called, and yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118898:27"/>
The Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> exhorts you earneſtly to contend for the faith, which was once delivered to the Saints,<note place="margin">verſ. 3, 4.</note> And the reaſon he gives of your ſtanding to, and earneſt conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for that faith, is in verſe 4. For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old, ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into laſciviouſneſs, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>My beloved Friends, the Counſel I gave in my Epiſtle, is, that I do now give again, and beſeech you to take: its from Chriſt himſelf, Take heed how, and what you hear (then I may ſay whom you hear.) For what the Apoſtle ſaid will come, I may now ſay, is come, When ſome will not indure ſound Doctrine, but after their own luſts,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4 3.</note> ſhall they heap to themſelves teachers, having itching eares: And hath not this infectious Diſeaſe ſo ſpread, that many profeſſors have been ſo ſcabby, that they are very ſcabs in Religion? Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I know ſomething, and ſome ſuch ones, and I believe ſome of you know more. Well then, take heed, and beware, let men have a Scripture-call to teach, before we have a call to hear, leſt we be ſeduced.</p>
               <p>Thoſe ſeducers, who formerly came creeping in amongſt us, have (ſince a wicked Toleration given) ſo increaſed, and now got to that heighth of impudence, that not only houſes, but Churches, Preſſe and Pulpit, have ſounded too loud of helliſh Blaſphemies.</p>
               <p>I heartily wiſh, that that Epiſtle of Mr. <hi>R. Baxter,</hi> (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to his Quakers Catechiſm) to the Separatiſts, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts in <hi>England,</hi> were by them laid to heart: And that the Anabaptiſts eſpecially, would ſeriouſly conſider it: For the Quakers practice is what their Doctrines hold out; for though every Anabaptiſt be not a Quaker, yet every Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker is a Non-baptiſt, if not rebaptized: one of their Queries to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> being this,<note place="margin">Quakers Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm their 3d Query.</note> what expreſs Scripture have you for Infant-baptiſm? And oh that ſome able pen, would in the ſpirit of meekneſs, hold forth the riſe of our Ranting Blaſpheming Tenents and practiſes, which I ſuppoſe, would eaſily be made appear, to be from the Anabaptiſts Doctrines.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:118898:28"/>I ſhall give in ſomething of my low obſervation, and go no farther then my own knowledge, nor from thoſe I know, that have either printed, preacht, or practiſed that which is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, even in <hi>Bristol,</hi> (at preſent the Receptacle of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, and baſe men) and parts adjacent; ſome Speakers to the Anabaptiſt Church in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> that have in Preſſe and Pulpit, held forth ſuch Doctrines, that tend to what is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, both in principle and practice, and that in, and near the ſaid City.</p>
               <p>One, an Anabaptiſt, or rebaptized man, blames Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for ſpeaking from but one Text, in one Sermon, ſaying, Did ever the Prophets and Apoſtles do ſo? (whither tends this?) in a little thing, called, <hi>A Word to the World,</hi> p. 56. Again, If you have been in the Pulpit, to deliver the Meſſage of Chriſt, why are you afraid to have your Doctrine queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned? p. 64. (what meanes this?) The Devil hath as great Rhetorick and Logick, as the Heathen, or the national Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. A little thing called <hi>P. No power,</hi> p. 4. In his Dialogue between Law and Goſpel, brings in the Law querying, Wilt thou not own me for Rule of life? And the Goſpel anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, No, by no meanes, p. 110.

He adviſeth Miniſters to declare to their Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their diſowning their Ordination, and that ſpeedily, elſe they will be laid aſide, p. 169. In his Epiſtle to the World, He tells the Miniſters, that what they yet ſuffer, is but the beginning of ſorrow, p. 186. And though he gives 13. Characters of a true Goſpel Miniſter, and they be all found in each of them; yet if they renounce not their Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they will be laid aſide, both by God and man, p. 189. 190. Whither tends all this? Do not the Quakers practices in oppoſing and queſtioning the Miniſters in their Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations (and that with ſuch impudence, and much diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance) declare themſelves to be diſcipled by the Anabaptiſts Doctrines?

                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:118898:29"/>I ſhall tell you what <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Conſt.

He was baptized, he, and all his ſtraight way thus. [He, and the Children of his Houſe were baptized.] But this godly Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, by a <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Den.

               <p>
                  <hi>My Chriſtian Friends,</hi> You have about this their practice, theſe three things to obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Its a very improbable opinion, to ſay or think ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Where in Scripture, the Houſhold is mentioned, and the Children excluded, there are Children by name excepted, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.8. but in neither of theſe Texts, which ſpeaks of the Apoſtles baptizing the whole Houſe, are Children ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, therefore they (if any were there) are included.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Until it be proved (as it concerns theſe Adverſaries, and Infant-Baptiſm dangers,) that there were in thoſe Houſholds no Children, the enemies to this truth, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Ordinance of Infant Baptiſm, have ſaid nothing; And therefore I ſuppoſe, you of right may ſay he is miſtaken.</p>
               <p>And now to retutn.</p>
               <p>Another Speaker ſometime to the Anabaptiſt people in <hi>Briſtol,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">J.

Friends, take heed whom you hear.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">T. T. F. Y. T. A.</note>Another Speaker to the Anabaptiſt People (but now a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Quaker) was ſo accuſtomed to this groſſe and filthy ſin, that he did lie in bed with a whore on each ſide of him; for though they were both re-baptized, (whatever you call them) I do call them whores; for from one of their own mouthes (glorying of her liberty, in what they did) was heard, that which I tremble to think on, and am aſhamed to write, it being not fit for a modeſt tongue to ſpeak, nor chaſt eares to hear, and therefore ſhall abruptly leave it.</p>
               <p>Theſe people require an expreſs Text for Infant-Baptiſm, which need not, it being proved by undenyable conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;) but here you ſee by this beaſtly practice, an expreſſe text, fulfilled in the very letter, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. But it is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto them, according to the true Proverb, <hi>The Dog is turned to his own vomit again, and the Sow that was waſhed, to her wallowing in the mire.</hi> And here you have ſeen a Boar and two Sowes, wallowing in the mire, and that after waſhing. Friends, be not offended, for its all Scripture-Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
               <p>I had thought to have given a brief Account of (that Taylor) <hi>John A Leyden,</hi> and that Rebaptized Crew, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſtical Fryery of <hi>Munſter,</hi> but I refer the Reader, to the Hiſtory it ſelf, and ſhall only give you one Relation, of the folly of two Siſters, after they were ſeduced (and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized) in <hi>Germany,</hi> citing the very words of the<note n="*" place="margin">A ſhort Hiſtory of the Anabaptiſts.</note> Authour: It was (ſaith he) ſpeaking of the Anabaptiſts in <hi>Germany,</hi>) their conſtant Doctrine every where, that Women muſt be common. Three Reaſons they had, (well worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred to poſterity) to perſwade honeſt women to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118898:30"/>
proſtitute their bodies, if they would be ſaved.</p>
               <p>The firſt was, That Chriſtians muſt renounce thoſe things which they love beſt, and therefore Women muſt renounce their beloved honeſty.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, That for Chriſt's ſake, we muſt undergo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kind of infamy.</p>
               <p>The third Reaſon was; That the Publicans and Harlots, ſhall go before the Phariſees into the Kingdom of Heaven. Lying with other women then their Wives, they called Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Marriages, and under that title, they would lye with Neeces and Siſters. They had (ſaith the Authour) a main Reaſon for community of Women, that as Chriſtians are all one Spirit, they muſt alſo be all one body. Theſe two Maiden Siſters (ſpoken of before) before they were re-baptized, ſaith the Authour) had been much ſolicited, and could never be won, till they were perſwaded to be whores for conſcience ſake. I dare ſay as much for the two re-baptized Creatures before mentioned, p 51. for I knew their Converſation, for ſome years. <note n="*" place="margin">On a civil account wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men-guides, upon a (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred account, women have men dippers.</note> Let women therefore, if they will be waſhed, have women-guides, and take heed of that immodeſt action, for men to dip them. Its the Apoſtles counſel, avoid all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evil. If there be but a ſhew of evil, Chriſtians are to avoid it.</p>
               <p>But of this ſort of people, amongſt us now, you have a character given by <hi>Dennis Holliſter,</hi> (who was ſome years an Elder over them, and a Speaker to them) in his Book ſent to the Independent-baptized people, who call themſelves a Church of Chriſt in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> but are found to be a Synagogue of Satan. Title page, and in p. 14. He telleth them, he is conſtrained to bear witneſs, that they are no Church of Chriſt, (neither know the name of Chriſt) but a Synagogue of Satan, and a cage of unclean and hateful Spirits, in which lodgeth pride, hypocriſie, envy, ſlandering, backbiting, rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lying, love to this preſent world, and conformity to the faſhions, cuſtoms, and converſation of the ſame. And of theſe I may ſay, as the Apoſtle doth, theſe are they,<note place="margin">1 Tit. 1.12.12, 13.</note> whoſe mouthes muſt be ſtopped, who ſubvert whole Houſes, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's ſake: For you ſee one
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118898:31"/>
of themſelves, even a Prophet of their own ſaith they are lyars; this witneſs is true.</p>
               <p>And now Brethren, theſe things I relate, not becauſe I would priviledge or excuſe any Church or member thereof, (even the pureſt) as being altogether free from faults, (yea, ſometimes ſcandalous.) But then firſt we muſt enquire, what are the principles that ſuch do hold out; For if they hold out ſound principles in Doctrine, that ſuch things ought not to be done,<note place="margin">Rev. 2.20.</note> (which Phariſees and other Sectaries do not, but teach men ſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.19.) Then cannot theſe things be juſtly charged on them. And then 2dly, We are to conſider, who are the Societies and ſuppoſed Churches, we have to deal with in this Charge; for if they are ſuch who pretend to higher l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ght, greater refining and reformation; yea, (as ſome of them do) to ſinleſs perfection, then they may be juſtly minded of their ſpots and blots, their blemiſhes and imperfections: And ſo there cannot be any retortion upon them, who, holding out ſound Doctrine, contend for a ſtrict Diſcipline, which would help theſe things. And let it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Laſtly, That as for theſe Sectaries, Quakers, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (Amongſt whom commonly, are ſuch things:) there is openly by ſome, and ſecretly by others, an oppoſing and undermining of thoſe great Ordinances of God, a right Magiſtracy and Miniſtry, who in a civil and eccleſiaſtical way do, or would carry on Government in Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, whereby ſuch wicked perſons and practices might be ſhamed and puniſhed;<note place="margin">Jude 8.</note> and now dealing with them who are found to deſpiſe Government, we may well reprove them, (and that without reproach) that ſo many among them, do defile the fleſh. Likewiſe alſo, theſe filthy dreamers, defile the fleſh, deſpiſe dominion, and ſpeak evil of dignities.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Another <hi>J. W.</hi> ſaid to a godly Divine Mr. <hi>P.</hi> That the Scripture was the cauſe of all the diviſions and diſtractions in the Nation. Renounce thy Baptiſm. Why, what is't worth? its null, its void, its worth nothing, you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it, and be rebaptized, Why? Why, your Infant Baptiſm, is a misbaptiſm, ſaith Mr. <hi>Ewins,</hi> (in that Anſwer to <hi>Holliſter,</hi> pa. 59.) Tell God he lyes to his face. Why, ſaith another, nay, many others, ſo we do. The Scripture, the Bible, the Word of God, what word of God? what Bible? bibble babble, its as an old Almanack out of date, its a blind and plague to the Nation (as before) therefore we never uſe it, we need it not, we ſpeak the dictates of the Spirit. Ah my Brethren, remember the Word was, Take heed whom you hear, you ought to remember it, its the Word of him that is the Captain of your ſalvation the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. You know the forgetting of the Word (amongſt Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in time of danger) may looſe thy life, and that by thy friend, he may not know thee; nay, Chriſt himſelf will one day ſay, for want of remembring this word (take heed) De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me, I know you not. To forget the word, it may overthrow a Gariſon, ruine an Army, looſe a Kingdom; nay, to forget this word, may looſe thy ſoul,<note place="margin">Mat 16.26.</note> which is of more worth then all the Kingdoms of the World; nay, the world it ſelf, will thy Chriſt tell thee.</p>
               <p>Friends, my advice is ſtill the ſame, remember the Word, take heed whom you hear; And now to as many of my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſtians and Citizens, as have forgot it: the word to them is, faces about, and you know all Military termes, when the word is, faces about, &amp; no hand mentioned; it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, to the right. So the word now is, to the right about, unto thy keeping cloſe to publick Ordinances again: to thy old puritanical principles again: to thy conſtant Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily duties again: to thy hearing (and that only) of thoſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118898:32"/>
that are ſent, ordained Miniſters again: Although Seducers (to make parties, and carry on their deſignes, who would ſet us in a flame again if they could) quarrel at Ordination (though Scripture be clear for it, and as clear againſt uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Seducers,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.14.</note> that run before they are bid to go.) And quarrel at laying on of hands, ſaying, its a Ceremony (which if ſo, yet by their leave, its a Goſpel Ceremony.) And at Presbytery; yet that alſo hath an expreſſe text of Scripture, which is a part of the everlaſting Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 14.6.</note>Well dear Friends, about to Infant baptiſm, own that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance in publick, let's walk (our ſelves) more worthy of it, and anſwerable unto it; bleſſe God for thy priviledge, that he will admit thy Child, thy Infant, to be a member of his Church viſible. Oh be not ſo hard hearted! as to deny that to thy Child which God doth offer thee, thou being a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, do not ſo eaſily part with thy priviledge, and that which is thy Child's due.

               </p>
               <p>Brethren, the advice is again, take heed how, and what you hear. And had you not need ſo to do? I ſuppoſe, that when you firſt heard ſome of your uncall'd Teachers, their ſmooth Doctrine ſo pleaſed you, that you would labour to juſtifie your practice in ſo doing (though ſince, many of you are of another mind) and you little thought, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would be rebaptized, and turn rebaptizers; and ſo bring in another Baptiſm,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4, 5.</note> when the Apoſtle ſaith there is but one: And you leſſe thought they would unchriſten you, and ſo (as much as in them lyeth) make you Heathens, telling you, that you are misbaptized: but you ſee the nature of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. And as for this ugly immodeſt action of dipping, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptizing, (for I dare not call it an Ordinance without ſin) it doth not only make null, and overthrow the Ordinance (as before:) but calls in queſtion the judgement and practice of all thoſe grave, able, and godly Divines, who have in theſe <note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Philpots</hi> letter hereafter cited.</note> ſixteen hundred years, received thouſands of Infants, as Members into the viſible Church, by Baptiſm, (and are now Saints in the Church triumphant) and yet now muſt be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118898:32"/>
and made void with a word, to call it misbaptiſm; and thus nullifie the Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt, Infant baptiſm.</p>
               <p>And Brethren, I call this dipping, or Rebaptizing, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt action, becauſe I could tell you (the name) of a Gentleman of credit, who by accident, comming by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (at <hi>Stony-Wear</hi>) where a Woman was to be rebaptized, ſtayed to ſee the manner (or rather immodeſty) of it, and did in the action, ſee her nakedneſs. And upon <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 18 th of <hi>June,</hi> 1657. When Mr. <hi>Ewin</hi> and Mr. <hi>Symſon,</hi> dipped two men and five Women, the nakedneſs of one of the women, in this action of dipping, was ſeen above her knees. For this there are many witneſſes. Is this an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? Its an uncivil immodeſt action, let us abhorre it; and let us all take heed, that we be not by <note n="*" place="margin">Conſider, that Seducers have not only a faculty to deceive us, but there is in their flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a power to force, <hi>Prov</hi> 7.21. with much fair ſpeech, ſhe cauſed him to yield, with the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of her lips ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him.</note> drawing words, and fair ſpeeches, cheated of our Religion.</p>
               <p>Well Friends, let us about again, and take that counſel from the Lord himſelf, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.16. Thus ſaith the Lord, ſtand you in the wayes and ſee, and ask for the old paths, which is the good way, and walk therein, and you ſhall find reſt for your ſouls.</p>
               <p>Friends, take heed, and be not deceived by this Sect. For its the obſervation of many godly Divines, that where this prevaileth, God doth uſually follow it with ſome ſad Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The ſtory of <hi>Munſter,</hi> hath ſufficiently ſet them forth. Oh! the Rapes, the Poligamy, the murders that were there committed, which I thought to make ſome brief Relation of, but I would avoid tediouſneſs, and, to help you further to lamentation, ſhall leave the Reader to the Story it ſelf. For though an Anabaptiſt in print tells you, the Argument of <hi>Munſter</hi> hath been ſo oft preſt, that its wore thred-bare, (he dares not ſay, 'tis not true) yet let me tell you, that its to be feared, had theſe men power, they would make this thred-bare Argument cotton again. And they begin to talk al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, <hi>A</hi> Commiſſion-Officer in <hi>Ireland</hi> (and that no mean one neither, but now out of Commiſſion) told a perſon of quality of this City, (he diſcourſing with him, about their dipping or rebaptizing there in that Nation) that though
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118898:33"/>
for a while they did forbear, yet, if we did not come about to them, to be rebaptized, they ſhould look upon us, as they did upon the Rebels of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Brethren, you ſee what is ſpoken, and one man may ſpeak the ſence of a great many, and its no hard matter to inſtance action (towards it) as well as words <note n="*" place="margin">See the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingdon,</hi> by <hi>W.

And truly, ſome are of opinion, (and that not a few) that had this Generation power, their quarter and termes might be as bad (if not worſe) as what <hi>Nahaſh</hi> offer'd the men of <hi>Jabeſh Gilead,</hi> which was to thruſt out all their right eyes.</p>
               <p>And now truly I think, if there be any ſuch neceſſity of dipping, it may be to cool the heat of thoſe, who are exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſuch an immodeſt action, I judge not how chaſt their thoughts are at ſuch a time, but leave it to him that knowes them, but I know they are but men.</p>
               <p>But Brethren, that we may be eſtabliſhed in this bleſſed truth, and Goſpel-Ordinance of Infant Baptiſm, let us read and conſider that unanſwerable Treatiſe of Godly Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> about it: and I alſo recommend Mr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Infant Baptiſm, and another Goſpel-Ordinance (in which they that fear the Lord, have much communion with him) to wit, ſinging of Pſalms. The Book is of no great price, I deſire a ſerious reading of the 10, 11, 12, &amp; 15 Chapters, where this godly man, though dead, yet ſpeaketh, to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction (I ſuppoſe) of every ſober Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>And Brethren, I ſhall to this, cloſe with deſiring a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reading of a letter, of that eminent Chriſtian, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Martyr of the Lord, Mr. <hi>John Philpot,</hi> who ſealed, amongſt other truths, this (truth alſo) of Infant Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>The Letter is an Anſwer to a young man, that ſeemed to ſtumble at Infant Baptiſm, where you have in ſhort, Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſufficient, againſt all the Adverſaries of this truth: And in this Letter, he proveth the Baptiſm of Infants, from the Apoſtles practice; and tells us of one <hi>Auxentius,</hi> who was one of the <hi>Arian</hi> Sect, that firſt deny'd the Baptiſm of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; and next after him, <hi>Pelagius</hi> the Heretick; and in our dayes (ſaith he) the Anabaptiſts (be not offended, its

               <p>Upon the 5th of <hi>February,</hi> 1656. one <hi>Lewes Harris,</hi> a Quaker, having been in the Countrey, came home to his Houſe in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and there meets with one <hi>William Hill,</hi> a Brother of that Fryery, who (amongſt other diſcourſe, askt the ſaid <hi>Harris,</hi> why he ſell from his principles (meaning as
