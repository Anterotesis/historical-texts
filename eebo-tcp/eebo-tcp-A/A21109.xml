         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To which point, if we doe but a little cast our eye, forsomuch as the maker of this law is <hi>Christ our Lord,</hi> he that is <hi>the Sonne</hi> of God, and <hi>wisedome</hi> of the Father: he by whom

In lawes made by men, wee may euer sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their soundnesse, and therefore as men that are to buy wares, will view them well before they bargaine for feare of deceipt; or that are to receiue money, will trie it well least else they take crackt for currant, and base for good coyne: it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, that wee examine and prooue them well by this and other rules of perfection, before wee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue and practise them; assured, that it is said in this case no lesse then in any other,<note place="margin">1.

            <p>This sheweth vs likewise the large extent that this law hath,<note place="margin">2.

By which note alone, wee must acknowledge them, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, so to excell the one the other, no lesse then doth the soule the body, heauen the earth, and the euerli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>God</hi> a mortall man. This also appeareth by the obseruation subsequent, I meane the vse of this Law, which (as heereafter more at large happely we shall see) concerneth <hi>all the s

When as therefore our Sauiour saith, <hi>Doe to them,</hi> we must take it al one as if he had said, deale with them; think and imagine of them: speake to or of them, and in outward works render vnto them so as, &amp;c.

I will not stand to giue examples of this kind, as which are so obuious to euery eye, that with ease enough they may bee

seene. Onely hasting to passe this point, 1. I aduise e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man to take heede he deceiue not his owne hart with the shadow of equitie in stead of the substance. 2. I assume the premisses onely considered,<note place="margin">

So that he hath need to pray with the Prophet,<note place="margin">Psal. 19.12.</note>

            <p>From the matter I come to the <hi>manner</hi> of doing,<note place="margin">2. Manner, and that 1. Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely. 2.

            <p n="1">1. The sense is not, That we should doe to others what we will,<note place="margin">Negatiuely. 1.

Our will is now like a blind man groaping his way, and therefore must be guided: or rather like an vntamed horse, that knowes no pace, and can keepe no path, and therefore it must with the bit of <hi>Religion</hi> be curbed, with the reines of <hi>reason</hi> be ruled, and with the hand of <hi>discretion</hi> be held aright.

And among men but of inferior place, so licentious is the age and time wherein we doe liue, a man may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times heare verie peremptorie tearmes, as, May I not vse mine owne childe, mine owne Seruant, as pleaseth me? It is mine owne Money that I spend, mine owne goods that I waste, and what hath any to doe therewith? &amp;c. But surely such sayings sound ill in the mouth of a Christian, who should know, That there is but one absolute Lord, <hi>The Lord of the Vineyard,</hi>

If this were a current course, then many times we should do euill to others in stead of good. If this were the rule, I suppose it would bee obserued more then now it is. For euen now though it be not the rule, yet as if it were the rule of Equitie, and the right course, many doe excuse and seeke to iustifie themselues thereby. Why? What haue I done? I haue vsed him, but as he did me. Such bread as hee brake to me, haue I broken to him againe, &amp;c. as who would say, In doing but so, they had done but well. Hence it comes, that many are so readie, if they be stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to strike againe: if they be euill spoken off, or euill spoken to, to speake euill againe: if they be hurt, to hurt againe: if defrauded, to defraud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: and that it is growne by common practise to a common prouerbe, <hi>Fallere fallentem non est fraus, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>But thus it ought not to be. For this wee haue
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18996:10"/>
no warrant at all. Gods Law condemnes it. <hi>Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense to no man</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>malum pro maelo:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12.17. 1. Pet. 3.9.</note> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill for euill, or rebuke for rebuke. Also our Sauiour before, <hi>If any man take away thy coate,</hi> what then? take thou away his for it?<note place="margin">Math. 5.40.</note> No, rather <hi>let him haue thy cloak also.</hi> And, <hi>If any giue thee a blow on the cheeke,</hi> what?

But what speake I of Gods Law in this case? Mans law also condemneth this course. For what Nation is there whose Lawes ordinarilie hold it not vnlawfull for priuate persons <hi>retaliare,</hi> to repay (in euill) like for like. And not onely so, but by the very light of nature the Philosophers heathen-wise <hi>somtimes</hi> saw it was our dutie, not onelie not to doe euill for euill, but that we ought likewise <hi>to doe good for euill.</hi> Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that <hi>Xenophon</hi> when one railed at him,<note place="margin">

            <p>Learne we then, learne we I say this lesson from hence, That it is naught, vngodly, vnnaturall, and not warrantable <hi>to doe to others</hi> alwaies <hi>as they doe to vs:</hi> and therefore know we, it is no good excuse, no iust ground why to doe euill to any.

<q>The very lacke, and the onely want of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration and course in mens proceedings and dealings one with another, is one maine and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary cause of so much violence and wrong, deceit and fraud, slander and reproach: and in a word, of all the vniust and iniurious dealing, the vnhonest and intemperate courses that be in the world, while men can consider and conceiue rightly enough, what they would haue other men <hi>to doe to themselues,</hi> but not <hi>versa vice</hi> what they ought to do <hi>to others.</hi>

out of his way into another mans possession to take spoile or prey there-hence, according to the qualitie of the fact, he was either beaten in his own sight with cudgels, or scourged with rods, or put to death: or, if happely the dignity of the person ouerswayed these penalties, he was sharply rebuked, the Emperor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe saying vnto him, <q>
                  <hi>Visne hoc in agro tuo fieri, quod in alieno feceris?</hi> Wouldst thou be content another man should haue made such spoile &amp; wast in thy ground, or in thy vineyard, as thou hast done in this mans? &amp;c.</q> And hee did often vtter that notable sentence, which he had learned of some Christians, to be one of their lawes: and when he corrected any, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it to be proclaimed by a Cryer, <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris:</hi> what thou wouldst not haue to be done to thy selfe, that do not to another. Which sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence (saith he) he so much delighted in, that both in his pallace at home, and in publike places abroad, as of iudgement and other like, he ordained it should be written vp or painted, for all men to reade and doe thereafter.

And it is their fault likewise, that so many kings and princes, so many gouernours and rulers among the people, haue beene so laborious in penning and publishing good and holesome lawes as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well for our conuersation as for our religion. For had they not had both <hi>precept</hi> and <hi>president from them,</hi> no doubt they would haue beene more sparing and lesse diligent that way.

            <p n="3">3. Let vs consider well, first the natiue dulnesse of mans heart, and the blindnesse of his vnderstanding, specially in spirituall and good things: and then the peruersenesse of his will, the backwardnesse or rather vntowardnesse of his nature, vnto either godlines or goodnesse: so shall we see, That not only this Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is not sufficient, vnlesse it be <hi>to his condemnation,</hi> and to take away all excuse from him, but likewise that all those helpes, which <hi>God</hi> knowing our wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; weakenes both, hath added thereto, out of the Law &amp; Prophets, in the vse of his word &amp; Ministerie, and in the care and indeauour of the higher powers by humane lawes and policie, are all little enough.</p>

Who is he, that can not tell you at his fingers end, how ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man should vse him, and what he should in this and that case doe to and for him: but change the person, and say to him, as <hi>Christ</hi> to the Lawyer, <hi>Vade &amp; tu,</hi>

            <p>Then for the other point, I meane our peruersenes and vnaptnes vnto good, who sees not, who knowes not, That neither the instructions &amp; directions, the exhortations and admonitions, the reprehensions and comminations of the Prophets, Preachers and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of <hi>God,</hi> some while with the sweete promises of Gods mercies and blessings perswading and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: some while with the sharpe threats of Gods iudgements and cursings terrifying and enforcing: nor yet the ecclesiasticall censures of the Church

That therefore which these say, This one sentence were enough for all; <hi>Doe as thou wouldest be done to,</hi> is easier vttered then prooued, and sooner said then performed. It were enough, if euery man did, or could, or would vnderstand and apply it well. It were enough, if we were al as prone and apt to <hi>good,</hi> as we are to euill. But beeing, as we are, so blind and bad, both this short remembrance, and those many and long additions and helpes are (for their successe and operation) all too little and too few.

               <note place="margin">The Kings Maiesties speech at white hall. Anno. 1609.</note> 
               <hi>First, I could wish, it were written in our owne vulgar language: for now it is an old, mixt, and corrupt language, only vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by Lawyers, whereas euerie subiect ought to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the law vnder which he liues. For since it is our plea against the Papists, that the language in Gods seruice, ought not to be in an vnknowen tongue, according to the rule in the law of</hi> Moses.<note place="margin">Num. 15.38.</note> 
               <hi>That the law should be written in the fringes of the Priests garment,</hi>

               <hi>and should be publiquely read in the eares of all the people: so me thinkes ought our law to bee made as plaine as can be to the people, for that the excuse of ignorance may be taken from them, for not conforming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues thereunto.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>And lastly, <hi>There bee in the common law diuerse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie Reports and Presidents: and this Corruption doth likewise concerne the statutes and Acts of Parliament, in respect there are diuerse</hi> Crosse <hi>and</hi> Cuffing <hi>statutes; and some so penned, as they may be taken in diuers, yea, contrarie senses. And therefore I would wish both these statutes and Reports, aswell in the Parliament as common Law, to be once maturely reviewed, and reconciled. And that not only all</hi> Contrarieties <hi>should be scraped out of the bookes: but also that euen such penal statutes as were made but for the vse of the time, (from breach whereof no man can bee free) which doe not agree with the condition of this our time, might like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise bee left out of our bookes.

            <p>We deny not, but that some Prohibitions, (<hi>P. de iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</hi>) be necessarie as a pale or partition wall betwixt the 2. Iurisdictions, ecclesiasticall and temporall, to keepe, as banks each riuer within its owne channell; each cause within its owne court: and we easily grant that there is and must be a twofold Iurisdiction. But till the one bee so confined and limited, that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude not nor vsurpe vpon the other: and (which is the thing we specially complaine of) vntill the meanes of Limitation, bee onely such, or at least onely so vsed, as may performe their proper and right vse and originall intention, and bee not made (as <hi>Prohibitions de facto</hi> commonly fall out to be) as sluces that conuey all water to one Mill, meanes to

bring all causes into one Court, wee can hope of no tollerable condition, nor acknowledge that men doe to vs <hi>as they would be done vnto.</hi> So that (to conclude) better were it for vs, <hi>rebus sic stantibus,</hi> that our causes <hi>for Tythes</hi> were translated wholly from the one into the other iurisdiction.

Well worthy are you to beare the losse and lacke of their labours, and not worthy to reape better fruite, which sustaining such hurt, see the cause, and seeke not the remedie; more, are the cause and will not be the amendment.
I verily beleeue, many of you are ashamed to see in what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurious case and needie state (many of) your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters do liue: and therefore I wonder how either your eyes can be so blind, as not to see, or your hearts so hardned, as (seeing it) not to redresse the cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <q>The law of <hi>God bids you</hi>: no law of mans <hi>forbids you</hi> to doe it: and yet, as if either you ought not, or else dared not, you leaue it vndone.</q> In ill doing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you can be ready to runne one before another, and to encourage and draw-on one the other: how commeth it then to passe, that in <hi>weldoing</hi> all are so backward, euery one is so afraid to be foremost, and (in manner) none willing to be a leader, or an ensam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the rest?

contrary to this course.
