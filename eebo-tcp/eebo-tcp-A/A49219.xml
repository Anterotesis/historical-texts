         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The great ſucceſſes which it hath pleaſed God to give to the ſpiritual excitations, and the other reaſonable means which We have hitherto uſed for the Converſion of Our Subjects of the pretended Reformed Religion, do oblige Us to ſecond the motions which God has given to many of Our ſaid Subjects to acknowledge the errour wherein they were born; We therefore have reſolved to Repeal ſome things in Our Declaration of the firſt of <hi>February,</hi> 1669. by which the Children of that Religion were in ſome ſort hindred to convert themſelves to the Catholick Apoſtolick and <hi>Roman</hi> Religion after the age of Seven years (in which they are capable of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and choice, in a matter ſo important to them as is that of their Salvation) till the Males were of the age of Fourteen years, and Females of the age of Twelve; though in the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and in the other Edicts made in favour of the pretended Reformed Religion, there is no ſuch proviſion made. And this being a thing of which it is neceſſary for Us to take care, <hi>For theſe Reaſons,</hi> and for other Conſiderations moving Us thereunto, We have ſaid and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and do ſay and declare by theſe Preſents ſigned with Our Hand, And it is Our Will and Pleaſure, that Our ſaid Subjects of the pretended Reformed Religion, both Males and Females, having attained to the age of Seven years, may lawfully embrace the Catholick Apoſtolick and <hi>Ronan</hi> Religion. And to that effect they ſhall be admitted to make abjuration of the pretended Reformed Religion, ſo as that their Fathers or Mothers may not give any hindrance to it upon any pretence whatſoever. And to that effect, We repeal ſo much as concerns this point in Our ſaid Declaration of the firſt of <hi>February,</hi> 1669. Beſides, We Will that the ſaid Children that ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted after the age of Seven years compleat, ſhall enjoy the effect of Our Declaration of the Fourteenth of <hi>October,</hi> 1665. And that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it, it ſhall be left to their choice, after their Converſion, either to return to live and be bred up in the ſame houſe with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Mothers, or to go elſewhere; and to demand of them a Penſion for their Subſiſtence proportionably to their condition and abilities; which Penſion their ſaid Fathers and Mothers ſhall be bound to pay to their Children quarterly: And in caſe they ſhall refuſe to do it, Our Will is, that they ſhall be compelled to it by all due and reaſonable ways. And We being informed that many of Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the ſaid pretended Reformed Religion, have ſent their Children to be bred in Forrein Countries, by which they may receive Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes contrary to the State, and the Fidelity which they owe Us by their birth, We do require them moſt expreſly to recal them without delay under the following pains, that thoſe who have Eſtates in Lands ſhall forfeit their whole Revenue during the firſt year, and a moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their ſaid Revenue during all that time that they ſhall keep their Children in forrein Countries. And for thoſe who have no Eſtates in Lands, they ſhall be obliged to recal their ſaid Children under the pain of a Fine, which ſhall be determined proportionably to their Goods and Abilities. And they ſhall be obliged to make payments of their ſaid Revenues and Fines every year, till they have recalled their Children. We prohibit Our Subjects of the ſaid pretended Reformed Religion to ſend for the future their Children into forrein Countries, to be educated in them, before they are Sixteen years old, without Our expreſs leave, under the pains above-mentioned. We do alſo <hi>Give in Charge</hi> to our beloved and faithful Counſellors that conſtitute Our Court of Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> that they make theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to be read, publiſhed, regiſtred, and executed according to their Form and Tenour, without ſuffering them to be contravened in any ſort or manner whatſoever: for ſuch is Our pleaſure. In witneſs whereof, We have put Our Seal to theſe Preſents.</p>

And His Majeſty likewiſe conſidering that the chief motive of the Edict of Grace, granted by the late King of glorious Memory, in the year 1629. to his Subjects of the pretended Reformed Religion, was to deface the memory of what was paſt, in hopes that his ſaid Subjects, deveſting themſelves of all paſſions, might be more capable to receive the light of the Goſpel, and to re-enter into the true Faith in which this Kingdom had continued above 1200. years. And whereas the Miniſters of the pretended Reformed Religion, do endeavour by all ſorts of Artifices to obſtruct ſo good a work, which is contrary to his Majeſties intentions; He having thereupon conſidered the Edict of 1629. together with the whole af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, His Majeſty in Council does moſt expreſly forbid all Miniſters, Elders, or others of his Subjects, profeſſing the ſaid pretended Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion, to uſe any Menaces, Intimidations, Artifices, or any fact whatſoever to hinder the Converſion of thoſe of the pretended Reformed Religion. And forbids all Miniſters and Elders to enter their houſes either by day or by night, except it be to viſit the Sick, and do other functions of their Miniſtry, under the pain of Corporal puniſhment. And His Majeſty ordains that he be informed of the violations of the ſaid Edicts, and of this preſent Order, by the diligent care of his Attorneys; and that proceſs be made againſt the guilty who ſhall violate the ſame, by the Judges to whom the Cognizance of it ought to belong.</p>

            <p>WHile our Enemies are every where pulling down our Churches, they procure an Edict, that our Miniſters may not viſit us in our houſes; and ſo they intend to take from us the exerciſe of our Religion both in private and publick. I need not acquaint you with the slight pretences that ſerve to procure a condemnation of our Churches; how weak ſoever it is in Law, and how weakly ſoever it is proved, yet every thing alleadged againſt us is ſufficient. Every complaint made of our Miniſters is believed. We have no more any humane confidence to depend upon: We are impriſoned, and kept there without any thing objected to us. Our Enemies will not be ſo kind as to make us feel all their rage at once, and make us die a ſingle death, but intend to famiſh us, and make us die of hunger; and that not onely of the Word of the Lord, by depriving us of our Churches and Paſtors, but even of our daily bread. In all theſe our ſufferings, we cannot be accuſed of one act of rage againſt our Enemies, or of diſloyalty to our King. And now our miſeries encreaſe upon us, for an Edict is coming out, that our Children at Seven years old may change their Religion. We know what will follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us; and that our buſie Enemies will be every where tempting our little ones; ſo that we dare no more reprove or chaſtize them for their faults, leſt we thereby drive them to renounce our holy Faith at an age in which they cannot diſtinguiſh truth from falſhood, nor good from evil. We have nothing left us but to fly to God by Faſting, Mourning, and Prayer; and who knows if he will turn theſe evils from us? In which we humbly beg the aſſiſtance of all our Brethrens Prayers.</p>
