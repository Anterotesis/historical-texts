         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>AS I live Gentlemen, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd how any Piece could be made such minc't meat as this hath been by a twice-printed Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, which I find flying abroad to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse the <hi>Author,</hi> who long since tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling for Companies-sake, with a Friend into the Low-Countreys, would needs for his own Recreation, write this Essay of them, as he then found them: I am sure as far from ever thinking to have it publick, as he was from any private spleen to the Nation, or any person in it; for I have moved him often to Print it, but could never get his consent, his modesty ever esteeming it among his <hi>Puerilia,</hi> and (as he said) a piece
<pb facs="tcp:49755:3"/>
too light for a Prudential man to publish: th truth is, it was meerly occasional in his youth, and the time so little, that he had for observation (his stay there not being above three weeks) that it could not well be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, he should say more, and though the former part be joculary and spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, yet the seriousness of the latter part renders the Character no way injurious to the people. And now find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some ruffled Feathers only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented for the whole Bird, and having a perfect Copy by me, I have presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to trespass so much upon the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> as to give it you (in vindication of him) so as I am confilent it was dressed by his own Pen. And after I have begged his Pardon for exposing it without his Warrant, I shall leave you to judg by comparing this and the former Impressions, whether or no he hath not been abused sufficiently.</p>

They are the Ingredients of a black Pudding,

and want only stirring together. Marry 'tis best making on't in a dry Summer, else you will have more blood then grist; and then have you no way to make it serve for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, but to tread it under <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Torrida,</hi> and so dry it for Turfs.</p>
                  <p>Sayes one, it affords the people one commodity beyond all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Regions; if they die in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, they are so low, that they have a shorter cut to Hell then the rest of their Neighbours. And for this cause, perhaps all strange Religions throng thither, as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclining towards their (en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Besides, their Riches shews them to be <hi>Pluto's</hi> Region, and you all know what part that was which the Poets did of old assign him. Here is <hi>Seyx, Acheron, Cecytus,</hi> and the rest of those muddy streams
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49755:4"/>
that have made matter for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers. Almost every one is a <hi>Charon</hi> here, and if you have but a <hi>Naulum</hi> to give, you cannot want or Boat or Pilot. To confirm all, let but some of our Separatists be asked, and they shall swear that the <hi>Elizian Fields</hi> are there.</p>
                  <p>It is an excellent Countrey for a despairing Lover: for every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner affords him Willow to make a Garland on; but if Justice doom him to be hang'd on any other Tree, he may in spight of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence live long and confident.

                  <p>The oile is all fat, though want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the colour to shew it so; for indeed it is the buttock of the World, full of veins and blood, but no bones in't. Had <hi>St. Steven</hi> been condemn'd to suffer here, he might have been alive at this day; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be in their paved Cities, gold is a great deal more plentiful then stones, except it be living ones; and then for their heaviness you may take in almost all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a singular place to fat Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys in. There are Spiders as big as Shrimps, and I think as many. Their Gardens being moist, abound with these. No creatures; fo<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>You may travel the Countrey though you have not a guide: for you cannot baulk your road with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the hazard of drowning. There is not there any use of an Harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Wheresoever men go the way is made before them. Had they Cities large as their walls, <hi>Rome</hi> would be esteemed a bable. 20 miles in length is nothing for a Waggon to be hurried on one of them, where if your fore-man be sober, you may travel in safety, otherwise you must have stronger faith then <hi>Peter</hi> had, else you sink immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. A starting horse endangers you to two deathe at once, breaking of your neck, and drowning.</p>

If your way be not thus, it hangs in the water, and at the approach of your Waggon shall shake as if it were Ague strucken. <hi>Duke d' Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va's</hi> taxing of the tenth penny frighted it into a <hi>Palsey,</hi> which all the <hi>Mountebancks</hi> they have bred since could never tell how to cure.</p>

                  <p>Their houses, especially in their Cities, are the best eye-beauties of their Countrey. For cost and sight they far exceed our <hi>English,</hi> but they want their magnificence.

                  <p>Their Artists for these are as rare as thought, for they can paint you a fat hen in her feathers; and if you want the language, you may learn a great deal of Dutch by their signs; for what they are, they ever write under them.

                  <p>Their beds are no other then land-cabins, high enough to need a ladder or stairs. Up once, you are walled in with Wainscot, and that is good discretion to avoid the trouble of making your will every night; for once falling out else would break your neck perfectly.

They speak more, and do less; yet doth their blood boil high, and their veins are full, which argues strongly that when they will they may take up the custom of entertaining stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. And having once done it, I believe they will be notable; for I have heard they trade more for love then money, but 'tis of the sport not the man, and therefore when they like the pastim they will reward the Gamester; otherwise their gross feed and clownish bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hath spoiled them from being

                  <p>'Tis the Fair of all the Sects, where all the Pedlers of Religion have leave to vent their toys, their Ribands, and phanatick Rattles. And should it be true, it were a cruel brand which <hi>Romists</hi> stick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. For (say they) as the <hi>Camelion</hi> changes into all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours but white: so they admit

of all Religions but the true; for the <hi>Papist</hi> only may not exercise his in publick: yet his restraint they plead is not in hatred but ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, because the <hi>Spaniard</hi> abridges the <hi>Protestant.</hi> And they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shew a little spleen, then not cry quit with their enemy.

                  <p>Had <hi>Logicians</hi> lived here first, Father and Son had never passed so long for Relatives.

                  <p>Their apparel is civil enough and good enough, but very uncomly, &amp; has usually more stuffe then shape. Only their <hi>Huykes</hi> are commodious in winter; but 'tis to be lamented, that they have not wit enough to lay them by when Summer comes.</p>
                  <p>Their women would have good faces if they did not mar them with making. Their <hi>Ear-wyers</hi> have so nip: in their Cheeks, that you

would think some Fairy, to do them a mischief, had pincht them behind with tongs. These they dress, as if they would shew you all their wit lay behind, and they needs would cover it. And thus ordered, they have much more forehead then face.</p>
                  <p>They love the <hi>EnglishGentry</hi> well; and when Soldiers come over to be billeted among them, they are <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulous</hi> in chusing of their guest, who fares much the better for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liked by his <hi>Hostess.</hi>

If you look lower; she's a Monkey chain'd about the middle, and had rather want it in diet, then not have silver links to hang her keys in.</p>
                  <p>Their Gowns are fit to hide great bellies, but they make them shew so unhandsom that men do not care for getting them. Marry this you shall find to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, their smocks are ever whiter then their skin.</p>

But if the child be dead, there is thrust out a Nosegay tied to a sticks end; perhaps for an emblem of the life of man, which may wither as soon as born; or else to let you know, that though these fade upon their gathering, yet from the same stock, the next year a new shoot may spring.</p>
                  <p>You may rail at us for often changing; but I assure you with them is a great deal more follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fashion; which they will plead for as the ignorant Laity for their faith. They will keep it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their Ancestors lived in it. Thus they will rather keep an old

fault though they discover errors in it, then in an easie change to meet a certain remedy.</p>
                  <p>For their diet, they eat much and spend little: When they set out a Fleet to the <hi>Indies,</hi> it shall live three months on the Offals, which we here fear would surfeit our swine, yet they feed on't, and are still the same <hi>Dutchmen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In their houses Roots and Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish are Staple-commodities. If they make a feast and add flesh, they have Art to keep it hot more days, then a <hi>Pigs-head</hi> in <hi>Py-cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> Salt meats and four <hi>Cream</hi> they hold him a fool that loves not, only the last they correct with Sugar, and are not half so well pleased with having it sweet at first, as with letting it four, that they may sweeten it again, as if a woman were not half so pleasing

being easily won, as after a scold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fit she comes by man to be calmed again.</p>
                  <p>Fish indeed they have brave and plentiful; and herein practice hath made them Cooks as good as ere <hi>Luculbus</hi> his latter Kitchin had, which is some recompence for their wilfulness, for you can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pray nor buy them to alter their own Cookery.</p>
                  <p>To a feast they come readily, but being set once you must have pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. They are longer eating meat then we preparing it. If it be to supper, you conclude timely when you get away by day-break. They drink down the evening. Starre, and drink up the morning Starre. At those times it goes hard with a stranger, all in courtesie will be drinking to him, and all that do so he must pledge: till he doth,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49755:23"/>
the fill'd Cups circle round his Trencher, from whence they are not taken away till emptied. For though they give you day for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet they will not abate the sum. They sit not there as we in <hi>England,</hi> men together, and women first, but ever intermingled with a man between: and instead of March-panes, and such juncates, 'tis good manners if any be there, to carry away a piece of Apple-Py in your pocket.</p>
                  <p>The time they there spend, is in eating well, in drinking much, and prating most. For the truth is, the compleatest drinker in <hi>Europe</hi> is your English Gallant. There is no such Consumer of liquor as the Quaffing off of his Healths. Time was the <hi>Dutch</hi> had the better of it; but of late he hath lost it by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting too long over his pot. He sips,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49755:23"/>
and laughs, and tells his tale, and in a Tavern is more prodigal of his time then his wine. He drinks as if he were short-winded; and as it were eats his drink by morsels, rather besieging his brains then assaulting them. But the <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> charges home on the sudden, swallows it whole, and like a hasty tide, fills and flows himself till the mad brain swims, and tosses on the hasty fume. As if his Liver were burning out his stomach, and he striving to quench it, drowns it. So the one is drunk sooner, and the other longer. As if striving to recover the wager, the <hi>Dutchman</hi> would still be the perfectest soker.</p>

                     <p>For war they are Grashoppers, and without a King go forth in bands to conquer Kings.

above 100 Ensigns, the Admiral of <hi>Arragon</hi> a prisoner. The very fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of the Arch Duke's own Chamber and Cabinet, yea, the signet that belonged to his hand.</p>
                     <p>In 1607. they assailed the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mado</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> in the Bay of <hi>Gibral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> under covert of the Castle and Towns Ordnance, and with the loss of 150, slew above 2000, and ruined the whole Fleet.

                     <p>For industry, they are <hi>Spiders,</hi> and are in the Palaces of Kings.

In all their Manufactures they hold a truth and constancy, for they are as fruits from Trees, the same every year that they are at first; Not Apples one year and Crabs the next; and so for ever after.

                     <p>The Depravation of Manners they punish with contempt, but the defects of Nature they favor with charity.

Poverty and Madness do both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit handsomly.

                     <p>And this he speaks of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in general: nor was the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Romans</hi> less worthy in particular concerning these lower Provinces, which made them for their valor and warlike minds stile them by the name of <hi>Gallie Belgica,</hi> and especially of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavians,</hi> which were the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and part of <hi>Guelders.</hi> You may hear in what honourable terms he mentions them, where speaking of the several people of <hi>Germany,</hi> he says, <hi>Omnium harum Gentium vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute praecipui Batavi: Nam nec tribucis contemnuntur, reepublica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus atterit: exempti oneribu &amp; Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationibus, &amp; tantum in usum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorum siposit, velut tela atque Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Bellisreservantes,</hi> Of all these
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49755:31"/>
Nations the prineipal in valiant vertue are the <hi>Batavians;</hi> for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they become despleable by paying of tribute, nor oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed too much by the Farmor of publick Revenues, but free from taxes and contributions of servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; they are specially set apart for the fight, as Armor and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons only reserved for War.</p>
                     <p>All this even at this day they seem to make good. For of all the world they are the people that thrive and grow rich by the war, like the <hi>Porepisce,</hi> that plays in the storm, but at other times keeps sober under the water.</p>
                     <p>War which is the worlds ruine, and ravins upon the beauty of all, is to them prosperity and ditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And surely the reason of this is their strength in shipping, the open Sea, their many sortified
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49755:32"/>
Towns and the Country by reason of its lowness and plentifull irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guation becoming unpassable for an army when the winter but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches. Otherwise it is hardly possible that so small a parcell of Mankind, should brave the most potent Monarch of Christendom, who in his own hands holds the Mines of the wars sinews Money, and hath now got a command so wide, that out of his Dominions the Sun can neither rise nor set.</p>
                     <p>The whole seventeen Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not above a thousand Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish miles in circuit. And in the States hands there is not 7 of those. Yet have they in the field some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 60000 Souldiers, besides those which they always keep in Garrison, which cannot be but a considerable number neer thirty thousand more. There being in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49755:32"/>
the whole Countries above two hundred wall'd Towns and Cities. So that if they have people for the War, one would wonder where they should get mony to pay them; They being, when they have an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the field, at a thousand pound a day charge extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</p>
                     <p>To maintain this, their Excise is an unwasted Mine, which with the Infiniteness of their Traffick, and their untired industry, is by every part of the World in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other contributed to.</p>
                     <p>The Sea yields them by two sorts of Fish only, <hi>Herrings</hi> and <hi>Cod,</hi> six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand pound <hi>per annum;</hi> for which they go out sometimes se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight hundred boats at once, and for greater ships, they are able to set out double the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:49755:33"/>
Their Merchandise amounted in <hi>Guiceiardinis</hi> time to fourteen millions <hi>per annum.</hi> Whereas <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which is in compass almost as large again, and hath the Ocean as a Ring about her, made not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove six millions yearly; so sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous are these Bees to labour and enrich their Hive.</p>
                     <p>As they on the Sea, so the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are busie on land in weaving of Nets, and helping to adde to the heap. And though a husbands long absence might tempt them to lascivious ways; yet they hate adultery, and are resolute in Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial chastity. I do not remember that ever I read in Story, of any great Lady of that nation, that hath bin taxt with loosness. And questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onless 'tis their ever being busie, makes them have no leisure for lust</p>
                     <p>'Tis idleness that is <hi>Cupids</hi>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:49755:33"/>
Nurse; but business breaks his Bow, and makes his arrows use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</p>
                     <p>They are both Merchants and Farmers. And there act parts, which men can but discharge with us. As if they would shew that the Soul in all is masculine, and not varied into weaker sex as are the bodies that they wear about them.</p>
                     <p>Whether this be from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their Country, in which if they be not laborious they cannot live; or from an Innate Genius of people by a Superiour Providence adapted to them of such a situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; from their own inclination addicted to parsimony; from cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome in their way of breeding; from any Transcendency of active parts more than other Nations; or from being in their Country, like people in a City besieged,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49755:34"/>
whereby their own vertues do more compact and fortifie; I will not determine. But certainly in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral they are the most painful and diligent people on earth: And of all other the most truly of <hi>Vespasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> opinion, to think, that <hi>Ex re qualibet bonus odor lucri;</hi> Be it rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from what it will, the smell of gain is pleasant.</p>
                     <p>Yet they are in some sort Gods, for they set bounds to the Sea: and when they list let it pass them. Even their dwellings is a miracle. They live lower then the fishes. In the very lap of the floods, and incircled in their watry arms. They are the <hi>Israelites</hi> passing through the Red Sea. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wall in them, and if they set ope their sluces shall drown up their enemies.</p>
                     <p>They have strugled long with
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49755:34"/>
                        <hi>Spains Pharaoh,</hi> and they have at length inforced him to let them go. They are a <hi>Gideons</hi> Army up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the march again. They are the <hi>Indian</hi> Rat, gnawing the bowels of the <hi>Spanish Crocodile,</hi> to which they got when he gap'd to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them. They are a serpent wreathed about the legs of that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephant.</hi> They are the little sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish pricking the belly of the <hi>Whale.</hi> They are the wane of that Empire, which increas'd in <hi>Isabella,</hi> and in <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth was at full.</p>
                     <p>They are a glass wherein Kings may see that though they be So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns over lives and goods, yet when they usurp upon Gods part, and will be Kings over conscience too, they are sometimes punisht with losse of that which lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is their own. That Religion
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49755:35"/>
too fiercely urg'd is to stretch a string till it not onely jars, but cracks; &amp; in the breaking, whips (perhaps) the streiners eye out.</p>
                     <p>That an extreme taxation is to take away the hony while the Bees keep the Hive, whereas he that would Inke that, should first either burn them, or drive them out. That Tyrants in their Government are he greatest Traitors to their own States. That a desire of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too absolute is to walk upon <hi>Pinacles</hi> and the tops of <hi>Pyramides,</hi> where not only the footing is ful of hazard, but even the sharpness of that they tread on may run into their foot and wound them That too much to regrate on the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of but tickle Subjects, is to press a thom till it prick your finger. That nothing makes a more desperate Rebell than a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49755:35"/>
Prerogative inforced too far.</p>
                     <p>That liberty in man is as the skin to the body, not to be put off, but together with life. That they which will command more than they ought, shall not at last command so much as is fit.</p>
                     <p>That moderate Princes sit faster in their Regalities, than such as being but men, would yet have their power over their Subjects, as the Gods unlimited. That oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is an iron heat till it burns the hand. That to debar some States of <hi>antient Priviledges,</hi> is for a Falcon to undertake to beat a flock of Wild-geese out of the Fens. That to go about to compell a sullen reason to submit to a wilfull pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptoriness, is so long to beat a chain'd mastiffinto his kennell, till at last he turns and flies at your
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49755:36"/>
throat. That unjust policy is to shoot as they did at <hi>Ostend,</hi> into the mouth of a charged Canon, to have two Bullets returned for one. That he doth but indanger him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that riding with too weak a Bit, provokes a head-strong horse with a spur. That tis safer to meet a valiant man weaponless, then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a coward in Armor. That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a weak cause with a strong Castle, wili boil salt blood to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Itch. That 'tis better keeping a Crazy body in an equal temper, than to anger humors by too sharp a Physick.</p>
                     <p>That Admonitions from a dying man are too serious to be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. That there is nothing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that is not impossible. That a Cobler of <hi>Vlushing</hi> was one of the greatest enemies that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ever had.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:49755:36"/>
To conclude, the Country it self is a Moted Castle, keeping a Garnish of the richest Jewels of the world in't; The Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and her Princely Children.</p>
                     <p>The people in it are Jews of the New Testament that have exchanged nothing but the Law for the Gospel; and this they rather prosess then practice. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a Man of War riding at <hi>Anchor</hi> in the Downs of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For forein Princes to help them is wise self-policy. When they have made them able to defend themselves against <hi>Spain,</hi> they are at the Pale, if they enable them to offend others they go beyond it. For que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionless,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49755:37"/>
were this thorn out of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> side, he might be feared too soon to grasp his long intended Monarchy. And were the <hi>Spaniard</hi> but possessed Lord of the Low. Countreys, or had the States but the wealth and power of <hi>Spain,</hi> the rest of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> might be like people at Sea in a Ship on fire: that could only chuse wherther they would drown or burn. Now, their war is the peace of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. So <hi>Rome</hi> when busied in her civil broils, the <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> lived at rest; but those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded once, by <hi>Caesar</hi> next are they designed for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</p>
                     <p>If any man wonder at these contraries, let him look in his own body for as many several
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49755:37"/>
humors. In his own brain for as many different Fancies. In his own heart for as various passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and from all these he may learn That there is not in all the World such another Beast as <hi>Man.</hi>

                  <p>FIrst, for the Countrey, I must confess it is good for those that possess it, and too bad for others, to be at the charge to conquer it. The Air might be wholsom, but for the stinking people that inhabit it The ground might be fruitful had they wit to manure it.</p>
                  <p>Their Beasts be generally small, women only excepted, of which sort there are none greater in the whole world. There is great store of Fowl, too, as foul houses, foul sheets,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49755:40"/>
foul linen, foul dishes and pots, foul trenchers, and napkins; with which sort, we have been forced to say, as the children did with their fowl in the wilderness They have good store of fish too, and good for these that can eat it raw; but if it come once into their hands, it is worse than if it were three days old. For their Butter and Cheese, I will not meddle with I at this time, nor no man else at any time that loves his life.</p>
                  <p>They have great store of Deer, but they are so far from the place where I have been, that I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe, than go to disprove it: I confess, all the Deer I met withal, was dear Lodgings, dear Horse-meat, and dear Tobaco, and English Beer.</p>
                  <p>As sor fruit, for their Grand fire <hi>Adams</hi> sake, they never planted
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49755:40"/>
any; and for other Trees, had <hi>Christ</hi> been betrayed in this Country, (as doubtless he should, had he come as a stranger) <hi>Judas</hi> had sooner found the Grace of Repentance, than a Tree to hang himself on.</p>
                  <p>They have many hills, wherein they say is much treasure, but they shew none of it; Nature bath only discovered to them some Mines of Coal, to shew to what end he cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated them.</p>
                  <p>I saw little grass, but in their Potrage: The Thistle is not given of nought, for it is the fairest flower in their Garden. The word Hay is Heathen Greek unto them; neither man nor beast knows what it means.</p>
                  <p>Corn is reasonable plenty at this time, for since they heard of the Kings comming, it hath
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49755:41"/>
been as unlawful for the common people to eat Wheat, as it was in the old time for any, but the Priests, to eat shew-bread. They prayed much for his coming, and long fasted for his welfare; but in the more plain sense, that he might fare the better: all his followers were welcom, but his guard; for those they say are like <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> lean Kine, and threaten death wheresoever they come: They could perswade the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that oaten cakes would make them long-winded; and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Chappel they have brought to eat of them, for the maintenance of their voices.</p>
                  <p>They say our Cooks are too sawcy, and for Grooms and Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men they wish them to give to their Horses no worse then they eat themselves; they commend
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49755:41"/>
the brave mind, of the Pensioners, and the Gentlemen of the Bed-Chambers, which choose rather to go to Taverns, then to be always eating of the Kings provision, they likewise do commend the Yeomen of the Buttery and Cellar, for their readiness and silence, in that they will hear 20 knocks, before they will answer one. They perswade the Trumpeters that fasting is good for men of that quality; for emptiness, they say, causes winde, and winde causes a Trumpet to sound well.</p>
                  <p>The bringing of Heralds, they say, was a needless charge, they all know their pedigrees wel enough, and the Harbingers might have been spared, s<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ce they brought so many beds with them; and of two evils, since the least should be chosen. They wish the beds
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49755:42"/>
might remain with them, and poor Harbingers keep their places, and do their office, as they return His Hangings they desire might like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be left as Reliquos, to put them in mind of His Majesty; and they promise to dispense with the wooden Images, but for those gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Images in his new beautified Chappel, they threaten to pull down soon after his departure, and to make of them a burnt offering, to appease the indignation they imagined conceived against them in the Brest of the Almighty, for suffering such idolatry to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Kingdom; The Organ, I think, will find mercy, because (as they say) there is some affinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Bag pipes.</p>
                  <p>The Skipper that brought the singing men with their Papistical Vestments, complains that he hath
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49755:42"/>
been much troubled with a strange singing in his head, ever since they came aboard his ship. For reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whereof the Parson of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish hath perswaded him to fell that prophane Vessel, and to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the money among the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Brethren.</p>
                  <p>For his Majesties entertainment, I must needs ingeniously confess, he was received into the Parish of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> (for a City I cannot call it) with great shouts of joy, but no shews of charg for Pageants; they hold them idolatrous things, and not fit to be used in so refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a place; from the Castle they gave him som pieces of Ordnance, which surely he gave them since he was King of <hi>England,</hi> and at the entrance of the town, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented him with a golden Bason, which was carried before him on
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49755:43"/>
mens shoulders to his Palace, I think, from whence it came. His Majesty was convey'd by the Youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Town, which were about 100 Halberds, (dearly shall they rue it, in regard of the charge) to the Cress and so to the high Church where the only bell they had stood on tip toe to behold his sweet face; where I must intreat you to spare him, for an hour I lost him.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time to report the Speeches of the people concerning his never-exampled entertainment, were to make his discourse too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious unto you, as the Sermon was to those that were constrained to endure it. After the Preachment he was conducted by the same Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berds unto his Palace, of which I forbear to speak, because it was a place sanctified by his divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, only I wish it had been better
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49755:43"/>
walled for my friends sake that waited on him.</p>
                  <p>Now I will begin briefly to speak of the people according to their degrees and qualities; for the Lords Spiritual, they may well be termed so indeed, for they are neither Fish nor Flesh, but what it shall please their earthly God, the King, to make them. Obedience is better then Sacrifice, and therefore they make a mock at Martyrdom, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That Christ was to die for them, and not they for him. They will rather subscribe then surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and rather dispense with small things, then trouble themselves with great disputation; they will rather acknowledge the King to be their head, then want where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to pamper their bodies.</p>
                  <p>They have taken great pains and trouble to compass their Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49755:44"/>
and they will not leave them for a trifle; for the Deacon, whose defects will not lift them up to dignities, all their study is to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace them that have gotten the least degree above them; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot Bishop, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim they never heard of any. The Scriptures, say they, speak of Deacons and Elders, but not a word of Bishops. Their Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are full of detraction; their Sermons nothing but railing; and their Conclusions nothing but Herefies and Treasons. For their Religion they have, I confess they have it above reach, and God-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling I will never reach for it.</p>
                  <p>They christen without the Cross, marry without the Ring, receiv the Sacrament without reverence, die without repentance, and bury without divine Service; they keep
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49755:44"/>
no Holy-days, nor acknowledge any Saint but S. <hi>Andrew,</hi> who they said got that honor by presenting Christ with an oaten cake after his forty days fast. They say likewise, that he that translated the Bible was the son of a Maulster, because it speaks of a miracle done by Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-Loaves, whereas they swear they were Oaten Cakes, and that no other bread of that quantity could have sufficedso many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands.</p>
                  <p>They use no prayer at all, for they say it is needless, God knows their minds without pratling; and what he doth, he loves to do it freely. Their Sabbaths exercise, is a preaching in the forenoon, and a persecuting in the afternoon; they go to Church in the forenoon to hear the Law, and to the crags and mountains in the afternoon to louz themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:49755:45"/>
They hold their Noses if you talk of Bear-baiting, and stop their Ears if you speak of a Play: Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation they hold but a pastime, wherein mans ability is approved, and a womans fertility is discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; At Adultery they shake their heads; Theft they rail at; Murther they wink at; and Blasphemy they laugh at; they think it impossible to lose the way to Heaven if they can but leave <hi>Rome</hi> behind them.</p>
                  <p>To be opposite to the Pope, is to be presently with God; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, I am perswaded, that if God and his Angels at the last day, should come down in their whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Garments, they would run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and cry, The Children of the Chappel are come again to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment us, let us flie from the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of these boys, and hide our selves in the Mountains.</p>
                  <p>

For the Lords Temporal and spiritual, temporizing Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, if I were apt to sp ak of any, I could not speak much of them; only I must let you know they are not Scottishmen, for assoon as they fall from the breast of the beast their mother, their careful fire posts them away for <hi>France,</hi> which as they pass, the Sea sucks from them that which they have suckt from their rude dams; there they gather new flesh, new blood, new manners, and there they learn to put on their cloaths, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, into their Countreys, to wear them out; there they learn to stand, speak, discourse and congee, to court women, and to complement with men.</p>
                  <p>They spared for no cost to honor the King, nor no complemental curtesy to welcom their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;

their followers are their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows their wives their slaves, their horses their masters, and their swords their Judges; by reason whereof, they have but few labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and those not very rich: their Parliaments holo but three dayes, their Statutes three lines, and their Suits are determined in a manner in three words, or very few more, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The wonders of their Kingdom are these; the Lord Chancellor, he is believed; the Master of the Rolls, well spoken of; and the whole Councel, who are the Judges for all causes, are free from suspition of corruption. The Country, although it be mountainous, affords no Monsters but Women, of which, the greatest sort (as Countesses, and Ladies) are kept like Lions in Iron grates; the Merchants wives

are also prisoners, but not in so strong a hold; they have wooden Cages, like our Boar Franks, through which, sometimes peeping to catch the Air, we are almost choaked with the sight of them; the greatest madness amongst the men, is Jealousie; in that they fear what no man that hath but two of his sences will take from them.</p>
                  <p>The Ladies are of opinion, that <hi>Susanna</hi> could not be chast, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she bathed so often. Pride is a thing bred in their bones, and their flesh naturally abhors cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; their breath commonly stinks of Pottage, their linen of Piss, their hands of Pigs turds, their body of sweat, and their splay-feet never offend in Socks To be chained in marriage with one of them, were to be tyed to a dead carkass, and cast into a stinking ditch; Formo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49755:47"/>
and a dainty face, are things they dream not of.</p>
                  <p>The Oyntments they most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently use amongst them are Brimstone and Butter for the Scab, and Oyl of Bays, and Stave sacre. I protest, I had rather be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est servant of the two of my Pupils Chamber-maids, then to be the Master-Minion to the fairest Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess I have yet discovered. The sin of curiosity of oyntments is but newly crept inro the Kingdom, and I do not think will long continue.</p>
