         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>They writ in behalf of theſe matters to all the Provinces, and repreſented to the Generalitie, whatſoëver might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the undertaking of the Work: among the reſt, That their Provincial Debts were ſo great, that though they ſhould get their whole project of reducing charges effected, and had all their means and Revenues continued ſtill in the ſame ſtate they now were in; nevertheleſs they could not but remain every year, a whole <hi>Million</hi> in arrears, and were much deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of expedients, how to get out of debts at length. But the reſt of the Provinces returned unanimouſly advice, that there ought no more forces yet to bee caſhiered, then 55 Foot-Companies, and 20 of Horſ; allowing the caſhiered Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, an honeſt penſion or entertainment during life, and to the Colonels, each 1000 Rix-dollers <hi>per an.</hi>

                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:99708:22"/>
ſought it: That ſo many gallant <hi>Captains and Officers,</hi> as had hazarded their lives for the Land, ought not to bee ſo ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited: That it was againſt the <hi>Union,</hi> for <hi>Holland</hi> to perſiſt alone thus, to disband and caſhier the common Forces. Som alſo upbraided <hi>Holland,</hi> that they had not managed their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure well, and thereby run into ſuch arrears; Whereupon <hi>Holland</hi> remonſtrated, That for all this caſhiering, there would remain men enough in ſervice ſtill; for, ſaid they, To what end ſhall wee entertain Garriſons at <hi>Delf, Rotterdam, Goude, Dort, Schoonhoven, Schiedam,</hi> and other In-land Towns, as likewiſe at <hi>Utrecht, Campen, Deventer, Swoll, Arnbeim, Reenen, Nymeghen;</hi> in the <hi>Trieſiſh</hi> Towns, and <hi>Groninghen?</hi> That it was againſt the Union, to charge any Province a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their will, and beyond their abilitie: That many years ago they had longed to ſee a more equal proportion of raiſing means, and that many ſendings had paſt from them into the Provinces to that purpoſe, but all in vain: That they of <hi>Frieſland,</hi> had alreadie reduced and ſaved 600000 flor. yearly means; and that the ſame Province was now advantaged neer upon 200000 flor. yearly beſides; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it was evident, that <hi>Holland</hi> was too highly charged, and much over-rated.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>March</hi> there arrived a very great extraordinarie Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee out of <hi>Zealand;</hi> principally about the matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, who mainteined at firſt, there ought none to bee caſhiered at all: Wherein they had their particular Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; namely, that they, with their Province, were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Van or Front; that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſhewed themſelvs moſt implacable againſt them: Som alſo of the chiefeſt there ſought at that time to ingratiate themſelvs with the Prince, thereby to advance their particular intereſt and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs. Nevertheleſs, within a ſhort time after, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed themſelvs to the other five Provinces.</p>
                  <p>About middle <hi>March,</hi> the <hi>French, Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Officers, preſented their Requeſts, remonſtrating their old, long and faithful ſervices, and that they ought not to bee ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiered

more or ſooner then the <hi>Natives.</hi> The advice of the Prince thereupon was, that the disbanding ought to bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned equally between the one and the other, as well the Native as the Foreiner. The ſecond of <hi>April</hi> the Lords <hi>Bronckhorst, Vett, Renſwoud, Andeé, Mulart (Gronginghen,</hi> and the <hi>Omlands</hi> beeing abſent) were deputed and ſent from the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralitie, into the Aſſembly of <hi>Holland,</hi> where by a ſpeech of the Lord <hi>Bronckhorst</hi> there was endeavoured and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whatſoêver might any way conduce, to make the Lords of <hi>Holland</hi> conform themſelvs to the reſt of the Provinces.

to ſettle upon them. And the other ſix Provinces doubted not, but the States of <hi>Holland</hi> would have conformed themſelvs to this expedient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But wee are very ſorrie to understand that their Noble Mighties ſhould bee perſisting ſtill in their foreſaid points of ſaving obarges, with intention and purpoſe, to paſs and act the ſame apart, without the General Autoritie; which wee ſeriouſly regarding, and weighing the evil conſequences thereof, that in this and like matters one Province alone ſhould in oppoſition to all the rest of the confederates, undertake ſuch diſcrepant reſolutions, and the effectual proſecution of them; the rather, foraſmuch as before the determining and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding of the Treatie of peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> it was ſolemnly agreed to, with the advice of his Highneſs, and the Council of State, That a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent number of forces ſhould bee retained. Therefore wee judged it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to make this addreſs unto your Honor, that you will bee pleaſed to give notice hereof unto the Members which are to meet, either by writing or ſending to them, and thereby endeavour to perſwade the ſaid Lords the States, that, for to prevent confuſion and diſorder, they would beware how they tread into any ſeparate or particular reduction or disbanding of Forces, ſworn and committed to the Generalitie; for if this ſhould bee attempted, it would bee directly againſt the Union, the everlaſting alliance, and laudable obſervance hitherto; beſides, that ſo ſoon after the peace made, there would bee diſcovered thereby a very greet fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs in the Government of theſe Countries, and the reputation thereof mightily weakned round about. Whereas on the contrarie, this State in the times of hotteſt war, hath no leſs by the mutual unitie, then by the prosperous ſucceſs of arms, been of great esteem and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute both far and near, it being moſt plain and aſſured, that the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of a competent quantitie of Forces, is both formidable to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and cloſe enemie, and as conſiderable pleaſing and grateful to the friends and confederates. Your Honors may pleaſ herewithal to conſider, that his Highneſs and the Council of State, in framing the late new project and ſtate of war, aimed as on the one ſide at the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the State of the Land, the preſent doubtful conſtitution and occurrences of things, the <hi>neighbors</hi> round about us beeing in arms ſtill; ſo on the other ſide, at the great charges, that lie upon the respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Provinces, onely that the weightiest part beeing the preſervation
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99708:24"/>
of the whole, must needs preponderate or out-weigh the leſſer; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſix other Provinces out-went the former project, as hath been alreadie mentioned, and met thoſe of <hi>Holland</hi> a great part of their way; Which affair, beeing narrowly looked into, it will bee found, that following the advice of the ſix Provinces, there will bee one hundred Horſ, and <hi>270</hi> Foot more entertained now then were kept in ſervice, during the laſt Truce; when as ſince the expiration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it hath pleaſed Almightie God to augment, ſtrengthen, and crown the ſtate of theſe Countries with the Reduction of many Cities, and a great number of Forts; which Forts and Cities muſt needs bee beſet and kept with requiſite Garriſons, unleſs wee hold ſuch dear-bought Conqueſts ſcarce worth the keeping. And it is farther worth noting, that the whole Difference betwixt the Provincial Advices of the ſix ſaid Provinces, and that of the ſaid Province of <hi>Holland,</hi> doth charge theſe Provinces yearly with no more then about <hi>25000</hi> flor. which for ſuch a Province (which God Almightie hath ſo abundantly bleſſed with Trade, Wealth, and Prosperitie) in our apprehenſion ought to bee esteemed far leſs then the diſ-repute and miſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>understandings, which are like to ariſe moſt unexſpectedly out of the fore-named diſcrepancie, it beeing no unuſual accident, that a ſmall ſpark eaſily kindleth into a great embracement. Over and above all which conſiderations, wee conceiv likewiſe that the foreſaid Lords the States of <hi>Holland</hi> ought to ponder the love, affection, and kinde diſpoſition they owe to thoſe provinces their Confederates, who continually endured the heat and brunt of war, and whoſe inhabitants ſat daily ſo ſenſibly in the flames thereof, to eaſ &amp; reliev them now as much as may bee in regard of the burthen, which not without cauſ remain's hanging upon their ſhoulders, none knowing how ſoon or which way the like miſchiefs may light upon them again, peradventure, when it may least bee thought on from afar off by ſuch forces, of whoſe raiſing there was or could bee had but little notice, or notice beeing had, the reaſons and grounds thereof may have been diſguiſed and palliated; against which, there is otherwiſe no fence, but by providing and keeping ſufficient Garriſons in the utmost Frontiers of this State, wherein conſist's the preſervation and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of that, which through God's gracious bleſsing upon the Armies of theſe Countries, hath been purchaſed for us with ſo much expence of

                  <p>In <hi>May,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Leyden</hi> propounded, That the Provincial advices of the reſt ſhould bee followed, proviſionally for the ſpace of four months, and then to conſider and reſolv far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Hereupon the Members repaired home to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals, and returning back again, ſeemed readie to yield to the propoſition.

                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:99708:25"/>
That the Militarie and ſuch like entertainments ſhould bee regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated according to the project formerly preſented by them to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie.</p>
                  <p>That the Officers to bee caſhiered, ſhould enjoie no further enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment or penſion, beeing out of the Land-ſervice.</p>
                  <p>That the paiment for lodgings, ſhould bee ſurceaſed, becauſ of true and exact pay to bee made to the Armie.</p>
                  <p>That the Foot-Forces ſhould bee reduced from <hi>70</hi> to <hi>60</hi> men, and that there ſhould bee disbanded <hi>8</hi> Companies more of Horſ, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the former <hi>12,</hi> produce in all <hi>20</hi> Companies that may bee ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>That the Commiſsioners of the reſpective Provinces would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take or endeavour to recommend theſe matters effectually to their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals, and within the ſpace of a moneth or ſix weeks at fartheſt, procure their respective Provincial Advices upon theſe four laſt points to bee returned to the Aſſembly of the Generalitie.</p>

is no year, but the States are <hi>prayed and entreated</hi> for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the State of war, that is to ſay, of all the Armie. And verily in the midſt of war the States had power and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to continue or diſcontinue the ſame, as likewiſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other incidents of <hi>Leaguer-charges,</hi> of <hi>Subſidies to the Weſt-Indie-Companie,</hi> of <hi>caſting Ordnance,</hi> of <hi>lodging-monie,</hi> of <hi>buying ammunition, paying for Fortification,</hi> &amp;c.

The like Disbandings and Reductions, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuations have been practiſed in the very height of our wars: as immediately after the loſs of <hi>Breda,</hi> 1625. and afterwards, after the Reduction of the <hi>Boſch</hi> in 1629. and of <hi>Maſtricht;</hi> and further in the years 1640. 1642. 1647<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though I ſay, wee were in war ſtill, <hi>Holland</hi> going before, the reſt of the Provinces followed; not as if <hi>Holland</hi> thereby ſought or arrogated a ſpecial Prerogative unto her ſelf above or over the reſt; but onely doing that which all the others might have don, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſcontinuing their conſent:</hi> beeing commonly the firſt, for that they are <hi>in loco,</hi> and can alwaies bee the readieſt; and this condition of theirs beeing wholeſom and advantagious for the other Provinces, <hi>Holland</hi> in all reaſon ſhould have heartie thanks rather. However, if the other Provinces are pleaſed to continue charged, it was left to their freedoms, although it was never ſeen, but the reſt of the Provinces would alwaies in this point follow the laudable pattern of <hi>Holland:</hi> and hitherto it ſucceeded well. Beeing now in peace, what reaſon is there, that wee ſhould not diſcharge things uſeleſs and unneceſſarie. I ſee no need wee have of continuing entertainments to <hi>Governors, Colonels,</hi> and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs

companie of other <hi>Camp-Officers.

It can bee no good advice to entertain ſtrange Forces, or Troops and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of Forein Nations. When Kings and Princes bring in ſuch, it is a ſhrewd ſign they intend to tyrannize or to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an abſolute arbitrarie Government. Do not wee ſee now at this time, that <hi>Scotland</hi> (though threatned and in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by <hi>England,</hi> yet) will not ſuffer their King to bring in there any ſtrange Forces, and ſo it is likewiſe every where elſ.</p>

For ſuch unprofitable things I ſay, ſo much wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt bee foul'd now. That which is ſo Learnedly brought in, in the third Section about the <hi>true Reformed Religion,</hi> doth fit the matter as aptly as the fift wheel a Waggon.

That night they returned all to the <hi>Hague</hi> again. About the houſ <hi>Deyl,</hi> betwixt <hi>Leyden</hi> and the <hi>Hague,</hi> one of the Prince's Pages fell out with his Wain-man, whom hee unhappily ran through and kill'd, leaving a poor widow and an houſ full of ſmall children behinde him, which cauſed much diſcourſ.</p>

                  <p>It was <hi>obſerved,</hi> that as his Highneſs named the Citie of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> hee did it with a certain <hi>commotion and elevation of the Voice,</hi> yet afterwards moderated his ſpeech again.

                  <p>The <hi>States of Holland</hi> appointed a Committee, <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Nobilitie,</hi> and the five foremoſt Cities of <hi>South<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Holland, Dort, Haërlem, Delft, Leyden, Amſterdam,</hi> and of the North-Quarter, <hi>Alcmaër, Horn, Enckhuyſe,</hi> for to examine the whole Buſineſs of the foreſaid <hi>Sending,</hi> and dependance thereof; who found the ſame to conſiſt in three <hi>heads,</hi> as, 1. What was fitting to bee don in regard of <hi>Formalities</hi> about the ſaid <hi>Sending;</hi> 2. What was to bee judged of the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the foreſaid <hi>Propoſition</hi> made in the Cities of <hi>Holland.</hi> 3.

                  <p>Touching the firſt point, <hi>viz.</hi> the foreſaid <hi>Formalities,</hi> it was the opinion of the Committee, That their No: Great Mo. ought by <hi>Reſolution</hi> to diſapprove of the ſaid Sending and dependance thereof, it beeing <hi>paſt example,</hi> and againſt the order and form of Government.

                  <p>As for the ſecond point, the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> namely, contained in the foreſaid <hi>Propoſition:</hi> That there are found in the ſame in ſeveral reſpects, divers <hi>abuſive poſitions:</hi> as, 1.

                     <hi>by their Nob. gr.

                     <hi>Art.</hi> of the ſaid Councils <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> that the ſame is reſolved to belong to the <hi>Provinces.</hi> As little ground hath that which the ſaid Propoſition aver's, ſaying, <hi>That the leſsning of the Forces made by their No. gr.

Mi. as highly affect and minde, as ever any of the other Provinces did or doth) that it was ill ſaid there, <hi>the leſsning of the charges made by their No. gr. Mi. was an unheard of and new accident.</hi> Whenas it is well known to all the State, what the <hi>other Provinces</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly have undertaken and don in that kinde, and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, what <hi>Utrecht</hi> did in the <hi>hottest time of war,</hi> withdrawing themſelvs, and refuſing their <hi>Contributions</hi> for the whole af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99708:46"/>
of the <hi>Sea Coaſt-Navie,</hi> which in effect is the <hi>Leaguer for the State at Sea,</hi> and the moſt <hi>principal pillar of the Citie's wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare;</hi> as <hi>Frieſland</hi> and others alſo likewiſe have proved notably defective in that regard from time to time, beſides what is known, <hi>Frieſland</hi> did in regard of the <hi>Weſt-Indie-Companie,</hi> altogether abandoning theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, <hi>even to this day,</hi> notwithſtanding that the maintenance thereof, is the <hi>cauſ and firm aſſurance</hi> of our ſo long exſpected, dear bought <hi>peace;</hi> and the means, whereby the power of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> can beſt bee <hi>bridled.</hi> As alſo in particular, the leſsning of the Forces, hath heretofore been undertaken by ſeveral Provinces.</p>
                  <p>It was alſo the foreſaid Committee's advice, that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned <hi>diſapproving Reſolutions</hi> might bee intimated to the <hi>Generalitie,</hi> and <hi>regiſter'd</hi> there. And that withal, it was fitting to bee there likewiſe <hi>in terms</hi> declared and regiſter'd, <hi>That, for the time to com, the Cities of this Province ſhould not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit nor ſuffer any ſuch Sending or Commiſsion, to bee brought or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them:</hi> and that therefore it ſhould ſeriouſly bee urged, <hi>That the Provinces beware of laying a ground for ſuch Sendings, or</hi> ever undertaking again to put the ſame in execution, for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to bee further deduced then. That it ſhould likewiſe bee remonſtrated to the Generalitie, how among the ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of the Propoſition made, <hi>there was uſe made of many abuſive Poſitions</hi> in various reſpects, with the deduction thereof, as was briefly touched above, andcould eaſily bee particularized further.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That it was fitting, ſerious and well-grounded <hi>Letters</hi> ſhould bee written and ſent to all the Provinces, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to acquaint them with the <hi>reaſons and motives,</hi> why the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Sending</hi> was, by their No. gr. Mi. Reſolution diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and for time to com never to bee admitted or entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned again by the Cities of this Province, deducing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal, how manifold Devoirs and offers, friendly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious applications there have been made and reiterated to the <hi>Generalitie,</hi> even in <hi>preſence</hi> of his Highneſs, and his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie the Stadholder, and the Council of State, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the Provinces to an agreement with their No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gr.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99708:46"/>
good <hi>intentions;</hi> declaring that their No. gr. Mi. had never other aim nor deſign, but to disburthen the State for a time, according to the preſent opportunities, and nevertheleſs to keep a ſufficient proportion of Forces for its ſecuritie, and therwithal firmly to maintein, and more and more to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate the old confident Confederacie with all the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>That in all this, the <hi>perſon and reſpect</hi> of <hi>his Highneſs,</hi> was to bee held and maintained by them all, in high eſteem, and that this intention of their No. gr. Mi. ſhould in terms bee certified to his Highneſs himſelf in their behalf.</p>
                  <p>Upon the third point the advice was, that his Highneſs ſhould bee ſaluted from his No. gr. Mi. by the Councellor Penſionarie, and deſired, that according to his wiſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and the exact knowledg hee hath of the whole Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his Highneſs would bee pleaſed to make <hi>overture</hi> of ſuch <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> as hee judged would moſt effectually ſerv for to reduce the Provinces to a common conſent, about leſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or eaſing the charges of the State. And beſides that the ſaid Councellor Penſionarie ſhould likewiſe give his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to underſtand, that the Members of <hi>Holland</hi> were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to entertain a <hi>Conference</hi> about theſe matters with his Highneſs, that there beeing afterwards made Report of the ſucceſs thereof, ſuch further progreſs might bee made or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, as ſhould bee requiſite and fitting.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon <hi>ſeveral Conferences</hi> were held with his Highneſs, who deſired that in the firſt place and above all things, <hi>Holland</hi> ſhould recall their foreſaid diſapproving advice. Nor was there any other or further Propoſition or Project made by his Highneſs; but hee ſtuck ſtill to what formerly was reſolved and determined by their Hi. Mi. and by the Council, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, that <hi>Holland</hi> could nor ought not to do any thing to the contrarie. Saying, that for the defence of the Land there were required at the leaſt 27000 Foot, and 3000 Horſ. That the whole buſineſs of charges, ought to bee reviewed with the Council of State: that beeing don once, hee would
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99708:47"/>
make report of it to the Provinces, and that in the interim <hi>Holland</hi> ſhould continue to pay the caſhiered Companies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Friday, July</hi> 8. The Counſellor Penſionarie <hi>Cats,</hi> made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Conference held by the Committee Members with his Highneſs, relating, that after various diſcourſes of the one and the other ſide, the opinion and intention of his Highneſs was received to bee reported at the Aſſembly, in manner as followeth.</p>
                  <p>That the third Member of the Advice preſented to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Aſſemby, touching the <hi>Sending</hi> reſolved upon by the <hi>Generalitie,</hi> to the Cities of this Province, ſhould bee exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a <hi>particular Reſolution</hi> by it ſelf, and as having no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the other Members of the ſame Advice.</p>
                  <p>That his Highneſs confiding in the Committee-Members, that they will endeavor to the utmoſt to diſpoſe their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Superiors, that the buſineſs of <hi>diſapproving the foreſaid Sending</hi> to the Cities of this Province, might bee ſet apart and laid by, without <hi>preſenting</hi> of it to the Generalitie, or otherwiſe <hi>acting</hi> in it; hee could bee content, that a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee might bee appointed by their No. gr. Mi. for further Conference with him for to frame ſuch an advice together, as might bee moſt ſerviceable for the Land, about <hi>leſsning of the Souldierie,</hi> and matters depending thereon; to bee commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the Aſſembly of their No. gr. Mi., and if accepted there, overture might then bee made thereof at the <hi>Generalitie,</hi> as an advice of his Highneſs, and Conference thereupon had with the Provinces, that ſo the ſaid Work might bee ſetled at laſt, and effectually diſpatched.</p>
                  <p>That in the mean time the <hi>paiment</hi> ſhould bee continued to the diſcharged Souldierie, till ſuch time as the Provinces ſhould bee reduced to a full conſent.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore it was related by the Counſellor Penſionarie, that his Highneſs at pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:99708:47"/>
All which beeing taken into Conſideration, it was agreed, That the laſt Member of the foreſaid Advice, ſhould accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Highneſs's deſire, bee extended, as a <hi>Reſolution by it ſelf,</hi> without reflexion to any thing elſ.</p>
                  <p>And further, that the Committee-Members ſhould bee deſired, and were deſired by theſe, to make a general Report to their reſpective principals, of the foreſaid matter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, and ſo endeavor to the uttermoſt of their abilities, that their ſaid principals may bee diſpoſed to contribute that Zeal to the Work, whereby the ſame and things dependant, may commodiouſly bee directed to moſt ſervice of the Land, and beſt conſent of the Provinces, for an happie iſſue and concluſion of all. And it was further agreed, that in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim <hi>another Conference</hi> ſhould bee entertained by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of their No. gr.

                  <p>At the Deliberation, what Members ſhould bee choſen for the Conference with his Highneſs about the ſaid ſubject of leſſening the Souldierie and like matters, it was found good the Reſolution now taken, and reſumed, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that afternoon, ſhould before-hand bee communicated to his Highneſs by the Counſellor Penſionarie, and his minde known, whether it would bee acceptable to him, to enter next day following into the foreſaid Conference.</p>
                  <p>Not long after Report was made by the ſaid Counſellor Penſionarie, that his Highneſs upon the hearing of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Reſolution read, had declared, hee would bee readie to morrow to enter into Conference with the Committee of their No. gr.

by vigorous reſiſtance defeated of all their hopes of ſucceſs againſt us; it beeing undeniable, that otherwiſe, by the continuance of the charges, which cannot bee furniſhed from the Incoms, the State will and muſt needs bee ruin'd by Peace, which ought to bee the means of its recoverie; which as it were great unthankfulneſs to God, who all this while and long hot War not onely kept, but alſo enlarged it; and unanſwerable to poſteritie, that ſuch a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fabrick, which ſtood unmoveable against all the enemies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſhould by ill-truſted friends and careleſs Gardians bee ſuffered to fall at laſt to ruine: So wee have, looking on the one hand, to the Eaſ of charges, and on the other, with no leſs heed, upon the ſecuritie of the State, acquainted thereupon his Highneſs his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, and the Council of State, with our advice for the new ſtate of War, framed with that circumſpection, and preſented at laſt to the Generalitie, that wee have ſevered matters of Liberalitie from matters of Neceſsitie, and nevertheleſs in the firſt, uſed that Diſcretion, that the modestie of a diſcreet deſire might well bee content there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; and proceeded in the ſecond with that carefulneſs, that wee were no way behinde hand; but that afterwards, for compliance ſake with the other Provinces, and if it had been poſsible, to have brought all to one Conſent in this affair, Wee made offer, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding <hi>20</hi> Troops of Horſ, and <hi>55</hi> Foot-companies each of <hi>50</hi> men, and the reduction of the companies <hi>à 70</hi> to <hi>60</hi> men, wee yielded to continue the remaining forces both Horſ and Foot in ſervice, the Cuiraſſiers onely changed into Carabins; to the ſum of <hi>2700</hi> horſ and about <hi>26000</hi> foot: and although wee hoped that the upright diſcoverie, which with ſingular confidence wee made to the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Provinces, ſhewing, that wee ſhould keep a leſs num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>effectivè</hi> in ſervice, if wee took on more then wee are able to pay; whereby the State muſt needs rest leſs ſecure and conſiding in the Forces, and grow more ruinous in the Treaſurie.

and among them your Nob.

our ſelvs free from paying or contributing to ſuch charges, for the continuation whereof wee, (any of the Provinces) had declared our ſelvs once, that wee could not yield our conſent; The <hi>Provinces having no power</hi> to <hi>over-vote</hi> the one the other in matter of <hi>conſent,</hi> much leſs upon ſuch Conſent's <hi>refuſal,</hi> to <hi>force</hi> any to Contribution; of which all the Provinces, eſpecially <hi>Utrecht</hi> and <hi>Frieſland</hi> may bear witneſs; the former having in the <hi>hotteſt time of War</hi> with held their Conſents for many years together, for Subſidie to the <hi>Coaſt-Navie,</hi> the Sea-Leaguer (as it were) of the State, as the other did for Subſidie to the <hi>Weſt-Indie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Companie,</hi> the protection of the Conqueſts in <hi>Braſil,</hi> and the withſtanding of the perfidious power of the <hi>Portugals;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently contributed, reſpectively, not a penie to either. Thus much indeed wee yield to, That the <hi>Council of State,</hi> as <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor</hi> of the <hi>Reſolutions</hi> of the <hi>Common-Union,</hi> may, after that all the Confederates have certified their conſent of raiſing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, accordingly <hi>levie</hi> the ſame, and <hi>engage</hi> them by Oath; and that the <hi>Officers</hi> ſo taken on, in matters of militarie exploits for the ſervice and conſervation of the State, are to yield obedience to his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> and the Council of State; but the ſame are in no wiſe enabled or autoriſed <hi>to raiſ or continue Forces in ſervice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the conſent of the Provinces,</hi> much leſs under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of the Oath, taken in the Name of the <hi>Common-Union,</hi> to <hi>force</hi> them to continue the ſame in ſervice against the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance</hi> of the <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Union.</hi> Nor ſhall it ever bee found, that the Province of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Frieſland</hi> underſtood it otherwiſe at any time againſt their Confederates; bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the <hi>Examples</hi> produced for that purpoſe are of a clean <hi>different</hi> nature; and particularly, That ſom Provinces, either contrarie to their conſent given, or without fore-going notification to the Confederates of their diſcontinuing conſent, may have ſought to eaſ themſelvs by clandeſtine Reduction of the Forces, or ſom other under-hand waie of disburthening charges; the ſame might not without reaſon bee ſaid to have been againſt the Union, as, whereby the ſecuritie or ſafetie of the State is empaired, againſt former (given, or at leaſtwiſe not profeſſedly diſcontinued) Conſent,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99708:53"/>
without any notification to the Confederates. But if ſo bee, that a Province have made known to the Confederates her diſabilitie of undergoing their Burthen any longer, and have ſhewed their reaſons why they cannot continue their conſent of entertaining the charges they were not able to bear; then certainly, it is far enough from the Province of <hi>Holland,</hi> ever to have maintained, this to bee contrarie to the Union; <hi>Holland</hi> having in this Caſe, not onely been content to paſs by ſuch with-holdings, but (the Lands exigencie requiring it) hath readily put her <hi>own ſhoulders</hi> under the burthens, thus excuſed or rejected by others; by which <hi>zeal and proneneſs</hi> of hers her back beeing overbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened and born down readie to break, Wee cannot bee ſo miſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to our cauſ, that putting off now what wee are <hi>not longer able</hi> to bear, and doing but therein, what the <hi>Freedom,</hi> preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Union,</hi> doth <hi>enable</hi> us, and following in the ſame the <hi>Examples</hi> of other <hi>Confederates;</hi> wee ſhould yet bee held bound to your Nob.

Complaints and Diſſatisfaction. And though they would have been glad, that what happened in that kinde might have been paſt by in ſilence, ſo, as their W.

                        <p>The great weight and concernment of all which, hath made the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomaſters judg it neceſſarie, timely to deliberate hereupon with the Citie-Council; and to this end at a ſolemn Meeting appointed <hi>June 10</hi> it was unanimouſly agreed, that the foreſaid Sending of their Hi.

Reſolution the ſaid Sending and dependance, is to bee diſapproved, as beeing paſt Example, and againſt the order and form of Government; as alſo, that it bee reſolved, The Cities of this Province ſhould henceforward, neither offer nor admit any ſuch Sending within their Bounds; furthermore, that this diſapproov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reſolution ſhould bee made known from your N. G. M. to the Generalitie, and regiſtred there, that hereafter no ſuch Sending ſhould bee more admitted by the Cities of this Province; and that therefore it ſhould bee ſeriouſly urged to the ſaid Generalitie, they would take heed of laying a ground hereafter for any ſuch Sending, or of undertaking and acting the ſame, for reaſons to bee further ſhewed, and laſtly to write ſeriouſly to all the Provinces, and to give them a particular account of the reaſons and motives, wherefore the foreſaid Sending was diſapproved by their N.

                        <p>See the foreſaid Advice a little before.</p>
                        <p>And foraſmuch as the Burgomaſters and Council of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> were ſorrie and wondered much to ſee, that his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (by ſuch, to whom it no waies belong's) to bee entangled in the accepting of this Commiſsion, and perceived, that they could no leſs diſacknowledg his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> himſelf then the reſt in Commiſſion with him, Their W W. out of reſpect to his ſaid High<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, and to ſever him, if it were poſsible from his received Commiſſion, and to prevent a Refuſal of the Audience, found good to ſend to his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, and to let him know the foreſaid Reſolution, with deduction of the pregnant Reaſons, which mooved the ſaid Burgomaſters and Council, to take the ſame, and conſequently ſeriouſly to deſire his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, that bee would bee pleaſed to break off his intended journie, in regard that hee and the reſt in Commiſsion with him, could not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99708:56"/>
bee received into the Council nor Cittie of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> in qualitie of that Commiſsion. Which meſſage with other offices beeing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Burgomaſters <hi>Waveren</hi> and <hi>Haſſelaër</hi> in the Citie of <hi>Gorcum,</hi> they had thanks given them at their return.</p>
                        <p>Now the ſame beeing conſtrued by his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, as if the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Burgomaſters and Council had been, ſimply not to admit his Princely perſon into their Citie, no not in conſideration of his Dignitie of <hi>Stadholder of the Province;</hi> their W W ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared for elucidation of their good intention, that the ſame was altogether far removed from their least thoughts, as the Eaſt is from the Weſt; but that his Highneſs as Stadtholder of the Province might bee aſſured of the greateſt honor and reſpect that could bee deſired, and that the ſenſ of the Council was onely, That his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> could not bee admitted, <hi>in regard of the foreſaid Commiſsion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And when afterwards the ſaid Burgomaſters were advertiſed, that his Highneſs continued in his Reſolution to repair neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to the ſaid Citie, conceiving hee might prevail for all that to get admiſsion upon the foreſaid Commiſsion and Lettes Credenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al from their Hi. Mi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Their W W and the Council perſiſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, it was not in their libertie nor power to grant the foreſaid Audience, and found good to ſend the ſecond time to his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> to acquaint him with their Reſolutions, and for the foreſaid reaſons moſt ſeriouſly again to deſire him, to paſs the Citie by in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, teſtifying nevertheleſs all due readineſs to receiv him (this quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie laid aſide) as Stadtholder, with all reſpect and honor. To this end there were ſent unto his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> the Lord <hi>Gelvinck,</hi> old Burgomaſter, and Sig<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                           <hi>Spiegel</hi> of the Council, with a Secretarie, who meeting his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> at <hi>Edam,</hi> they there in decent manner made known unto him the foreſaid Reſolution and deſire; intimating therewithall unto him, in the Name of their Superiors, that if his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> were pleaſed to com into the Citie as Stadholder, that their W W ſhould longingly take the opportunitie of ſhewing to his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> all the proofs of their reſpect and obſequiouſneſs.</p>
                        <p>And becauſ it pleaſed his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> to replie thereupon that hee meant to com together with the reſt of the Commiſsioners in all the

Qualities hee now was inveſted with. The Citie-Commiſsioners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, that his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> coming to the Citie, hee ſhould bee looked upon and received as Stadholder of the Province, and hee was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired then to let them know the time when his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> was to bee there exſpected.</p>
                        <p>Next daie, beeing <hi>23</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> together with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Commiſsioners arrived within the ſaid Citie, and was receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his perſon with the train-bands in arms, and with further exhibition of all due reſpects by the Burgomaſters.</p>
                        <p>But when, notwithſtanding all the former Devoirs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations, it pleaſed his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> to declare to the ſaid Burgomaſters, that hee was com there, together with other Commiſsioners from their Hi.

                        <p>Which they made uſe of the rather, in conſideration of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence committed in this Commiſsion againſt the Dignitie and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of your No. Gr. <hi>M.</hi> Province, when as the Lord <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vande Capelle,</hi> Sig<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of <hi>Aertsberghen,</hi> beeing the mouth of the Commiſsioners from their Hi.

Lord of <hi>Aertsberghen</hi> declaring further, that in caſe of failing in or delaying the ſaid Reparation, they the Commiſsioners muſt talk with them in another ſtrain, whereof they ſhould hear more ere long.</p>
                        <p>Upon the foreſaid Excuſe, his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> was pleaſed to let it reſt there, and began to deſire that hee might bee admitted then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf onely in perſon to Audience, as Stadtholder of <hi>Holland,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out nevertheleſs laying down the fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>And when his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> would not bee pleaſed to recede from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, nor make any further overture of what hee intended to propound, the Burgomasters, for to give as much content as might bee, and to conſider, whether it were neceſſarie and requiſite to call the Common Council about it, they received the deſire of his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> to communicate the ſame with the Lord <hi>Valekenier</hi> their Collegue, Preſident at that time, but not preſent, becauſ of ſom bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition.</p>

That the Act of ſeparate Disbanding or Caſhiering of Forces was againſt all antient cuſtom and order of Government; That it was not all <hi>Holland,</hi> but ſom few Bell-weathers that had cauſed all this ſtir and variance: That thoſe few ones beeing once removed out of the way, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Lord of <hi>Beverweert</hi> was com expreſsly from the Leaguer on Munday, to obſerv and manage what might bee reſolved at the Generalitie; and it appeared, that this their Hi.

So it ſtood onely at laſt upon this point, that theſe two ſhould bee removed from the Government.

                     <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> beeing the richeſt, the mightieſt and moſt conſiderable Member of <hi>Holland,</hi> failing and yielding thus, it became a powerful example and inducement to all the reſt, and many blamed them exceedingly, ſaying, They ſhould have <hi>timely conſidered</hi> before, whether they had the <hi>power</hi> or the <hi>courage</hi> to ſtand to what <hi>they principally</hi> had ſo long and eagerly profeſſed and preſſed. Now it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>that</hi> they wanted either or both; <hi>that</hi> they had don very ill, to ſhew ſo much averſneſs to ſo little purpoſe; There beeing now by this Extremitie, a <hi>new pattern given</hi> to his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> and the Generalitie, which will ſerv them hereafter for a <hi>Rule</hi> to proceed by, when <hi>Holland</hi> ſhall fall again into a fit of Reluctancie; <hi>that</hi> now there will bee little cauſ left to glorie of the freedom of the Land or the States. But they of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> thought they did beſt as they did; and like a ſhip upon Ancre in a tempeſt, were glad to ſtrike and give rope till they might recover a better time and opportunitie: for they continued in affection the very ſame they were before.</p>
                  <p>The Commiſsioners of their Hi. Mi. arriving at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veen</hi> on Wedneſdaie-Eve found all tranſacted, and were all of them, together with thoſe of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> entertained

by his Highneſs at <hi>Supper,</hi> where among other Diſcourſes, thoſe of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſaying, they ſhould have had the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of water</hi> for their advantage; the <hi>Prince</hi> replied, And I ſhould have made uſe of the <hi>Element of fire</hi> againſt it; (they of <hi>Delft</hi> having, upon order from the Council of State, furniſhed ſtore of Ammunition, Ordnance, Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, Morter-pieces, &amp;c.) which paſt away thus with ſmiles and laughing, but the <hi>earneſt</hi> ſurpaſſed the <hi>jeſt</hi> in the reflection.</p>
                  <p>Next morning early his Highneſs parted from thence, and arrived in the <hi>Haghe</hi> about noon, and the Forces were all reconducted to their Quarters.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſix</hi> apprehended <hi>Lords</hi> were carried away from the Court, Sunday the 31 of <hi>Julie,</hi> in two Coaches, three and three in a Coach, and in each three ſouldiers, beſides 25 horſmen before, ſo many in the midſt, and as many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, together with 50 musketiers.

But perceiving they accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated themſelvs all one after another, to the Propoſition of <hi>Julie</hi> 15<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, and <hi>abandoned all their own cauſ;</hi> they ſaw well enough, none of them would take up the Buckler in their behalf, and that the <hi>Caſe of the Bickers</hi> muſt bee their <hi>Rule.</hi>

That the means of the State may bee well and duely managed and advantaged. That the Navie-affairs
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99708:68"/>
may ſeriouſly bee taken to heart. That the Liquidations between the Provinces, may at length bee taken in hand and really perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

That the Ratification of the Treatie and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract made with the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and matters coïncident, may bee fully concluded and ſettled.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon, after ſom Deliberation, it was found good, according to the <hi>Propoſition</hi> and <hi>Modification,</hi> which his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, his Excellencie the Stadtholder and the Council of State had brought in and preſented to the Generalitie, <hi>July</hi> 15 by reaſon of the <hi>Differences</hi> ariſen then about the <hi>State of War;</hi> with joint conſent of all the Provinces, to accept of and confirm the <hi>State of War,</hi> as the ſame was projected by his Highneſs, his Excellencie and the Council of State, and ſent unto the Provinces; and that the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding and Reduction</hi> therein mentioned, ſhould bee made by his Highneſs his Excellencie and the Council of State, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Order of the Land, <hi>provided,</hi> that the 4 troops of horſ and a 1000 foot, ſhall bee entertained and paid, till the Provinces ſhall bee wholly agreed touching the ſame; whereunto the Provinces were deſired, to accommodate themſelvs, and to bring in their Conferences and Advices at furtheſt within the ſpace of 5 or 6 weeks; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces undertaking in the interim to paie all Souldiers wages entertainments and other defrayments of War, according to the <hi>old State of War.</hi> Further it was <hi>reſolved and agreed, that henceforward there ſhall no ſeparate Caſhiering or Reducing of Forces bee undertaken or practiſed by any Province, of their own Autoritie; and in caſe any Province ſhould attempt the like, the ſame ſhall forthwith bee addreſſed and remedied by the General Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie, as a Contravention of the Union, and Order of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

                  <p>That hee the Miniſter, having ſpake to him, and with pertinent and pregnant arguments, tending to the practice of repentance, ſorrow, hope of reconciliation and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, together with the confident aſſurance in Chriſts bloodie merits, endeavored to prepare his Soul for a bleſſed waiting for the coming of Chriſt, and happie departure out of this miſerable World; His Highneſs, beeing asked the Queſtion thereupon by the ſaid Miniſter, whether ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, upon the ground aforeſaid, His Soul vvas vvell ſatisfied, readie and content, chearfully to vvait for Death and the enſuing gracious Judgment of his <hi>Saviour,</hi> his Highneſs anſvvered vvith a hollovv voice, <hi>Yea,</hi> lifting up his eies therevvithal to Heaven. Then replied the Miniſter, vvell then <hi>Illuſtrious Prince,</hi> let theſe <hi>eies</hi> of your bodie, bee accompanied thither with your <hi>heart</hi> alſo, and with the eies of your Faith, and I do aſſure you, That you ſhall ſee the Heavens opened, and the Son of man, ſtanding at the right hand of God, to give your Bodie new ſtrength, or favorably to receiv your Soul into his glorie. Whereupon with good liking of his Highneſs, hee and the preſent companie, but few in Number, fell down upon their
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99708:77"/>
knees, powring out their praier with ſighs and tears, and heartily ſeeking to the Divine Majeſtie, to vouchſafe a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſpeedie releaſ to his Highneſs from under this heavie agonie: during the praier there was perceived a great and incredible change in the diſpoſition of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which doubled the zeal of praier, and made them ſigh out from the heart, that God would yet bee further gracious to the perſon of his Highneſs, and in him to the vvhole Land. Riſing up from praier, the Miniſter asked his Highneſs, vvhether hee had undſrſtood the vvords of the praier, and received any comfort by it? but hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no anſvver. Then the Phyſitians vvould have given his Highneſs ſom Cordial, but they found his mouth cloſely ſhut up, vvhich made them all conclude, that his laſt minute vvas at hand, returning thereupon to praier. But they perceived immediately, that this young Prince, with a gentle hiccough ſent forth his Soul to Heaven, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Happineſs, which notwithſtanding the complaints, tears and ſighs of his faithful ſervants, and others there preſent, took from him all deſire to return. And thus this Prince, who in Wiſdom, Diſcretion, Prudence and Couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs already ſurpaſſed his Heroïcal and famous Anceſtors, and whom the world did wonder at, was ſnatch'd out of it, indeed unworthie of him, even in the beautifulleſt bloom, and youthfulleſt vigor of his years, beeing old but 24 years and 6 months, after that the <hi>untha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>And like as alwaies, it hath been held and eſteem'd, according to the old and good <hi>maximes</hi> and <hi>fundamentals</hi> of theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, That the maintenance of the <hi>Reformed worſhip of God,</hi> The <hi>Obſervance of the Covenant of the Union</hi> made in Anno, <hi>1579.</hi> and the <hi>Entertainment of needful and ſufficient Forces</hi> for the <hi>common Safetie and Defence,</hi> are the <hi>three</hi> main and principal means, for to uphold and preſerv this moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable and bleſſed <hi>Unitie,</hi> together with <hi>Reſt</hi> and Tranquillitie at home, <hi>Reſpect</hi> among friends, and <hi>Terror</hi> to Enemies abroad;</p>

                        <p>Moreover, N. M.

In regard whereof, it beeing laid down as a fundamental Law of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99708:82"/>
Government in the foreſaid Covenant of the Union, and having likewiſe in former ſeveral times of emergent troubles and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, been the wholſom and profitable practice of the Land, in caſes even of leſs concernment then the preſent, for the more ſatisfactorie tranſaction and determination of things, to the content of all parties intereſſed, and to eſtabliſh and ſettle the ſame with the more efficacie, luſtre and autoritie. That the <hi>Lords the States of all the Provinces</hi> in general, were ſollemnly ſummoned and called together, to make <hi>one States-aſſemblie General,</hi> gathering and meeting all in one place; Their N. G.

And this wee are eſpecially charged to repreſent unto your N. M. wiſe Judgment, and moſt heartily and ſeriouſly to deſire you, that it would pleaſ your N.

                        <p>And that in the mean time no ground of prejudice may bee laid by ſeparate reſolutions in this or that Province, nor any change or alteration projected or practiſed, without communication and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation had before with the jointlie-intereſſed Confederates, for the better and due providing for and diſpoſing of all with the more maturitie, knowledg and conſent, and the leſs diſguſt and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of any: Our foreſaid Principals have held it as needful and reaſonable, ſo alſo void of danger to the Land-ſervice, That <hi>all matters</hi> concerning the State, bee left to the <hi>uſual Courſ</hi> and

                  <p>The Lord of <hi>Brederode,</hi> in the ſuperſcription of his Letter to the States of <hi>Groninghen</hi> and the <hi>Omlands,</hi> had one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put, <hi>To the Nob.

But thoſe of <hi>Groninghen</hi> ſaid, that by reaſon of their Differences among themſelvs, they ſtood in need of a <hi>Man,</hi> and not of a <hi>Babe</hi> for their Stadtholder; and were not uſed to have a <hi>Deputie Stadt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder,</hi> or <hi>Lievtenants Leivtenant,</hi> which would have been needful, if they had made choice of the young Prince; beſides, they had proſpered very well under <hi>Count William's Father, Brother and Uncle</hi> reſpectively, and their laſt Stadt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder (Prince <hi>William)</hi> was no better then forced upon them in the year 1640. Thoſe alſo that ſtood well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the Common Libertie judged it better, that at leaſtwiſe one man ſhould not bee Stadtholder General over all; for which and ſuch like allegations and diſcourſes in the foreſaid year 1640, ſom good Patriots run no ſmall hazard. There happened alſo another Diſguſt to the ſaid Princeſs Dowager, which was, that the Lord <hi>Knuyt</hi> was outed of all his functions, for having repreſented the Prince's intereſt before the ſame was made void by his death; which to recover, means was made to the Court of <hi>Holland,</hi> to autorize the late Prince's Counſel, proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally to manage the young Prince's pretence or intereſt: And the ſaid Council renewed an Act for <hi>Knuyt,</hi> ſuch as hee had before from the Prince, by virtue whereof hee undertook to preſent himſelf again at the Board of their Hi.

                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:99708:85"/>
would not endure him there; and returning into <hi>Zealand,</hi> the States there likewiſe turned him out of both the State and Commiſsion'd Council and other Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies where hee meant to take place, according to the ſaid Relation, the States taking it, that by the death of the Prince, that <hi>Prime Memberſhip of the Nobilitie</hi> among them was extinguiſhed; and mainteining, that indeed hitherto they had allowed it to the Princes of <hi>Orange</hi> for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, but perſonally onely, and under that proteſtation; not at all Really or hereditarily.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe of <hi>Dort,</hi> immediately upon the Prince's' death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd the Lord <hi>de Witt</hi> to his former place; and ſo did they at <hi>Delft</hi> ſoon after the Lord <hi>Duyſt van Verhout,</hi> and they of <hi>Haerlem</hi> the Lord <hi>de Wael</hi> and <hi>Reuyl,</hi> and they of <hi>Medenblick</hi> the Lord <hi>Stellingſwerf,</hi> the Lord <hi>Keyſer</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready choſen Fiſcal for the Council of the Admiraltie in the North quarter, the Prince yet living. At <hi>Amſterdam</hi> they proceeded a little more ſlowly with the reſtitution of the <hi>Bic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> for to ſhew their moderation.</p>
                  <p>They of <hi>Groninghen and the Omlands,</hi> ſought to have the Companie of the Guard, which the Prince had cauſed to com from <hi>Groninghen</hi> in the late ſtirs laſt ſummer, that now they might bee returned, which was granted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficultie, but onely about the manner, under what Commiſsion they ſhould march now the Prince was dead.

And as for ſuch Cities and places as have no Seſsion in the Provincial State's-aſſemblie, nor any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie in point of chooſing Magiſtrates; it is found good, that they ſhall make their addreſſes to the Aſſemblie of their N.

                  <p>As for the diſpoſing of all civil Offices and charges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Magiſtracie, it was agreed, that henceforward the ſame ſhall abſolutely bee and remain in the power of the Aſſemblie of their N. Gr. M. ſuch onely excepted as ſhall

bee found to belong by peculiar right and known cuſtom unto other Courts or Aſſemblies, and there they ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the condition and qualification of perſons capable of Magiſtracie, it was agreed, That all ſuch as ſhould bee inveſted with any place or office of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ought to bee of the Chriſtian Reformed Religion, ſo as the ſame was confirmed by the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> and is taught now in the publick Churches of the Land; at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they ſhould make publick profeſsion thereof.</p>
                  <p>All other affaires, beeing not Domeſtick, or, meerly Provincial, but having relation to the Generalitie, were put of and referred to the arrival of the Grand-Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie of the Provinces, aſsigned to begin the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> enſuing.</p>

G. M. approbation, to ordain.</p>
                     <p>Beeing mooved thereunto, by the full and perfect knowledg ſhee, Remonſtrant hath concerning this, of the earneſt will and deſire of his Highneſs her husband: whereof their N.

                     </p>
                     <p>Which diſpoſition beeing circumſtantially examined, especially ſo far forth, as the ſame make's mention of conſtituting of Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and the qualifications of them; together with the plain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of all others, not thus qualified; The will of his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, and the aſſuredneſs of the foreſaid Diſpoſition, cannot bee drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to queſtion by anie reaſon; it beeing conſtituted in the Laws, that even imperfect Dispoſitions, deſtitute of all ſolemnities, nay, the very bare intimation of the laſt will, is ſufficient for the giving or appointing a Guardian, eſpecially beeing the Fathers for his childe.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why the foreſaid Diſpoſition want's the formal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie (however unneceſſarie as for the preſent purpoſe of conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting Guardians) proceeded not from any change of his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> former will, nor any intention of his, it ſhould remain without the uſual ſolemnities; but, that the ſame was hindered onely by ſom other accidents, the which, ſhee Remonſtrant, for certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, doth not think good as yet to diſcover, and ſhould bee contented to let it paſs thus, if ſhee bee not conſtrained to ſhew forth the Truth thereof in its nakedneſs.</p>

                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:99708:87"/>
It beeing a meer abuſe, that the draught of the foreſaid Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſhould bee aboliſhed or cancell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d by the Codicill of his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, dated <hi>Decemb. 21<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1649.</hi> the Laws plainly ſhewing, that <hi>Codicillarie Diſpoſitions</hi> do not alter <hi>Wills</hi> or <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> no nor any former Codicils, but in ſo much as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly derogated unto the former, by the later.</p>
                     <p>A like abuſe is it, That the foreſaid Draught ſhould bee of no efficacie, for that his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> ſhould have teſtified in his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that hee would or intended to make a Diſpoſition or Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Such an intention tending not to the altering of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Diſpoſition, but onely to paſs in due form, what hee long beforehand and premeditately had brought to that perfection, that by ſpecial charge from himſelf, and by his own hand Clark, it was fairly written out, and lackt nothing more but the ſolemn for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities aforeſaid, as ſhall bee fully proved if need bee.</p>
                     <p>Shee, Remonſtrant, will not bee tedious now, by ſhewing to your N. G.

                     <p>The Right, which Shee, Remonſtrant, hath before all other, to the inſpection and Guardian-ſhip of her Son, doth need no juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication at all, in the righteous judgment of your N. G. M. Her own Minorennitie coming not into any Conſideration here, when as the very Laws of the Land pronounce the age compleat by matrimonie; ſo that the Civil Law can take no hold of Us in this particular; beſides eſpecially, that it ought to bee conſidered, in what Eminencie of Condition her perſon is, which doth quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, the Princes and Princeſses of her Familie, even under age, ſuch as ſhee, Remonſtrant, now is, to the Government of the State it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Shee, Remonſtrant, is very well contented, that My Lady the

                     <p>Shee, Remonſtrant, make's no ſcruple at all at your N. G. M. beeing autoriſed, to provide her Son with Guardians aſsiſtant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with herſelf, ſutably to the foreſaid Diſpoſiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>It is without all Controverſie, moſt agreeable to the Laws of this Land, that Shee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Remonſtrant, beeing Mother of the Prince, her Son, her Dear Husband deceaſing, ſhee thereby becom's and is
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:99708:88"/>
the Governeſs or Guardian of her ſaid Son, beyond all diſpute, with excluſion of the Grandmother.</p>
                        <p>Which unremoovable Foundation beeing laid, it follow's ſurely, and is clearly grounded in Right, that Shee, the Remonſtrant, is enabled thereby, not onely to undertake the Guardianſhip, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to exerciſe all acts thereon depending, and that ſhee cannot bee hindred therein, by reaſon that hitherto there are no Guardian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſsiſtants aſsigned with her.</p>
                        <p>That which is ſaid here, beeing clear and plain in Law, ſhee the Remonſtrant ſtand's evidently free from having attempted the leaſt againſt it; ſo that in Juſtice there can bee no Inhibition made of her foreſaid Adminiſtration of the Guardian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>

and kinde Correſpondence, and beeing readie to give them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all reaſonable Satisfaction about the Direction in the particular of the Guardianſhip.</p>
                        <p>For the ſaid Guardianſhip conſiſting principally in three functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the <hi>firſt,</hi> touching the Education of the Perſon of her Son; the <hi>ſecond,</hi> the Adminiſtration of his goods; the <hi>third,</hi> the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or beſtowing ſom Charges and Grants or Benefices.</p>

                        <p>The managing and adminiſtration of the goods, the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrant conceiveth, ought as hitherto, to bee diſpoſed by the Council, and conformably to the deſire of his late High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> her husband.</p>

                        <p>And for to give the ſaid Prince Elector full aſſurance thereof, in reſpect of the <hi>Fidei-Commiſsio,</hi> or Truſt mentioned in his Remonſtrance, ſhee, the Remonſtrant here, will gladly admit, that the ſame Prince Elector and her High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> the Princeſs Dowager ſhall themſelvs, or by their appointed Commiſsioners, aſsiſt to audit the yearly accounts of the Treaſurer General.</p>

                        <p>And in reſpect of the Cities lying in <hi>Zealand,</hi> to take the advice, during the minoritie of the young Prince, of the States of that Countrie, whereby all apprehended ſurmiſes vaniſhing, how injuriouſly ſoever deviſed. The Remonſtrant deſire's to give your N. G.

                        <p>Shee Remonſtrant not entertaining ſo much as a thought to intrude or intrust any Engliſh therewith, or even to ſuffer any Nundination to bee made about them, but rather to take care, that in all, the Rules of diſtributive Juſtice may exactly bee conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and obſerved.</p>
                        <p>All which Shee Remonſtrant thought good to attest thus unto your N. Gr.

                        <p>And that in regard hereof, you will not ſuffer the waie of Juſtice to bee ſhut up to the Remonſtrant, which to the glorie and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of your N.

ABove it was ſaid, that they of <hi>Holland</hi> ſo ordered their Provincial Government, as to bee without a <hi>Stad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholder</hi> or <hi>Governor;</hi> that the Cities ſhould enjoy the chooſing of their own Magiſtrates, and that whatſoe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ver hitherto was don by the <hi>Stadt-holder,</hi> ſhould bee don by the <hi>States</hi> themſelvs. The Memberſhip of the <hi>Nobilitie</hi> and the Citie of <hi>Leyden</hi> ſhewed themſelvs ſomwhat en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the Prince.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alcmaer, Delft,</hi> and <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> were the firſt that ſought and obtained a Charter for the free choice of their own Magiſtrates; for it was declared alreadie beforehand, that none ſhould bee refuſed that came to deſire it. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Grant, each Citie proceeded according to their own pleaſure, as it beſt agreed with every one; moſt of them ſorting their Election out of a double Number; which the Stadt-holder was wont to do before with the advice of the Council, or Court Provincial, or in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence that Court alone, by reaſon whereof the ſame Court might well have pretended now, that it belong'd to them alone, and none other. But they never did nor durſt open their mouths about it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt that arrived in the <hi>Hagh</hi> of the Provincial States for the <hi>Grand-Aſſemblie,</hi> were they of <hi>Zealand,</hi> and were ſtreightwaies moſt kindly welcom'd with ſom Coaches, by the principal Members of <hi>Holland;</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe afterwards they were fetch'd again in their Bodie, with Coaches, to have Audience in the Aſſemblie of the States of <hi>Holland;</hi> there paſsing abundance of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſhews of much affection and friendſhip, with readineſs of contributing whatſoe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ver might tend and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the maintenance of the everlaſting Union, and faithful correſpondence one with another.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99708:97"/>
where heretofore the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was Abjured, his Yoke caſt off, and the Foundations laid of theſe Countrie's Libertie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Trophies and Bliſs-tokens of Victorie from time to time moſt graciouſly beſtow'd upon this State, by God, are waving over every one of our heads here. This ſame God now let us pray unto, from the bottom of our hearts, to continue his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand over this State from age to age, and more and more to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie his Grace and Mercie upon us.</p>
                        <p>After that, through the incomprehenſible Judgments of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, Prince <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> of immortal memorie, was ſuddenly and unexſpectedly taken away from this world, without leaving any iſſue of his bodie viſible, however afterwards through God's bleſsing a young Prince was happily born; The State of theſe United Netherlands was found to bee reduced into ſuch an eſtate and condition, the like it never had been in from their Foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> at that point, that there is <hi>none left of the Houſ of ORANGE, fit and capable to bee what the former Princes of ORANGE have been.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Lords the States of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſtfrieſland,</hi> thoſe which from the beginning of the Union ſo worthily have acquitted themſelvs, ſo freely opened their Coffers, ſo largely extended their Treaſure, and in a word, ſo spent and adventured their utmost abilities, both in Defence of, and Conqueſts for this State, as is ſufficiently known to all the world, and they themſelvs are yet ſmartingly ſenſible of to their very bowels; they were nevertheleſs ſo far from ſetting their accuſtomed zeal faint in this diſaſtrous conjuncture of times and affairs, that it hath made them ſo much the more careful for the State, and to procure the preſent hopes of redreſs, having upon mature Deliberation held it very expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, nay moſt neceſſarie, that the Higher Powers of all the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Netherlands might bee brought to meet together in a <hi>Grand-States-Aſſemblie,</hi> for jointly and unanimouſly there (God graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſsiſting to bleſs them) to perpend and Conſult, how the State of theſe Countries may beſt of all, bee ſafely and ſecurely ſettled.</p>
                        <p>Their No. gr. Mi. ſeeing now upon their intimated Deſires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Illuſtrious Aſſemblie ſo happily met; They declare that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99708:98"/>
therein they finde a moſt ſingular content and ſatisfaction: and as among the people of God it was counted once a remarkable bleſsing when the ſame, even from <hi>Beerſheba</hi> to <hi>Dan,</hi> aſſembled themſelvs like one man, to conſider of their common good and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, the ſame beeing a most evident and manifeſt ſign of their concord and unanimitie; ſo do their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> N. Gr. M. no leſs rejoice and congratulate both themſelvs and the whole High Mightie Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie, in and for this bleſſed meeting of them all united thus, doubtleſs excited and brought to paſs by a ſingular Providence and Grace of Almightie God, to whom therefore their N. Gr. M. return moſt heartie praiſ and thanks, moſt officiouſly and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly likewiſe thanking your H. Mi. and every Member apart, that they were pleaſed, at the foreſaid deſire of their N. Gr. M. to repair and aſſemble in this place.</p>
                        <p>Now then for to begin this praiſ-worthie and moſt important action, their Nob. Gr. M. do declare, as ſpeaking by my mouth, their judgment to bee this, <hi>That the Unitie and Concord of the Provinces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the onely foundation whereupon the Fabrick of this State may bee ſecurely grounded and kept alwaies entire:</hi> as indeed our wiſe Forefathers and Founders of the State have well conſidered, leaving unto their poſteritie an everlaſting <hi>Memorandum,</hi> the Hedged Cloſe with the Bundle of Arrows, and this Inſcription, viz. <hi>Concordiâ res parvae creſcunt,</hi> &amp;c. They therefore again now ſincerely and uprightly declare before this High Mightie Aſſemblie, their ſtedfast intention and utmost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to bee no other, (whatever malice may have ſpred in the ſtreets to the contrarie, to abuſe the people,) but to cheriſh, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein, and inviolably to entertain and cultivate the mutual Love, Friendſhip, Unitie, good Correſpondence and Confidence between the Provinces, without ever receding or withdrawing themſelvs from the ſame; and that this they will do not onely in words, but rather in real effects and deeds at all times.</p>
                        <p>And for the more effectual proſecution and performance of the Reſolution aforeſaid, their N. Gr. M. declare, they judg it very needful, that three diſtinct main things bee well ſettled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually mainteined, to wit, <hi>The Union, Religion, and Militia,</hi>
                           <pb n="155" facs="tcp:99708:98"/>
beeing the three preliminar points which before the beginning of the Treatie of Peace were judged neceſſarie by the State to bee lookt unto in and above all things. Theſe their N. Gr. M. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly held inviolable, and ſtill adhere to the ſame judgment, That <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Union</hi> bee kept entirely as it was concluded in the year <hi>1579.</hi> at <hi>Utrecht;</hi> That <hi>Religion</hi> bee mainteined ſtedfaſtly, ſo as the ſame is taught in all the publick Churches throughout theſe United Provinces, and was elucidated by the <hi>Synod of Dort</hi> in the years <hi>1618,</hi> and <hi>1619,</hi> and that the <hi>Militia</hi> bee entertain'd conſtantly, according to the Reſolution formerly agreed on by the State, upon the ſaid preliminar points.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the two firſt points there is, at the preſent conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of affairs (God bee praiſed) no change yet happened, and their N. Gr. M. are likewiſe confident there will bee no diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pancie nor difference at all between the Provinces about them, ſo that the Deliberations and Conſultations to bee entred now into, will properly and onely concern the ſettling and ordering of the <hi>Militia</hi> and matters annexed, and how the ſame ought to bee diſpoſed of and regulated by this preſent Solemn Aſſemblie.</p>
                        <p>There are at this preſent three concurrent things, which never ſince the beginning of this Republick were ſeen in that conſtitution.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is, The Peace, which through the gracious bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God the State of theſe Countries hath gloriouſly purchaſed.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>ſecond,</hi> The unexſpected Caſe, That there is none at this preſent of the Houſ of <hi>Orange</hi> fit and capable to undergo and manage the higheſt charge of this State.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third,</hi> That in the upſhot of the War it was found good to chuſe and appoint a Field-Marſhal, whoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is, in abſence of the General, or other emergencie, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Armie.</p>
                        <p>Hereupon their N. Gr. M. conſidering that of old, from the beginning of the War, the managing af all militarie affairs was
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99708:99"/>
referred to the Council of State, according to their Instruction, eſpecially in conformitie to the <hi>ſixt</hi> and <hi>eighteenth</hi> Article of the ſame. Their opinion is, that it will bee good and ſerviceable for the State, that the foreſaid Council of State, as alſo the fore-named Field-marſhal, together with the Governors, Commanders, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chief officers by Sea and by Land, bee continued in the full and effectual function of their reſpective charges.</p>
                        <p>And further, that the removing of the Garriſons, and giving of Patents or Commiſsions may bee diſpoſed of to the content and ſecuritie of the Provinces, in the enſuing manner, framed and drawn out of fundamental State-Documents, and the modern pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and experiment, eſpecially of the Province of <hi>Frieſland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        <p>AFter the ſudden and remarkable Alteration happen'd in the chiefeſt parts of the Government, through the deplorable Death of his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> of immortal memorie, the Lords the States of <hi>Zealand,</hi> were very glad to underſtand, Firſt, the proviſional Order that was taken by the Ordinarie Deputies of the Provinces, for Direction of the Militia or Armie; and Secondly, that their Hi. Mi. were pleaſed to convocate this Grand and Solemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie, for to conſider together, either of ſom <hi>Perſon</hi> on whom the Eminent Adminiſtrations, his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> whilom was inveſted with, might ſecurely and ſafely bee conferred; or of ſom other waie and order, whereby the affairs of the Common Union, both within and without the Land, might best bee regulated and managed.</p>
                        <p>And that the rather, for that the ſame Convocation, was made in ſuch a manner, as never or ſeldom was don before, that your Hi. Mi. were pleaſed to repair hither with ſuch a numerous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and by the reſpective States-Aſſemblies.</p>
                        <p>Whereby the ſaid Ordinarie Deputies in the Generalitie made known, that one the one ſide they apprehended as they ought, the preſent perplexed conſtitution of time and affairs, and on the other, wiſhed, that with all poſsible acceleration, care and courſes might bee taken, for ſettling of the Government, and timely obviateing of all attempts, that might bee practiſed againſt it.</p>
                        <p>Once more, it is ſaid, your Hi. Mi. were aſſembled before, and in the ſame manner, and in the ſame place, whenas, <hi>(viz.</hi> in the year <hi>1582.)</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was declared, to have forfeited his Right and Dominion over theſe Countries, and all Princely Autoritie ceaſing in him; thereby, was conſolidated into
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:99708:104"/>
the power of the States, and the whole Souveraigntie devolved to the States of the reſpective United Provinces, from whom the ſaid Princely autoritie originally was ſprung and derived; at which time alſo the State of theſe Countries orderly returned, to that form, wherein it conſiſted before the Creation of Hereditarie principals, in the daies when the Dutch Nation in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and ours alſo among the reſt, were governed in the waie of Republicks.</p>
                        <p>And as then, for the reaſons aforeſaid, the Cauſ of your Hi. Mi. aſſembling was very important, ſo it is likewiſe of no leſs weight at preſent; whenas the Government doth finde it ſelf at an inſtant and ſo unexpectedly bereft of its principal Director born of the Illuſtrious Houſ of <hi>Orange,</hi> which had obliged this State with ſo many notable ſervices and deſerts; and deceaſed without leaving anie of that Houſes poſteritie, fit and capable in perſon, to put his hand to the rudder of the Ship.</p>
                        <p>Foraſmuch then, that your Hi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mi. are met here upon this occaſion, for to conſult and adviſe together, what may bee moſt requiſite for the Common good and intereſt, The States of <hi>Zealand</hi> wiſh, their <hi>H. M.</hi> may undertake the ſame, with the ſame Love Unitie and Confidence, wherewith their reſpective Predeceſſors made the Union at <hi>Utrecht<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> and proceed likewiſe with as much Zeal and Courage, as made our Fore-fathers (nothing daunted at the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo mightie a Prince) to ſtand it out againſt him, and ſet up the preſent frame of Government, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and maintain the ſame by all means to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture.</p>
                        <p>Not onely, becauſ all good Governments are ever wont heartily to minde and effect the Government that is in beeing, but alſo for that the ſame which is ſet up among us, is grounded upon ſuch laudable and ſtedfaſt maximes, that there can bee no better nor ſafer deviſed; as that, wherein there is nothing administred or managed by any Superioritie, and which is, even from the bottom to the top, altogether repreſentative.</p>
                        <p>As now this Grand Aſſemblie of your Hi. Mi. is compoſed of Seven Members or Provinces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who though free and Soveraign,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:99708:105"/>
each one within their limits, are nevertheleſs, for their common pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, ſo ſtreightly allied and confederated, as if in effect they were but one Province.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe ſame Provinces again conſiſt of ſeveral Members and Towns, ſuch as were never ſubdued to ſlaverie by any ones arms; but were of old free and privileged members and Cities, which are governed reſpectively by ſuch perſons, who at the entrance of their functions, muſt make Oath, to watch with all conſcionableneſs, and according to their beſt knowledg, for the ſafetie and welfare of the Land.</p>
                        <p>Out of which advices and deliberations, are framed afterwards in each Province the Reſolutions of the States, and the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions are orderly tranſmitted and communicated to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie of the Confederates. Whence it appear's and follow's undiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, that this Common Government, ſet up for the affairs of the Union, beſet with ſo many Provincial Orders and fences, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by ſuch an authoritative Aſſemblie, conſiſting of the prime, ableſt and faithfulleſt perſons in the Land, is not onely in reaſon to bee eſteemed by all men underſtanding and verſed in divine and humane affairs, but really and experimentally, the moſt pleaſing, moſt honorable and moſt ſafe Government, that can bee imagined here on earth.</p>
                        <p>As beeing further alſo commended by the Example not onely of the Common wealth of the Hebrews inſtituted according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of God Almightie himſelf, which ought to bee of great weight and moment among all Chriſtians; but of many other civiliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nations l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>kewiſe, under the ſame forms of Government, both of old and later times, in neighbor and remoter Countries; eſpecially the great Aſſemblies of the Grecians, called <hi>Amphyctiones,</hi> compoſed of divers Cities, who, though every one apart was free and Soveraign within themſelvs, were nevertheleſs confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and United together againſt the power of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And as the hiſtories inform us, that, as long as they cleaved to this alliance and remained in this Union, they could not bee overcom by all the power of the <hi>Perſians:</hi> ſo experience hath
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:99708:105"/>
ſhewed likwiſe, what this State, through the Members unitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding one in the other, was able to do against the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and how the ſame by that means hath waded and got through all the obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and difficulties of <hi>80</hi> years war, to this prosperitie and height wee ſee it in at preſent.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore wee have great cauſ to praie to God Almightie, that hee would bee pleaſed to preſerv the Republick in Unitie and Concord, that wee may bee able to tranſmit the ſame as pure and undefiled to our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie as wee received from our forefathers; ſettling and governing the ſame upon thoſe good and wholſom Laws and Maximes that were the original foundations thereof.</p>
                        <p>And foraſmuch as without all controverſie there are neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to this purpoſe three inſeparable <hi>main-points,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Religion</hi> and <hi>Militia;</hi> and that the Provinces of <hi>Gelderland</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> have preſented to your Hi. Mi. ſom conſiderations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and chiefly upon the point of the <hi>Militia;</hi> Wee ſhall likewiſe in behalf of the Lords the States of <hi>Zealand</hi> ſummarily deduce a few Conſiderations which their N. M. had upon the points of the Union and Religion in particular.</p>
                        <p>As for the former, your Hi. M. know, that as well this grand and Solemn Aſſemblie, as the affairs of this Boards are properly grounded upon the Treatie of the <hi>Union made at Utrecht</hi> in Anno <hi>1579.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That likewiſe the ſame Union is originally contracted between the Provinces, to the mutual and common protection of all, againſt all, both forreign and homebred force and violence.</p>
                        <p>Which alone is ſufficient to make your Hi. Mi. apprehend, of what importance it is, that the ſame Union bee religiouſly and uprightly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, as known to bee the onely Foundation whereupon the glorious ſtructure of this Government ſtand's ſettled, the onely morter and morteiſes whereby the walls thereof are cemented and faſtned on all ſides, the advantagious ſteps and degrees which have moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to the preſent Eminencie, and the pillars whereon ſecurely reſting, it preſent's it ſelf with ſo much luſtre and pleaſantneſs to the eies of all the world.</p>
                        <p>Now as it is almost impoſsible, Hi. and Mi. Lords, that the ſame Unitie ſhall duly bee preſerved, if the Members of the Bodie
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99708:106"/>
ſhould claſh one againſt the other through inward Diſſentions and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtandings; and that likewiſe one cannot well conceiv, that there ſhould never no differences ariſe in a Government ſuch as this is, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of ſeven ſeveral free and Sovereign Provinces, and each one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of conſiſting of ſundrie Members and Cities, as ſaid is, and they again repreſented by perſons of various humors and intereſts, and alſo gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by different and peculiar Laws, Conſtitutions and Cuſtoms: that it is ſcarce poſsible likewiſe, that by reaſon of the difficulties of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Deliberation, and difference of apprehenſions and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings all things ſhould bee diſpatched with unanimous conſent; and that it happen's oft times, that through the diſcrepancie of opinions, eſpecially about eſſential points, there are cauſed notable Diſtractions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, unleſs the ſame are by provident care and diſcretion timonſly obviated or prevented; ſo the Lords the States of <hi>Zealand</hi> wiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in this General Convocation ſom promt and peremtorie expedient may be thought and reſolved upon, whereby the <hi>Differences</hi> at any time ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing among the Provinces, may either happily bee avoided, or expeditely removed.</p>
                        <p>Which wee ſay not, Hi. Mi. Lords, as if wee feared this Aſſemblie ſhould bee troubled by any ſuch Diſputes and miſunderſtandings; or, that, if any ſhould happen (which God Almightie bee pleaſed to prevent) wee ſhould not bee confident the ſame might preſently bee agreed again, by means of perſuaſion or otherwiſe; but onely that for time to com<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient order may bee provided againſt the ſame; and that your Hi.

                        <p>In reading over and examining the foreſaid Treatie of the Union, wee finde, that proviſion is made in this behalf in diſtinct manner, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diverſitie of matters, &amp; firſt by the <hi>IX</hi> Article, what courſ is to bee taken in Deliberations about <hi>Truce, Peace &amp; War,</hi> namely, that therein the Provinces are to conclude with <hi>one conſent;</hi> or if that cannot be obtein'd, that then the Difference ſhall be refer'd &amp; ſubmitted to the L<hi rend="sup">ds</hi> Stadth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who ſhall compoſe the ſame between the parties, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the matter, rather by themſelvs alone, or in caſe of diſcrepancie, with aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

afterwards likewiſe applied in the <hi>16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

                        <p>True it is indeed, Hi. Mi. Lords, that the foreſaid power and prerogative ſeem's to bee given by the contents of theſe Articles, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Lords <hi>Stadtholders then in beeing,</hi> and therefore not to bee extended to the ſucceeding Stadtholders. But as theſe and other ſuch like clauſes are oftentimes put into ſolemn Contracts and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, ſo they ceaſ not, however but proviſionally inſerted, to bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies obligatorie, as long as they are not expreſsly repealed; the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the foreſaid clauſes beeing onely, that, if afterwards there ſhould ſom inconvenience or grievance com to bee diſcovered about the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Expedient or Diſpoſition of the Article which they are annexed to; that in ſuch a caſe the Contracting parties ſhall have libertie, paſsing by or nulling the former expedient, to think and reſolv upon another; as alſo accordingly the Members of the Union, if heretofore they had remarked any difficultie, whether about the foreſaid ſubmiſsion to the Lords Stadtholders, or in their deciſions, they had power enough to conſider and agree together upon ſom fitter and ſafer diſpoſition; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto nevertheleſs they have not found themſelvs neceſsitated, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the ſaid Lords Stadtholders beeing of themſelvs not much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined or diſpoſed to pronounce Sentence or make Deciſions between the principal Members of ſuch a Conſiderable Bodie, and willing to avoid all occaſions of giving offence, they have for the moſt part endeavored to compoſe the Differences by waie of interceſsion and perſuaſion, which alſo for the moſt part hath well ſucceeded, not onely by reaſon of the great credit and autoritie the ſaid Lords Stadtholders were inveſted with, but alſo that the partie reflecting on each ſide, which waie the ballance might happen to preponderate, were loth to advenuture upon a Deciſion, and alwaies eſchew'd the ſame.</p>

Wee are not ignorant, Hi. Mi.

                        <p>Wee are not ignorant neither Hi. Mi.

                        <p>And whereas likewiſe, Hi. Mi.

                        <p>For although it is agreed unto of this ſide, by the Treatie of peace, that the Subjects of the ſaid King in General, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſ and negotiate in theſe Countries, the ſame ſeem's nevertheleſs not applicable to the foreſaid eccleſiaſtical perſons, or Clergie-men.

As likewiſe in the third place, the ſame is evinced, by the interpretation and practice of ſeveral other Princes and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, who notwithſtanding their friendſhip and alliance with the ſaid King, whereby his Subjects in general are denied no acceſs nor commerce in their Countries, yet ſuffer no known Clergie of his to com and coverſ there, which interpretation agree's likewiſe with the Declaration of the Lords the Ordinarie Deputies of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie plainly expreſſed in a Certain Ordinance of theirs, made for that very purpoſe, and obſerved to this daie in the Quarters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting under their Command.

ſom vigorous reſolution for an effectual Introduction of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both Eccleſiaſtick and Civil, in the Meyerie of the <hi>Boſch,</hi> and other known Quarters of like nature. And to that end due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weigh and review, how dear the Conqueſt of theſe Quarters bath ſtood this State; what Diſputes there have been agitated by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> about the Soveraigntie thereof, and with how much difficultie they were at laſt aſſerted to Us; what troubles and vexations, the beginning of Eccleſiaſtical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation ſuſtain'd there; what countermining and oppoſition were practiſed againſt it, both from without and from within the Provinces: with how much enormitie and inſolence the Miniſters thereof were aſſaulted; and what helpleſs remedies there were applied, not onely to the contempt of the Government, and grief of all the good Inhabitants of the Land, but even to the diſhonor of the Reformed Religion, and provoking of Almightie God. What couragious and wholſom Reſolutions were there not taken by the Generalitie, for the introduction of the Civil Reformation there (without which the Eccleſiaſtick, doubtleſs, cannot ſubſiſt) and how ſmall an appearance is there of any Fruits or Effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? nay, how have they been from time to time croſt, travers'd and utterly hindred? Wherefore the Lords the States of <hi>Zealand</hi> deſire, that courſes may bee taken, for the ſurceaſing at length of all further oppoſition againſt the foreſaid Reſolutions, ſo ſolemnly taken and reiterated, and tending ſo much to the maintenance of the Right and Service of the Land; and that on the contrarie, the ſame may bee executed and obſerved, ſo as they are couched, in all their points and Articles: for the effecting whereof, their N.

                  <p>The Provinces indeed agreed all of them in this, that good Ordinances and Regulations were made in the point of Religion; but the complaints of the Miniſterie of <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and others, were, <hi>That the ſame ought to bee better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and executed.</hi> Wherein they of <hi>Holland,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Amſterdam</hi> were conſured moſt; who for fear of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice in their Trade, connived much. But <hi>Holland</hi> and others ſtood upon this, that having taken up arms for <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of Conſcience,</hi> and in time of war and rigor it ſelf, never proceeded according to the manner of the <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition,</hi> the ſame ought not now neither bee introduced. What they adviſed upon this point will follow by and by: and although the States of <hi>Gelderland, Zealand,</hi> and <hi>Utrecht</hi> had been at firſt more rigid in their Provincial Advices upon all the three points (as ſhall likewiſe bee ſeen anon by what was preſented in behalf of thoſe points) yet they declared afterwards, to wit, <hi>Gelderland, That they conformed themſelvs to the advice of</hi> Holland; <hi>provided onely, that as concerning the Civil Reformation in the Mayerie of the</hi> Boſch <hi>and other parts of like nature, ſuch as could ſhew to have any right and intereſt to any Civil Office, might receiv reaſonable ſatisfaction or compenſation; and that ſuch as at preſent were in any ſuch charge or office might have libertie to treat with ſom fit perſon, beeing of the Reformed Religion, under the approbation</hi>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:99708:115"/>
of their Hi. Mi. <hi>Zealand</hi> likewiſe declared themſelvs Conform to <hi>Holland,</hi> urging onely a more vigorous execution of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; and ſo did <hi>Utrecht,</hi> and that the Civil Reformation in the foreſaid Mayierie, and ſuch like places, might bee proſecuted and ſetled; and that the Sects which were connivingly tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, might not bee ſuffered to ſpread further, nor in any other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then where now they were.</p>
                  <p>The Advices and inclinations of the other Provinces will bee ſeen in their own Propoſitions hereafter, but for connexion's ſake of matter, wee ſhall produce here what <hi>Holland</hi> adviſed upon the point of <hi>Religion;</hi> the ſame bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards converted into a General Declaration of all the Provinces <hi>Januarii</hi> 27<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.</p>

                              <p>The Lords of the Citie and Land therefore, viewing and well weighing, that the preſent conſtitution of the times and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant affairs which ſutably to the undoubted preſuppoſition of the foreſaid <hi>3</hi> main points, are to bee alter'd or otherwiſe diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this your <hi>H.

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:99708:120"/>

                                 </hi> of this ever undoubted Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, That all good gifts, bleſsings and proſperitie of theſe Countries and the Inhabitants thereof, muſt com from the great and merciful God, who therefore ought to bee worſhipped and heartily praied unto.</p>
                              <p>Whence wee conceiv it very neceſſarie, if in theſe high and important affairs wee would partake of God's gracious bleſsing, (without which all our conſultations will bee abortive) to minde and take in hand the things immediately concerning the ſincere and true worſhip of Him, above and before all other Worldly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                              <p>And that not onely by ſuch <hi>words</hi> as theſe, <hi>Religion ſhall bee maintained, even if need require, with the mightie hand;</hi> that beeing formerly agreed upon by the Members of the Union, but by a <hi>real</hi> maintenance thereof, in which behalf the Lords of <hi>Groninghen</hi> and <hi>Omlands,</hi> refer to their <hi>H. M.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,</p>
                              <p>Whether there ought not <hi>Vigorous means</hi> bee provided by the joint Provinces, to the end, that throughout them all, though in each, by themſelvs, and in all the aſſociated Countries and Towns, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual courſes may bee taken, as well as unanimous Reſolutions paſt and Ordinances publiſht, for the reſtraining, ſuppreſsing and puniſhing of Popiſh Conventicles, which do daily ſo encreaſ in Number and inſolencie, that without rigorous and preſent proceedings againſt them, this State cannot but incurr great danger.</p>
                              <p>Conſequently alſo, that the Seminaries of this Poperie, that is to ſaie, the places or Schools, where the Youth from their infancie are nouriſht up and embibed, like a new earthen pot, with thoſe abominable ſuperſtitions, may <hi>de facto,</hi> bee put down and aboliſhed; they having hitherto been ſuffered and continued in this State, not by connivance onely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but openly and daringly, to the great grief of many faithful Patriots.</p>
                              <p>That withal there bee to this end, upon all events a readie mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and means deviſed against the unlimited coming in of the Popiſh Clergie, who do not onely moſt freely and frequently reſort
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:99708:120"/>
and converſ in the countries, but likewiſe by their ſubtilties and envenom'd inſinuations ſeduce the younger ſort from the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to follow them: nevertheleſs, that the ſame bee don in ſuch manner, as the treatie of peace will permit; and beſides this, that the other ſects or ſeparates, however they bee called, be indulged no more libertie of exerciſe, then the very ſame, they had from the beginning, and no other; though none ſhall bee troubled in his Conſcience about private opinions.</p>
                              <p>That the Ambaſſadors &amp; publick Miniſters of Forrein Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Potentates ſhall ſuffer likewiſe no ſermons or other Church-Service in their houſes, but in the language of their own Lords, and Maſters, and admit none to them but thoſe of their own train and familie.</p>
                              <p>And that the civill reformation in the Mayerie of the Boſch, and ſuch like other places, bee most ſeriouſly taken to heart.</p>
                              <p>Now concerning the ſecond Point, beeing the <hi>Union</hi> and everlaſting Alliance of this State; becauſ your <hi>H.

                              </p>
                              <p>Therefore the Lords of the Citie and Lands would deſire your Hi. Mi. ſeriouſly to ponder, whether all the conſultations in theſe high and weightie affairs, as well Civil as Militarie, ought not to bee regulated, according to the ſenſ and contents of the Union aforeſaid, it beeing an everlaſting alliance, and a confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie which cannot bee receded from.</p>
                              <p>Wherewithall their <hi>N. M.</hi> ſhould take it for granted, that the leaſt, yea no alteration thereof at all is doubtleſs the best; if ſo bee your Hi. Mi. ſhall judg that the preſent constitusion of this state can permit it, which their <hi>N. M.</hi> conſide, they may in this behalf.</p>
                              <p>Hereupon, paſsing by the Civil administration of every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince apart, who are to bee left respectively to their own So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereinty, with reſtriction, nevertheleſs of the ſaid soveraigns in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the United Bond as joint intereſt, The Lords of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:99708:121"/>
and Land, ſhould conciev, under correction of your Hi. Mi. further advice and conſideration.</p>
                              <p>That all and the whole Civil Adminiſtration of this State, is moſt exactly and curiouſly ſettled therein, according to that time.</p>
                              <p>For the <hi>1.</hi> and <hi>16.</hi> Article thereof, doth ſay in plain terms, how and in what manner the differences and queſtions ariſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Provinces, the Cities and Members thereof, about their privileges, rights &amp;c. (as the text run's) ſhall bee determined or taken away.</p>
                              <p>Inſomuch, that for to ſhun and prevent moſt pernicious inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in our State, all unexſpectedly ariſing queſtions and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in matters, there ſpecified, ought to bee left there, where, and according as the ſame Article dictate's.</p>
                              <p>But in caſe there ariſe Diſcrepancie and jarring among the Provinces about the conduct and managing of this United State and matters depending and conſectarie, the <hi>9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                                 </hi> Article ſaith, In that caſe all is to bee regulated by the concluſion of the moſt-voting Provinces.</p>
                              <p>And whereas, the making of Peace or Truce, waging of War, and raiſing of contributions in the behalf of the Generalitie and the State united, are matters of very great weight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; Our forefathers agreed, that therein the pluralitie of Votes, ſhould have no place, but things ſhould bee don, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and unanimous Conſent of all the Confederacie.</p>
                              <p>Our Forefathers conſidered well enough, that the diverſitie of perſons, whereof the Government of this State conſiſted, and yet doth, would bring with it diverſitie of humors, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently cauſ at laſt diſcrepancie of opinion, even in weightieſt matters.</p>
                              <p>And herein alſo they have thought upon wholſom means, againſt the evil thence to bee feared, agreeing, that the difference riſen in that behalf, ſhould bee referr'd to the Lords Stadtholders of the United Provinces, in the laſt named Article.</p>
                              <p>It is true indeed, that the ſaid Article add's theſe terms, <hi>by proviſion</hi> or, <hi>proviſionally, and now are at this time beeing.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But the Lords of the Citie and Lands deſire your H. M.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:99708:121"/>
ſeriouſly to conſider, whether notwithſtanding ſuch clauſes, all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences ariſing from the grounds aforeſaid, ought not ſtill bee left at the ſubmiſsion there ſet down.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſ the ſame proviſion was never cancell'd or alter'd yet by any other order of the joint Conſederates.</p>
                              <p>In the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, becauſ the <hi>24</hi> Article of the ſaid ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting League and Union ſaith in plain and down-right terms, that the Lords Stadtholders which now are, or ſhall com hereafter, &amp;c. ſhall make promiſs by Oath, to follow and obſerv all and every Article in particular.</p>
                              <p>To which end, beſides this, there ought to bee likewiſe applied the unanimous Reſolution, taken after mature Deliberation, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 8/18 1650,</hi> together with the Inſtruction of the Council of State.</p>
                              <p>Furthermore the Lords of the Citie and Land are deſirous to propound to your H. M. herewithal, beeing the Articles of the Union ordinarily ſpeak of ordering or ſettling things by the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and the United Provinces; and more then manifeſt, that the ſaid Confederated State, that is to ſay, the United Provinces, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alwaies bee aſſembled in Bodie;</p>
                              <p>Whether it bee not therefore very neceſſarie, that exact and pertinent Orders may bee framed and eſtabliſhed for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Generalitie, in abſence of the reſpective voting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
                              <p>And that the Deputies or Commiſsioners to bee appointed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, bee autorized not by Provincial, but by a General and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Inſtruction of all the Provinces together.</p>
                              <p>That the ſame ſhall have an eie to whatſoever the joint Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces have referred unto them, that is to ſay, to the Generalitie, and diſpoſe therein as according to the extent of their inſtruction ſhall bee fit and requiſite for the Common welfare.</p>
                              <p>Coming now in order to the third point, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Militia;</hi> That the foreſaid Deputies or Commiſsioners of the reſpective Provinces, ſhall, with the advice of the Lords Stadholders or Council of State, have the direction of the <hi>Militia,</hi> and matters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, ſuch as are the removing or ſending forth of Garriſons
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:99708:122"/>
in great or ſmall bodies, out of one Province into another, for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of Fortifications and Frontiers, &amp;c. as the Union hold's forth throughout.</p>
                              <p>Safe notwithſtanding the Lords the States and the Stadtholders of the reſpective Provinces, each their own peculiar power, digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and autoritie within themſelvs, in matters of <hi>Militia</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant thereon, and the diſpoſing of the forces within their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Provinces, placed there for the ſecuring thereof.</p>
                              <p>They having the libertie in caſes of neceſsitie and conveniencie to place and diſplace, encreaſ or diminiſh them by their own Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for the ſervice of the Province.</p>
                              <p>And to take and frame ſuch orders and courſes about the Militarie Diſcipline and Juriſdiction, as either they have already, or ſhall finde good and ſutable to the conſtitution of their Provinces.</p>
                              <p>That the reſpective Provinces ſhall likewiſe retein to themſelvs the abſolute beſtowing of all higher and lower Offices of War, in ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments and Companies of either Foot or Horſ, as ſhall by repar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition bee charged upon the Provinces, and do receiv their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsions from them, provided onely they take the Oath of Fidelitie, to bee true to the Generalitie.</p>

                              <p>Moreover, that the Deputies or Commiſsioners of the reſpective Provinces to bee appointed as is aforeſaid, ſhall have the chief autoritie over, and managing of the Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>affairs, with the advice of the reſpective Councils of the Admiraltie; and in a word, power to do whatſoëver otherwiſe, a General of this State by Sea and land, upon incident occaſion and emergencies of trouble and danger is warranted and commanded to do, until ſuch time as the joint Provinces ſhall bee agreed about a General for the ſervice of this State.</p>
                              <p>By which occaſion the Lords of the Citie and land do preſent to your H. M. whether it is not highly neceſſarie, and mightily important

                              <p>Thus then, it beeing clear and manifeſt, not onely out of the forementioned Declaration of the States of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> but alſo out of many other publick Acts, that the beſetting or garriſoning of the Cities and Holds, or Forts in the Land, was ever left to the diſpoſing of the particular Governors of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Provinces, together with the States thereof or their Commiſsion'd Council, it muſt follow that the beſetting of the Cities and Forts in the reſpective Provinces hath ever purely and abſolutely, been and remained in effect, the proper and peculiar right and fact of the States of the reſpective Provinces, or their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion'd Council.</p>

                              <p>Which could bee deduced with many more inſtances, as from the ſame Inſtruction, ſo out of ſeveral other publick Acts of the ſaid States; but that their N. Gr. <hi>M.</hi> do hold it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>

                              <p>And this their N.

                              <p>And it is worth ſingular obſervation about that third Article, That all that is laid down there, and eſpecially the tranſmitting of the Patents with blanks for the names, is in every point a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing, with the manner of proceeding, obſerved and practiſed in thoſe Provinces, which had their particular Governors, and ſuch as were not withal, Captains General of the Armies or Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers; and particularly in the Province of <hi>Frieſland,</hi> out of which when the Council of State had a minde to take forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny forces, they were alwaies wont to addreſs their deſire for that end, to the Stadt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>holders or Governors particular of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, tranſmitting their patents with blanks for names, which the Stadt-holders or Governors particular, by advice of the States, or their deputies, fill'd up, and added thereunto their own Provincial patent.</p>

                                 <hi>As for the States of</hi> Holland and Zealand; <hi>they declare very formally in this behalf in the before-mentioned Reſolution of Feb.</hi> 6. 1587. <hi>in plain words,</hi> That in the open countrie of Holland, Zeland, and Weſt-Frieſland, no forces of foot or horſ, may attempt any inquartering, or thorough-marchings, without patents from his Excell<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> given by adviceof the foreſaid States, or their Committees. <hi>(Note) not in the</hi> open countrie: Ergò <hi>much leſs, in fenced Cities ſorts or ſtrong holds of the Provinces.</hi>

                              <p>The like is eaſily to bee ſhewed to have been ſetled by the Provinces of <hi>Utrecht, Frieſland, Over-Yſſel, Groninghen,</hi> and the <hi>Omlands;</hi> as in the Inſtructions given to their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie-States and Stadtholders, ſo alſo by ſeveral other publick Acts of the States; which their N.

There is applicable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this the <hi>7</hi> Article of the Union, in the beginning whereof it is eſtabliſhed, <hi>That the Frontier-Cities and others alſo, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie requiring it, ſhall be bound at all times to receiv ſuch Garriſons as the United Provinces ſhall finde good, and ordain by the advice of the Governor of the Provinces, where the Garriſon is to be laid</hi> (where

And howbeit the Election of ſom <hi>Officers of the Forrein Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> were abſolutely, and without any precedent Nomination, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of by the late Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and his Predeceſſor or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors; yet it cannot bee contradicted, but that the ſame was don, not by virtue of any right thoſe Princes had in qualitie of Captains General over the Souldierie for the Generalitie, but onely as allowed them by the States of thoſe particular Provinces, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they were likewiſe Stadtholders in particular; as alſo their Highneſſes in that regard never meddled with diſpoſing of any ſuch Forrein Officers as ſtood in the Repartition of thoſe Provinces which had their particular Governors.</p>
                              <p>The ſubſtance of the foreſaid <hi>eight Article,</hi> or the <hi>eight point</hi> formerly propounded, is pertinently confirmed by the ſeaventh Article of the Union; the <hi>18</hi> Article of the Inſtruction for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State; the oft-mentioned Reſolution of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> of Febr. <hi>6, 1587,</hi> the form of the Oath agreed upon by the States of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> upon the <hi>20</hi> daie of the ſame month (wherein the ſwearing Souldierie, among other, make's this ſolemn promiſs, <hi>To bee obedient to the States aforeſaid, or their Commiſsioners, in what they ſhall command them for the furtherance of the ſervice and defence of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Countries)</hi> together with the practice enſued and continued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
                              <p>For the elucidation of the <hi>Ninth point</hi> above mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> That their N. Gr.

                              <p>And first, touching the Office of <hi>Governor General</hi> having been inveſted from the Generalitie, his Autoritie extended over all the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:99708:140"/>
United Provinces, there beeing yielded up unto him, <hi>powerfully and abſolutely,</hi> (to make uſe of the words of the Acts of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorization, given by the States General, unto the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> Januar. <hi>10. 1586.) to command in the matter and point of War, and that which depend's thereon, by Sea and Land, over all the foreſaid Provinces, Cities and Members thereof</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>That on the contrarie the Charge of <hi>Captain General,</hi> likewiſe inveſted from the Generalitie, extended no further, then over the Souldierie Horſ and Foot, in ſervice of the Provinces, appear's by the <hi>Commiſsions</hi> given to the reſpective <hi>Princes of Orange</hi> in that qualitie, by the <hi>States General.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Inſomuch that betwixt theſe foreſaid offices or charges there are to bee obſerved theſe enſuing <hi>remarkable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the power and Autoritie of the <hi>Governor Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> extended and ſpread it ſelf over all the United Provinces themſelvs, together with the Cities and Members thereof, and the power and autoritie of the <hi>Captain General,</hi> onely over the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dierie, Armie or Leaguers thereof.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the <hi>Governor General</hi> of the United Provinces had the full and abſolute command over the particular Governors thereof, when as on the contrarie, the <hi>Captain General,</hi> had not any command in the world over the particular Governors of the Provinces, within their reſpective Juriſdiction; but thoſe particular Governors, notwithſtanding the Captain General appointed over the Souldierie, for the Generalitie, having been themſelvs alſo Captains General over the Souldierie lying within their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Provinces, as the ſame hath ſufficiently been ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, out of their respective Inſtructions and the conſtant practice of the Provinces, whoſe particular Governors were not the ſame perſons, that were appointed Captains General over the Souldierie, for the Generalitie.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that the <hi>Government General</hi> of the Generalitie did not in effect include the <hi>Admiralſhip</hi> of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, there beeing given likewiſe to thoſe Governors General by
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:99708:140"/>
their Commiſsion the power <hi>fully and abſolutely to command the Admirals and Vice-Admirals;</hi> whereas on the contrarie, the <hi>Captain-ſhip General,</hi> and the <hi>Admiral-ſhip of the Generalitie,</hi> are <hi>two equal charges,</hi> the one not beeing above the other, but of equal autoritie over the Souldierie by Land and Water, reſpectively; wherefore alſo the Commiſsions of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains general do not import (that which the Commiſsions of the Governors General aforeſaid, in that regard expreſsly comprehended) that the ſaid Captains General ſhould have any command over the Admirals, howbeit, that <hi>generally the Admiral-ſhip hath been conferred upon the Captains General, as a Charge apart,</hi> ſomtimes by one and the ſame, and otherwhiles alſo by ſeparate and diſtinct Commiſsions.</p>
                              <p>By all which it beeing abundantly manifeſt, what a palpable difference there is betwixt the <hi>Government and the Captain-ſhip General,</hi> beeing both conferred and exerciſed by autoritie from the Generalitie of thoſe Countries; their N. gr. M. will likewiſe briefly ſhew, the diſtinct offices of the <hi>Captain Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> over the Forces for the <hi>Generalitie,</hi> and of the <hi>Captains General</hi> appointed over the Souldierie, for the <hi>particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces;</hi> holding it needleſs to ſaie any more of the foreſaid Government General of the United Provinces, the ſame coming now into no conſideration at all, beeing altogether extinct and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in the times of the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> or to ſhew here the diſtinction that is betwixt the Government and Captain-ſhip General of the particular Provinces, foraſmuch as thoſe Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were never combined together in one and the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                              <p>Now then, it beeing heretofore fully proved, that the ſupreme autoritie over the Souldierie, within the reſpective Provinces, hath alwaies appertained and yet doth at preſent, unto the Provincial Government thereof, or to the Captains General of the particular Provinces, appointed by the ſame Provinces in the manner above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; it muſt needs follow, that the power and autoritie of the <hi>Captains General</hi> of the United Provinces, appointed by the States General, in qualitie as ſuch, hath extended no farther, nor
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:99708:141"/>
indeed could extend any further, then over the <hi>Souldierie Armie or Leaguers,</hi> beeing <hi>without the Voiceing-Provinces and in the Field,</hi> ſo as their own Commiſsion ſhew's likewiſe plainly enough, inſomuch, that the difference of the Charges of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains-General of the Generalitie, and of the Captains General of the particular Provinces conſiſted therein, that the former had the command, as the true and proper <hi>Chieftain</hi> or <hi>Field-leader</hi> of the <hi>Leaguers or Forces without the Provinces,</hi> and the Armies beeing in the <hi>Field,</hi> and the other had the <hi>chief power</hi> and autoritie in the Militia and the conduct of War <hi>within the</hi> reſpective <hi>Voicing-Provinces,</hi> by the advice of the States or their Commiſsion'd Counſellors, for ſo much as concerned the ſecuritie of each of theſe Provinces apart.</p>
                              <p>The States General of the united Provinces, having diſcovered in what manner the <hi>Earl of Leiceſter</hi> exceeded and abuſed the power of the Government General, conferred upon him by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, they found good after, for the preventing of the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies in time to com, to extinguiſh and mortifie the ſaid charge, as alſo it hath remained abſolutely extinct and mortified to this daie; (ſo that, as was ſaid before, the ſame ought not to bee taken into any deliberation at all) nevertheleſs the Provinces beeing engaged in ſo great a War with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſtanding in need therefore of a Field-leader, or Chieftain of the Union, they agreed by advice, to chuſe his Excellence <hi>Prince Maurice,</hi> of immortal memorie, for <hi>Captain General</hi> over the Land-Forces, and <hi>Admiral-General</hi> likewiſe over the Sea Forces; and after his Deceaſ the War ſtill continuing, they ſupplied the vacant place ſucceſsively, by the employ of their High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> 
                                 <hi>Henrie</hi> and <hi>William,</hi> both <hi>Princes of Orange:</hi> and now the War, through God's gracious bleſsing beeing com to an end, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a <hi>glorious peace,</hi> their N. gr. M. are of opinion, that thereby thoſe moveing cauſes beeing com to ceaſ, and yet ceaſing, it is conſequently not onely needleſs, but likewiſe for ſundrie preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant reaſons, formerly deduced by their N. gr. M. both by word of mouth and in the foreſaid written propoſition, both <hi>diſſerviceable and unadviſable, to procced again to the Election of a Captain-General.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="241" facs="tcp:99708:141"/>
The rather, for that their N.

The <hi>Militia</hi> or forces of theſe United Provinces beeing provided yet with a fit Chieftain or Director for the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralitie, the <hi>Field-marſhal</hi> namely, appointed by Commiſsion, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Julie 31, 1642,</hi> to bee over all the Forces Horſ and Foot, in preſent ſervice of the State, or ſuch as may bee entered therein afterwards.</p>

                                 <hi>The ſaid</hi> Field-marſhal <hi>having full</hi> power, autoritie <hi>and</hi> ſpecial command <hi>given him in that qualitie of his,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the ſaid forces; and to bring and keep them in all good order, rule and militarie diſcipline, and to uſe and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploie them for the defence of the United Netherlands; the quarters, forts and places thereof, according to the orders of the United Provinces in general and in particular; to ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the enemie, to annoie and diſadvantage him: <hi>item,</hi> To defend and protect the foreſaid United Countries in general, and the Provinces, Quarters, Cities, places &amp; inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in particular againſt all manner of force and violence, &amp;c.</p>

                              <p>Wee know very well and eaſily grant, That every one, who carrie's the Name of an honeſt man, is preſumed in Law, what matters ſoëver bee brought before him, that hee will adviſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, attentively, uprightly and ingenuouſly; ſo as according to his beſt knowledg, and in Conſcience, hee apprehend's it to make moſt for the honor of God Almightie, and the common welfare; as likewiſe, That all ſuch as are choſen to any office or place of Government, ought to bee called thereunto, with ſuch a particular reflexion; that all Inſtructions and Commiſsions in the Provinces and others, do preciſely aim at and imply as much; That all Governors themſelvs do either <hi>implicitly</hi> oblige themſelvs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:99708:144"/>
or are engaged by <hi>Oath</hi> in that behalf.

                              <p>Your H.

another in a holy and fervent Zeal, and in the ſecond, wherein conſiſt's the preſervation of the State, they would bee as readie to continue their upright mutual affection each to other.</p>
                              <p>Nevertheleſs, ſince ſom of the Provinces were pleaſed to inſiſt, that the States of <hi>Holland</hi> would declare themſelvs in special manner about the ninth and other Articles of the Union, and about the Expedients, whereby the Differences ariſing among the Provinces, in matters ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the ſaid Article, might bee removed; others ſom, as the Lords of <hi>Frieſland,</hi> and the Citie of <hi>Groninghen,</hi> and the <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> were pleaſed to inferr out of the ſaid Articles and from a pretended Neceſsitie, as if the Provinces were bound each one in particular, to proceed to the chooſing of a Stadtholder; The Lords of <hi>Holland</hi> are neceſsitated to declare, with all due reſpect to your Hi. Mi. that They are not able to comprehend, how either by the Text of the Union, or any Arguments thence deduced, or by any other pretended neceſsities, it is or ever can bee proved, That the Provinces ſhould bee bound to chooſ Stadtholders, or the intereſt and ſervice of the Common League ſhould require the ſame: for it is a thing paſt all diſpute, and aſſerted by the preſented Conſiderations of the Provinces themſelvs, <hi>That the States of the reſpective United Provinces every one apart are Soveraign States; That the Union made between them, expreſsly condition'd it, that every Province not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſame, ſhould not onely remain unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in their freedoms and prerogatives, ſo as that none ſhould trouble or moleſt the other about it, but on the contrarie, by all means due and poſsible, yea with body and goods, to help, aſsiſt, maintain, ſtrengthen and protect one another therein to the utmoſt againſt any whomſoëver;</hi> and whereas among all the foreſaid privileges the <hi>greateſt and moſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able point,</hi> is the <hi>Free and Soveraign Government,</hi> therefore the Provinces had no intent nor deſire, to bound and over-rule one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other therein in their Reſpective Juriſdictions; but have left one another, as to that, in their perfect freedom, for to adminiſter all the parts of Soveraigntie, in policie, Juſtice and otherwiſe, by themſelvs, or ſom of them in their name by others. And verily the Confederates could
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:99708:163"/>
have no ſuch particular intent at the time of making the Union, as to oblige or engage one another to the appointing of Stadtholders, foraſmuch as at that time they had not yet renounced the Dominion of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and conſequently were not qualified to appoint any Stadtholders; and therefore it will follow ſo much the leſs, that by the <hi>10</hi> Article of the Union the States ſhould have obliged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs to the continuance of appointing Stadtholders, they having then made no beginning yet, and the Stadtholders which then were ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the King's Commiſsion; beſides that by the foreſaid Article, ſuch queſtions as might ariſe about the matters there mentioned, are not abſolutely referred to the Stadholders, <hi>but</hi> onely proviſionally; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at all to the office of Stadtholderſhip, but onely to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in office and place then; inſomuch that the foreſaid proviſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Order, not beeing diſcontinued or altered in the life time of the Stadt-holders then in beeing, the foreſaid ſubmiſsion muſt needs bee ended with the deceaſ of the ſaid Stadt-holders, as beeing faſtned by the ſaid Confederates to the Elected perſons of thoſe Stadt-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And by adding of the words, <hi>now beeing,</hi> clearly ſhewed, that they meant not their Succeſſors ſhould pretend to the ſame right, unleſs it were that the ſame by a later Reſolution ſhould bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto them, which the Lords of <hi>Holland</hi> do not finde was ever don ſince; beeing the words of the foreſaid Article cannot poſsibly bear any ſuch interpretation as the Lords of <hi>Frieſland</hi> do hold forth; namely, <hi>That the ſubmiſsion ſhould not bee proviſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but that the ſentence or doom of the Stadt-holders ſhould have proviſional Execution;</hi> ſo much the leſs, beeing this is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to the <hi>16</hi> Article of the Union, expreſsly importing, <hi>That the ſentence of the Stadt-holders ought to bee followed and yielded unto without any further demur, or other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo of right, by way of appeal, relief, review, nullitie, or any other exception whatſoëver:</hi> which doth not agree with a proviſional Execution, preſuppoſing a further demur or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, whereby the ſentence may com to bee altered: as alſo the words <hi>now beeing</hi> cannot bee referred to the United Provinces, becauſ that thereby the Stadtholders of the Provinces which thereafter might have joined themſelvs to the Union, would have remained excluded from the

God's gracious and bleſſed aſsiſtance for their preſent important Deliberations, They deſired, <hi>that, according to their Summons of</hi> Novemb. 6, <hi>laſt, they would bee pleaſed to receiv them into their Aſſemblie, and to ſhew and appoint the places where they the Commiſsioners ſhould in the name and behalf of the ſaid Land of</hi> Drent, <hi>have their Ordinarie Seſsion at and together with the reſt of the Provimces;</hi> as alſo, <hi>That the Deputies of the ſaid Countrie ſhould bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Seſsion likewiſe in all the Courts of the Generalitie.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was found good, that the <hi>Retro-acta</hi> of and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to ſuch matters and propoſitions formerly paſt in the Aſſemblie of their Hi.

                  <p>It was ſtrange to ſee that there was a <hi>Summons</hi> paſt, as from their Hi.

And thereupon was it, that the Deputies thence deſired the Seſsion, as was ſaid before. The then Lord Preſident beeing deſired to ſhew how that abuſe came, hee was able to ſay nothing elſ to it, but that ſuch kinde of diſpatches depend upon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, notice-taking and fidelitie of the ſecretarie, having all the Regiſters and Original Acts in his keeping; and it beeing impoſsible for a Preſident to collation every thing that is brought him for to ſign, with the Regiſters,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:99708:182"/>
or to look after it whether all bee well don, there beeing ſomtimes twentie, thirtie and more things ſent in together at one time, to bee ſigned in haſt. However this abuſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited thoſe of <hi>Drent</hi> nothing, but they were ſilently kept without the Aſſemblie for all that.</p>
                  <p>That which the Deputies of the Countrie of <hi>Drent</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and preſented in writting to the Lords of the great Aſſemblie, in grounding and juſtifying their Demands, is to bee ſeen by that which followeth, formerly exhibited by them.</p>

In purſuance of this, the Gentrie and Freeholders, repreſenting the State of the Countrie, or Countie of <hi>Drent,</hi> were ſolemnly and <hi>aequo Jure,</hi> as Confederates, taken and received into the <hi>Union of Utrecht, April</hi> 11<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1580.</p>

                              <p>The like caſe happened alſo to other their neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Provinces, either totally or in part, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſame, beeing afterwards reduced again, recovered all their former places and privileges, <hi>Jure poſtli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minil.</hi>

                              <p>So that in every regard, it is more then fitting and reaſonable, that the Countrie of <hi>Drent,</hi> after their Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Reduction, bee likewiſe wholly reſtored unto and repoſſeſsed of their former ſtate and condition.</p>
                              <p>Which your Hi. Mi. themſelvs alſo have underſtood thus, and clearly manifeſted, in the year 1584. whenas your Hi.

                              <p>Nor can or ought the ſmalneſs of the ſaid Countrie or their mean abilities, prejudice them ought, beeing that notwithſtanding the ſaid Conſiderations, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Union and into the general Aſſemblie <hi>aequo jure,</hi> ſo long ago, by reaſon whereof they cannot now in that regard bee rejected.</p>

                              <p>Beſides that the ſaid Countrie of <hi>Drent</hi> is not ſo ſmall neither, or of ſo little conſideration, but that in regard of the ſituation ſhee is the <hi>Keie of</hi> 2 <hi>or</hi> 3 <hi>of her</hi> neighboring al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied <hi>Provinces,</hi> in which the Countries in general are not a little concerned.</p>
                              <p>No more can it prejudice the ſaid Countrie, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and ſom particular Cities alſo were admitted into the Union, which nevertheleſs had no Seſsion nor Voice in the general Aſsemblie; There beeing a vaſt difference

Whereupon your Hi. Mi. were pleaſed to

tranſmit the Copies of the ſaid Remonſtrance and annexed papers to all the Provinces, and ſeriouſly to recommend the ſame buſineſs, that at convenient opportunities, and and at their Land-daies, they might ripely examine the whole matter, and having conſidered thereof, charge and and autorize their reſpective Commiſsioners at the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie General, that with common advice of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, the foreſaid deſires of the Countrie of <hi>Drent</hi> might bee reſolved upon as was fitting; all which appeareth by the Reſolutions of <hi>Octob.</hi> 27, 1618, and by your Hi. Mi. ſerious Letters of Recommendation of the ſame date.</p>
                              <p>Which produced this effect, that ſom Provinces decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereupon, that they would charge and autorize their Deputies at the Aſſemblie, to advance ſuch a Reſolution, as ſhould give content to the Countrie of <hi>Drent,</hi> and that none ſhould thereby bee prejudiced in his juſt cauſ and right.

                              <p>However, the ſucceſs failing for that time, there were new applications made in this behalf in the year 1632.

                              <p>Afterwards in the year 1600, when by the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral there was introduced at <hi>Berg op Zome</hi> and <hi>Breda</hi> a higher raiſing of the general means, and complaint pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented thereupon in theſe Cities behalf, ſhewing, That the ſaid Cities, for matter of means, contributions and the like burthens, were not dealt withal, according to their old Rights and Privileges of <hi>Braband;</hi> the ſaid States General declared thereupon, That they judged, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants ought, as <hi>members of the Common Union,</hi> bear the burthen together with their Neighbors; and if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after there ſhould bee occaſion of any high or new rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of means, they ſhould have <hi>Writs</hi> ſent them firſt, to com to the Aſſemblie of the States General, with the ſame autoritie, as they ſhould have in thoſe matters among the States-Aſſemblie of <hi>Braband,</hi> if the ſame could bee formed in due maner.</p>
                              <p>In this foreſaid State and Government did the affairs of <hi>Braband</hi> remain, notwithſtanding, That their ſtate and condition was much ſtrengthened and enlarged from time to time, through the Reduction of the Cities of <hi>Breda, Steenbergen, Grave, the Boſch, Maſtricht</hi> &amp;c. inſomuch, That the <hi>State of Braband,</hi> holding it with the United Netherlands, conſiſt's at preſent, in <hi>ſix ſtrong and walled Cities,</hi> beſides <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> and divers others belonging thereunto, and therewithal an exceeding great Diſtrict of open Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,

                  <p>By the Tenor of the <hi>Union</hi> it appeareth, that between the <hi>Netherlands</hi> there was concluded an everlaſting firm Peace, Covenant and Unitie for the expelling of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> and their Adherents, and to reſtore the Inhabitants

                  <p>After which time the Citie beeing overmaſtered, the ſame was continually kept under by force of arms, and pittifully handled by the Spaniards Italians and other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Nations, till in the year 1577. their Confederates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued the Citie from the High Dutch.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1576. the foreſaid Citie ſigned and ſealed the Pacification of <hi>Ghendt.</hi>

In the year 1578. ſhee ſwore to the peace of Religion and in the year 1579. embraced and publiſhed the <hi>Union</hi> made at <hi>Utrecht.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the maintenance whereof, the <hi>good partie</hi> within that Citie adventured life and goods, laboring continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how they might bee ſupported by the Confederates with men and ammunition, according as they had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd and promiſed them by the Deputies, within a little while after the foreſaid publication, and the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of that Citie, had thankfully accepeted of it, with proteſtation, they were reſolved never to ſeparate from the <hi>Generalitie,</hi> whereunto they were engaged and confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſolemn Vow and Oath.</p>
                  <p>But when the Confederates afterwards, contrarie to the foreſaid preſentation foreſlowed the ſending of ſuccor, and the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> after the ſubduing of <hi>Maſtricht</hi> drawing neer to the ſaid Citie of the <hi>Boſch,</hi> cauſed the ſame to bee ſummoned to ſurrender, then the <hi>good partie,</hi> unable to make reſiſtance, both to the ill-affected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, with whom they had ſtrugling enough before, to bring them to ſom communitie; and to the puiſſant Leaguer of the foreſaid <hi>Prince of Parma</hi> without, was conſtrained to abandon the Citie with all their families, ſom thouſands of them, and to leav all their welfare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde.</p>
                  <p>Which Citie beeing afterwards reduced again to the Union, by the arms of the <hi>Confederates</hi> in the year 1629. it ought likewiſe to bee reſtored to their antient Rights and Privileges.</p>
                  <p>As for the faithful ſervices of the <hi>Citie of Breda,</hi> for the Common Libertie, there is much of it upon publick Record, in the Netherlandiſh Hiſtories.</p>
                  <p>For a taſte whereof wee ſhall onely touch here; That the Companie of the withdrawing partie from <hi>Breda,</hi> did many notable ſervices againſt the Spaniards, before <hi>Berghen</hi> in <hi>Heinout, Harlem,</hi> vvithin <hi>Zirick-Sen</hi> and elſwhere.</p>

The inland wars lighted more heavie and ſmart upon this Citie then any of the Netherlands beſides. For beeing taken into Confiſcation by Duke <hi>D' Alva</hi> in the year 1568. it was thereafter moſt extremely overburthened with heavie Garriſons both horſ and foot; until the Citie was beleaguered and delivered again by the Earl of <hi>Hohenloe</hi> in the year 1577.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards, <hi>Jun.</hi> 28. 1581. the Citie, beeing bare of Garriſon, was ſurprized again by the Spaniards, through the Caſtle, by force of arms, and barbarouſly plundred notwithſtanding the manful reſiſtance made by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, and eſpecially by the young men of the Citie, who were moſt of them ſlain in the Defenſ thereof.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1590. the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> the Caſtle was ſurprized again by Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> with a Turf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat.</p>
                  <p>During the Spaniſh Siege before it, from <hi>Auguſt</hi> 27. 1624. to <hi>June</hi> 5. 1625. there periſhed above 5000 Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants within the Citie, by the war, plague and famin; and the Citie was deſerted after the ſurrender by more then three fourth parts of the Citizens, till the reduction of the Citie followed in the year 1637.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe of the <hi>Citie of Grave,</hi> have likewiſe ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs very zealous and reſolute in the late wars againſt the Enemies of the Common Fatherland; for not long after the <hi>Pacification of Gbendt</hi> they took their Spaniſh Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor priſoner, and what with monie, what by force and the loſs of manie Citizens in the Enterprize, got and drove out the Spaniſh and high-Dutch Garriſons, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards <hi>Maie</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the year 1586. all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof engaged themſelvs by Oath; to make ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt reſiſtance againſt the common Enemie of the Land, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Adherents; and that they would in no wiſe liſten to any offer of agreement or reconciliation with the foreſaid Enemies.</p>

                     <pb n="361" facs="tcp:99708:203"/>
Within a ſhort time after, This ſame Citie beeing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the Union and ſubdued by the Enemie, they remained in a ſad condition, till the Citie was reduced again to the United State, in the year 1602. by Prince <hi>Maurice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Steenberghen,</hi> a very antient Citie of <hi>Braband,</hi> beeing freed of the High-Dutch Garriſon in the year 1577. it vvas ſubdued again by the Spaniards, both in Anno 1582. and 1622. and tvvice alſo reduced by the Arms of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, viz. in the years 1591. and the ſaid 1622.</p>
                  <p>It is remarkable, that vvhileſt the Spaniſh held this Citie in poſſeſsion, the ſame vvas ſo deſerted of Citizens and made ſo deſolate that there vvas not left nor kept any Judgment-Seat or adminiſtration of Juſtice there.</p>
                  <p>By all which it plainly appear's, That none of the foreſaid Cities of <hi>Braband,</hi> ever endeavored to join or agree with the Spaniard or their Aſſociates againſt the Union and Oath taken, without extreme neceſsitie; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly never ſought of their own accord or wilfully to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joint themſelvs from the United State; but they were all of them, forced and rent away from the ſame, by the force and povver of the Enemie, deſtitute of ſuccor, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd by others, vvithout any fault of their ovvn, nay, to their ovvn great grief and undoing.</p>
                  <p>The Cities of <hi>Bruggen</hi> vvith the Land <hi>Van Vrye</hi> and <hi>Venlo,</hi> they are the onely places, vvhich for the ſaid Crime of Deſertion vvere publickly declared Enemies, and conſequently had forfeited their Rights and pretentions, vvhich by virtue of the Union they might have claimed othervviſe.</p>
                  <p>In all publick Acts, Thoſe of <hi>Braband</hi> are by the States of the United Provinces called indeed their <hi>Aſſociates,</hi> but in Truth they are dealt vvith as a people purely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered.</p>

For proof vvhereof vvee ſhall produce among many, but theſe 3 points.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> for matter of <hi>Adminiſtration of Juſtice,</hi> the Court or <hi>Council of Braband</hi> doth ſit without the Province, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the known Privileges and Charters of the Land, ſworn to by all the <hi>Dukes;</hi> beſides that the ſaid <hi>infringement</hi> draw's the good inhabitants into exceſsive troubles, charges and inconveniencies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> in regard of <hi>Government,</hi> There is introducing a new waie of naturalizing ſtrangers in <hi>Braband,</hi> for the ſuppreſsing and excluding of the Natives as well from beeing employ'd in their own Province, as they are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently excluded from offices and Emploiments in others, contrarie to their expreſs privilege, <hi>quod competit univerſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulo Brabantiae,</hi> (which is the peculiar privilege of the people of <hi>Braband,)</hi> conditioned for with the Prince, and ſworn to by the Prince.</p>
                  <p>This Privilege was never violated in <hi>Braband</hi> before the Troubles, and remaineth pure and uncorrupt even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Spaniſh Government</hi> to this very daie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> touching the Revenues and <hi>Contributions,</hi> there have been new burthens impoſed all along upon thoſe of <hi>Braband,</hi> and they are threatned with more heavie ones to bee impoſed at pleaſure, without any of their conſent, nay, without ſo much as hearing them.</p>
                  <p>Which is repugnant, not onely againſt the Privileges of the Countrie, but likewiſe particularly againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes of the <hi>States General</hi> of the year 1600, alleged in the former Deduction.</p>

                  <p>Where it is obſervable yet, that to the <hi>Pacification of Ghendt</hi> and <hi>Union of Utrecht,</hi> there were not onely invited and called in the <hi>great</hi> or <hi>chief</hi> Cities of the Provinces, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently <hi>all</hi> the Cities and <hi>Members</hi> thereof; and who know's not the practice ſince therupon throughout all the United Provinces.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Steward Dorp,</hi> together with the Prince's <hi>Gentle-men</hi> and <hi>Halbardiers,</hi> came to meet the Deputies of the States
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:99708:206"/>
General firſt, and afterwards the reſt of the Deputies ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsively unto their Caroaches, and led them to their Seats.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tegneius</hi> the miniſter was to make the Sermon, and <hi>Lindanus,</hi> to adminiſter the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> The Church was ſo throng'd and fill'd with people greedie after <hi>Noveltie,</hi> that it cauſed very much <hi>diſorder</hi> and <hi>diſturbance</hi> both in ſinging and preaching, the one was confounded, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could ſcarce bee heard by any, for all the autoritie and command for ſilence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inſomuch, that the miniſter was fain to give over abruptly, ſoon after the infant and the reſt of the train were got in once.</p>
                  <p>There had been ſom <hi>Diſorder</hi> likewiſe at <hi>Court,</hi> which cauſed them to com later then was exſpected, and that by reaſon of the diſpute about the <hi>Duke of York</hi> his going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them. The firſt order was, that the <hi>Princeſs Albertina,</hi> ſhould carrie the Infant, and bee led by the <hi>Duke of York</hi> and <hi>Prince Edward.</hi> But the <hi>Duke</hi> deſired to bee excuſed, ſaying, hee had not been wellcom'd by the <hi>State,</hi> and if on this occaſion, hee ſhould meet with ſom of the Government, hee knew not how to comport himſelf, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or ſalute them; nevertheleſs hee ſaid hee would go along and lead the <hi>Queen of Bohemia;</hi> but afterwards, conſidering that likewiſe, hee repeated his former Excuſe, and went not at all. But hee himſelf having made no addreſs at all before unto the State of his coming, that hee might bee wellcom'd by them, his Excuſe was none: and it was thought, hee refuſed it onely of <hi>greatneſs,</hi> or by reaſon of the <hi>conteſting</hi> of the <hi>Princeſſes Royal</hi> and <hi>Dowager</hi> about the <hi>Guardian-ſhip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But hereupon the Princeſs <hi>Albertina</hi> likewiſe refuſing to carrie the Infant, it was moved my Ladie <hi>Stanhope</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs of the Princeſs Roial ſhould carrie it, and the young Ladies of <hi>Brederode</hi> and of <hi>Dhona</hi> ſhould bear up the Train, beeing a long piece of cloth with white fur and black ſpots. This was oppoſed by my Ladie <hi>Brederode,</hi> ſaying, Shee
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:99708:207"/>
did not deſire her daughters ſhould go training it after Madam <hi>Stanhop.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At laſt it was agreed that the Ladie of <hi>Dhona,</hi> daughter of the Lord <hi>Brederode,</hi> ſhould carrie the Childe to Church, as ſhee did, led on the right hand by Count <hi>Maurice,</hi> and on the left by my Lord <hi>Goring, aliâs,</hi> Earl of <hi>Norwich:</hi> the Train was born by two Ladies of <hi>Dhona,</hi> and two of <hi>Brederode.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After them followed the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> led by—and then Princeſs <hi>Dowager,</hi> Grandmother, led by Prince <hi>Edward;</hi> after her the Princeſs <hi>Louyſe,</hi> the young Princeſſes of <hi>Orange,</hi> of <hi>Hozenzollen</hi> and others, moſt of them confuſedly.</p>
                  <p>Beeing Coach'd and brought to Church and ſeated there; the noiſ and ſtir of the people was ſo great, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter was glad to diſpatch and haſten to the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament, by reading the uſual inſtitution (during which the whole companie ſtood up:) and then the Childe was preſented by the <hi>Queen,</hi> and baptized by <hi>Lindanus,</hi> naming it <hi>William-Henrie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſpeech went, that the <hi>Princeſs Roial</hi> would gladly have named it <hi>Charls-William,</hi> but that the <hi>Grandmother</hi> oppoſed it with that eagerneſs, that ſhee ſaid, <hi>If they will call him</hi> CHARLS, <hi>I will not go along to ſee him Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Church-Cerimonies beeing performed, the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties roſe up one after another in their order, and paſsing by the Ladies, took Coach again, each partie repairing to their uſual Randevouz, and the reſt back to the Court.</p>
                  <p>Where having repoſed themſelvs a little, there came the Deputies of their Hi. Mi. the States General, finding the Princeſs Roial ſtanding before her bed ſide, and right over againſt her the <hi>Queen</hi> and Princeſs <hi>Dowager.</hi> And after my Lord <hi>Van Soelen</hi> had complemented her, according to the occaſion, hee preſented a gilt-box for the Infant, wherein there was an Obligation of an yearly <hi>penſion</hi> for him of
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:99708:207"/>
8000 <hi>Gilders.</hi> The <hi>Princeſs Roial</hi> anſwered with a like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, yet did not reach forth her hand to receiv the Box from him, but hee beeing beckned towards a Chair ſtanding by, there hee ſet it down; and thus taking their leavs again they withdrew, having cauſed a <hi>thouſand Gilders</hi> in fair gold to bee beſtowed upon the Nurſerie. A little after thoſe of <hi>Holland</hi> came, whoſe preſent was a gilt box with a penſion of 5000 <hi>flor. per ann.</hi> giving 800 <hi>flor.</hi> to the Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie. <hi>Delft</hi> gave a penſion of 200 <hi>flor. per ann.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> one of a 1000 <hi>flor. per ann.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Zealand</hi> 20000 <hi>flor.</hi> once for all.</p>
                  <p>The two Miniſters, the one for preaching, the other for Adminiſtring the Sacrament, had each 300 <hi>flor.</hi> given them in the young Prince his behalf.</p>
                  <p>From the Prince <hi>Elector of Brandenburg</hi> there aſsiſted none at all at the Font; nor from any other forrein friend, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in perſon, nor by Deputation.</p>

                  <p>Feaſt or Collation there was none.</p>
                  <p>Som did not take it well that the Halbardiers went by the Coach ſides of the young Prince; nor that the childe was covered with Ermyn-fur, black on white, that beeing Roial.</p>

                  <p>Shee cauſed hers likewiſe to take great pains in <hi>Zealand</hi> at the Land-daie there in <hi>April,</hi> to get the young Prince received there again as <hi>Premier Noble,</hi> upon ſeveral grounds, which the Province notwithſtanding would in no wiſe yield unto.

                  <p>Thoſe of <hi>Holland,</hi> to have an eie upon it, diſpatched thitherwards the Lords <hi>van Opdam, de Wit, Nyport</hi> and <hi>Rypen,</hi> as it were to invite thoſe of <hi>Zealand</hi> to the ſending back their Deputies to the great Aſſemblie, and to erect the <hi>Chambre Mi-partie,</hi> according to the Treatie of Peace with <hi>Spain:</hi> but really, for the diverting of that blow, of chooſing again a <hi>Stadholder</hi> and <hi>Premier Noble</hi> there. And ſo much they effected, That there was nothing don at that meeting, but a Reſolution taken, of ſending to the <hi>Hague</hi> again. And the Countie-Cities took upon them the Right of chooſing their own Council, after the example of <hi>Holland.</hi>

                  <p>

                  <p>Beſides all this, there happened yet a further occaſion of exaſperating and heightning the Contention, news bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought about this time, that the Governor of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi> the <hi>Earl of Donaw,</hi> had cauſed to bee apprehended and ſecured an Orange Gentleman, by name <hi>Rafaëlis,</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore French Miniſter at the <hi>Haghe,</hi> and afterwards one of the Princes Counſel, beeing ſecretly diſpatcht by the <hi>Princeſs Roial,</hi> to get a certain Act declared in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palitie of <hi>Orange,</hi> pretended to have been made by <hi>Prince William,</hi> and addreſt to the ſaid <hi>Earl of Donaw,</hi> in manner as followeth.</p>

<pb n="379" facs="tcp:99708:212"/>
hee cauſed hold to bee laid on him that night, and lodged him ſafe in the Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>High Court</hi> having heard out the full plea of the Difference between the Princely parties, there were all means tried, to bring it to an amicable tranſaction and compoſure; but the ſame not taking, Sentence was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, and therein alſo, how the <hi>Cabinet</hi> ſhould bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed, which the <hi>Court Provincial</hi> in their precedent Sentence, had not ſo much as mentioned once.</p>
                  <p>By this Sentence the <hi>Princeſs Royal</hi> conceived herſelf much prejudiced, and declared, that ſhee would deſire Review thereof to bee made; yet becauſ all the Creditors remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtill unpai'd, and clamored much, the Princeſs Roial declared, That though ſhee could not yield to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Sentence, there beeing Errors in it, and was reſolved to deſire a <hi>Review</hi> thereof, and to proſecute it accordingly; nevertheleſs for the Creditor's ſake, that they might receiv due ſatisfaction once, ſhee was content, reſerving her Right and exception againſt the foreſaid Sentence, that Order may bee taken jointly for their paiment &amp;c. Which Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beeing preſented from the <hi>Princeſs Roial</hi> to the Princeſs <hi>Dowager, July</hi> 31. her anſwer was, That as for the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged Sentence, her High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> and the Pr.

It was none of her High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> fault, that the Creditors were not paid, ſhee having deſired the High Court formerly, to autorize the Princes Counſel for ſatisfying of them. Her High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it to the care of the <hi>Princeſs Royal</hi> to finde the monies for ſatisfying of the Creditors, and would bee very glad thoſe honeſt people might receiv content once.</p>

                              <p>As after wee chearfully took it for a pledg and token thereof, that your N. M.

                              <p>Conſidering on the one hand that it could ſo fall out at one time or other, by Wars or otherwiſe (which God in mercie avert and protect theſe Countries from) as that the condition of the Land ſhould require it to proceed to the choice of a <hi>Captain Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> during this ſaid Minoritie; when it would prove very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the publick intereſt, that the Provinces in that caſe ſhould bee manacled by ſuch an Engagement from doing their Countrie ſervice.</p>
                              <p>And on the other hand, it might ſo happen likewiſe (as wee hope to God it ſhall) that the young <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> beeing com to age, theſe <hi>Netherlands</hi> may yet enjoie the bleſsing of a ſettled Peace, ſo that all the reaſons and motives formerly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged, whereupon wee ground it at preſent <hi>unſerviceable</hi> and <hi>unadviſable</hi> to make a <hi>Captain General,</hi> ſhall remain the ſame, and firm and good ſtill; yea, and that at that very time

alſo the Election of a Captain General may bee found and held di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to bee againſt the ſervice of the Land, and repugnant to its welfare. And that it would prove the higheſt prejudice, to have in any ſort obliged our poſteritie by ſuch Engagements.</p>

the reſt, that the 6 and 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of the foreſaid Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>June</hi> 16 ought to bee obſerved.

That they had, for redreſs thereof, examined the former Acts of <hi>Febr.</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1599<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of <hi>Jun.</hi> 7<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1623. and found both in the one and the other ſeveral good points, from all which together there might bee framed a good Project, accommodated for the preſent time and conjuncture, leaving out ſuch things, as are not practicable, or cannot bee introduced without offence. So as it was ſeen in the year 1623, that immediately after the publiſhing of that Act, there aroſe great alteration and diſtemper among the Souldierie, whereby ſom places might eaſily have run great hazard, had it not been prevented inſtantly; at what time his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Prince <hi>Henrie,</hi> with ſom of the Lords of the Generalitie were fain to repair in perſon to <hi>Breda,</hi> to ſettle the diſorder by exemplarie puniſhment; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it ſtuck there, inſomuch that they durſt not urge the further ſtrict obſerving of the ſaid Act, and indeed it could never yet bee brought or kept in practice. This they thought themſelvs obliged to repreſent unto their H. M. before the drawing up of another Act for redreſs in the point of Muſtering; which might eaſily cauſ new diſtemper, or would hardly bee obſerved as was fitting, and the executions of the puniſhments prove as difficult and dangerous; not that they ſought any waie to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract or delaie the redreſs of having and keeping a good and well ordered Militia, they counting nothing more needful, and had therefore been continually preſsing for the ſame, and recommended it from time to time moſt ſeriouſly as the greateſt ſervice of the Land; and ſo they did ſtill. But to obtain that by a <hi>reformation</hi> of the <hi>muſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and making of ſtrict Acts and Orders about that, they conceived it would bee fruitleſs, if there went not before, a redreſs of that pretext, which is ſo commonly taken up in this kinde, <hi>viz.</hi> in the firſt place, a more <hi>preciſe and readie paie,</hi> without letting the Companie's arrears run on for a long time, even many months together, ſo as they ſaid, they were informed of late, when they went about
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:99708:237"/>
to take a courſ with a certain Ritmaſter, for the better paying of his complaining Troopers; the ſaid Ritmaſter alleging, That his pay-maſters were in arrears to him for 24 months together. The like they had underſtood alſo by other Ritmaſters and Captains; and that others, though better paid, were put to monthly extraordinarie charges, for Clarks and Sollicitors, whom they muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain at 60. 70. and more Florins <hi>per</hi> month, beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incumbrances, as defalcating of the 100. pennie and the like, over and above all other expences; which they beeing not able to ſupplie out of their own entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, (beeing allowed but a ſingle paie for a Clark in the liſt) they muſt either abate and deduct the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of ſo many months arrears from their Souldiers and Troopers, whence thoſe complaints of them ariſe, that they can never get their full paie: or elſ they muſt ſeek and finde out other waies, whereby to repair their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, to the Land's great diſſervice. Which ground of their pretext, if it were once remooved, and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies were duely and orderly paid their wages, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs in the muſtering would eaſily finde admittance, that the tranſgreſſors might bee puniſhed according to the tenor of the Acts made or to bee made in that behalf. Furthermore They ſaid, that it had been obſerved in the matter of muſtering, things were not every where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged for the beſt, whiles ſom Provinces ſent their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries to a Garriſon where there laie many Companies of ſeveral Repartitions, muſtering there onely ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies as belong'd to theirs; where it is eaſie to conceiv for any one, that it was no hard matter for ſuch Companies to make compleat muſters, when the reſt knew it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd not them, though all the Companies appeared in arms, and ſom kinde of muſtering paſt upon them all, as long as their paie was not at hand. But (ſaid they) if this Council ſhould muſter the whole Garriſon toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then none would bee at libertie, to lend his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:99708:237"/>
to another; which would bee ſo much the more effectual yet, if the Provincial paiments were made by no other rolls but thoſe of the Council, where the publick intereſt would bee better heeded. And if one or other Province were deſirous at any time, to have thoſe of their Repartition muſtered, the Council, having notice thereof, ſhould preſently give order for it. The ſaid Council proteſting, that in making theſe motions, they had no deſign or deſire to prejudice the Provinces Right of muſtering themſelvs, in the leaſt; but that according to their bounden dutie, they were conſtrained to make this repreſentation, it beeing evident, that in the courſes hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to uſed, the publick ſervice was not conſidered as it ought, and the whole Land and the Provinces abuſed. They therefore deſired their H. M. that they would bee pleaſed, to take all theſe things into due conſideration, that the affairs concerning the militia may bee brought once to a good ſettlement at length.</p>

The preſent Commiſsioners at the Aſſemblie, beeing of opinion, That, <hi>during the peace,</hi> this courſ would bee proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally ſufficient for this State.</p>

                  <p>And to the end that the ſervice of the Countrie may bee ſo much the better regarded, and the foreſaid publick Miniſters the more fitted for it, the Aſſemblie judged it requiſite, that the Committee (to whom the opening of the foreſaid ſecret Letters ſhall bee referred) ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bee deſired and autorized to tranſmit unto the ſaid

                     <p>THe High Mightie Lords the States General of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Netherlands, taking to heart the <hi>long-continued, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and dangerous diſturbances and irritations</hi> which daily are encreaſing more in the States of theſe Countries, by reaſon of the <hi>Diſcrepancie</hi> ariſen betwixt the <hi>hx Provinces</hi> on the one ſide, and the Province of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſtfrieſland</hi> on the other, about the <hi>Reducing and caſhiering of a part of the Militia, and the eſtabliſhing of a ſtate of War;</hi> and according to their great wiſdom and knowledg of affairs, foreſeeing the inconveniences like to enſue thereupon; the rather for that by the Province of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſtfrieſland</hi> there was already a ſeparate Caſhiering reſolved upon by pluralitie of voices, and orders iſſued by them for the effecting thereof; they found good and neceſſarie to decree a ſolemn Sending or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion (whereunto wee join'd our ſelf) to all the Cities and Members of the foreſaid Province of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſtfrieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for to perſuade the ſame by all conceivable motives, that they would refrain from all ſeparate caſhiering, diminiſhing or altering of the forces, engaged in ſervice by oath to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie; and to withdraw themſelvs from what might have been undertaken to the contrarie; conforming themſelvs with the ſix other Provinces, or ſubmitting the points in difference according to the proviſion of the Union in that behalf: <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>And the ſaid Lords the States General deſired and autorized Us, to ſee all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite order taken, and to provide that all might bee kept in <hi>peace and quiet,</hi> and ſpecially the Union preſerved and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, together with all the conſequences and references of the ſame, and that on the contrarie all things may bee obviated and

reſiſted, what is or may bee attemted againſt it.</p>
                     <p>The foreſaid ſending or Commiſsion beeing performed and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and nothing effected by it, by reaſon of the <hi>counter-working of ſom ill-affected,</hi> Wee, together with his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie the Stadholder of <hi>Friezland,</hi> and the Council of State, after many meetings and conferences (under proteſtation to meet the Province of <hi>Holland</hi> as far as might bee) framed a ſolid draught touching the affairs of the Militia, and things conſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and connexed, ſo as it might bee pleaſing and acceptable to the joint Provinces; and tend moreover to the maintenance and conſervation of the Uuion, and conſequently to the greateſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, quiet, unitie and ſecuritie of the State of theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whereupon conceiving hope, and having likewiſe uſed both in publick, and under-hand all friendly means of inducement and perſuaſion, wee found at laſt, to our higheſt grief, that all theſe well-meant endeavors and labors of ours were made but ſo much the more fruitleſs</hi> through the inſolent demeanour of ſom, who choſe rather to put the ſafetie of the Land from without, and the welfare of the good Inhabitants within into an hazardous ballance, then yield but one hair's-bredth from their ill-conceived opinions, wherewith they had abuſed, and abuſively informed their reſpective Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and indeavored afterwards by wiles and ſubtilties to draw aſide likewiſe diverſ good Members of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie of <hi>Holland</hi> it ſelf.</p>

<pb n="480" facs="tcp:99708:263"/>
publick autoritie profeſſed and exerciſed in the Provinces, Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated Countries and Cities of this State.</p>
                     <p>So that there beeing no appearance left of prevailing by any kiude of perſuaſion or accommodation, and in the mean time all kinde of <hi>bold, ſeditious and dangerous diſcourſes</hi> of thoſe ill-affected perſons coming to our ears; beſides diverſ others well-grounded warnings <hi>of moſt unheard of, pernicious and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous deſigns and machinations againſt the State of theſe Countries,</hi> which were projected by them, and in part promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bee undertaken, whileſt under a fair ſhew and ſpecious pretexts, they onely ſought to gain time for the accompliſhing of the foreſaid pernicious deſigns, and to bring the State of theſe Countries by that means into a notable rupture and confuſion, to the ſingular advantage of thoſe which are big with jealouſies againſt this State.</p>
                     <p>Wee have by virtue of our Commiſsion and ſpecial reſolution and autorization in that behalf from the foreſaid Lords the States General, judged and conſidered it highly neceſſarie, that the forenamed evil and pernicious deſigns, undertaken with ſo much prejudice and danger of the Common Cauſ, contrarie to the Union, ought to bee prevented and reſiſted before it ſhould bëe too late.</p>
                     <p>And thereupon (though unwillingly, as may appear by all our former peaceable offices and friendly endeavors) reſolved to prevent the foreſaid perſons in <hi>their attemts,</hi> and to take and keep ſom of the <hi>moſt principal Bell-weathers</hi> from among them in cuſtodie, leaſt they ſhould further miſlead and abuſe the other good and well-minded Members of the foreſaid Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſtfrieſland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wee were conſtreined at the ſame time, and upon the ſame grounds, to reſolv with the aſsiſtance of ſom Forces to repreſent unto the Citie of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> how that a very few perſons among them, and chief leaders and inſtigators of the foreſaid deſigns, having hindred the Audience wee ſought in the Citie-hall there in qualitie as Stadholder of the ſaid Province of <hi>Holland,</hi> for the ſervice and advancement of the publick, they ought of

neceſsitie to rid their Government of ſuch Inſtruments; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and what further was taken into conſideration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, all was amicably tranſacted and agreed on both parts.</p>
                     <p>Where it is obſervable, that the evil beeing broke out in its worſt condition, the ſame was ſo conditioned, as it would have rent and torn the whole State and Bond of thoſe Provinces, and thereby involved them into inevitable ruine, the remedies, all fair waies failing, were of neceſsitie now more ſtrictly and ſharply to bee applied and practiſed.</p>
                     <p>For even as when there happen's a dangerous fire to ariſe, wee make uſe of and employ any thing to quench the ſame, which otherwiſe would not bee thought on, as ſomtimes ſuch and ſuch particular houſes are one a ſuddain pull'd down to the ground, to ſave a whole ſtreet and thereby a whole Citie, from beeing laid all in aſhes; So wee, beeing engaged by Oath and Commiſsion to maintain the Union and Religion, and over and above that anew autoriſed by ſpecial Reſolution of the foreſaid States General, for the maintenance of the foreſaid Union<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing a Flame ariſing among the Provinces, which by progreſs and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>nuance might have laid them all into coals and aſhes, and having the means in the hand, to prevent the ſame, it might juſtly bee conceived, wee had had no regard to acquit our Commiſsion, Honor, Oath and Conſcience, nor duely reſpected or valued ſuch a ſpecial and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs autoriſation, from the higheſt Government, if wee had not with all poſsible ſpeed and fervor adventured our ſelvs againſt that riſing embrazement, and endeavored to reſiſt and damp it, in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as was don Us.</p>
                     <p>As for the particular points of the charge againſt the arreſted perſons, which do reſpectively more concern the one then the other of them, the ſame could not bee brought in above, in the general charge; but is reſerved to a proper time of proceeding therein as ſhall bee fitting.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This wrought ſo much in the mindes of the ſaid Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie of <hi>Holland;</hi> that they put both it, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which the Prince had made immediately after

                  <p>And that the ſaid Deduction beeing made readie, the ſame ſhould bee read at the Generalitie, after the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the like writing, there containing <hi>Reaſons and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> as before, preſented to their Hi.

                  <p>In the ſecond place, That the Sending or Commiſsion in <hi>June</hi> the laſt year 1650. performed by his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> with the aſſumed Lords, to all the Cities of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Frieſland,</hi> having Voice in this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie, together with all the conſequences and effects thereof ought to bee diſapproved by a poſitive Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>As contrarie to the Order and Form of the Government, infringing the Eminencie and Prerogative of this your N. gr.

That the ſame diſapproving <hi>Reſolution</hi> ought together with the aboveſaid writen <hi>Deduction</hi> and <hi>Juſtifications,</hi> to bee preſented to the Generalitie, and entred into the Regiſter there; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe tranſmitted by Miſsives unto the reſpective Provinces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deſiring each of them, that for the reaſons to bee alleged in the ſaid Miſsives and juſtifying Deduction, they would bee pleaſed to conform themſelvs to the like; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in no caſe to laie any ground for ſuch Send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings hereafter, nor ever to take upon them to decree the ſame.</p>

poſitive Reſolutions as before, the enterprize againſt the Citie of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> laſt year <hi>July</hi> 30. together with the ſeizing of the ſix Lords, Members of this Soveraign States-Aſſemblie, committed the ſame daie, and the conſequences thereof to have been an attempt upon the Freedom, Eminencie and Soveraigntie of this Province, directly contrarie to all the Laws Rights and Prorogatives of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>That moreover the Common Halls or Councils of the Cities, for which the foreſaid <hi>ſix Lords,</hi> had appeared in this Aſſemblie, there and ſo far forth as it was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed alreadie; as alſo all other common Halls or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils ſending their Deputies to the ſaid Aſſemblie, ought to bee deſired to ſend in their Declaration in writing, whether their reſpective Deputies had in the matter of Reducements, and in regard of the Deliberations happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about the State of War in the year 1649. for the with-holding of the Conſents of paying ſom forces, as was petitioned by the Council of State in the foreſaid State of War, and in the Execution thereof and things depending thereon, carried themſelvs conformable to the charge and intent of their Principals yea or no; that the ſame Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations beeing peruſed, the Aſſemblie might then proceed in regard of the <hi>ſix Members</hi> aforeſaid, by further Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, according as the condition and exigencie of the matter ſhould bee found to require.</p>

                  <p n="2">II. Whether hee knew not otherwiſe, who had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or endited the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Hee anſwered, no.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Whether hee had never ſurmiſed with himſelf, who might have penned it.</p>
                  <p>Hee ſaid, That now and then hee received writings of that nature at his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> hands, within ſom hours or a little while after, that the late Secretarie <hi>Muſh</hi> had been with his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> in private, and that thence hee took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſomtimes, to conceiv, that the ſaid Secretarie <hi>Muſh</hi> might have drawn them.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Whether all the forementioned writings had been writen by one and the ſame hand, or no.</p>
                  <p>Hee ſaid; hee conceived, That the letter writen by his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> to the Provinces and Cities, touching the matter of the foreſaid ſeizing and ſiege, and the firſt-named pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per above, was writen by one and the ſame hand; but that hee was not able to ſaie, whether the other paper intituled, <hi>Reaſons and Motives</hi> &amp;c. was writen by the ſame, or no.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Beeing demanded a ſecond time, whether hee could ſaie nothing of the hand, whereby both the papers, mentioned in the firſt Article, were writen;</p>
                  <p>Hee ſaid, hee thought, that one of the Clarks of his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Secretarie, by name <hi>N. Hulſt,</hi> had told him, whileſt the ſame writings were copying, that it was the hand of <hi>Cunes,</hi> chief Clark of the foreſaid Secretarie <hi>Muſch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Whether hee knew the hand of the ſaid Secretarie,
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:99708:266"/>
and whether hee could not ſaie for certain, that the foreſaid writing was writen by the Secretarie himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Hee ſaid, hee knew well enough, that it was not the hand of the ſaid Secretarie himſelf, and that the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings withal were written fair without any blots.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Why Hee, examined, beeing ſummoned by their N. gr. M. went home firſt.</p>
                  <p>Hee ſaid, it was to tell his wife, that hee was ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and withal to make water.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Whether hee had ſpoken with no bodie elſ concerning this, before hee made his appearance in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie of their N. gr. M.</p>
                  <p>Hee anſwered, No: but onely that coming along, hee had ſpoken with his brother in Law Burgomaſter <hi>van der Mayden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This examined beeing withdrawn, and after that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Hulſt</hi> was likewiſe heard and had declared as wil bee ſhew'd preſently, call'd in again, hee was asked, whether hee knew not the hand of <hi>Cunes,</hi> and whether when <hi>van der Hulſt</hi> aforeſaid had formerly told him, that it was <hi>Cunes</hi> his hand, hee could obſerv by the writing it ſelf, whether it was his hand indeed.</p>
                  <p>Hee ſaid, that when the Clark <hi>van der Hulſt</hi> put him in minde, that the ſame was <hi>Cunes</hi> his hand, hee could obſerv well enough, and knew it now, that it was ſo indeed, both by reaſon that hee knew <hi>Cunes</hi> his hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and that having ſince ſeen more of his writing, hee obſerved it more particularly.</p>

N. Gr. M. Aſſemblie, and to laie ſiege to the Citie of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Hee ſaid, hee could not tell.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Demanded further, and preſſed, whether himſelf told not <hi>Heylerſich</hi> then, that it was the hand of <hi>Cunes,</hi> Clark to the late Secretarie <hi>Muſch?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hee ſaid, that now indeed hee did remember, and that indeed it was <hi>Cunes</hi> his hand.</p>

                  <p>Hee ſaid, yea; and that hee had ſeen his writings often.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Whether hee had no diſcourſ with the ſaid <hi>Cunes</hi> about the ſaid Writings?</p>
                  <p>Hee ſaid, yea; and that <hi>Cunes</hi> had told him, it was Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie <hi>Muſch</hi> that indited the ſame, but had charged him <hi>(Cunes)</hi> very earneſtly to keep it ſecret.</p>

That next daie they ſtai'd there, and after dinner, put themſelvs in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to attend the Troops, till about five of the clock, hee Examinat having notice of the Troops beeing arrived without the Village, hee forthwith joined and marched along with them from place to place, before expreſſed, till they came to the Heath without <hi>Hilverſum,</hi> where by a <hi>ſtorm or ſudden tempeſt</hi> the Troops were much incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, which cauſed ſom halt in the Village, till they were all met again, refreſhing themſelvs withal a little; and, that, in marching thence, the thunder and tempeſt more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, one part took the right waie, and ten companies an other, which was not perceived till the former were com to <hi>Vreelant.</hi> That notwithſtanding this, hee Examinat, marched on with the Troops about him to <hi>Abconde,</hi> where as hee could gueſs, hee arrived half an hour paſt four in the morning, and met <hi>Count William</hi> with two or three Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, asking ſtraight, whether all the Troops were arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and perceiving that ſom remained behinde, hee ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf ill-ſatisfied, ſaying, hee had cauſ now to ſcruple, whether, in regard of this neglect, hee might go on with his Commiſsion or not; however hee would not do it of his own head, but adviſe firſt with the reſt of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers about it; That, after deliberation had, the Officers beeing heard, and ſufficiently agreed about advancing the march, Hee Examinat ſtept in between and adviſed, That it ought not to bee attempted, it beeing expreſsly againſt the intention of his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, who would not have the buſineſs undertaken but with a great number to prevent diſorder, and leaſt the Inhabitants and Souldiers of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> might bee encouraged by ſo ſmall an appearance of

                  <p>Now as touching his having plai'd the <hi>Spie</hi> upon the Citie of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> hee repreſented the occaſion, the time and the cauſ of his journie to <hi>Sharp-Zeel</hi> by <hi>Amſterdam:</hi> beeing gon from the <hi>Haghe</hi> upon Wedneſdaie in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, about one a clock on horſ-back, attended but with a Chamber-groom, and overtaken about <hi>Koudekerck</hi> by the Marquis <hi>de la Vieuville,</hi> who preſently told him, hee had order from his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> to overtake him, and to make report of the March which hee was to make with the Cavallerie.

                              <p>And although on the one ſide, wee might eaſily cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate, that his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> was drawn both to the one and other, by ſom Conſiderations of his <hi>perſonal repute;</hi> Yet
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:99708:289"/>
wee on the other ſide took into our Conſideration; firſt, that the <hi>States Securitie</hi> conſiſtech eſpecially, that the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dierie perform their duties, not onely for the receipt of their <hi>wages,</hi> but alſo out of <hi>love, affection</hi> and <hi>natural proneſs</hi> to the State it ſelf, which without all queſtion, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies more to bee exſpected from the <hi>Natives</hi> then the <hi>Forreiners;</hi> beſides that it could not bee taken but for a ſingular <hi>ingratitude</hi> and <hi>unnaturalneſs</hi> of the Governors, That the ſame paſsing by their Inhabitants, and as it were, their own <hi>native and legitimate children,</hi> ſhould prefer the <hi>Forreiners,</hi> as <hi>adopted</hi> ones before them, a thing never pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed yet by any Kings, Princes or States, in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandings to this da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And then ſecondly, that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid propoſals of reduction, however as manie or more forces then by our waie, were thereby to bee ſubſtracted from the States Service, yet there appeared no proportion at all therein with ours, for the eaſing and ſublevating our overburthened Treaſurie; when you obſerv that the ſaid Reduction toucheth not the Captains and Officers, but onely the private Souldiers, whereas that which one Captain alone is wont to receiv by the State, would finde and entertain a good number of common Souldiers. And foraſmuch as both ſides propoſals beeing counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballanced, it is apparant, that as well the ſecuritie of the State on the one hand, as the disburdening of the feeble Treaſurie on the other, is much better to bee obtained by our waie of Caſheiring, then by the effect of that of his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi>; wee therefore held it beſt ſeriouſly to remonſtrate all this to his ſaid High<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, and cauſed our Deputies to perform the ſame with many pregnant reaſons, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by a moſt exact <hi>Ballance</hi> of our <hi>Treaſurie,</hi> exhibited unto him, whereby wee ſhewed, That according to our waie, the Rate of this Province would yearly bee eaſed more, then by his waie, by <hi>two hundred eighteen thouſand, nine hundred and fourtie Gilders,</hi> 14 <hi>Stivers,</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.

buſineſs and recommend it to the reſt of the Provinces, that the Caſhiering propounded by Us, may bee expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and accompliſhed with all ſpeed.</p>
                              <p>At laſt, after many ſerious inſtances applied to this end in vain, wee found our ſelvs neceſsitated to make known unto the <hi>Generalitie,</hi> that by reaſon of the <hi>weakneſs of our Treaſurie,</hi> wee were <hi>not able</hi> to grant or bear that which the Council of State deſired of us, and by the above-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med project of the ſtate of War, was aſsigned and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon upon us, and that conſequently wee were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely enforced in part to excuſe our ſelvs of that deſire, declaring, that as to the continuing and paying of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>mentioned 105 Foot-companies, and 32 of Horſ, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with other particulars expreſſed in the above-cited Advice of our Commiſsion'd Council, wee could grant <hi>no Conſent.</hi>

                              <p>And howbeit that by virtue of the <hi>Freedom,</hi> which the reſpective Provinces ever had in matters of charging them, even under the Dominion of their <hi>Dukes, Earls and Lords</hi> themſelvs in the ſtricteſt ſence, wee were not bound to give any particular reaſons thereof, or to uſe any perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive means, but might, by the vigor of the ſaid Freedom, ſufficiently have acquitted our ſelvs with a <hi>ſimple notifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diſcontinuing our Conſent:</hi> yet for to ſatisfie all, wee forbore not to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſcover and laie before the Deputies of the States of other Provinces our Confederates, at the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, the whole State of our Treaſurie, and to deduce there all the pregnant motives of the foreſaid Diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at large and ſeveral times, with ſolid demonſtration, That a leſs number of forces effectively would bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in ſervice then wee had declared our Conſent for, if ſo bee that the State will entertain more then they are able to paie. Nothing doubting but all this might and would have wrought a fair correſpondence of the ſaid Deputies with us, and cauſed theirs by a faithful report of our foreſaid Reaſons and Motives, eſpecially of our
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:99708:290"/>
great neceſsitie unto their Principals, eaſily to diſpoſe the ſame, That the foreſaid diſ-banding of forces and leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of charges, might, according to the antient order and old waie, have ſpeedily been ſet a work and effected. Nevertheleſs wee not onely ſaw our ſelvs diſappointed of any ſuch effects, but on the contrarie, found to our great grief, that the paiment of thoſe charges which wee had conſented to as before, began to bee required at our hands; inſomuch that at laſt wee were conſtreined to declare unto the Generalitie, as alſo in <hi>Januarie</hi> 1650 wee had formally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that the Treaſurie of this Province was not able any longer to bear the heavie charges impoſed upon them du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Wars, now the Peace had already continued ſo long. And whereas every Province hath libertie each year <hi>to conſent or not to conſent</hi> to the Petition addreſt unto them by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State; and likewiſe to accept of, or to excuſe the charges therin propoſed, according to every one's conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and condition: and that the ſaid ſtate of War was knownly nothing elſ, but a Petition of the Council of State, and ſo was tranſcribed and ſent to the reſpective Provinces. That wee finding the charges therein men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to bee inſufferable for us, had found good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make difficultie, and to yield no further then our Provincial Advice formerly return'd, and often renewed there did import, and that conſequently wee were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in caſe the other Provinces could not bee diſpoſed to the like, to proceed to the execution of the ſaid Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Advice, according to the contents thereof, within our ſelvs; it beeing ſure that the before-mentioned <hi>Freedom of conſenting</hi> cannot poſsibly conſiſt in a bare and emtie <hi>ſound of words,</hi> but in ſuch effectual <hi>realities,</hi> whereby one may hold himſelf free from paying ſuch charges, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation whereof hee hath expreſsly declared hee cannot conſent. But then the <hi>Deputies</hi> putting us in ſom hope they would ſpeedily bring in their <hi>Provincial Advices</hi> upon our foreſaid propoſals of ſaving charges; wee again, for

And whereas thereby wee ſhould nothing near have been able to ſave the Moitie of that whereunto wee had forborn our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; wee again moſt ſeriouſly repreſented to his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> the real Conſiderations whereupon our former Provincial Advice was grounded, with earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to approve, and yet to recommend and ſecond the ſame in dealing with the other Provinces; which beeing denied by his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, and the Deputies of the Provinces inſiſting and preſsing, that the ſame Forces, for whoſe continuance wee had not conſented, ſhould bee entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and paid by us, for the moſt part beyond our abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; <hi>Wee thereupon,</hi> according to the <hi>Right</hi> belonging to us, andin conformitie of our above-mentioned <hi>Declaration</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented

burſt out into Extremities; to avoid all confuſions which threatned us, paſsing by all former projects, and that of the Deputies of the Citie of <hi>Leyden</hi> alſo in particular; wee determined to <hi>conform</hi> our ſelvs <hi>proviſionally</hi> with the advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſix other Provinces, and thus <hi>(Note)</hi> to agree with all that which their Deputies, at ſeveral times, and eſpecially <hi>April</hi> 2 1650, had deſired of Us in our full Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie, <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> by the Lord <hi>Bronckhorſt,</hi> to wit,</p>

                              <p>Nevertheleſs, after reiterated inſtances thereupon made at the Generalitie <hi>Maie</hi> 28, and 29, reſpectively, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Proviſional Execution of the Provincial Advices of all the Provinces could not bee obteined by Us; the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſaid Provinces urging us, wholly and once for all, to renounce all further purſuing or ſeeking of Disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Reduction and other deſigned points of ſaving char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and declaring therewithal, <hi>that in caſe of failing, they ſhould not give waie</hi> to our beeing disburdened ſo far yet, as the reſpective Provinces had unanimouſly conſented to, by Reſolutions of their own State-Aſſemblies for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs; whereby wee perceiving through their non-accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the foreſaid moſt reaſonable offer of ours, that all hope of accommodation was taken away, and wee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſsitated at length once, after ſo much and long patience, to take a <hi>final courſ</hi> for the diſcontinuance of paying the Militia, for whoſe further entertainment Wee had not given our Conſent; and to reſolv upon it, as alſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly wee did on the 1 of <hi>June</hi> next enſuing thereupon;

Nor by any <hi>Members</hi> of our own Aſſemblie, for that by waie of accommodation, wee had conformed our ſelvs to the project or opinion of ſom <hi>few,</hi> which alwaies had ſhewed themſelvs moſt <hi>difficult</hi> in the foreſaid buſineſs: and there beeing great Neceſsitie, our ſaid Reſolution ſhould bee made known to the Militia or the Officers thereof, leaſt continuing in ſervice, and afterwards miſsing their paie, there might bee cauſed mutinie or confuſion thereby; therefore wee found good to give timely advertiſement thereof, where and ſo as the ſame was requiſite; communicating nevertheleſs again with his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> about it, and deſiring to underſtand his intention, to what ſort of Officers the foreſaid advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might beſt bee directed. And finding, that his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> excuſed himſelf, wee proceeded therein with that circumſpection, and without conſideration of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, That wee cauſed Writs to bee made to XXXI Captains, beeing our proportion in the 55 Companies, all <hi>Forreiners,</hi> and laſt or newlieſt entertained in the Lands ſervice, together with 12 Ritmaſters, likewiſe our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion

<pb n="542" facs="tcp:99708:294"/>
might bee waved and deferr'd, at leaſtwiſe but for a little time yet; offering therewithal to that end, to call our Aſſemblie together again, as ſoon as poſsibly could bee don, that the matters which ſeemed to bee intended for to bee propounded to the particular Cities and Members of this Province, might bee repreſented to them; yet all this wrought nothing of that, which our Commiſsioned Council and Deputies at the Generalitie had hoped for: his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> notwithſtanding any thing that was or could bee alleged, departing from the <hi>Haghe</hi> with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned aſſumed Lords, to execute their pretended Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, which accordingly was performed; though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the foreſaid remonſtrance made at the <hi>Haghe,</hi> divers very ſerious and earneſt endeavors were likewiſe applied in their journey, by ſeveral Members of our Province, and eſpecially by thoſe of <hi>Dort, Haerlem, Delft</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam;</hi> eſſaying by all manner of reaſons, to divert his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> from the further proſecution of that deſign and to diſpoſe him, that hee would bee pleaſed to return to the <hi>Haghe,</hi> where the buſineſs might bee tranſacted in an orderly waie.

by reaſon thereof, the whole affair ſeemed now to bee brought to ſuch tearms, that there might have ſucceeded a ſpeedie unanimous Concluſion by all the Provinces, with good content to his <hi>High<hi rend="sup">s</hi>.</hi>

                              <p>And thus having ſet down here the very Truth of the moſt material paſſages between the Deputies of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, his Highneſs and Our Selvs, touching the Saving of the Publick Charges, and leſſening of the Militia, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the years 1649 and 1650, Wee are very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it will moſt clearly appear thence, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world don by Us in the whole carriage of this affair, but what according to the conſtitution of our <hi>Treaſurie</hi> wee were bound, and according to the <hi>Freedom and Right</hi> belonging to all and every one of the United Provinces, wee were warranted to do; nay, that for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation's ſake wee ſtill have yielded more and more, and from time to time made offer of taking and continuing ſuch charges upon us, as moſt evidently in proceſs of time, and without relief, would have ruined Us and our good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple together, putting all our hopes in Almightie God, and from Him alone exſpecting a good iſſue at length in the

                              <p>Now that nevertheleſs wee may a little more cloſely and particularly defend the foreſaid buſineſs, or the points thereof, which are ſo <hi>odiouſly</hi> repreſented and traduced in the foreſaid <hi>Paper</hi> of his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, entituled, <hi>Reaſon and Motives,</hi> &amp;c. and withal refute as well the contents of the ſaid <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> as alſo diverſ other <hi>Arguments</hi> upon ſeveral occaſions made uſe of to our prejudice and diſadvantage,</p>

words, both of the foreſaid General Reſolution, and our own Acts of Conſenting, wee cannot judg our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid firſt point ſhould need any further confirmation.</p>
                              <p>Although <hi>ex abundanti</hi> it might bee ſhewed here, not onely that their Hi. Mi. in general have by ſeveral Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives, and particularly that of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 8, 1648, and <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temb.</hi> 27, 1649 reſpectively, deſired of us, that wee would yield our Conſents to the foreſaid <hi>ſtate of War;</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that all the Provinces in particular have, in their reſpective Provincial Advices upon the ſaid projected <hi>ſtate of War,</hi> not onely acknowledged the ſaid <hi>libertie of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting,</hi> but likewiſe themſelvs plainly made uſe thereof in ſeveral particulars for their own advantage; for proof whereof wee ſhall content our ſelvs to produce here one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the words of the Province of <hi>Zealand,</hi> who in their advice returned upon the foreſaid <hi>ſtate of War</hi> having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that in the general <hi>Propoſition</hi> or <hi>Petition</hi> they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have their <hi>Quote</hi> to bee leſſened or ſubſtracted from the whole maſs or bodie of the State aforeſaid, they clauſ it with theſe following formal words, <hi>declaring, That otherwiſe wee will not bee bound to conſent to any further charges or Petition.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Whence indeed wee took occaſion to believ, as alſo wee are ſtill perſuaded, that the foreſaid affair was agitated and advanced at the Generalitie, not according to the intention, or by the joint acting of the Provinces themſelvs, whom wee perceiv to have been of one minde with us concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the main, but onely by ſom few Deputies, ſeeking to currie grace and favor from his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, or otherwiſe byaſſed by particular aims and intereſts of their own.</p>
                              <p>Now concerning the <hi>Second</hi> point propounded above, namely the Sending, <hi>Julie</hi> 5. 1650, decreed and forthwith expedited to all the Cities and Members of our Aſſemblie, wee have therein obſerved a twofold unlawfulneſs and unbefitttingneſs; the one in regard of the partie giving the Commiſsion, or decreeing that Deputation; and the
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:99708:299"/>
other, in reſpect of the matter it ſelf, or the aim and drift wherefore the ſame was undertaken.</p>
                              <p>As for the givers of the Commiſsion, The truth is and may appear, by the Notals of the Lords preſent, in the Regiſter-book of their Hi. Mi. that they were men in ſuch a ſcantling Number, that <hi>three</hi> whole <hi>Provinces</hi> were repreſented there but <hi>(Note)</hi> by <hi>four perſons;</hi> ſo that wee could not ſufficiently admire, how ſo ſmall a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Deputies ſhould dare to undertake the foreſaid general autoriſation, a matter of ſo great weight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, together with the foreſaid never well ſucceeded Commiſsion and Sending; without firſt (as in ſuch matters of importance the uſual cuſtom is) beeing war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted and ordered thereunto by their Principals, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving underſtood their minds and intentions in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half; proceeding to grant and decree the ſame onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Votes of five Provinces, ſo ſlenderly repreſented as ſaid is, againſt the ſtanding out of the Deputies of the Province of <hi>Gelderland,</hi> and the proteſtation of Ours.</p>
                              <p>Beſides this, that wee are verily perſwaded, there were divers yet among <hi>thoſe few ones,</hi> of a contrarie opinion and meerly over-voiced by their fellow Deputies, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſom, which by reaſon of the preſence and autoritie of his <hi>High<hi rend="sup">s</hi>
                                 </hi> durſt not oppoſe.</p>
                              <p>Inſomuch that even thereby, <hi>firſt</hi> it may eaſily bee judged, what is to bee held of the lawfulneſs of the foreſaid Concluſions taken at the Generalitie <hi>Jan.</hi> 5 and 6, aforeſaid.</p>
                              <p>And <hi>ſecondly</hi> it is conſiderable alſo, in regard of theſe givers of the Commiſsion, that though the foreſaid Send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had been approved of, and concluded on by the Lords the States General, or the Deputies of the Provinces, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly inſtructed and autoriſed thereunto, with unanimous conſent of ſix conſonant advices (in regard our own Deputies could not join with them) nevertheleſs it had
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:99708:300"/>
been clearly ſhewed, and will bee further very clearly and evidently deduced, that their <hi>Hi. Mi.</hi> are in no part warranted nor qualified to do it.</p>
                              <p>Beeing, that all Sendings, decreed or to decree, unto the Provinces, ought according to the fundamental Order of the Government to bee addreſſed unto the <hi>States-Aſſemblie,</hi> and not to the Cities or particular Members thereof.</p>
                              <p>Which likewiſe was alwaies obſerved in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and particularly alſo by the Lord Stadtholder Count <hi>William Lodovick</hi> of happie memorie, and Deputie for the Province of <hi>Frieſland</hi> in the year 1587. who underſtood and declared it thus, in regard of the Letters and Send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by or in the behalf of the E. of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> then Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and Captain General of theſe United Provinces, addreſt to the States of <hi>Oſtergo, Weſtergo</hi> and <hi>Sevenwolden,</hi> each apart, beſides the eight fenced Cities of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; <hi>That the ſame Act was an extraordinarie-waie of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, which could tend to nothing elſ, but to the making of Separations and Diviſions, and conſequently Diſſentions and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the Countries there, which to that time was never pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed or uſed before, by any Governors, Magiſtrates, no not the forrein Lords and Potentates themſelvs.</hi> And that the matter rightly conſidered, it is indeed the States-Aſſemblie of every one of the United Provinces, or the Members and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Cities thereof jointly, to whom the Eminence, Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie and chief Government of the Provinces reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belongeth; to whom alſo in that regard, all ſuch muſt addreſs themſelvs, as have any thing to propound concerning the publick affairs of the common ſtate of the Land, or relating to the chief Government; ſo that no ſuch addreſs can bee made to the particular members or Cities, without derogating the ſaid Eminencie, Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Prerogative Provincial. As indeed even his late High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> himſelf and the <hi>fellow Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners</hi> not obſcurely acknowledged in their Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:99708:300"/>
made to ſom of our Cities, that they meant it not otherwiſe, ſaying in the end of their ſaid Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</p>
                              <p>That they intended or meant not thereby to prejudice the Eminencie, Prerogative, Rights and Privileges of the Countrie of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Frieſland,</hi> the Members or Cities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; <hi>by words thus ſeeking to ſalv up, or in ſom ſort to qualifie that, wherein,</hi> reipſâ, <hi>they had ſo palpably tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Wherefore alſo ſuch a Sending ought not to have been undertaken at all, eſpecially by ſuch, which are engaged by Oath, to maintain, ſupport and ſtrengthen, yea defend and protect each others Freedoms, Rights and Privileges, by all convenient and poſsible means, and even with bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and goods too, if need were, againſt all and every one, whatſoever that ſhould attempt any actual encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or enterpriſe therein upon them, which is that, the United Provinces are obliged to perform the one to the other reciprocally, by virtue of the <hi>firſt Article</hi> of the ſworn Covenant and <hi>Union</hi> at <hi>Utrecht</hi> in the year 1579.</p>
                              <p>It beeing likewiſe worth ſpecial conſideration, that the ſaid <hi>Union</hi> is not a Covenant or Compact, between any <hi>Provinces</hi> on the one ſide, and every <hi>particular Member</hi> or <hi>Citie</hi> of every Province beeing in that Covenant, on the other ſide, but onely between <hi>Provinces</hi> and <hi>Provinces</hi> in general.</p>
                              <p>So, that as on the one ſide the Generalitie may not make their addreſs to any Members or Cities in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, in like manner on the other ſide the particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or Cities may not without offence to the <hi>Eminencie</hi> and <hi>Soveraigntie</hi> of the States of their Province, admit of any ſuch Sending unto them, <hi>they beeing not themſelvs the Confederates,</hi> but to content themſelvs that they are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Province which is confederated with the other Provinces. Beſides that it was in freſh memorie yet,
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:99708:301"/>
That in the year 1639. the like Sending having been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by the Generalitie to the Burgomaſter and 36. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Citie of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> when their Hi. M. Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were ſhewed there very pregnant reaſons, why ſuch a kinde of Sending could not bee admitted by them, theſe ſaid Deputies departed and returned back again, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having had any Audience with the ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>
                              <p>As otherwiſe alſo ſuch a kinde of Sending from the Generalitie to a particular a Member of any Province, is <hi>without Example:</hi> beſides that it is a thing unheard of that their High Mi. ſhould ever have addreſt, any Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives, or Letters, Acts or Ordinances, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, directly to any ſuch <hi>particular Member.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Foraſmuch as all ſuch things muſt bee directed ſtill to the <hi>States of the Provinces,</hi> and in their abſence to their <hi>Commiſsioned Council</hi> or other <hi>autoriſed parties,</hi> relating to the ſaid <hi>States;</hi> with deſire, if need bee, that the ſame may thence bee ſent to the particular Members or Cities; the <hi>Generalitie having no power,</hi> in caſe the ſaid States or thoſe autoriſed by them, ſhould forbear to ſend thoſe diſpatches to the places directed unto, <hi>themſelvs to ſend</hi> the ſame, or others in their ſtead, directly to <hi>any</hi> ſuch <hi>particular Members</hi> or <hi>Cities</hi> of the <hi>Provinces;</hi> as indeed not long before the decreeing of this laſt Deputation, a very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table example happened, conſiſting therein, That there was a certain Miſsive or Letter made readie by their Hi. Mi. <hi>April</hi> 16. 1650. and decreed on the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> enſuing, by the Generalitie, which beeing ſent thus to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioned Council, with deſire, that the ſame Miſsive might by Copies bee tranſmitted to the reſpective Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our Province; although our ſaid Commiſsioned Council, having upon good and weightie grounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, to delaie it, till ſuch time, as wee ſhould meet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in a States-Aſſemblie, and thereupon were deſired the ſecond time by thhir Hi. Mi. for to ſend that Miſsive
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:99708:301"/>
as was deſired, yet they would not take it upon them, as finding the ſame to bee contrarie to the Order of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and derogatorie to the Eminence, Autoritie and Prerogative of our States-Aſſemblie.</p>
                              <p>By reaſon whereof wee could not ſufficiently <hi>wonder</hi> at, That the ſame Aſſemblie, which but in <hi>April</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had actually acknowledged their beeing uncapable of addreſsing themſelvs by their Miſsive directly to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Members of our Province, ſhould in <hi>June</hi> next following forget themſelvs ſo much, as not onely by <hi>Miſsives,</hi> but by a formal <hi>ſolemn Sending</hi> of ſo great Lords and Commiſsioners, to addreſs themſelvs unto the ſame Members and particular Cities of our ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>
                              <p>Which addreſs notwithſtanding was ſo much the leſs to bee born with then the former, as the luſtre and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie of a <hi>Statdtholder</hi> of ſix Provinces, ſtrengthened by ſuch conſiderable <hi>fellow-Commiſsioners,</hi> beſides the awe and power of a <hi>Captain General</hi> of the United Netherlands, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a train of about 400 <hi>militarie perſons,</hi> could not but much more perplex and intimidate the reſpective Governors and Magiſtrates, and conſequently alſo, more prejudice and preoccupie their free Deliberations, then a few dumb lines could have don.</p>
                              <p>And as for the <hi>unlawfulneſs</hi> and <hi>unbefittingneſs</hi> which wee obſerved in the foreſaid Sending in reſpect of the <hi>matter</hi> it ſelf, or the <hi>Subject,</hi> drift and aim thereof, the ſame conſiſt's therein, That the foreſaid Sending was undertaken, not for to diſpoſe the Members and Cities of our Province to the taking of a Reſolution, which might bee judged ſerviceable and advantagious for the State of the Land, but on the contrarie to overthrow ſuch a <hi>Reſolution,</hi> already taken, after ſo manifold Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and reports, as may eaſily bee ſeen by what hath been ſhewed before, and which was taken upon full knowledge of the matter, with all ripeneſs and maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:99708:302"/>
and to the taking whereof <hi>Neceſsities</hi> unavoidablneſs had preſs'd and conſtrained Us.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Which cauſed us to bee ſo much the more aſtoniſhed after, when in the foreſaid Sending wee underſtood, and afterwards by the reading of the foreſaid paper entituled,</hi> Reaſons and Motives &amp;c. <hi>wee heard, That the matter was propounded ſo, as if the Deputies of the Cities, at the States-Aſſemblie, had abuſed, and abuſively informed their reſpective Commons, and gon beyond the orders and good intentions of their Principals, whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, it hath plainly appeared to us, by expreſs Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the ſaid Commons, both at the time of the ſaid Sending and during the troubles enſued, and ſince that, diſcharging their ſaid Deputies reſpectively of all imputations;</hi> That the ſaid Deputies have with all ſinceritie and faithfulneſs followed and executed that which was given them in charge by their reſpective Principals, and eſpecially, about the point of ſaving the publick Charge, and in regard of the Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations upon the projected State of War for the year <hi>1649.</hi> as alſo the with-holding of the Conſents for the paiment of a part of the Militia, petitioned for in the ſaid State of War, together with the execution of the Reſolution taken by Us in that behalf, with other matters depending thereon, carried themſelvs anſwerably to the charge and intention of their reſpective Commons, their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals, and ſerved and ſupplied the ſame from time to time, with exact, faithful and true reports of the advices and conſiderations, as well of the reſt of the Members in our Aſſemblie, as of the Deputies of the Provinces at the Generalitie, <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>contra,</hi> opened and mooved there, and in a word don all, to the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons their full intention, good content and abſolute ſatisfaction; without having ever ſhewed themſelvs to bee acted or inſtigated by paſsion or ill-affectedneſs, but on the contrarie alwaies directed the buſineſſes uprightly, ſincerely and unpaſsionately, and indeed as much as in them laie, by all fit means endeavored to tranſact and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all to the further ſecuritie of our dear-bought Freedom, together with the welfare of our dear Fatherland, and the common good of the State.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="559" facs="tcp:99708:302"/>
By all which well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>grounded Deductions wee perſwade our ſelvs to have fully and abundantly juſtified the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings inſiſted by Us in the years 1649. and 1650. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſaving of the publick Charge and leſſening of the Militia, and therewithal ſufficiently ſhewed that the above-mentioned Sending was unlawfully decreed, and contrarie to the order and form of Government, to the prejudice and derogation of our Eminencie, Rights and Prerogative, nothing doubting, but that every one will bee eaſily able to diſcern thereby, the groundleſſneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencie of the Arguments, which by the aboveſaid Commiſsioners in their <hi>Propoſition,</hi> and by his High<hi rend="sup">•</hi> in the foreſaid <hi>Paper</hi> and elſwhere were made uſe of; theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of theirs tending to evince, that on the one hand it ſhould not have been in our power to demur or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue the paiment of the foreſaid Militia in manner as you heard before; and on the other, That the ſafetie of the State ſhould not have been duely provided for, in caſe our deſign of leſſening the Militia had taken effect; for which end they labored hard to prove and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their project, as well by perſwaſive reaſoning, as alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of former Examples.</p>
                              <p>Their <hi>Reaſons</hi> uſed in that behalf conſiſting mainly therein, That by the joint Confederates, the <hi>Chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> taking on and diſcharging or reducing of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, ſhould have been committed to his <hi>High<hi rend="sup">s</hi>
                                 </hi> and the <hi>Council of State,</hi> and that of them alone ſhould have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended both the <hi>ſwearing of the Militia</hi> and the diſengaging of the ſame again, and that by reaſon thereof, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Diſcontinuance</hi> of <hi>paiment,</hi> ſhould have been a <hi>breach of the Union;</hi> and the alleged <hi>Examples</hi> endeavoring to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that wee <hi>our ſelvs</hi> at other times had underſtood it thus, yea maintained and helped to reſolv upon it, againſt others of our Confederates.</p>
                              <p>So much indeed beeing true enough that thoſe of the Council of State, as <hi>Executors</hi> of the Reſolutions of the
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:99708:303"/>
Common Union, <hi>after</hi> that all the Confederates have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animouſly declared their <hi>Conſents</hi> of taking on or levying forces, they are enabled to make the ſaid Levie and to engage the forces by <hi>Oath</hi> unto the State, <hi>according to the Conſents</hi> paſt.</p>
                              <p>And ſo likewiſe, That the <hi>Officers</hi> taken on in that ſort, have, for matter of militarie <hi>exploits</hi> for the ſervice and conſervation of the State, ſtood obliged to <hi>obey the Council of State,</hi> and his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> as appointed <hi>Captain General</hi> over them; But the ſame were <hi>never</hi> qualified, nor had ever the power committed to them to <hi>levie forces without the Conſent</hi> of the Provinces, or after the expiration of that time, wherewith the Conſents were limited, to continue the ſaid forces in ſervice ſtill, much leſs under pretext of the Oath taken from them in the Name of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Union, to force obedience from them againſt the difficulties made by the Members of the ſaid Union, to continue them in ſervice beyond ſuch a time.</p>
                              <p>It beeing likewiſe evident by the manifeſt deduction above, that wee are charged with <hi>careleſſneſs</hi> for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the State without any ground in the world, whiles indeed on the contrarie all our aim and drift hath tended to the <hi>Reputation, Honor</hi> and <hi>Safetie</hi> of the State, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> conſiſting therein, that by a wiſe and provident managing of things care bee had to ſtrengthen that in time of <hi>Peace,</hi> which by the exorbitancie of <hi>war</hi> is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and the <hi>Honor</hi> that thereby may bee recovered, the ornament of a well-furniſhed and well-ordered <hi>Treaſurie;</hi> and the <hi>Safetie</hi> it ſelf therein, that by means of readie paiment a <hi>well-diſciplined Militia</hi> may bee entertained under complete Companies; in lieu, that the neglect of ſuch a Management would cauſ a ſlighting of the Government among friends, a further decaie of the Treaſurie, low e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough already, and among the enemies much rejoicing from an aſſured hope, that by our own regardleſneſs wee ſhall ſhortly bring that to paſs our ſelvs, which all the
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:99708:303"/>
power from without for ſo many years together, through God Almightie's bleſsing, was never able to effect: which as on the one ſide it could never bee anſwered to poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſo on the other ſide it would prove an high ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to God himſelf, having not onely protected, but likewiſe enlarged and amplified this State in all the brunt and length of our Wars; that ſo glorious a building, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtood out all the attemts of their powerful Enemies, ſhould com to decaie and ruin through the heedleſneſs of friends, and thoſe to whom the care thereof is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. As likewiſe the entertaining of Forces or other char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, more or beyond that the Revenues can defraie, muſt needs and unavoidably cauſ a decaie in the Treaſurie, and that decaie, moſt ſlow and doubtful paiments; whence nothing elſ can bee exſpected, but a deſerting and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing in the Militia, and that which is worſ yet, thoughts and purpoſes in them of diſobedience and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affectedneſs, and conſequently an aſſured diſorder and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous confuſion in the State.

Beſides that the foreſaid objection of <hi>careleſſneſs</hi> and too great a diminiſhing of the Militia is made on the <hi>one ſide</hi> by him, whoſe own project in <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1649, as was ſhewed above more at large, had yielded to a greater diminiſhing of the Militia then ours, and the disbanding of more Souldiers; and <hi>on the other,</hi> by thoſe that refuſed our deſire of executing proviſionally the very thing, which formerly by advice in Writing they had aſſented to, and by an expreſs Deputie ſpecially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired at our hands, that it might bee don.</p>
                              <p>There beeing no <hi>Examples</hi> in the world to bee produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that ever wee ſhould have underſtood thoſe matters otherwiſe againſt our Confederates; thoſe <hi>Reſolutions</hi> which were alleged to the contrarie, in as much as there was found good and approved by us, relating to matters of a

quite different nature, and particularly that ſom provinces had either don contrarie to their declared Conſents, and ſo againſt the tie and obligation thereby undergon; or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preceding communicaaion with the Confederates of their diſcontinuing, gon about to eaſ themſelvs by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and under-hand Reduction of forces, or ſom other courſ of ſaving their charges.

                              <p>Wee cannot paſs by to ſhew here in particular from the Regiſters of the Generalitie, that as to the <hi>ſtate of War,</hi> for the foreſaid year 1623, preſented by the <hi>Council of State,</hi> together with their general <hi>Petition</hi> to their Hi. Mi. <hi>Octob.</hi> 20 1622, the <hi>conſents</hi> of <hi>all the Provinces, Frieſland</hi> onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, were already returned to and declared at the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie before the date of the foreſaid 1 of <hi>Novemb.</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently before the taking of the foreſaid Reſolution; and particularly that <hi>Gelderland, Holland, Zealand</hi> and <hi>Utrecht</hi> had don it together <hi>June</hi> 20, and <hi>Over-Yſſell,</hi> together with <hi>Groninghen</hi> and the <hi>Omlands,</hi> on the laſt of <hi>Julie;</hi> and <hi>June</hi> 21 all reſpectively of the year 1623 aforeſaid.

<pb n="563" facs="tcp:99708:304"/>
bee judged to have been contrarie to the Union, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſecuritie of the State ſhould have been diminiſhed, againſt the expreſs conſents, and without the knowledg of the Common Bodie of the Union; but whenas any Provinces ſhall have made known their diſabilitie of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the charges aſsigned them by the Council of State unto the Confederates, and then made difficultie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent again to the further entertaining of ſuch charges which they are not able to bear, and ſo put off or with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>held the paying thereof; Then it is far from it that ever wee ſhould have mainteined in ſuch a caſe this to have been againſt the Union, that <hi>on the contrarie,</hi> wee not onely have allowed of ſuch a diſcontinuance or forbearance, but likewiſe (if the Land's neceſsitie required it) helped to ſupport the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> excuſed burthens with our own ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                              <p>It appearing by diſtinct Reſolutions of their Hi.

In regard whereof it may bee obſerved, that in all worldly or humane affairs, there is a time of <hi>meeting,</hi> and a time of <hi>parting</hi> again. There never meet's ſo loving and ſweet a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, but at length it is determined by parting again.</p>
                              <p>This beeing the condition of all aſſembling (according to the ever variable condition of mankinde here below:) there can bee no better courſ taken (in our judgment) at meetings, then to conſider of, and endeavor for a fair parting, or good fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well after.</p>
                              <p>Experience hath ſhewed in all ages, That the greater Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, were alwaies ſubject to the greater dangers of heavie and grievous Accidents, and very frequently the cauſes of them.</p>
                              <p>This inconvenience (common almoſt every where) ariſeth doubtleſs eſpecially from the inbred varietie of men's inward Diſpoſition, and ſom other outward accidents joining with it. Nay, experience hath often taught, that in the very pureſt Aſſemblies (even where things divine and heavenly were trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of) they could ſeldom hit upon an unanimous Conſent of any Concluſion: whereof there are innumerable Examples obvious every where, ſo that it may bee eaſily proved.</p>
                              <p>The cauſ hereof is the great Difference of the humors of thoſe, which meet at the foreſaid great Aſſemblies; who as they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in their outward feature, garb and manner of acting, the one from the other, ſo they are found to bee altogether as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepant and unlike one another in their inward Diſpoſitions, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Conceptions.</p>

The Diverſitie is as great within.</p>
                              <p>So that ſuch a great Number of Men meeting together and there beeing oftimes (beſides theſe Natural Diverſities) many different aims and ſeveral particular intereſts, playing under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert

                  <p>The ſame Thankſgiving Sermon and a devout praier thereupon performed in the place aforeſaid by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Streto;</hi> and in their Hi. Mi. behalf one thouſand Rixdollers brought by Secretarie <hi>Ruyſch</hi> to the Deacons of the <hi>Haghe</hi> for the poor; thereupon the great Aſſemblie parted, and in the evening all the Bells were rung, and all the Canons diſcharged in token of rejoicing; as alſo on the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 13 daie of <hi>September</hi> after the like Thankſgiving and publick Teſtimonies of Rejoicing were more generally and largely performed throughout all the Land. And after that the managing of all affairs returned again to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Aſſemblie of the States General.</p>
                  <p>The Lords of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſtfrieſland</hi> had for many years together found and judged the place of their <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie</hi> very incommodious and mean; and obſerving that by the Deceaſ of the Prince as Stadtholder moſt of the upper rooms of the Court of <hi>Holland</hi> ſtood vacant; they appointed a Committee <hi>Octob.</hi> 3, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord <hi>van Scha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> of the Nobilitie, together with the Lords of <hi>Dort, Amſterdam, Schiedum Alcmaer</hi> and <hi>Horen,</hi> to look out for a more convenient place there; provided nevertheleſs, that with the fitting of the place ſo much time might bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, as that before the meeting of the foreſaid Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie there, the mourning-year of the Houſ of <hi>Orange</hi> might bee exſpired.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Cats</hi> beeing now 74 years of age, had already at ſeveral times ſolicited the Lords of <hi>Holland</hi> for diſmiſsing of him from his charge of <hi>Counſellor-Penſionarie,</hi> or <hi>Advocate</hi> of that Province.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="599" facs="tcp:99708:322"/>
His many acceptable, long and faithful ſervices were ſuch, as that in regard thereof they were hard to bee brought to grant his requeſt. But the great Aſſemblie beeing ended, hee ſolicited more ſeriouſly yet for the obteinment, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gotten at length <hi>Septemb.</hi> 27, hee fell upon his knees in the Aſſemblie, thanking firſt Almightie God for his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold mercies in preſerving him all along in ſo weightie, toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and hazardous an Emploiment; and afterwards the Lords the States of the Province for all their favors by many elegant expreſsions, and wiſhing them all further happineſs, bliſs and proſperitie.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Lord <hi>Cats</hi> beeing diſcharged of that place, though continuing in his Office of keeping the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Deputie of the Fiefs of Holland;</hi> the Aſſemblie proceeded inſtantly to the chuſing of another Counſellor-Penſionarie, the neceſsitie and importance of the ſaid Charge beeing ſo great, that a certain learned man called him that was inveſted with the ſame in his time, the <hi>Atlas Belgicae Libertatis;</hi> Therefore the buſineſs admitting no Delay, there was that very day choſe in his Room, by unanimous Voices, the Lord <hi>Adrian Pauw,</hi> Lord of <hi>Hemſtede,</hi> &amp;c. Firſt and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding Counſellor and Controller in the Chamber of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſtfrieſland,</hi> who likewiſe before that time had ſerved in this Charge, and been emploied in diverſ ſolemn Embaſsies with greateſt praiſ, and to the ſpecial ſervice of this State. Next daie after this Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was ſignified unto him by <hi>Beaumont</hi> Secretarie to the ſaid Aſſemblie, with deſire, that his native Countrie ſtanding now more in need then ever of his ſervice, hee would by no means ſeek to wave it; and returning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards again, brought the Inſtruction along for to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſame, and to loſe as little time as may bee, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to amend what might bee found amiſs in it. In the mean time hee was viſited and entreated both in the Nobilitie's and the Citie's behalf from the Aſſemblie, by the Lord <hi>Cats</hi> himſelf, and by the brethren the Miniſters
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:99708:323"/>
at the <hi>Hagbe</hi> for to take the Charge upon him; it beeing both their and all good Patriots opinion, that ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of honor, integritie, faithfulneſs, knowledg, experience, diſcretion and autoritie as the Lord of <hi>Hemſtede</hi> was, was exceeding neceſſarie and behoof-ful for the ſupplying of this Charge, to the good and ſervice of this Common-wealth.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="600-689" type="pages">
                  <p>The Lord of <hi>Hemſtede</hi> was very hardly drawn to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and reſolv hereupon; and therefore the foreſaid Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie preſsing him further in their N. Gr. M. behalf, hee diſcourſed long thereof, and deduced likewiſe by word of mouth in the Aſſemblie it ſelf whatſoever hee could to ſhew the weight thereof; and eſpecially in regard the ſaid Charge and Emploiment was ſubject to great trouble and thankleſs iſſues, and upon revolutions of times and affairs like to prove very dangerous; Therefore hee deſired that hee might not bee liable to give account of his doings, actions and adminiſtrations to any but their No. Gr. Mi. full Aſſemblie, and that likewiſe hee might bee allowed to have recourſ (if need were) to the Courts of Juſtice in the ordinarie courſ thereof, without being conſtreined under any pretext whatſoever to make any appearance, plea or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer before any delegated or extraordinarie Judges, or before any combined in-landiſh or out-landiſh Courts, Civil or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie; or any other Councils, Courts, or Benches of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture here or elſwere erected or to bee erected in any place.</p>
                  <p>That upon all Events, however things might fall out afterwards by either Revolution or miſchance, hee might keep and effectually enjoie ſtill the rights and privileges of the Countrie of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſtfrieſland</hi> in general, and particularly the privileges belonging to the Citie and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> and that their N. G. M. would bee pleaſed to confirm the ſame <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> unleſs they ſhould think better, without prejudice or imminution of the ſolemn Act hee had obtained formerly from the Burgomaſters &amp; Governors of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> to grant him ſom other favorabl pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:99708:323"/>
for his farther ſecurity againſt any ſuch ſiniſtrous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.</p>
                  <p>That their N. Gr.

                  <p>That in regard and conſideration of the Commiſsions and travels laid upon him by the Inſtruction, to perform onely within the United Provinces, the better to attend and wait upon the ſervice of their N.

                  <p>And whereas the Inſtruction made for the ſaid charge of Counſellor Penſionarie, and delivered into his hands by their N<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gr M<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Secretarie, conteined a good number of Articles which partly were not to bee found in former Inſtructions, and partly differed ſomwhat from the waie and order which their N. Gr. M. had formerly deſired ſhould bee obſerved; and that in the execution of ſom of the Articles of the preſent Inſtruction, there might likely ſom difficulties bee diſcovered; That therefore hee might have leav and libertie, upon the findeing or meeting with any of the ſaid difficulties or inconveniencies, to propound the ſame from time to time unto their N. Gr. M. as likewiſe
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:99708:324"/>
the ſame was at other times found good and granted by their N. Gr. M. to others.</p>
                  <p>Promiſs beeing made hereupon, that good and full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of all this ſhould bee taken, his Honor at laſt complied, and beeing ſworn in the accuſtomed manner, undertook the charge in God's Name.</p>
                  <p>The great Aſſemblie beeing ended in this manner, there remained divers points of leſs concernment, or but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and unfiniſhed, referred to the Ordinarie Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie; which, together with other incident matters, held them buſie to near the end of the year 1651, as eſpecially the granting of <hi>leav for abſence</hi> to the Militarie Officers, whil'ſt ſom of the Officers, againſt the Act, engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs in forrein ſervice; others, and particularly the <hi>French, Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> beeing deſirous in this time of peace and breathing, to viſit their own Countries once. The <hi>States General</hi> maintained the right of diſpoſing herein to belong to them, by ſuch reaſons as they ſent unto the Provinces <hi>Nov.</hi> 30. whereof more ſhall bee ſaid anon. <hi>The Council</hi> on the other ſide claimed it to themſelvs; proteſting the one againſt the other. For Accommodation whereof there were propounded ſeveral Expedients: as,</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Leavs</hi> ſhould bee given by their <hi>Hi. Mi.</hi> and likewiſe by the <hi>Council of State,</hi> the one giving notice thereof to the other, and both Aſſemblies ſhould keep exact Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters thereof; provided that neither ſhould grant leav to to him that was refuſed by the other.</p>
                  <p>That Leavs ſhould bee ſought at and given by both Aſſemblies, but none ſhould paſs for current or valid but that which hath the Seals of both.</p>
                  <p>That their Hi. Mi. alone ſhould give the Leavs upon precedent advice of the Council, which ſhould bee ſealed likewiſe by the ſaid Council, which they might not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe; and that to this end the Council of State ſhould turn back to their Hi. Mi. all the requeſts preſented to them in that behalf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="603" facs="tcp:99708:324"/>
That one daie in the week ſhould bee appointed for to examine the requeſts of that nature by a Committee of both Aſſemblies, and to adviſe their Hi. Mi. whether the deſired Leav ſhould bee granted or not; and that the Leavs to bee given ſhould paſs in the name of their Hi. Mi. and the advice of the Council of State to bee witneſs by their Sealing thereof.</p>
                  <p>That the like number of Members of both Aſſemblies might bee autorized for to diſpoſe of theſe Leav-givings, and that the grants then after report made thereof, ſhould go forth in both their Names, and under both Seals.</p>
                  <p>That no Leavs ſhould bee asked but of their Hi. Mi. who ſhould have power to refuſe the ſame, or elſ to put it off to the Council of State for to diſpoſe therein; and in caſe the ſaid Council did yield unto it, that then they ſhould go in the name of the Council alone, but yet not bee valid, till firſt they were confirmed by the Seal of their Hi. Mi.</p>
                  <p>And aſſoon as the one or the other of theſe waies ſhould bee liked and determined, that then notice ſhould bee given thereof to the Provinces, with deſire that thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward they would give no Leavs themſelvs, but by waie of annexing theirs to the Leav given by their Hi. Mi. or the Council of State; in ſuch a manner as ſhould then bee found good to bee granted, for to avoid confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and diſorder, which elſ would hardly bee avoided.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Abſent Officers,</hi> the Lords of <hi>Holland</hi> brought in their Provincial Reſolution <hi>Sept.</hi> 30, conteining a charge to their Commiſsioned Council, to iſſue no paie to any, which contrarie to the Act of <hi>June</hi> 30 this year, had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelf forth the Land, or ingaged in forrein ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or ſhould do the like for time to com. Deſiring, that the reſt of the Provinces would take the like order in their diſtricts. Whereupon their Hi.

<pb n="564" facs="tcp:99708:325"/>
the Execution; the Lords of <hi>Holland</hi> underſtanding it, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> each Province might do the ſame upon the Companies be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>longing to their reſpective Repartition.</p>
                  <p>A good while after <hi>viz. Octob.</hi> 24. it was reſolved, That their Hi. Mi. alone, ſhould give the foreſaid <hi>Leavs,</hi> with precedent Advice from the Council of State, who might not refuſe the under-ſealing thereof; and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Council ſhould return<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the requeſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them in that behalf, unto their Hi.

The Provinces in the mean time remaining entire and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced, for either to give or to refuſe their annexings, to them, which ſhall have obtained their leavs in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner aforeſaid. The Acts or Inſtruments of the foreſaid Leav-giving, beeing to bee diſpatched with the addition of theſe words, <hi>after advice taken from the Council of State.</hi> But the Council not ſatisfied therewith, their Hi. M. writ unto the Provinces, under date of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 3c. That after they had cauſed ſeveral Conferences to bee held by Deputies of their Aſſemblie, with a Committee of the Council of State, about the waie and manner to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in giving leav to the Militarie Officers in ſervice of this State, which was to bee don by their Hi. Mi. with precedent Advice of the ſaid Council, provided that there were beſides that annext conſents to bee ſought and obtained from the reſpective Provinces their pay-maſters; nevertheleſs the Lords of the ſaid Council were not pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as yet to acquieſce therein, they maintaining ſtill, that it belonged to them to grant the ſame leavs together with Us, according to the Right conferr'd upon them by the firſt Article of the Act in the year 1599. in the point of Muſtering; and the poſſeſsion enſued, which beeing not ſpecifically revoked or taken from them by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie General of all the Confederates kept here in the great Hall, it ought of right to remain where it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Their Hi. Mi. could not forbear by waie of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Elucidation and Information of what is ſaid before,
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:99708:325"/>
to repreſent to their No. Mi. (the particular Provinces) that having ripely examined and pondered every thing, they could not finde the Council's Aſſertion to bee ſo grounded, as that the Right of granting the foreſaid Leavs at firſt inſtance ſhould irrevocably appertain to them, in regard that according to the Reſolution of <hi>June</hi> 16. laſt taken by the foreſaid Great Aſſemblie, the chiefeſt care, autoritie and direction over the Militia of this State, was peculiarly committed to the Generalitie; to whoſe diſpoſition principally was left the granting of Patents, and the taking care for the Frontiers of the ſaid State together with the conſequences and dependencies thereof, onely with the precedent advice of the Council aforeſaid; which they underſtood was likewiſe to bee obſerved in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; eſpecially conſidering moreover the Reſolution, likewiſe taken at the great Hall <hi>July</hi> laſt 21. committing to their hands alone and ſolely, the whole buſineſs of ſecret Correſpondencie (whereby they could beſt peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, what was ſpecially neceſſarie for the ſecuritie of the reſpective Frontiers of the State aforeſaid) and of what a dangerous conſequence it might bee, in caſe the ſaid Leavs ſhould bee given by any other but themſelvs, when as otherwiſe it might frequently com to paſs, that upon any Diſcoverie of the condition within and without of one or other Frontier of greateſt importance, the ſame may by ſuch means bee made bare or deprived of a good part of their Officers, and conſequently of their principal ſecuritie and direction, againſt which the alleged Article of the foreſaid Act cannot avail, in aſmuch as in the firſt place, the ſaid Act was decreed by them (the Ordinarie Aſſemblie of the Generalitie, &amp; not by the joint Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces met in ſtates-Aſſemblie or ſummoned together upon precedent intimation of certain points to bee determined, and therefore, might as juſtly, for pregnant reaſons, bee ſtreightned, enlarged or changed by themſelvs (the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie Aſſemblie) which could in no wiſe bee diſputed
<pb n="906" facs="tcp:99708:326"/>
by them, that had no other Right, but what that Act afforded them; beſides that it is obſervable, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſaid Articles, the Captains General had during that time, by little and little taken that right, for the moſt part to themſelvs; inſomuch that of the forecited Poſſeſsion, the ſaid Council would bee able to ſhew and produce very little or nothing, unleſs it were the ſame happened peradventure now and then for a ſmall time, by reaſon of the abſence, ſickneſs, or other the like acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents or impediments of the Captains General. But as for their maintaining, that the foreſaid <hi>Right and Poſſeſsion, was not taken from them by the joint Confederates in the great Hall; and that therefore it ought to bee continued to them;</hi> to the ſolution of this, beſides the motives and reaſons alreadie alleged, ſerveth eſpecially the 50<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of their Inſtruction, renewed <hi>July</hi> laſt 18. importing, <hi>That all things not expreſly ſet down in the ſaid Inſtruction, to bee at the diſpoſition of the ſaid Council, ſhould remain at the diſpoſition of the States General, the States of the particular Provinces, the Magiſtrates of the Cities, and other lawful Superiors, each within their own juriſdiction and limits.</hi> Now it is plain enough, that in the foreſaid Inſtruction, there is not the leaſt mention made of the foreſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Leav-giving,</hi> much leſs the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to the Council, and conſequently might not bee exerciſed by them; but that the ſame doth appertain to them (the Ordinarie Aſſemblie of the States General,) even by virtue of the ſaid Article, and likewiſe by the foreſaid Reſolution of <hi>July</hi> 18. and from the nature of the buſineſs it ſelf, for the reaſons aboveſaid; which may yet further bee confirmed by the laſt Reſolution, at the Cloſe of the foreſaid Aſſemblie in the great Hall, taken <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt 19. whereby all other buſineſſes and affairs not determined there, ſhould bee left to them (the Ordinarie Aſſemblie) and none elſ.

                  <p>The <hi>Council</hi> of State was alſo ſummoned again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for to com and take their <hi>Oath</hi> upon the new <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> paſt <hi>Julie</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>But by reaſon that through the abſence of many the Council was very thin and uncomplete, they excuſed and <hi>declined</hi> it ſtill, until <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1. they brought in their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations upon the ſaid Inſtructions;</hi> ſhewing, that ſom points thereof were <hi>not practicable</hi> according to the letter; as alſo that thence would follow much remiſſneſs or ſlow proceeding in the affairs, and therefore no ſmall diſſervice to the Land.</p>

                  <p>They ſaid, the <hi>Second Article</hi> required, <hi>That the Lords of the Council ſhould have their firm Reſidence at the place of their Aſſemblie;</hi> this the Council held ſerviceable indeed for the State, if it could bee put in practice by the Lords; but ſom declared they had taken the Commiſsion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them on other terms; and thoſe which were ſent hither from the Provinces but for the ſpace of <hi>one or two years,</hi> beeing abſent now, they would finde themſelvs put to a great deal of inconvenience, to quit therefore their habitation in the Provinces, and to tranſport their whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies hither for ſo ſmall a time.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Third Article,</hi> of <hi>gathering in the fore- and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and that the Counſellors ſhould ſtill bee ready at hand where</hi>

                     <hi>the Council is emploi'd,</hi> they ſaid, they held it ſufficient to keep to the old practice, and ſuch as their Hi. Mi. them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs do, gathering namely in the forenoon in ordinarie, and beſides that at any time when the Lord Preſident ſhall finde it requiſite for the ſervice of the Countrie.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>Article</hi> 15, That is was known the Council had no diſpoſing of the common means within the reſpective Provinces, but onely in the places without the Provinces reſorting under the Generalitie, where the equalitie would bee obſerved well enough, but that it was requiſite there ſhould firſt ſom reſolution bee taken about the difference which was in the common means of the <hi>Boſch,</hi> with other places of <hi>Braband,</hi> for which advice was given a good while ago; and that the Liſts of <hi>Braband</hi> and <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> may likewiſe bee looked into, as not well agreeing yet.</p>
                  <p>They declared, they could not perform the 19 <hi>Article</hi> according to the letter, beeing the paiment of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dierie was not made by them; but the ſame and the charges of War beeing charged by <hi>Repartition</hi> upon the reſpective Provinces, they had the diſpoſition over the paiment and the managing of their means themſelvs. The <hi>Generalities</hi> means were emploied by the Council, upon the undivided Intereſts, running upon the account of the Receiver General, and all other emergent occaſions, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsities and charges, incident and incumbent to and with the Aſſemblies of the Generalitie. As for the neceſſarie Muſtering and Diſcipline over the Souldierie the Council would take care for well enough, but the paying them <hi>by Pole</hi> or <hi>by the head,</hi> was never practiſed yet, and beyond the Council's abilitie.</p>
                  <p>To the 20 <hi>Article</hi> the Council ſaid, it was not in their power to provide for that, beeing every Province did therein every one as they found good, and ſom did pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the contrarie, cauſing the Companies to bee char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; ſom alſo not paying preciſely; ſo that without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſsing
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:99708:330"/>
firſt the one and other exorbitancie in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and reducing all to an Uniformitie, it was in vain preciſely and duly to effect the reſt upon or againſt the Souldierie.</p>
                  <p>To the 21, where is ſaid, <hi>how the Orders ought to bee ſigned,</hi> they obſerved there was omitted, <hi>that the Secretarie of the Council ought to ſign the ſame likewiſe,</hi> which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs was expreſſed in the enlargement of the Inſtruction for the Receiver General, ſaying, That none ſhould bee paid otherwiſe, but beeing ſigned alſo by the <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 22 they ſaid did moſt concern the <hi>Courts of the Admiraltie,</hi> who had the direction of the Receits for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys and Licences, and accordingly ought to take care, that none indebted that waie, may ſeek to exemt himſelf. That this Council was onely concerned in judging of ſuch goods in the open Countrie, as beeing ſtaied by the Souldierie, want paſſes; of which this Council had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies given Judgment, and the <hi>Courts of the Admiralties</hi> of ſuch as had paſſes, according as it hath been practiſed theſe many years.</p>
                  <p>In the 23 <hi>Article</hi> it was ſaid, <hi>The States ſhall ſuffer the,</hi> whereas the Old Inſtruction hath it, <hi>The Cities ſhall ſuffer the,</hi> it were fit to bee known which is to ſtand.</p>
                  <p>To the 24 they ſaid, <hi>The drawing up or framing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up ſuch a ſtate every third month of the charges of War, and the incoms of the means,</hi> was not feaſible for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, in regard that the Souldierie and charges of War were divided among the Provinces, and that the Council could do no more, then to preſent every year a propoſition by waie of Petition, <hi>What they judged Neceſsitie did require for the conſervation of the ſtate of the Land,</hi> it belonging to the States of the Provinces, by Declarations and Liquidations to ſhew forth their paiments iſſued.</p>
                  <p>The Liſt for the Garriſons whereof the 25 <hi>Article</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Council was ready enough (ſaid they) to ſee it
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:99708:330"/>
kept exactly; provided onely, that the Provinces tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing any Companies within their Provinces or places adjacent, or Patents beeing ſent them with open names, filling them up and yielding the Companies to bee drawn forth, they give immediate advertiſement thereof unto the Council, ſo as the order of giving of <hi>Patents</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>To the 26, the Council would take care for <hi>equalitie of Contribution,</hi> but that firſt the remaining Differences with ſom ought to bee reſolved upon, as was likewiſe inſtanced above upon Article 15.</p>
                  <p>As to the 27, The Council would continue their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted care in regard of the Land-forces, on condition, that the Provinces do addreſs ſuch Collonels, Ritmaſters and Captains, as they ſhall chuſe in vacant places, unto the Council, to take this Oath upon their Commiſsion, as likewiſe to ſign the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>refuſing no manner of ſervice,</hi> or <hi>ſuffering no alterations</hi> in caſe of any delaie of paiment, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the uſual, antient, and hitherto-continued practice in this Council.</p>
                  <p>The Council found the 28 needful enough, and ſhould gladly entertain all <hi>Treaties and alliances</hi> made within and without the Land; provided, that notice thereof was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them, leaſt they ſhould commit any thing againſt it unwittingly.</p>
                  <p>In the 31 there was mention made of <hi>ordinarie matters,</hi> whereas the Old Inſtruction ſpeak's of <hi>extraordinarie matters,</hi> whereof they deſired explanation.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the 33 they ſaid, the Council ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded warily, and upon good knowledg after informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in granting ſom <hi>Remiſsions to Farmers,</hi> as alſo to the people of the open Countrie where any of our Armie or Leaguers had been; and that in ſuch extraordinarie Caſes, whereof conſideration may bee deſired on both hands, it were fit to know, whether the intention was <hi>that all the Counſellors ought to bee perſonally preſent,</hi> which ſeldom
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:99708:331"/>
happen's; or, <hi>that all all the Counſellors beeing at the place where the Council is kept, ſhould bee preſent in it;</hi> however ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the greater part.</p>
                  <p>To the 34 they ſaid, That the publick putting out of Fortification works, was for a long time obſerved by the Council by waie of affixion of printed Bills, as alſo the continuations of entertainments aboliſhed heretofore; but many times it happened, that the publick undertaking of ſuch works could not bee effected by reaſon of bad pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereof wee have ſom late Examples, none bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bee found that would undertake the work at a double rate, becauſ the Provinces paid not at all, or very ſlowly; ſo that for the avoiding of more miſchief, the Works remaining imperfect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Council was ſomtimes neceſsitated to cauſ the ſame to bee made up by other means, (when the publick courſ failed) either by daily paie, or upon declarations; for which cauſ all could not bee tied thus to the publick putting out of the Works without diſſervice to the State; but the Council <hi>(ſaid they)</hi> made indeed trial ſtill of all publick means, and ſo they would likewiſe for the future: but if no undertakers could bee found, they muſt nevertheleſs ſtill conſider the advancement of the Land's Service, and the managing of it with the leaſt charges that may bee. Alſo ſince the Aſſent to the laſt <hi>ſtate of War</hi> no Orders for Works were addreſſed to the Receiver General, but Acts onely are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for deſiring of paie from the Provinces according to the foreſaid ſtate of War, and Inſtructions for the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver General, and there are no Aſsignations granted by him upon ſubordinate Receivers, but upon precedent Orders from the Council.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To Artic.</hi> 35. they ſaid that the ſame, as to the main, <hi>againſt all gifts or preſents,</hi> tending to <hi>Corruption,</hi> was very good, and would bee followed by the Council accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; but for to ſharpen it to the leaſt things; as to <hi>eating and drinking wares,</hi> among friends; which perhaps
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:99708:331"/>
a great while after, might get ſom buſineſs to follow at the Council, that would prove <hi>too captious.</hi> However, of ſuch things no more could bee made known, then one enjoi'd or remembred yet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To the</hi> 28 they ſaid, it would bee very unbeſeeming to hang up any ſuch <hi>Patent</hi> in the Out-room, or Anti-Chamber, much impairing and derogating to the <hi>honor and reſpect</hi> of the Council, and the Lords in particular; <hi>and why to hang up ſuch a thing more there before the Council, then before the other Courts or Aſſemblies of the Generalitie.</hi> The beſt waie were, that the Provinces looked carefully to it, to entruſt and ſend none with Commiſsion to ſit in any of theſe Aſſemblies, but <hi>men of integritie;</hi> the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of July</hi> 1. beeing a <hi>ſufficient</hi> Patent, to give warning to all in that behalf, having been publiſhed and affixed every where, which alſo ſufficiently reached to the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tournies</hi> and <hi>Sollicitors,</hi> practiſing before the Council; there beeing no ordinarie or ſet ones there, but every one hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing libertie to follow and ſolicite his affairs before the Council, by whom hee conceived it beſt, and ſo as might bee leaſt chargeable to Souldiers and poor people, having buſineſs there. Inſomuch that they knew not whom to ſwear; the <hi>Council</hi> having likewiſe <hi>no Juriſdiction over the Notaries, Attournies and ſuch like,</hi> dwelling in this place, as <hi>Townſmen,</hi> againſt whom they could not execute the penalties.</p>

                  <p>The 46 <hi>Articl.</hi> they ſaid, was taken, according to the old Inſtruction of the year 1588., when as there were <hi>three Secretaries</hi> appointed for the Council of State each
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:99708:332"/>
with an Entertainment of 800 Gilders <hi>per an.</hi> And three Secretaries there were then, becauſ the Council in thoſe times was fain, according to the occurrences of affairs to divide themſelvs, ſom <hi>here,</hi> ſom in other <hi>Provinces</hi> and in the <hi>Leageurs;</hi> where the Secretaries had all the Diſpatches, with the profits and emoluments thereof: they beeing dead, there were no others put in their rooms, ſo that ſince the year 1605. all was lookt to by <hi>one Secretarie:</hi> and accordingly his entertainment was augmented, and hath been above theſe 30 years enjoied by the predeceſſors of this preſent Secretarie, <hi>viz.</hi> up to 1400 Gilders: as may bee ſeen by the <hi>State of War in Anno</hi> 1628. whence this is extracted.</p>
                  <p>The preſent <hi>Secretarie</hi> (they ſaid) had remonſtrated to the <hi>Great Aſſemblie</hi> his 34 years ſervice, in ſeveral quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and having been Secretarie for above nine years, did, upon good grounds, then ſpecified, ſue for an augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the foreſaid Entertainment of 1400 Gilders; which requeſt of his was by Reſolution of <hi>July</hi> laſt 21. returned to the Diſpoſition of the <hi>Ordinarie Aſſemblie</hi> of their Hi.

                  <p>To the 49. they ſaid, That the <hi>Counter-Seal</hi> was wont to bee kept by the Lord Preſident in the Council, but in regard of the troubleſomneſs, there beeing oftimes divers Commiſsioners and other Diſpatches to bee Sealed, without the Councils ſitting, the Seal was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore committed to the hands of the Secretarie of the Council, who kept the ſame in a peculiar Box under lock, within the Council-chamber, and delivered <hi>yearly</hi> a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Liſt of all the ſealed Dispatches,</hi> and the <hi>dues</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for the ſame, together with ſuch monies as were
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:99708:333"/>
emploi'd there for publick buſineſſes, though but of ſmall importance; This (they ſaid) had been in uſe thus for many years, and that if any alteration was deſired there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the ſame might bee don; but it was worth conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, whether this <hi>ſervice</hi> and <hi>troubleſomneſs</hi> ſhould bee undertaken <hi>gratis.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>The 52. they ſaid, was conform to the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>of the old Inſtruction,</hi> which had it been thus followed, the Council was of opinion, it would have produced ſo good a fruit from the practice of and advice for any alteration, that they might have taken the oath in behalf thereof, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcruple, and ſhould not have been troubleſom now to their Hi.

                  <p>And thus the taking of the <hi>Oath</hi> upon the ſaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, was <hi>put off</hi> for that time.</p>
                  <p>As for the Lords, which henceforward were to bee employ'd in the name and behalf of the Generalitie in any <hi>Ambaſsie, Commiſsion or any other Deputation, of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſoever,</hi> whether within or without the Land; it was decreed alreadie <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt 10. that they ſhould bee prohibited and forbidden to receiv any <hi>Honoraries, gifts or preſents</hi> from any at any time, neither themſelvs, nor by any other directly or indirectly, in what manner or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what pretext or title ſoever, of what qualitie and how ſmall ſoever the ſame ſhall bee; all upon pain of <hi>infamie</hi> and <hi>incapableneſs</hi> of any <hi>Charges, Employments, Offices or Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits</hi> whatſoever, for ever; and that likewiſe the ſaid <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers</hi> or <hi>Accepters</hi> of preſents, ſhall <hi>ipſo facto</hi> bee and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main

                  <p>Next daie the Lord <hi>Wimmenum,</hi> preſiding at the <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie,</hi> hee offered to their Hi.

This was no removing of the abſolute <hi>Direction,</hi> but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Director;</hi> therefore the cauſ remaining ſtill the ſame, the impatience remained in like manner. To this came alſo, that thoſe which had the preſent Direction la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored very much ſtill, during the <hi>Great Aſſemblie,</hi> againſt the <hi>intentions of Holland;</hi> who for that very purpoſe ſent to the State's-Aſſemblie in <hi>Zealand</hi> the Lords <hi>Opdam, de Wit, Nyport</hi> and <hi>Ricce,</hi> who made in <hi>publick</hi> the Propoſition of <hi>April</hi> 25, above-recited.

                  <p>The <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> at <hi>Middleburg</hi> were alreadie beſides that extremely unſatisfied with thoſe, which had the Direction there, and were inveſted with all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal offices. It was laid to their charge, that they did many things contrarie to the privileges of the Citie; which cauſed at laſt a total change of the Magiſtrate at <hi>Middleburg;</hi> as oftimes it happen's, when outward ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie medicines are deſtitute of operation, that nature it ſelf begin's to work a change within: The ſtorie and occaſion hereof is, that the <hi>Cities of Zeland,</hi> had, according to the example of <hi>Holland,</hi> undertaken and reſolved, to make henceforth their own Magiſtrates; ſaving ſtill the

                  <p>The <hi>Directors</hi> at <hi>Middleburg,</hi> for to retain the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there, had ſo contrived the matter, that the <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Cuſtom</hi> of certain <hi>twelv Electors</hi> (who were all to bee <hi>ſtrangers</hi> or <hi>forein-born Citizens)</hi> was much impaired in the Grant for the Citie of <hi>Middleburg,</hi> and the <hi>Election</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt totally put into the hands of thoſe, that were in the <hi>Government.</hi> This cauſed a great deal of <hi>murmuring</hi> and <hi>impatience</hi> among the <hi>Commons,</hi> complaining, that too many ſtrangers were brought into the Magiſtracie, whiles other better beloved of the Citizens and better qualified were excluded.</p>
                  <p>They likewiſe complained againſt a certain Bench, or Seat-monie or Contribution, which the <hi>Church maſters</hi> (all men of the Government) had put upon the places or ſeats in the Church; <hi>Item</hi> a certain <hi>Styver-monie,</hi> ſet upon thoſe, which were found walking forth the Gates on <hi>Sundaies,</hi> moſt lighting upon the <hi>poorer ſort.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Miniſters</hi> thereupon, and the foreſaid encroachings of the privileges, inveighing againſt thoſe courſes in their Sermons, it happened, that one of the Magiſtrates went forth the Church much diſguſted, and that the Preacher was ſummoned to appear before the <hi>red door</hi> (as they call it) where it com to that height, that they began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join the Miniſters, they ſhould com that daie before their Sermons, and acquaint the Council <hi>what Text</hi> they had choſen to preach upon, and what manner of <hi>Explications</hi> or <hi>Application</hi> they intended to make thereof, threatning them, that the <hi>Church,</hi> yea and the <hi>Citie</hi> too, ſhould bee forbidden them, if they continued refractorie. The <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> anſwered, <hi>if they ſhould bee put out of the Church, they would preach it in the Streets; and if forth the Citie, they would do it in the fields.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus one diſcontent coming upon the neck of another,

there beeing an Aſſemblie of the States kept at that time, there gathered themſelvs <hi>June</hi> 6. a great number of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens</hi> near <hi>two thouſand</hi> of them, in the <hi>Abbie-Court,</hi> deſiring Audience.

night after to keep watch before the ſaid houſ; within a few days after, a certain requeſt was preſented to him by ſom of the Miniſters, in the name of ſom perſons, pretending to bee the Companies of the Citie, beeing in effect deſired thereby, and what elſ was declared by word of mouth by the foreſaid Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that hee would laie down his aboveſaid Office and place of Counſellorſhip of the Citie of <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> if hee choſe not rather to ſell both his own and ſom of his friends houſes, utterly plunder'd and ruinated the firſt night enſuing, inſomuch that then, to avoid more miſchief, hee was conſtrained, to condeſcend to the ſaid deſire with this proviſo nevertheleſs, that it ſhould bee promiſed him in the foreſaid pretended Companies behalf, that ſo doing all ſhould bee and remain at reſt, and himſelf unmoleſted any further, and maintained in his other places and Charges, as alſo at that time, the foreſaid Miniſters declared, they had no other intention. And although hee was readie to go on in the exerciſe of his other functions, and ſo continued ſtill, and therefore ought not to have been diſturbed therein in any kinde, nevertheleſs it was judged at the ſame time by the foreſaid Miniſters, for the further and better quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>(as was pretended)</hi> of the tumultous multitude, it would bee beſt hee ſhould retire himſelf for a while out of the Citie, which hee was very loth to yield unto, in regard of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid declaration made, but yet was perſwaded at laſt, the rather for that this ſame retirement of his out of the Citie was afterwards found good likewiſe <hi>(as they pretended)</hi> by the ruling Burgo-maſters for the time beeing, who likewiſe in token thereof, together with the Baylie, conducted him forth the Citie themſelvs, and brought him to a certain boat in the haven there, beſpoken by him.

finde their Cities conſtitution ſuch that they could defend him againſt the feared ſtreet-injuries, they declared in plain terms, it was not in their power, whereupon hee deſiring the ſaid Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go-maſters, they would bee pleaſed then to conſent to his retiring himſelf to the Spa, for his own and wifes health ſake; the ſaid Burgo-maſters gave their conſent unto it, and accordingly hee went to the Spa, and beeing afterward returned thence to <hi>Sluys</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi> for the diſpatching of ſom particular affairs of his own there, hee thence by letters ſignified to the Magiſtrate of <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> that hee was ſtill diſpoſed and readie, to com and duly to execute his foreſaid offices for the ſervice of the ſaid Citie, waiting but for their (the ſaid Magiſtrates) leaſt intimation and promiſs of beeing protected againſt all the ſuſpected and feared inſolencies or affrontings in the ſtreets. But there beeing hitherto no anſwer at al returned to him upon his ſaid letter, and hee therefore not without reaſon ſuſpecting, that the conſtitution of the ſaid Citie was not yet ſo ſetled, that the Magiſtrates were able duly to protect him; and that beſides hee was from good hands in that Citie ſufficiently informed of the certaintie thereof: That all ſuch tumultarie commotions of the commons were of dangerous conſequence, which, according as now was don in ſom of the prime places of Holland, ought to bee exemplarily ſuppreſſed; and that therefore, hee was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned now for to bee duly and ſufficiently freed from all the ſuſpected ſtreet-violence, and other inſolencies, together with his wife, children, familie, ſervants, moveable and unmoveable goods, and unmoleſtedly to attend in due manner upon the diſcharge of his offices, to applie himſelf unto this Court, deſiring their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion herein.</q>

                              <p>And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> how the foreſaid Cities ought to bee conſidered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after that in the beginning of the War they were admitted <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of the <hi>Sovereign</hi> Government of this Province.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>As to the firſt,</hi> this muſt bee held for aſſured &amp; unqueſtionable, that although an <hi>Earl of the Land</hi> in thoſe times could juſtly claim, not onely the <hi>Power of Sovereigntie</hi> and Reſort, but likewiſe all manner of <hi>Juriſdiction and Roialties</hi> in the ſame; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there remained and belonged alſo to the places themſelvs <hi>ex jure publico Univerſitatis,</hi> ſom <hi>proper and peculiar autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> in matter of Government, diſtinct and ſeparated from the Earl's Command, in the behalf and among their own <hi>Common Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>As likewiſe it is notorious, that there can no Univerſitie (or Bodie Politick) bee otherwiſe rightly conſtituted <hi>ſine aliquo Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitio Juris publici.</hi>

Therefore it appear's alſo, that the ſame places, before ever they came under any particular Lords, had ſeveral <hi>Elections</hi> and <hi>Privileges</hi> granted and confirmed them by the ſucceſsive <hi>Earls</hi> and <hi>Counteſſes,</hi> for the uſe of them and their Inhabitants, and the adminiſtration of their <hi>own Government;</hi> as is manifeſt among other proofs by the old <hi>Citie-rights</hi> and <hi>Charter,</hi> given by <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam of Hanolt,</hi> as <hi>Earl of Zeland,</hi> to them of <hi>Fluſhing</hi> in the year <hi>1315,</hi> and afterwards renewed and amplified by the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Marie of Burgundie,</hi> in the year <hi>1477.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Which thus premiſed, it is further known and notorious, that the foreſaid Government having <hi>originally</hi> appertained to the ſaid <hi>Cities ex Jure Publico,</hi> the ſame was not taken from them, but contrarily left entire, when afterwards by the Earls and Counteſſes of <hi>Zeland</hi> they were ſold and tranſported to other Lords.</p>
                              <p>It beeing plain for the proof thereof, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the ſaid Earls or Counteſſes in making thoſe <hi>Ceſsions</hi> have, according to the <hi>Tenor</hi> of their <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> expreſsly reteined no more to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs then the right of Sovereigntie, Reſort and Homage.</p>
                              <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the foreſaid particular Lords, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of their foreſaid Sale and Tranſport, they have notoriouſly paſt away no more right or autoritie over them then the <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Inveſtiture,</hi> and the ſpecification of the Fiefs do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein and hold forth.</p>
                              <p>Which for all the Conceſsion of as well higher, as middle and lower Juriſdiction, and diverſ other both honorable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable rights and prerogatives made over to the ſaid Lords, do therefore withall <hi>in terminis</hi> give up unto them all manner of functions and requiſites neceſſarie for the Direction and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Civil Societie; it followeth evidently, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever (ſerving to that end, and not belonging to the immediate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Sovereigntie) is not expreſsly and by name ſet down in the foreſaid Letters, the ſame ought to bee left and reſerved to the Cities aforeſaid.</p>

                                 <hi>Secondly,</hi> from divers <hi>Contracts, Tranſactions and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> ſolemnly made, as well of old as later times, betwixt the <hi>Lords</hi> on the one, and the <hi>Governors and Commonalties</hi> of the ſaid Cities on the other ſide.</p>
                              <p>And particularly from the <hi>Contract made in the year 1530,</hi> between <hi>Adolph</hi> of <hi>Burgundie</hi> as Lord of <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> and the Burgamaſters and Governors of that <hi>Citie</hi> touching the maintein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Citie-works to the Sea-ward, and the collecting of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Incoms and means ariſing there, a certain diſtinction beeing made therein between partie and partie, both for charge and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thence accrewing; where is likewiſe mention made, not onely of nulling or repealing a former <hi>Contract,</hi> but alſo (which is worth noting) in the Citie's behalf that this was don, <hi>after due and Legal communication had with the Principal ones and Commons of the ſaid Citie;</hi> the whole Contract alſo beeing confirmed on the one ſide with the Seal of the Lord, and on the other with the Seal uſed for the Citie-affairs.</p>
                              <p>As likewiſe <hi>Prince William</hi> of Hon<hi rend="sup">ble</hi> Memorie, in the year <hi>1582,</hi> granted unto thoſe of <hi>Fluſhing</hi> aforeſaid for their ſupport and relief, and towards the mainteining of their Sea works, the <hi>Herring-toll</hi> there and <hi>Heir's-right,</hi> together with the <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll;</hi> under certain conditions ſet down at large in the ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsions.</p>

of the ſaid Cities were wholly, and without any exception, depending on their Lords, and could not in any wiſe bee conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without them; as alſo in ſuch a caſe, beeing all one with their Lords, it is plain of it ſelf, that they would not bee able to make any <hi>Contract</hi> with them, <hi>Siquidem nemo ſecum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahit.</hi>

                              <p>It appear's <hi>Thirdly</hi> alſo very evidently by the <hi>Agreements and Tranſactions</hi> entered into and past by the ſaid Cities, <hi>without their Lords,</hi> apart and in particular with the States of this Province.</p>
                              <p>For proof whereof doth ſerv eſpecially among others, that which past between the ſaid Lords the <hi>States of Zeland,</hi> and the Citie of <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> in the year <hi>1585,</hi> touching the <hi>Indemnitie</hi> deſired by them upon the <hi>enſurance</hi> made to her Roial Majeſtie of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

                              <p>By which Letters or grant of Indemnitie obteined then, there are engaged to them and put into their hands, all the Domains, Means and Revenues of the Earl and Earldom of <hi>Zeland,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that Citie and reſort thereof; with autorization, that of their own power they may ſeiz upon the ſame for the Indemnitie of the Citie, their Citizens and Inhabitants, againſt all damages and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, which by reaſon of the ſaid tranſport or ſurrender the ſaid Citie might chance to ſuffer in their Domains, Incoms and otherwiſe, or any of their Citizens and Inhabitants in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments.</p>
                              <p>Beeing that the foreſaid Letters and Acts of Indemnitie <hi>(note well)</hi> were granted to the Governors of <hi>Fluſhing</hi> for themſelvs and their Inhabitants in particular, and upon their particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, without any uſe made in that behalf of the name and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of his Excellencie <hi>Maurice,</hi> beeing at that time the <hi>Lord of the place.</hi>

                              <p>

As alſo it is notorious, and appear's by the Regiſters, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the foreſaid Act of Indemnitie for the Governors and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> expedited <hi>Septemb. 23, 1585,</hi> the Letters of Indemnitie for his Excellencie aforeſaid, (in caſe, that through the foreſaid Garriſon of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> his Juriſdiction, Domains, Houſes and Rights ſhould com to ſuffer any damage or inconvenience,) for all the inſtance of thoſe of <hi>Fluſhing</hi> aforeſaid, and the earnest ſollicitation of the Lord <hi>Bruninex,</hi> Counſellor to his Ezcellencie were not granted till <hi>December thirteenth</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing.</p>
                              <p>It beeing true withal, that the Magiſtrate and Citizens of <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> for the cauſ aboveſaid, having been engaged by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Oath of Fidelitie to her Majeſtie aforeſaid, they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward <hi>June 14, 1616,</hi> particularly likewiſe releaſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                              <p>And therefore was it very pertinently ſaid in the <hi>9</hi> Article of the Grant or Charter given to thoſe of <hi>Fluſhing</hi> by his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie <hi>Prince William</hi> of happie memorie, in the year <hi>1574.</hi> That according to their antient Privileges they are ſufficiently qualified and antorized to treat, tranſact and diſpoſe of all matters and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs belonging to the foreſaid Citie.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the grounds of the former aſſertion are conſpicuous alſo, from the Contracts and Tranſactions made as well by the Lords as the Governors of the the ſaid Cities, intervening, and for their diſtinct interest with other forrein Princes and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates.</p>
                              <p>An <hi>example</hi> whereof wee have in the Agreement made in the year <hi>1612</hi> between the Commiſsioners of the States of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by autorization of the <hi>King,</hi> on the one part, and the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners both of the <hi>Marquiſs</hi> and of the <hi>Citie</hi> of <hi>Veer</hi> on the other, concerning the foundation of a <hi>Staple</hi> for the Scotiſh Wares within the ſaid Citie, in most of the Articles principally engaging the Magiſtrate there; and in the ſolemn <hi>Signature</hi> thereof, the Deputies of the <hi>Marquiſs</hi> ſtanding <hi>ſeparated</hi> from the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of the <hi>Citie.</hi>

without incongruitie, if the Magiſtrate of the foreſaid two Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had no power and autoritie in civil matters without their Lord, but abſolutely in all things depended on him.</p>

                              <p>By reaſon whereof alſo it is expreſsly ſaid in the <hi>5</hi> Article of the Charter aforeſaid, granted to thoſe of <hi>Fluſhing</hi> by <hi>Prince William,</hi> That they ſhall have power yearly to Commiſsionate the <hi>Rent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>maſter</hi> or <hi>Treaſurer</hi> for Receiver of the Revenues particularly belonging or appropriated to the ſaid Citie.</p>
                              <p>And for further proof may bee added, that the foreſaid Rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter is bound yearly to bring in a due Account of his Receit and Adminiſtration, together with his Evidences and Remains, before and in the preſence of the Burgomaſters and Senators, without making any mention of the Lord or his Commiſsioners, paſsing by the very Counſellors, beeing that they are particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put in by the Lord, for the adminiſtration of Juſtice: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to this very daie there is not the leaſt notice taken of thoſe things in the Lord's behalf.</p>

                              <p>And Artic. <hi>8,</hi> it is again declared, that the Burgomaſters, according to their antient privileges, ſhould have the Diſpoſing of the Citie<hi>-Revenues,</hi> to emploie them to the uſe there rehearſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without any mention made of the Lord.</p>
                              <p>It beeing likewiſe known, that in conformitie hereof, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricts and and Lordſhips of <hi>Soutelanden</hi> and <hi>Coudekerck</hi> do particularly appertain at preſent to the Citie of <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> not pretending the leaſt Right or Direction therein.</p>

                              <p>Whereunto among others eſpecially relate's a certain <hi>Privilege</hi> given them by King <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in the year <hi>1475.</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> van <hi>Borſſele,</hi> as <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Veer,</hi> together with the Burgomaſters and Governors (diſtinguiſhed from the Lord) as alſo the general Inhabitants and Commons of the ſaid Citie, which then were, or ſhould bee hereafter.</p>
                              <p>Which kinde of <hi>Privileges,</hi> eſpecially there beeing <hi>many</hi> of them, are of that <hi>validitie</hi> and weight, in regard of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Cities, and muſt ſo bee underſtood in <hi>Law,</hi> that although the <hi>Lords</hi> thereof, ſhould either committ any <hi>felonie</hi> or delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencie againſt the <hi>Earl,</hi> as the <hi>direct Lord,</hi> or have given to the ſaid forrein Potentates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any juſt cauſ of offence, and merited thereby to bee deprived of the Diſpoſition and Contents of the foreſaid Privileges, ſo far forth as concerneth them; nevertheleſs the ſame could not bee interpreted to the prejudice of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Cities and Inhabitants, beeing guiltleſs of any ſuch tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion or neglect; nor they deprived of their Intereſt in the ſaid rights and privileges, but for their own Delinquencie.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Ninthly,</hi> and moſt principally, the ſame is ungainſaiably plain, by the oft foreſaid <hi>grand Charter,</hi> given to thoſe of Fluſhing and Veer reſpectively by <hi>Prince William</hi> of happy memory, in the year <hi>1574.</hi>

                              <p>And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> given not to the Lord, nor in reſpect of him, but onely upon requeſt for the common good of the foreſaid <hi>Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> in regard of their particular members.</p>
                              <p>And eſpecially in the <hi>third</hi> place, That it might ſerv them for a permanent law and conſtitution, whereby the government of
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:99708:345"/>
the ſaid City, ſhould thenceforward be regulated, and as neer as was feaſible <hi>equalized</hi> as well in reſpect of divers freedoms and prerogatives, as in regard of of the form of Government with the <hi>old free and privileged Cities</hi> of the <hi>Earldom.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The truth of which threefold qualification, lying ſo evidently plain throughout the whole text and diſpoſition of the oft-ſaid Charter, that none of any ſound Judgment can at firſt view, remain ignorant thereof, much leſs contradict the ſame.</p>
                              <p>The rather for that his Excellencie, as well in the Proêm and beginning as the upſhot of all, very plainly avoweth, that hee doth it in the Name and behalf of his Majeſtie, <hi>v z</hi> as <hi>Earl</hi> of the Land, and in that Qualitie beeing his <hi>Stadtholder</hi> within this Province.</p>
                              <p>Without making any mention of the Right and qualitie which the foreſaid King was then inveſted with in regard of theſe places, beeing their particular <hi>Fief-Lord.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>As likewiſe that Qualitie could then not well have been made uſe of, not onely by his foreſaid Excellencie without ſpecial Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Commiſsion from the King, as Lord, wherewith it is known hee was not inſtructed then; but alſo much leſs by the ſaid King himſelf, in regard that in the foreſaid qualitie and ſimply conſidered as Vaſſals of the Earldom, hee was well known to want the Qualification of any ſuch Privileges, which apperteined onely to the Prince or States of the Land, or to ſuch as by them are lawfully and ſolemnly commiſsioned and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torized thereunto.</p>
                              <p>The like <hi>power</hi> and <hi>autoritie</hi> was never committed to the <hi>Lords of Fluſhing</hi> and <hi>Veer,</hi> in their Letters of <hi>inveſtiture,</hi> which readily appear's in the peruſing of them.</p>
                              <p>Therefore wee ſee likewiſe, that in diverſ other Privileges and Elections, wherewith it pleaſed <hi>Prince William</hi> of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie memorie in thoſe times to gratifie diverſ other Cities alſo, both in this and ſom neighboring Provinces, his Excellencie every where made uſe of the Name and Title of <hi>Stadtholder,</hi> and as exerciſing the function of the <hi>Supreme Autoritie.</hi>

                              <p>Whereunto is very appliable, that his ſaid Excellencie in the

                              <p>Therefore, and clearly do ſhew, that the ſaid <hi>prerogatives</hi> were granted without any regard had to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and onely in the behalf and to the advantage of the foreſaid <hi>Cities,</hi> and their <hi>common inhabitants,</hi> by reaſon of their particular and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt,</hi> it is ſaid in expreſs terms, both in the Preface and concluſion of the ſame, that they are granted upon the <hi>humble petition</hi> of the <hi>Burgo-maſters and Governors,</hi> and in the none and behalf of the ſaid Cities and their Governors to com, together with the common Porteers and inhabitants thereof.</p>
                              <p>And to what end? namely, for the furthering of <hi>good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> welfare and proſperitie among them, and that they may bee <hi>relieved from under the great and heavie burthens</hi> which were fallen upon them, partly by reaſon of the neceſſarie <hi>Sea-Works,</hi> and great arrears of Rents, and partly becauſ of the warrs against <hi>Duke d' Alva</hi> and his adherents, together with regard had to their good endeavors and faithful ſervices per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them in that War.</p>

Which ought to bee of ſo much the more validitie, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection is made upon the <hi>direction intention and aim,</hi> Prince <hi>William</hi> of happie memorie had in granting of the ſaid <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> to the Cities aforeſaid, namely, to compoſe and <hi>frame the Government</hi> and civil admin ſtration thereof, as neer as might bee, <hi>equal</hi> to the other <hi>Cities</hi> of the <hi>Earldom,</hi> as among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear's ungainſayably by the enſuing Arguments.</p>
                              <p>And <hi>Firſt</hi> by this, that there having been of old a <hi>Court</hi> in the foreſaid Cities, ſerving originally to the direction and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of juſtice, and the ſame in are likewiſe before the warr, by contract made between the Lords and the ſaid Cities, for ſake of their Government; now by virtue of the expreſs text of the foreſaid privileges, there is ſet up and inſtituted there reſpectively a formal <hi>Court of Common-Council</hi> or Citie-Council.</p>
                              <p>It beeing well known that (as on the one ſide the Court of juſtice was formerly ſet up and emploied by order of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Lords, according to their letters of inveſtiture, ſo on the other ſide) the foreſaid <hi>Erection of the Citie-Council</hi> there could not bee effected otherwiſe, then with expreſs conſent, and by the immediate <hi>Autoritie of the Earldom.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>That ſame power beeing one of the moſt eminent and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Roialties, which belong's to the Princes or States of the land here.</p>
                              <p>As therefore wee ſee likewiſe, that both in theſe Neighboring-Provinces, not onely the <hi>Citie Councils</hi> themſelvs, could not bee erected without the <hi>ſpecial Grant</hi> from the <hi>Earldom;</hi> but likewiſe not the <hi>Leaſt amendment, alteration</hi> or <hi>ampliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> thereof could bee made without the like <hi>Grant,</hi> and with Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Conſent of all the <hi>Members,</hi> after the contents of them were firſt very ripely and ſeriouſly examined.</p>
                              <p>And that which is more, the remonſtrances to this end, made by divers Cities, are uſed to bee preſented onely by the Burgo-Masters and Common-Council apart, with preterition of the <hi>Counſellors,</hi> Who in many places in this countrie, have nothing to do with the Government, but are onely employed about the exerciſe and administration of juſtice.</p>
                              <p>

As in very truth alſo, there hath ever, time out of minde, been a ſpecial difference in the Cities of this Province betwixt theſe <hi>two ſorts of employments;</hi> and the Common-Councils were originally introduced there (diſtinguiſhed from juſtice) onely for the <hi>keeping of the rights and Privileges of the Cities</hi> whereunto likewiſe they are particularly ſworn; and, as by the Lords the States it was very well ſaid, in the year <hi>1587<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                                 </hi> to whom appertain's the power, not onely to reſolv but alſo to diſpoſe of all things, concerning the ſtate of the Countrie and the Cities.</p>
                              <p>Which is the reaſon likewiſe, Why the Burgo maſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of theſe Cities are wont and bound, in all buſineſses of importance, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the good opinion of the foreſaid Common Councils, as whereby the Cities and Commonalties, for matter of civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are properly repreſented.</p>
                              <p>And for the ſame reaſons alſo is the Election of the ſaid Common-Council, in most Cities both of this and Neighboring-Provinces, left by <hi>Priveleges</hi> from the Earls or the State there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, unto the immediate diſpoſition of the Cities themſelvs, even to the leaſt incluſively.</p>

                              <p>In the Citie of <hi>Goes,</hi> there are indeed no <hi>Counſellors</hi> or <hi>Common Council</hi> at all, nor in the Citie of <hi>Tolen</hi> neither; the whole <hi>Government</hi> conſiſting there both for <hi>Policie</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> in the <hi>Burgomaſters</hi> and <hi>Schepens.</hi>

                              <p>Whence followeth anſwerably, that the Poſitions and Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Lord of the Commiſsioned Council in the <hi>84. 85. 86.</hi> and <hi>87.</hi> Articles of their Conſiderations, touching the <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>Election of Magiſtrates,</hi> and the perſons from among whom the ſame was made of old, and is now made at preſent, are <hi>ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> altogether, and cannot ſerv to their purpoſe and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                              <p>But on the contrarie, thoſe very Articles include a <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of the <hi>Lord Marquiſs</hi> in that, which they meant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of, <hi>That</hi> namely the <hi>chooſing of the Magiſtrates,</hi>

                                 <hi>hath of old belonged and ſo continueth to this daie to the Lords of</hi> Fluſhing and Veer.</p>
                              <p>As likewiſe the ſame <hi>Lords</hi> electing of <hi>Burgomaſters</hi> and <hi>Schepens</hi> can bee ſhewed and verified by the <hi>Regiſters</hi> of the ſaid cities for the ſpace of about <hi>two hundred years.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>It would withal make a very ſtrange conſtruction if one ſhould argue according to <hi>84</hi> article of the conſideration of the commiſsioned Council, That the Prince, for in the matter of Nomination, and election of the Magiſtrates, to make an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie with the cities of the Earldom, by the ſaid Privelege, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving the Lords of <hi>Fluſhing</hi> and <hi>Veer</hi> of the <hi>free Election,</hi> which to that time hee had made <hi>ex arbitrio,</hi> without Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and preſcribing an Order, according to which the Election to bee made, out of the precedent Nomination, now as to this, by that Order, the <hi>Election it ſelf</hi> ſhould bee taken away from the <hi>Lord.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Moreover it turn's likewiſe for the advantage of his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, that it beeing preſuppoſed, even according to the ſence of the Commiſsioned Council themſelvs, that Prince <hi>William</hi> his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, aim and intention had been to <hi>equalize</hi> the two Vaſſal-cities with the cities of the <hi>Earldom;</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>There is no probabilitie at all that the ſaid Prince ſhould have been minded to introduce ſuch a form of Government into the ſaid two Cities; as was not known in <hi>any</hi> of the <hi>Cities</hi> of the <hi>Earldom;</hi> as namely, whereby the <hi>Schepens</hi> ſhould bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the cogniſance and deliberations of matters of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as is deduced above.</p>
                              <p>Nay, on the contrarie it appear's plainly, that this was not the leaſt part of his intention or meaning by the very text of the ſaid great <hi>Charter</hi> in ſeveral Articles, where mention beeing made of the Government of the Cities, all the diſpoſition is put <hi>conjunctim,</hi> to the <hi>Burgomaſters, Counſellors</hi> and <hi>Senators,</hi> and no where to the <hi>Senators</hi> alone.</p>
                              <p>As alſo it cannot ſo much as bee conceived, that the Prince ſhould in that conjuncture of time have been willing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſuch a notable <hi>alteration,</hi> as to withdraw the cogniſance
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:99708:361"/>
and deliberation of <hi>Policie,</hi> whereof depend all the important affairs of the State, from the <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>antient Magiſtrate,</hi> and againſt the uſual order of Government obſerved in all the Cities of <hi>Zeland,</hi> to reduce and confine the ſame onely to the <hi>new Senators.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>As for the contents of Artic. <hi>88</hi> of the foreſaid Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it ſhall ſerv for replie thereunto to ſaie, that a <hi>perverted fence</hi> is put upon the contents of the <hi>Charter</hi> there, whenas the ſaid Article averr's, that the Election to bee made out of the nominated perſons, as well of <hi>Burgomaſters</hi> as <hi>Schepers,</hi> ſhould bee left to his <hi>Roial Majeſtie</hi> as <hi>Earl of Zeland,</hi> beeing that the qualitie of the <hi>Lord</hi> is not expreſſed therewithal, nor the Deſignation of his Majeſtie any where in all the Charter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by that Name.</p>
                              <p>Whereas the contrarie hereof is unanſwerably manifeſt by ſundrie Articles of the foreſaid Charter; as for Example in that of <hi>Fluſhing.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Artic. <hi>2.</hi> That his <hi>Majeſtie</hi> ſhall appoint a <hi>Bayliff</hi> for to keep his <hi>Majeſtie's</hi> and the <hi>Citie's Rights.</hi> Artic. <hi>7.</hi> that the <hi>Burgomaſters, Schepers</hi> and <hi>Senate</hi> ſhall create the Officers requiſite for the good of the Citie, and maintenance of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the <hi>King's Majeſtie's</hi> autoritie and domains remaining ſtill entire; and ſo likewiſe in the <hi>24</hi> and <hi>34</hi> Articles of the <hi>Charter</hi> of the Citie of <hi>Veer,</hi> That the Fiſhermen ſhall not bee allowed to ſell their fiſh upon the ſtream, but bring the ſame for rebate into the foreſaid Citie, and pay there the dues of the Clark-office belonging to his Majeſtie.</p>
                              <p>All which Articles have relation to the <hi>Domainial Rights</hi> belonging to his Majeſtie there, not as <hi>Earl of Zeland,</hi> but as <hi>Lord</hi> of thoſe two <hi>Cities.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>For further verification whereof doth ſerv, that the King having by a <hi>Decree</hi> of the great <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Mechelen,</hi> in the year <hi>1563,</hi> remained <hi>Buyer</hi> of the Cities of <hi>Fluſhing</hi> and <hi>Veer,</hi> with the Charges lying upon them;</p>
                              <p>Though his Majeſtie did not ſatisfie the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nevertheleſs hee carried himſelf as the <hi>Buier</hi> and <hi>Proprietarie</hi> of the ſaid
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:99708:361"/>
Cities and the <hi>Domainial Rights</hi> thereof.</p>
                              <p>Which is evidently proved thereby, that the conditions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cautions, whereupon the <hi>Marquiſate</hi> with the foreſaid Cities were ſold to his Majeſtie in the year aforeſaid by the ſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, do expreſsly import,</p>
                              <p>That the prerogative of repreſenting all the <hi>Nobles</hi> of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the <hi>ſecond State</hi> of the Countrie aforeſaid, from all times belonging to Lord of <hi>Veer,</hi> the ſame <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Prerogative,</hi> ſhould likewiſe remaine to the <hi>Buyer.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>In purſuance whereof his Majeſtie alſo gave Commiſſion, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii 21<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1568</hi> to the Lord <hi>Adolph of Burgoigne,</hi> to take ſpecial heed in the King's behalf, of the ſaid place of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier Noble,</hi> and that in terms as followeth.</p>
                              <p>Whereas the Lord <hi>Maximilian of Burgoin,</hi> in his life time <hi>Marquiſs of Veer,</hi> uſed as <hi>Premier Noble</hi> of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and Countie of <hi>Zeland,</hi> by reaſon of his Marquiſate of <hi>Veer</hi> and the Citie of <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> to com and appear in perſon, or by his Plenipotentiaries into all the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Aſſemblies of the General States of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and that the foreſaid Cities are devolved of late to Us by purchaſe, wee found good therefore to ordein and commiſsionate a certain qualified perſon, in our Name to act in that behalf <hi>as Lord</hi> of theſe Cities, ſo as the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie and opportunitie of times ſhall require; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to help and further the good weal and profit of the ſaid Cities, in the ſame manner as the fore-named late Marquiſs of <hi>Veer</hi> was wont to do in his life time, &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>By the deduction of which inſtance there fall's to ground the contents of the <hi>89, 90</hi> and <hi>91</hi> Articles of the oft-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Conſiderations; there beeing otherwiſe alſo no queſtion here about gratifying the Marquiſs above the advantages and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives mentioned in the Letters of Inveſtiture with any other extraordinarie ones.</p>
                              <p>

But whether the Sovereign Lord may diſpoſſeſs the <hi>Lord Marquiſs</hi> of his Domainial Rights.</p>
                              <p>That which the Commiſsioned Council ſomwhat doubtfully ſeem to infer in the Artic. <hi>92</hi> and <hi>93,</hi> and afterwards poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſert, Artic. <hi>112,</hi> That hitherto the Princes of <hi>Orange</hi> had made no Election of the Magiſtrates in the ſaid Cities as Lords of the places, but onely as <hi>Stadholders of the Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and that through their deceaſ now the ſaid Election ſhould bee devolved again into the boſom of the <hi>Earl.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The ſame is manifeſtly a wrong concluſion, grounded upon untrue premiſes, ſince the contrarie thereof can bee fully proved out of the Letters of Nomination, which from the time when the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Orange</hi> purchaſed the Marquiſate in the year <hi>1581,</hi> the Magiſtrates of the foreſaid Cities have yearly writen to their Highneſſes for the making of the Election, which Letters can bee produced <hi>in originali,</hi> ſhewing,</p>
                              <p>That their Highneſſes have made the ſaid Election, not as <hi>Stadholders,</hi> but as <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Marquiſes</hi> of the ſaid Cities. Whence the Lords of the Commiſsioned Council may bee deſired to conſider the reaſons which their Nob.

                              <p>As likewiſe the contents of Artic. <hi>95</hi> namely, That the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Command in all politick affairs ſhould peculiarly bee committed to the office of the <hi>Burgomaſters,</hi> which above is proved not to agree with the <hi>Government of any Citie</hi> in <hi>Zeland,</hi> beeing that the affairs of policie or Government in the ſaid Cities are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the <hi>Buhgomaſters, Counſellors</hi> and <hi>Senators,</hi> and not as in <hi>Holland,</hi> to <hi>Burgomaſters</hi> and <hi>Senators,</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Councils,</hi> with ſecluſion of the <hi>Counſellors.</hi>

                              <p>That it is true indeed, that the Feodotarie Letters contein no more now then the original firſt Letter of Ceſsion, Erection and Inveſtiture of the years <hi>1477,</hi> and <hi>1555</hi> above-mentioned; as alſo

                              <p>True it is, that as the <hi>97</hi> Article hinteth the <hi>Bailiff</hi> in the name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> the <hi>Burgomaſters, Schepens</hi> and <hi>Raedens</hi> are they to whom <hi>conjunctim</hi> the rule and government of theſe Cities (beeing made <hi>integrating Members of the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie)</hi> ſtand's committed by the foreſaid Grant or Charter of the year <hi>1574.</hi>

                              <p>And that the ſame which is granted to the Cities in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, deriveth from the <hi>Earl.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But as for the <hi>ſhare</hi> or <hi>autoritie of the Lord Marquiſs,</hi> in the preſent or former <hi>Government</hi> of the foreſaid two Cities, and the incompatibilitie of one and the ſame perſon or bodie Collegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, beeing <hi>Vaſſal</hi> on the one ſide, and obliged to make <hi>oath</hi> and do <hi>homage,</hi> and on the other ſide to bee an <hi>integrant Member</hi> of the ſame <hi>Sovereigntie,</hi> and to receiv <hi>oath,</hi> whereof is ſpoken by the Commiſsioned Council in the <hi>98</hi> and <hi>99</hi> Articles of their Conſiderations; together with what is deduced to that purpoſe in purſuance thereof, to the end of the Conſiderations aforeſaid.</p>
                              <p>To that it is replied in his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> behalf, That from that there can bee nothing at all inferred for the impairing or taking away his High<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Right, touching the Election of the Magiſtrate's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                              <p>

                              <p>So alſo it is quite another thing, the <hi>Right of Electing the perſons of the Magiſtrate,</hi> and the <hi>Right, function, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie</hi> belonging to the <hi>perſons of elected Magiſtrates,</hi> whether

                              <p>The Lord Marquis, having by his lawfully acquired Right from the Earl, elected the Magiſtrates perſons.</p>
                              <p>The functions and employments requiſite for the Magiſtracie, do belong to thoſe Perſons, <hi>co ipſo,</hi> that they are elected to the Magiſtracie.</p>

                              <p>All theſe reſpective Functions, Employments and Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions beeing quite different and ſevered from the <hi>Right</hi> of elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Magiſtrates perſons,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Marquis.</hi>
                              </p>

                  <p>This <hi>Counter-Remonſtrance,</hi> beeing preſented at the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie of the States of <hi>Zeland, Novemb.</hi> 9. The <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor Penſionarie</hi> of the Countrie, propounded next daie after, whether it would not bee fitting and expedient to proceed therein with all due Circumſpection and equitie, that the Lords of the Council ſhould ripely examin the ſame, and ſend their Conſiderations to the Members, as a point of intimation. Hereupon it was ſaid by the Lords of <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> that having heard the ſaid <hi>Counter-Remonſtrance,</hi> both by word of mouth and lecture made before them, they had not obſerved the leaſt therein; that overthrew any thing of the former advice given, but on the contrarie, were much more confirmed thereby, fully to embrace the ſame, without any further ſcrupling, and that the Lords of <hi>Fluſhing</hi> and <hi>Veer,</hi> ought to draw up and bring in their reſpective <hi>Reiglements,</hi> in conformitie thereof; nevertheleſs, to ſhew how readie they are to proceed therein with leiſurable prudence, they found good, that the ſaid <hi>Counter-Remonſtrance,</hi> ſhould bee put into the hands of the Lords of the Commiſsioned Council, who ſhould ripely examin the ſame, and within a few daies make their Report and communicate their advice to the
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:99708:364"/>
Lords the <hi>States,</hi> by word of mouth, conſidering eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the great Privilege granted to the Lords of <hi>Fluſhing</hi> in the year 1574. by <hi>Prince William,</hi> together with the copies of the <hi>Letters of Inveſtiture</hi> and <hi>Sale,</hi> relating to the ſaid Cities; That thereupon a final Reſolution may bee taken in this matter, ſuch as ſhould bee found requiſite in reaſon and equitie, to which advice <hi>Zirick-zee, Goes</hi> and <hi>Tholen</hi> conformed themſelvs, <hi>Fluſhing</hi> and <hi>Veer</hi> deſired a copie of the ſaid <hi>Counter-Remonſtrance,</hi> to bring in their Advice with the ſooneſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Novemb. 15. report beeing made by the <hi>Counſellor Penſionarie</hi> of the Land, That the reſpective Members having heard the daie before, the further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of the Lords of the Council, ſerving to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the reaſons of the <hi>Counter-Remonſtrance</hi> made in the behalf of the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> touching the <hi>Right of the Earldom, and the Lord of Fluſhing and Veer,</hi> reſpectively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, They were deſired, this daie to adviſe further upon it; The four fore-ſitting Members, unanimouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that in the Counter-Remonſtrance there were no reaſons alleged, which could any waies move them to change the former advice; but on the contrarie, they <hi>were rather more encouraged therein</hi> by the lecture thereof, and that ſo much the rather now, ſince they daie before the heard the further deduction of the Council, by word of mouth, more clearly yet, juſtifying the grounds and poſitions of their advice, and confuting the allegations of the Counter-Remonſtrance: That therefore the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs beeing now ſufficiently and fully verified, the ſame was readily fitted for to bee determined, and that the Penſionarie of the Land ought to <hi>put it in form</hi> without any longer delaie.</p>
                  <p>The Lords of <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> judging this to bee a point of great weight and Conſideration, and which ſhould not bee entered into, without due ſearch and ripe deliberation, ſo as neither on the one nor the other ſide, any might
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:99708:364"/>
bee prejudiced; they deſired, that what the daie before was declared by word of <hi>mouth,</hi> might bee brought to <hi>paper</hi> and <hi>coppies</hi> given thereof unto the <hi>Members,</hi> that ſo the <hi>Common Councils</hi> might bee made acquainted with, and examine the ſame, and orderly with all circumſpection take further advice about it; to which Vote the Lords of <hi>Veer</hi> conformed themſelvs, relating therewithal, that the Counſellor <hi>Beaumont,</hi> having preſented himſelf to their Aſſemblie in the behalf of the <hi>Princeſs of Orange,</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired them to direct their advice accordingly; as alſo the Penſionarie of the land declared, that the ſaid <hi>Beaumont</hi> had in the ſame Name deſired, that a <hi>Copie</hi> of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Verbal Advice,</hi> might bee brought to the hands of the <hi>Ladies</hi> aforeſaid, before any further proceeding in and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding of ſo weightie a point; which advices beeing heard and the reſpectiue Members a ſecond time deſired, to conſider the the Deſire of <hi>Fluſhing</hi> and <hi>Veer</hi> yet further, the <hi>four fore-ſitting Members</hi> perſiſted, That the buſineſs beeing fully diſcuſſed now, prooved and juſtified, there ought to bee uſed no further delaie, and that the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionarie was bound to conclude, though otherwiſe they could bee content, that <hi>Copie</hi> of the foreſaid <hi>Verbal Advice</hi> ſhould bee given to the reſpective <hi>Members,</hi> to ſerv them ſooner or later, for the clearer information of all the paſſages and tranſactions in this buſineſs. The Lords of <hi>Fluſhing</hi> and <hi>Veer</hi> judging it ſtrange, that <hi>Copie of the Verbal Advice</hi> ſhould bee yielded, and yet the <hi>concluſion</hi> not delai'd, they inſiſted again on their former deſire, and withal that beſide the ſaid copie of the <hi>Verbal advice,</hi> they might have a <hi>view of the Letters of Sale and Inveſtiture,</hi> that ſo much the better and with full knowledg of the cauſ, they might frame their advice: upon which deſires no further concluſions beeing taken, the Penſionarie of the land deſired the Lords of <hi>Fluſhing</hi> and <hi>Veer,</hi> to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to their Principals, of the advices and Conſiderations advanced by the other <hi>Members,</hi> that next daie they
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:99708:365"/>
might declare themſelvs in the principal matter.</p>
                  <p>Two daies after the Lords of <hi>Fluſhing</hi> and <hi>Veer</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, were again deſired to declare themſelvs upon the ſeventh point of the <hi>Writ,</hi> touching the <hi>Right of the Earldom on the one ſide, and the Lords of</hi> Fluſhing <hi>and</hi> Veer, <hi>reſpectively, one the other;</hi> but they perſiſted in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer advices, that firſt they might have Copie of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal Advice, againſt the Counter-Remonſtrance made in behalf of the <hi>Prince of Orange;</hi> as likewiſe of the <hi>Letters of Sale</hi> (or Tranſport) <hi>and Inveſtiture;</hi> upon which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſire the <hi>four fore-ſitting Members</hi> beeing the ſecond time ſollicited by the Penſionarie of the land, to adviſe, They declared, <hi>That the buſineſs having its accompliſhment of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation,</hi> and <hi>lying ſo clear before them, as could not bee gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid by any reaſon, The Concluſion ought to bee taken without any further delaie;</hi> upon which the Penſionarie of the land, producing and reading a certain <hi>Memorandum</hi> delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, in behalf of their High<hi rend="sup">ſs</hi> the <hi>Princeſſes of Orange;</hi> after the reading thereof hee propounded, whether the Members might not finde good for to proceed in this weightie affair with all <hi>complementarie civilitie and diſcreet leiſurableneſs,</hi> to communicate <hi>copie</hi> of what was <hi>Verbally</hi> brought in againſt the <hi>Counter-Remonſtrance,</hi> unto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioner of their High<hi rend="sup">ſs</hi>, as <hi>Guardians</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange;</hi> as likewiſe to the Lords of <hi>Fluſhing</hi> and <hi>Veer</hi> copie of the deſired pieces, that in convenient time they might produce what they ſhall have to ſaie to it: and to the end, that there may no ground bee laid of any prejudice, that the <hi>Election</hi> of the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and all other matters in <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Policie,</hi> might the while remain <hi>in ſtatu;</hi> whereupon the <hi>queſtion</hi> beeing put the ſecond time; The <hi>four fore-ſitting Members</hi> perſiſted in their former <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> and the Penſioner of the land was urged again to proceed to the Concluſion, <hi>Fluſhing</hi> and <hi>Veer</hi> perſiſting in their Deſires; till upon reiterated putting the matter to the queſtion, and deliberations paſt upon the ſame, it
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:99708:365"/>
was found good and reſolved, <hi>to embrace and in all parts to accept of the Advice exhibited by the Lords of the Commiſsioned Council, touching the Right belonging to the Earldom on the one ſide, and to the Lord of</hi> Fluſhing <hi>and</hi> Veer <hi>reſpectively, on the other, in reſpect of their Magistracie and Civil Government;</hi> the Lords of <hi>Fluſhing</hi> and <hi>Veer</hi> beeing deſired to draw up and bring in their reſpective <hi>Reiglements,</hi> for to bee paſt and regiſtred, in conformitie of the <hi>Reſolutions</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 23. and <hi>May</hi> 1. laſt paſt; the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil beeing autoriſed, finding the ſame agreeing with the foreſaid advice, to paſs and regiſter the ſame together with other, both there by the Secretaries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Accounts. At which concluſion this Item was entered, <hi>The Deputies of the Fluſhing and Veer reſpectively, have by Order of their Principals cauſed to bee entered, That they reſerved them the Libertie, to bring in touching this matter here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after what they ſhall finde requiſite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Holland,</hi> as was intimated before, the Cities had alreadie, immediately after <hi>Prince Williams</hi> departure, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to themſelvs the <hi>ſelf-chooſing</hi> of their <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> by grant of the States of the Province as the <hi>Soveraign.</hi>

                  <p>In <hi>Gelderland</hi> the Citie of <hi>Nimighen</hi> undertook the like of her own accord, on New-years daie the 1 of <hi>Januar.</hi> 1651. as a matter of old, and rights belonging to them. The Citie of <hi>Tiel</hi> obtained it, during the <hi>Great Aſſemblie</hi> from the States of <hi>Gelderland</hi> by waie of <hi>Grant:</hi> all the reſt of the Cities in <hi>Gelderland</hi> were of old in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion of making their <hi>own Magiſtrates,</hi> as likewiſe all the Cities great and ſmall in <hi>Over-Yſſel</hi> and <hi>Groninghen.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And after mutual communication and mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it was unanimouſly agreed, That the Right of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing Burgomaſters and Senators in the Common Council, and Counſellors of the Citie of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> was and for ever ſhould remain belonging to the Common Council onely; and that it ſhould bee decreed as an <hi>unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Reſolution</hi> and <hi>everlaſting Law,</hi> that the ſaid <hi>Right</hi> ſhal <hi>never bee yielded up, neither whole or in part, on no condition, and in no manner whatſoever, to any other.</hi> Saturdaie <hi>Maie</hi> 24 the Common Council beeing met again in competent num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, there was after diverſ propoſitions made, and ripe deliberations uſed, unanimouſly found good and agreed this following form and courſ of Nomination and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Senators in the Common Council.</p>
