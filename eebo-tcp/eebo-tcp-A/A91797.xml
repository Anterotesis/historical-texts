            <title>Some briefe considerations on Doctor Featley his book, intituled, The dipper dipt, wherein in some measure is discovered his many great and false accusations of divers persons, commonly called Anabaptists, with an answer to them, and some brief reasons of their practice.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and ſecretly wounds them with his malignant
pen, in his Epiſtle to his friend, hee complains of his corporall
thraldome, and that his preſſures are unſufferable, his perſon
confined, his eſtate ſequeſtred, his loſſes unvaluable, his books
and both his pulpits taken from him, that his friends &amp; himſelf
ſought earneſtly, but could not obtain that liberty which <hi>Paul</hi> injoyed when
he was in priſon in <hi>Rome,</hi> to preach the Goſpel to his fellow-priſoners: obſerve,
what doth he not ſay, that the <hi>Parliament</hi> are hinderers of the preaching of the
Goſpel of Chriſt? What, are they worſer then Heathen Emperours and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates?
can they not be prevailed with, to yeeld that the Goſpel ſhould be
preached to priſoners? &amp;c. O heavie charge! It ſeems he hath a great mind to
preach the Goſpel, but the honourable <hi>Parliament</hi> have had cauſe enough to fear
that he would ſo mixe it with the leaven of malignancy till hee had ſo ſowred
it, that all that ſhould taſte of it, were in danger to be poyſoned with it; and
ſo they did juſtly, in hindring him from preaching ſuch a Goſpel as this is:
and in <hi>pag.</hi> 32. the government of Archbiſhops, &amp;c. is not Antichriſtian, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

that hold ſo: and in <hi>p.</hi> 214, 215, 216. he ſaith, this kind of ſacriledge we
ſpeak of, whereby Churches and Churchmen are defrauded of their due, is no
better nor worſe then robbing God, and pronounceth a curſe upon a curſe to
them; what doth he leſſe, then charge the <hi>Parliament</hi> with ſacriledge? what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
he deſerves, I leave it to them whom it concerns: Alſo he ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 70.
(ſpeaking of the <hi>Separatiſts</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi>) that the Magiſtrate, who, though
by preſent connivence ſeems to give them line, yet no doubt it is, that they
may the more intangle themſelves, and more eaſily be caught; as if the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>

what is amiſſe, themſelves conſidering that many of the <hi>Separation</hi> and
<hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> are well known to be honeſt and conſcionable men, both towards
God and man? and concerning the Doctor, when he reckoneth up the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

               <head>Sect. II. Wherein it appears that the Doctor is guilty of greater errors, then to be
dipped in the river.</head>
               <p>DOctor <hi>Featley</hi> holds theſe errors, <hi>viz.</hi> that Archbiſhops, &amp;c. are not Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian,
<hi>p.</hi> 32. and that the Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are
not Idolatrous nor Antichriſtian, <hi>p.</hi> 32. that Baptiſme is a means of ſalvation,
and <hi>p.</hi> 40, 41, 50. that it is the remedy of originall ſin, <hi>p.</hi> 41. that regeneration
by water, is to take away the filth of ſin; <hi>p.</hi> 41. that children of faithfull pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
receive ſome meaſure of grace in their infancie; <hi>p.</hi> 59. that there is no
command or example, that women took the Sacrament, that the river is defiled
by dipping a man or woman into it; he ſaith, baptizing of Infants began in the
Apoſtles dayes, <hi>p.</hi> 19. and yet no man can name the time when it began, <hi>p.</hi> 52, 53,
66. (which is ſo high a contradiction, as no illiterate man can reach it) alſo he
ſaith, that thoſe children which cannot be taught, may be made Diſciples by
their parents, <hi>p.</hi> 39. or God fathers, <hi>p.</hi> 57. and that children make a profeſſion
of their faith and repentance at their baptiſme by theſe ſureties, <hi>p.</hi> 76. might he
not as truly ſay, that the faith of their parents or godfathers is given to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and ſo it's theirs? illiterate men muſt of neceſſity refer theſe things to the
School-men, as <hi>Tho. Aquinas,</hi> &amp;c. Alſo he ſaith, that Baptiſme is the entrance
into the Church, <hi>p.</hi> 23, 46. 63. and hee that is caſt out of the Church, upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
muſt be received in again, <hi>p.</hi> 29. then it ſeems he muſt be re-baptized,
elſe how ſhall he get in if it be the entrance? ſo by the Doctors doctrine he holds
re-baptizing, which we deny, and ſo he is an <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> and not we: alſo the
Doctor ſaith, that Chriſt is the Son of God, not only in reſpect of his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
generation, but alſo in reſpect of his eternall generation, <hi>p.</hi> 3. and that the
Spirit is ſaid to proceed from the Father, becauſe he proceeds from the Father
originally; and that the Spirit hath a dependence from both, <hi>pag.</hi> 23. But if
Chriſt, as he was God had a beginning, he could not be God if he had no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
How can Chriſt, as he is God, be the Son of God in reſpect of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
generation any more then the Father is his Son by eternall generation?
Secondly, if the Spirit of God be God, (as he is) equall with the Father and
the Son, all three infinite, without beginning, each having the whole divine
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:123324:3"/>
eſſence, and yet there is but one eſſence: how can the Spirit proceed from the
Father originally, any more then the Father from the Spirit? and how can the
Spirit of God have any more dependance upon the Father and the Sonne, then
they have upon him, ſeeing whatſoever is infinite, can have no dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any thing? Therefore the Doctors words contain in them the nature of
blaſphemy; and to define how one can be three, and three but one, &amp; alwayes ſo
remain, is above the reach of any man: I may ſay to him, as <hi>Mat. 7. 3. Luk.</hi> 6. 41, 42</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="section">
               <head>Sect. 3. Wherein is contained Doctor <hi>Featley</hi> his large conſcience in laying ſo many
and falſe accuſations and wicked errors, which he (like a mad man) ſhoots
deſperately againſt the Anabaptiſts (as he calls them) to wound their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they might appeare more vile in the eyes of the ignorant, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
their deſtruction.</head>
               <p>THe Doctor chargeth the Anabaptiſts in the Title page of his booke, with
high attempts againſt the State, which I confeſſe were an impiety inſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and all that are guilty of this charge, ought to die for it: But in no
place of his book he doth ſo much as offer to prove the leaſt part of this charge
againſt any one of this Kingdome, or the next to it; hee ſpeakes as if two or
three in Germany whom he pleaſeth to call Anabaptiſts, which he ſaith were
guilty of this ſinne: But what is that to us if they be guilty of theſe &amp; the like
wickedneſſes? ſhould not the Doctor have done better to have written his book
in their language (if he be not illiterate in it) and ſent it into thoſe parts of the
world as a means to reforme them? As for our parts, we can juſtly plead, <hi>Not
guilty,</hi> and challenge all in the world to prove it againſt us if they can. If the
Doctors meaning be that we are guilty of rebellion, becauſe we ſide with the
Parliament againſt thoſe that goe about to deſtroy the Kingdome: Wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
we doe ſo to preſerve the State, and this is not againſt the State. But the
Doctor ſaith, that we are a cruell and bloody Sect, by imbroyling Kingdomes
in warres, and by raiſing perſecutions againſt Gods ſervants, page 210. <hi>Anſw.</hi>
It is well knowne that we were not the cauſers of theſe warres, and our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
are, that God would end them, and ſettle truth and peace in all places in
the world. And it is well known, we deſire no man might be forced againſt his
judgement and conſcience in any way of worſhipping of God; no not to the
true worſhip, but rather to pray to God to open their eyes, and wait with long
patience till God perſwade them; and if they never ſee the light to walke in it,
to leave all to God. And if ſo, which way doth this tend to perſecution of
the Saints, let all judge. But he ſaith, wee are a lying and blaſphemous Sect,
yet he alledges not one proof to prove us ſo, and wee are content that your
bookes with ours may be examined, to ſee which is the lying and blaſpheming
Sect. Alſo he accuſeth the Anabaptiſts to be an impure and carnall Sect, <hi>p.</hi> 207.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:123324:4"/>
yet he brings not any one inſtance of any one act of uncleanneſſe of any one
Anabaptiſt in all England. And ſeeing hee could not produce any witneſſe of
ſuch a thing here, he for proof ſteps to Rome to ſearch the Popes, and names
three of them, <hi>Sergius, Gregory,</hi> and <hi>Leo,</hi> and that the Pope tolerated Stewes,
(he might as well have ſaid, a Prieſthood with holy Orders.) But the Doctor
is not ignorant that theſe Popes were not Anabaptiſts: but ſuppoſe they had,
is this a good reaſoning to ſay the Churches of Chriſt in the Apoſtles dayes,
were a filthy unclean Sect, and for proof name 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. that one was guilty
of fornication, yea one who had his fathers wife: And to ſay the Prieſthood
of <hi>England</hi> are a filthy and unclean Sect, and for proof alledge what the Prieſts
of <hi>England</hi> have been guilty of, neer our doores, as one <hi>John Wilſon,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
buggery with fifteen men. See the firſt <hi>Century</hi> of ſcandalous Miniſters,
<hi>p.</hi> 1. &amp;c. And, Doctor <hi>Featley,</hi> if you pleaſe to joyne iſſue with us, we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
our ſelves to this Kingdom, whether your Sect of Prieſts, or us be moſt guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of uncleanneſſe, and upon that ſide it falls by the cleareſt proofe, ſhall with
my conſent, be chronicled for the filthy and unclean Sect. So he makes a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
noyſe of the fearfull judgements of God that befell the Ringleaders of this
Sect, and of their deaths; and to prove this, he names <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer, who
was ſtruck with blindneſſe, <hi>p.</hi> 218. but hee was not an Anabaptiſt, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the Apoſtles, and the truth they profeſſed, and they practiſed dipping.
So that he is recorded for an example for others, that they oppoſe not Chriſts
ſervants, and the truth they profeſſe, leſt God meet with them alſo in like
manner; but he names 200 and odde were put to death, who were, as he ſaith,
Anabaptiſts. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This is no more then the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 7.
<hi>They ſhall make warre with the Saints and overcome them.</hi> He ſaith in <hi>Vienna</hi> ſome
Anabaptiſts were tied together with ropes and drowned, two were
burned beyond <hi>Southwarke,</hi> and a little after five Dutch Anabaptiſts
were burned in <hi>Smithfield, pag.</hi> 55. It rejoyceth us that men ſuffer for any truth;
behold how he honoureth thoſe men that ſuffered: But he ſaith, they dip one
another after their manner with a kind of ſpell, containing the heads of their
erroneous tenets, and their ingaging themſelves in their ſchiſmatical covenants.
We anſwer, The manner of our baptiſme is as the Apoſtles was, and there is no
other words expreſſed in our baptizing, then what is expreſſed in the 28 of
<hi>Matthew</hi> part of the 19. verſe, and no mention of any tenets, much leſſe erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
ones: nor no words of any covenants are mentioned at all. Wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
when any is to be baptized at the water ſide, the adminiſtrator goeth to
prayer ſutable to the occaſion, and after goe both into the water, and uſeth
the words <hi>Mat.</hi> chap. 28. part of the 19. verſe; and comming forth again, they
goe to prayer againe, and alſo returne thankes to God, and how this can be a
ſpell we cannot ſee. But he further accuſeth the Anabaptiſts, for running into
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:123324:4"/>
corners to meet in. We anſwer, If he mean houſes to be the corners, we confeſſe
it, and they are the beſt places we have; but if he or any other will doe us
ſo much favour to procure more larger and publick places for us to meet in,
we are ready to embrace them with much thankfulneſſe. But, ſaith the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
they goe men and women together ſtark naked into their Jordans, <hi>pag.</hi>
36. &amp; 203. Wee anſwer, wee abhor it, and deny that ever any of us did ſo, and
challenge him to prove it againſt us, if he can; &amp; if he cannot, it is fit he ſhould
be known for a ſlanderer, if he deſerve no puniſhment for it. But he ſaith, the
Anabaptiſts are an illiterate and ſottiſh Sect. We anſwer, Some of them know
many letters, and if they can do no more, I ſee not how it can be truly affirmed
they are illiterate. Yea but it ſeems in the Doctors account they are not ſo good
ſcholars as he is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I freely confeſſe it, and I perceive the Doctor hath skill in one
tongue that will never doe him good, and I deſire to be ignorant of it; but one
may wonder that he ſo much inveyeth againſt illiterate men, ſeeing he ſaith, in <hi>p.</hi>
200. that God in the firſt planting of the Goſpel, made uſe of illiterat men, that
all may know, that he that planteth and he that watereth is nothing; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 14. I confeſſe we read of one <hi>Fumentius,</hi> a lay-man, who in his
travels, converted many to the Chriſtian Faith: (and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fulk</hi> confeſſeth in his
Confutation of the <hi>Rhemiſt Teſtament,</hi> of a woman that converted a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them who lived in the Iſland to which place ſhe was carried captive) But
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Featley</hi> ſaith, the learnedſt men have proved the worthieſt Inſtruments
(bravely ſpoken) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17, 18. the ſumme is, therefore now all illiterate
men muſt for ever hold their peace, at leaſt in <hi>England,</hi> and in caſe any travell
into any Iſland, where there are ſome unconverted, if there be no Doctors there,
illiterate men may ſee what God will do by them. But the Doctor chargeth
the <hi>Anabaptiſts, p.</hi> 10. to be uncertain of their grounds, becauſe ſometimes they
plead one thing, and ſometimes another. <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, variety of grounds and
reaſons againſt a thing, may ariſe from the clear diſcovery of the truth to them
and from fulneſſe of perſwaſion in the judgement, as illiterate men conceive.
But, ſaith the Doctor, in his Epiſtle, the <hi>Separation</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> upbraid
the State with their merit, in hazarding their lives and eſtates in theſe preſent
wars. <hi>Anſw.</hi> No ſuch matter, they do but only declare their loyalty to the
State, being urged to it by ſome, who falſly accuſe them to be enemies to the
State; and I conceive they accuſe them to be enemies, out of a deſire that they
be leſſe friends to it; and ſome conceive, the Doctor, and ſuch as he is, ſeek the
deſtruction of the State, in ſeeking to deprive the State of the help of many (who
are faithfull and loyall to it.) But, ſaith he, Anabaptiſme was condemned long
ſince by the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Churches; mark how the Doctor bears himſelf
upon humane authority; then it ſeems you cannot ſay it is condemned by Jeſus
Chriſt in his Word; but the Doctor confeſſeth, that generall Councels have
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:123324:5"/>
ſometimes moſt groſſely miſtaken error for truth, and Idolatry for true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<hi>p.</hi> 92. then it's no wonder, if the Doctor erre with his <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi>
Church: and ſeeing the Doctor affirms that the example of Chriſt and his
Apoſtles doth not bind us without a precept, <hi>p.</hi> 37, 38. with what reaſon or
conſcience doth he urge againſt us, yea, and againſt Chriſts command, his <hi>Greek</hi>
and <hi>Latine</hi> Churches, without a precept? doth he not ſet them herein above
Chriſt himſelf? The Papiſts pretend antiquity, and brag of their univerſality
againſt the truth. Wee know error is ancient, and ſpreading; but truth was
before error, and baptizing by dipping was before baptizing by ſprinkling; he
may name to us as many men as he pleaſeth, but hee muſt tell us where it is ſo
written in the Scriptures, ſo as we may reade it, before we ſhall believe them,
<hi>Luke</hi> 10. 26. But the Doctor chargeth us in his book, with many things that
we hold: That no malefactor ought to be put to death, That it is lawfull to
have more wives then one at once, That a man may put away his wife if ſhee
differ from him in point of religion, That we are to goe naked, and not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed,
That we hold it lawfull to ſlay wicked Magiſtrates, That no Chriſtian
may goe to law, but right himſelfe by violent means, That wicked men have
no propriety in their goods, but all things ought to be held in common, That
we maintain pretended Revelations, That Chriſt took not fleſh of the virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> That there is no originall ſinne, That men have free will in ſpirituall
actions, That election is for foreſeen faith and repentance, That God gives all
men ſufficient grace to be ſaved, That a man hath free will of himſelf to accept
or refuſe grace, That Chriſt died indifferently alike for all, That a true beleever
may fall away from grace totally and finally, And that wee hold Libertiniſme
&amp; Familiſme, and ſuch like ſtuffe which we utterly abhorre and deteſt; and if
God permit, wee ſhall in the next impreſſion of the Confeſſion of our Faith,
more fully declare jointly what we believe, and therefore I will not anſwer his
exceptions, which he makes at ſome of the Articles, but leave it to them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
for themſelves, which will be ere long, if God permit; but ſure I am,
all this poyſon (which he chargeth upon us) is drawn out of the impure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of divers Heretikes, in which he laboureth to drown us in; and I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how his conſcience would permit him to heave ſo many untruths into the
Preſſe: but (as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 2. and) he was encouraged by <hi>Sleiden,
Gabriel, Abres, Alſtedius,</hi> and others, oh me thinkes I heare the Preſſe grone, if
not ſweat under the burden of ſo many heavie charges; and ſure his grones will
be much greater when God opens his eyes, and ſhews him what he hath done,
which the Lord in mercy doe, if it be his will. I hope I may ſay as Chriſt
did, Father forgive him, for he knowes not what he hath done, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 44.

               <p>AFter he had condemned the point in queſtion for an error, the Doctor
ſaith, I could wiſh you had brought Scholars with you, who know
how to diſpute, which I perceive you cannot do. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Obſerve, how before
he diſputes, hee vilifies the point in queſtion, and thoſe that maintain it. But
ſaith the Doctor, there are but two wayes of diſputing: firſt, by authority:
ſecondly by reaſon. Firſt, by authority, if you will diſpute in Divinity, you
muſt be able to produce the Scriptures in the originall language. <hi>Anſw.</hi> But
why may you not as well ſay none can diſpute in divinity unleſſe they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the ſame copy of the Scriptures which the Apoſtles wrote, and ſeeing you
cannot do that, you are not fit to diſpute your ſelf: for, ſaith hee, in tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
there may be, and are errors, for no tranſlation is are ſimply authenticall,
and the undoubted Word of God. We may ſay the ſame of your <hi>Hebrew</hi> and
<hi>Greek</hi> copies, ſeeing you cannot produce the firſt copy, how know you but
your copies are written and printed falſe? ſee <hi>pag.</hi> 109. Can no Writer, if
he pleaſeth, write contrary to his copy? as for printing, I may ſay the ſame,
printing is not above 250. yeers ſtanding. D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fulk</hi> in confutation of the <hi>Rhemiſt
Teſtament</hi> juſtifieth the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tranſlation of the Bible, and you have the ſame
reaſon to doubt of the writing or printing of your copy as wee of our tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and if you may depend upon the Writer or Printer of your copies, why
may not we do the ſame of our Tranſlators, they doing it upon oath? but truth
muſt not be taken by tradition; and if the knowledge of <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> &amp;c.
be ſufficient to teach them the minde of the Spirit of God, then all that know
the tongues muſt of neceſſity know the minde of God in the Scriptures, and if
ſo, <hi>Apollo</hi> being a learned man, and ſaw the firſt copy of the Bible, ſhould not
need to learn of <hi>Aquila</hi> a tradeſeman (one of the Laity) and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> his wife,
the Word of God more perfectly as he did, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 26. And what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
you agree not among your ſelves about the minde of the Spirit of God in
his Word? ſo that ſome of you in your Expoſitions, differ as much as light and
darkneſſe; and if our tranſlation be true, then we may know the meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
as well as you; and if it be not true, tell mee, what is that preaching worth
which is proved by a falſe tranſlation? And if we muſt believe contrary to our
tranſlation, becauſe you that know the originall ſay ſo; (what is this but an
implicit faith, &amp; ſo human?) And ſeeing you ſo differ among your ſelves about
the meaning of the Spirit of God in them, tel me how I ſhal know, which of you
I am to believe: alſo ſome who know the originall, affirm ſome one word will
bear 7 or 10 divers ſignifications, how do you know which of them is intended
by God, unleſſe hee reveale it to you? and if he pleaſe, hee can reveale it to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate
men; God hath hid that from the wiſe, which he hath revealed unto
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:123324:6"/>
babes; God ſaith, the naturall man cannot perceive the things that be of God
(though he be learned) ſurely no man can know the things of God, but he to
whom the Spirit will reveale them unto. The Word, ſaith hee, revealeth to us
the deep things of God by his Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. he doth not ſay by <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Hebrew,</hi> &amp;c. But it will be objected, Cannot learned men underſtand the
Scriptures as well as illiterate Aſſes, as the Doctor calls tradeſmen? I anſwer,
yes, both alike, not at all of themſelves. But are there other means and
helps to the underſtanding the Scriptures without <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew?</hi> yes,
only the ſelf-evidencing light of the Spirit of God, which firſt inſpired the
Pen-men of Scriptures, is in the hearts of the Saints, the only Interpreter of
the Scriptures. Secondly, the knowledge of the body of Divinity, or the
Analogie of the faith, to which the Scripture is to be referred for its right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.
Thirdly, the Law of God written in the hearts of the Lords,
which ſavoureth the truth, and diſreliſheth errorr. Fourthly, help to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
the Scriptures, is the manifold experiences of varieties of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and the experiences of the work of Grace in the ſoul. Laſtly, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
Scriptures that are dark with Scriptures of the ſame nature that are more
plain, and ſo to let the Scriptures expound themſelves. I conclude this, all men
are pur-blind, yea dead, till God gives life, and opens mens eyes. And although
humane learning is neceſſary for tranſlating the Scriptures, &amp;c. yet many Idolize
it, as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did their golden Calf; the iſſue of the conference, as
he ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 18. was, that they were not able to withſtand the truth; it ſeems he
was, hee ſaith, the Knights and Ladies thanked him, but he cannot ſay he
did deſerve it: and he ſaith, the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> went away diſcontented and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
<hi>Anſw.</hi> It ſeems they were very ſorrowfull, to ſee his great blindneſſe and
hardneſſe of heart; and he ſaith none of them ever after that troubled him
any more; it ſeems they could do him no good, and ſo they reſolved to leave
him to God, till he ſhall pleaſe to open his eyes, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 25, 26.</p>

how they are to be baptized; but if the new Teſtament expreſſeth any of theſe

we deſire they would ſhew it us, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they confeſſe they cannot, it followes

thereof; and ſo the new Teſtament to come ſhort of the old. But the
new Teſtament expreſly commands who ſhall baptize, <hi>Matth. 28. 19. Goe yee,

how they are to be baptized, they were to be dipped in the name of the three

God did never take in the body of the Gentiles to be his Church, as hee
did the Jewes; <hi>ergo,</hi> the argument is not the ſame. The Jewes Church ſtood
not by faith and circumciſion of heart (as the Church of the Goſpel doth)
but ſtood meerely upon nature and circumciſion of the fleſh. <hi>Object.</hi> But bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
is as large as circumciſion, <hi>Ergo</hi> Infants. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Baptiſme is both to
male and female, therefore larger: circumciſion was only to males. Baptiſme is
both to Jew &amp; Gentile, and ſo is the covenant, yet infants are not to be baptized.
<hi>Obj.</hi> But Believers children are holy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. therefore are to be baptized.
<hi>Anſ.</hi> This doctrine takes away the being of actuall ſin, elſe they could not be
holy; this is contrary to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 5. the unbelieving wife is termed holy in the
ſame place, therefore ſhee muſt alſo be baptized as well as the child: ſo the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
<hi>Jewes</hi> were termed holy, when they were broken off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16.
What is it to be holy? it may be, you will ſay, to be under the Covenant. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
when do Infants come under the Covenant? when they are conceived?
or when they are born? or when their parents are converted? if it bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that Infants begotten of believing parents, come under the Covenant
in their conception, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 5. and Infants borne come under the Covenant
when their parents are regenerate; then it appeareth, that the Covenant is
conveyed to their children by generation, and by filiall relation; but that
which is a means to bring an Infant under the Covenant, is a means to bring
them under Juſtification and Sanctification, then it muſt follow, that wee muſt
account all the children of (believing parents) naturall birth, to be under Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and under Sanctification, becauſe they are holy, that is, as they ſay, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:123324:8"/>
the Covenant: but prove by Scripture that this holineſſe ſignifieth true
ſanctification, or to be under the Covenant. The holineſſe of the child here, is
meant lawfully begotten, which is call'd holy or godly, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 14, 15. the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or holineſſe of the wife, is meant lawfull marriage, contrary to <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.
2, 3. as 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 3, 4. there is other kinds of holineſſe; one of things dedicated to
holy uſes, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 5. ſo there is a ſanctification by the Spirit, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
holineſſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. ſo there is a holineſſe being free from ſin; and thus
was Chriſt in the Virgins womb, this is called holy, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35. there is a holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of actions, when they are outwardly according to the Word that makes an
outward holineſſe, &amp;c. let them prove which of theſe holineſſes is meant by
this Scripture. <hi>Obj.</hi> But children are in the Covenant, and ſo are to have the
ſeale of the Covenant. We demand what Covenant it is they intend, if to the
old Covenant, to the old Covenant ſeals we ſend them; if they ſay they be in
the new Covenant, I deny it: for <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> aud <hi>Jacob</hi> were believers, as the
Scriptures affirm, yet of their children God teſtifieth, that but a remnant of
them ſhall be ſaved: <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 27. conſidered with <hi>Rom. 9. 13. Gen.</hi> 17. 19, 20. Now
if the new Covenant be as <hi>Jeremy</hi> reports, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 32, 33, 34. and as is expreſſed,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8. &amp; 10. 15, 16, 17. then God, who keeps Covenant, muſt (needs be true
in what he promiſeth) writes his Lawes in the hearts of all believers children,
they being within the Covenant, and their children muſt alſo be ſaved, which
yet the Scripture denies: <hi>Rom. 9. 27. Iſa. 1. 9. Rom.</hi> 9. 29. but it's believing the
doctrine of the Goſpel proves perſons to be in the Covenant, the promiſes are
all confirmed in Chriſt; no intereſt in Chriſt, no intereſt in the Covenant and
promiſes thereof, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 20. Rom. 10. 4. 1 Joh. 5. 11, 12. Rom.</hi> 8. 9. we are in Chriſt
(viſibly) firſt by faith, and then in the Covenant and priviledges thereof, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.
29. and they that were born in the Covenant are never out of it; if the parents
faith inſtates his childe into the priviledges of his faith, Salvation being one
priviledge, it muſt needs partake of that alſo. Men talk of a priviledge, O it's
a priviledge! but what priviledge is it for an Infant to have a name to live, and
yet to be never the more alive for it, and to be dead for for all that
any one knowes, they are the chidren of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who walke in the ſteps
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 25. &amp; 13. 26. 33. <hi>Joh. 8. 37, 39. Rom.</hi> 9. 7, 8. and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Geneſis 17. 7. I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed;</hi> to expound and
apply this, and the like places, to the naturall poſterity of believers, ſuch an
expoſition of it is an hereſie, as we conceive, and ſtrikes at many expreſſe Texts
of Scripture; to name ſome: 1. If it be ſo, that by being born of a believer,
the word (of God which is truth it ſelf) ſaith they are born in the Covenant
of Grace and life, then ſhall all ſuch children be ſaved, or elſe God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull,
becauſe the Covenant of grace is a covenant of life, in and by Jeſus
Chriſt, which is abſolute and unconditionall, therefore none can miſſe of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:123324:8"/>
if God be faithfull; but it is impoſſible for God to lie, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they ſhall all be
ſaved, or they were never in this covenant; this doctrine makes void the ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Gods covenant of grace it ſelf: thus, If the covenant of Grace be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and ſtable, then all within the ſame muſt be ſaved, but all within the ſaid
covenant were not ſaved, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the covenant of Grace is not abſolute and ſtable.
The major is confeſſed, that a believers ſeed is in the Covenant of grace without
exception; the minor is proved from <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> and the rejected <hi>Jews,</hi> all
which were the ſeed of believers, and yet not all ſaved. 2. It's a ground of
falling from grace; thus all that God took into his Covenant of grace, were
in an eſtate of grace; but all that God took into his covenant of grace did not
there continue, <hi>Ergo,</hi> 3. It's a ground of univerſall redemption; this doctrine
makes the death of Chriſt equall as well to ſuch as periſh, as to ſuch as are ſaved,
all that are in the covenant of grace Chriſt died for, but all that were in the
covenant of grace were not ſaved, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt died for ſuch as are not ſaved.
4. This doctrine offers to make God the authour of mans believing a lie, in
enjoyning him to believe the ſalvation of ſuch as hee knowes, and reveals the
contrary, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 27. God requires no man to believe an untruth; but for a
believer to believe that all his ſeed is in the covenant of grace, is to believe
an untruth, <hi>Ergo,</hi> God requires no ſuch thing. But here ſome are conſtrained to
confeſſe they are not in the covenant of grace and ſalvation; for all that are
in this covenant ſhall be ſaved. See, can you find another covenant whereof
Baptiſme and the Supper are the ſeals of it? and ſeeing they cannot prove them
to have by their naturall birth right in the covenant of life by Cheiſt, they
cannot prove they have any right to the ſeals of it. 5. If by their naturall
birth they be borne in the covenant of grace, then are they not by nature the
children of wrath as well as others who are born of unbeleevers, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 3. Now can one be under the covenant, and under grace, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
wrath at one and the ſame time? 6. Then there is two ways of entring into
the covenant of grace, one by naturall birth, another by faith. 7. That there is
two wayes to enter into the Church of God, one by a naturall birth, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to another by the ſecond birth, without which none is to enter into the
kingdom of God: this latter enters by profeſſion of faith &amp; repentance. 8. That
sa of old, ſo now there is ſome fleſhly privilege as by which we become members
of the Church now, <hi>viz.</hi> by being borne of a believer; therefore all old things
are not done away, and all become new, which is contrary to divers Scriptures:
as they which are the children of the fleſh, theſe are not the children of God,
but the children of the promiſe are counted (by God) for the ſeed <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 7, 8.
with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 9. 9. If by fleſhly birth ſome have right to the Ordinances, &amp;c. then
we may know ſome after the fleſh, that is, in a fleſhly conſideration, but that is
contrary to 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 16. Phil.</hi> 3. 45. 10. This abuſeth the Word of God, by
making every believer to come in the place of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo aſſuming to each
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:123324:9"/>
believer to be the Father of the faithfull; yea, the woman to have this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which never any believer had beſides <hi>Abraham:</hi> Now they ſay, if one
of them be a believer, the woman and not the man, yet this promiſe they wil ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to her ſeed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 29. not conſidering that the parents themſelves, though
believers come not in the place of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but in the place of his ſeed, it's an
high contempt of Jeſus Chriſt, as he is the husband of his Church, to force up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him a natural wife (himſelf being ſpiritual) to found the Church upon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
birth. 11. It tends to overthrow this doctrine, that the matter of the
Church of Chriſt to be Saints, living ſtones, contrary to 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 5. 9. Epheſ.</hi> 2.
19. 20. 21. 22. &amp; 46. 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 12, 13, 25, 26, 27. Eph. 5. 25. 26. 27. John</hi> 4. 23.

                  </hi> 17. 14. the naturall poſterity of beleevers are not ſo much as
in appearance ſuch. 12. This inforceth ſuch matter upon the Church, as tends
to the deſtruction of the form of it, and bring the Saints in bondage: for to
found the Church of Chriſt upon naturall birth, ſeeing to one born in the
Spirit, there appears to be twenty born in the fleſh: what then the major voice
is like in a ſmall time to be the worſt, and ſo oppreſſe thoſe who are borne the
ſecond time, it's apparent it's the next way to make the Church become car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
and tends to a Nationall Church. And how ſhall the leſſer voyce in the
Church caſt out the greater, if they ſin? 13. It tends to make Gods holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
a lying ſigne, to confirm that which viſibly is not, ſecret things belong
to God, and revealed things to us, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. and ſeeing ſuch infants ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
not to have any right in the covenant, they are not to have the ſeal of the
covenant, it being againſt the light of nature to ſet a ſeal to a blank. And that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſhould have a viſible right to the ſeals, &amp;c. and yet not godly, is ſtrange do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
14. It tends to prove either, that infants may eat the Lords Supper (it
being in the ſame nature, end and uſe for kind:) or elſe that the Church may
withhold from the members the priviledges &amp; ordinances of the ſame, this is to
acknowledge them fit for union, who are not fit for comunion w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the church;
and ſeeing it puts an infant into a ſtate of grace and remiſſion of ſinnes before
calling, contrary to 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 9. Acts 26. 28. Rom. 8. 30. Heb.</hi> 9. 15. And it conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes

9. <hi>Rom. 6. 7. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 2. It upholds a Nationall Church, as Circumciſion did of

a covenant of grace, and to have a right to a promiſe of life in Chriſt Jeſus,
contrary to <hi>Rom. 9. 9. 7. 8. Gal. 3. 9. 26. 28. 29. Rom. 9. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. Pſal.</hi> 51.
5. <hi>John 3. 6. Eph.</hi> 2. 3. And it maintains that grace is intaild to generation, and

of a Serpent, which is very remarkable, and yet he hath ſaid nothing

of <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> yet ſayes in <hi>p.</hi> 24. there is but three ſorts in all, ſo according to his
own confeſſion, his explanation thereof cannot be true, nor hang together,
I ſhall therefore propoſe to your conſideration, what I conceive they may more
properly hold forth unto us: The great headed Serpent is the old Serpent,
which is the Devill, neer to his mouth is written in great letters, the name <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt,</hi>
it ſignifies to us, that the name <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> came firſt from the Devill, and
that he will own whatſoever is written againſt them; this name is written, as
it were, in a white curtain, which the Serpent ſtretches wide open: the meaning
is, that what is held out by any againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> for ſubmitting to Chriſt,
is from the devil; and that the devill would have all to take notice what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
againſt them: the ſpuing that proceeds out of his mouth, is myſtically, all
his abominable lies and devilliſh errors, which is the filth of his ſtomach, which
he labours to caſt upon the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> to make them odious, which declares
the devill hath much malice againſt them; and the mouth of the Serpent is
wide open, which ſhewes he never ceaſeth raging and accnſing them, and his tail
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:123324:10"/>
is ſharp, and it points toward the <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> it ſhewes his willingneſs to give
them a deadly wound with it, but his tail is ſhort of them, that is, they are ſafe
from his hurting them, being out of his reach; and the <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> is ſet in the
midſt, and is incloſed cloſe in the Eaſt, Weſt, North, South, with men &amp; the devil,
it declares that they are beſet with enemies in all the four quarters of the earth,
and the men have ſeverall names, this ſignifies ſeverall religions and opinions of
ſeverall perſons, yet they all are as one joyned together to oppoſe the truth and
people of God, eſpecially againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſt;</hi> and on the top on the right
ſide of the Serpent, he ſeems to be very ſtill, his picture declares, that either hee
hath wearied himſelf againſt the people of God, and ſo is glad to be quiet, or
elſe he is one that obſerves the event of things, and perceiving no good can come
of it, he chooſeth rather to do nothing then to medle with them; the ſecond,
by the poſture he ſeems to be in, is preaching, he holds up his hand, and from it
falls ſomething like drops of water, he ſeems to preach that ſprinkling is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for Baptiſme, but he hath no pulpit, it's like he hath had two pulpits, and
both juſtly taken from him for his malignancy to the State. The third is not
aſhamed of his name, and he is a <hi>Separatiſt.</hi> Surely, I believe he is an honeſt man,
I wonder what he doth here, hee means honeſtly, and intends to do good, it
ſeems he is in a pulpit; it's like he is preaching againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſt.</hi> How! is't
poſſible? if it be ſo, I fear hee hath not well ſtudied the point he hath ſpoken
againſt them, and the devill hath tempted him to preach againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi>
openly; it may be alſo, that he might not be eſteemed an Heretike, and out of a
hope of doing good, hath yeelded, but his face ſeems to be turnd ſomthing back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
which holds forth, hee wil not be able to ſtay there long; but why ſhould
the Devill deſire honeſt men to preach againſt them? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Becauſe he knowes
one word from an honeſt man, will more prevail with ſome, then many from
a looſe fellow. The 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> holds up both his hands; ſurely he ſtands amazed, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
at the ſillineſs of ſuch as will in cold weather go into a river to be ducked
or dipt. The 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> he ſtands as one that holds ſomething againſt his mouth; he
repreſents them that will neither ſpeak for them nor againſt them; he is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
yet one of the ſame company. The 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ſtaggers, he will fall off from them
ere long. The 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ſtretches out his hands both wayes, that is, he cars not, let all
go which way they will. The 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> appeares naked, the meaning is, he is ſo fooliſh
in defending his practice, as all that hears him ſees the folly of the man, and
what he contends for, or he conceives he is innocent, and no perſecutor. The 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
is compaſſed round with a Serpent, ſignifying eternity; this repreſents all thoſe
whom God in his juſt judgement hath given up to their wickedneſs, and ſhall
to eternity periſh in it. The 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> hath the Sun touching him; this ſhewes the
light is come, now he ſees that he never ſaw, he points to the light, it ſheweth he
is affected with it, and that declares he uſeth means that others may ſee it alſo,
and he hath a key in his hand, that is, now God hath inlightned his mind, he is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:123324:11"/>
able to open ſuch places of Scripture which others cannot: alſo he ſeems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
<hi>Paul,</hi> who being a perſecutor, God hath mercy on him, and with a
light from heaven converts him. The 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> picture is a Chariot with two in it,
drawn ſwiftly with horſes, this ſignifies they make haſte, as if they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from ſome remote part of the kingdom to <hi>London,</hi> to do ſome of the people
of God a miſchief, and the Chariot ſeems to be all on fire; this declares their
great zeal and malice, which fire came from the devill; and there being two of
them, declare they are for witneſſes, ſure it's a conſpiracie againſt them. The 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
hath a Serpent at his mouth, which ſheweth the neer familiarity they have with
the devill, that are enemies to the people of God, and that they are counſelled
by the devill what miſchief they ſhall do, and how they ſhall effect it. The 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
hath a pen, and he is a writing; this holds forth, that the devill hath alwayes
one or other to write againſt the truth, and them that profeſſe it. The 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> is
pictured with two, like women imbracing them, that is, hee is ſo taken up
about his wenches, that he is not at leaſure now to meddle with them. The 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
and laſt, ſeems to be out of his wits, hee hath perſecuted the people of God ſo
long, that he is diſtracted, or ſo terrified in his conſcience, that he ſtands in
water ready to drown himſelf. In the middle of all is a river, named <hi>Jordan,</hi>
this declareth that much water is required to baptiſe in, a few drops being not
ſufficient; the men in it, ſeem to be the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> ſo called, a man and a woman
are about to be baptized in the preſence of all the aforeſaid enemies; this holds
forth their loyalty, courage and conſtancy, of both men and women, that they
are not afraid nor aſhamed to own Jeſus Chriſt &amp; practice his truth in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Devill and his inſtruments. And they are almoſt naked: this was
done to make them odious to the world, by an enemy of theirs, myſtically they
have forſaken all fathers, mothers, friends, land, to ſubmit to the wayes of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt. Thus they have denied themſelves to be Chriſts Diſciples, and that
their enemies have ſtripped them of all, and that none may expect outward
riches nor glory, in ſubmitting to the wayes of Chriſt: And thus being ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
of all outward comforts, now they ſeem to a carnall eye moſt miſerable.
One puts anothers head under water ſo baptizing him: this to a learn'd Doctor
(that can ſee but the out-ſide of things) ſeemes, yea, eſteemes it a meere duck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that deſerves drowning: there is no money nor figures ſet down neere the
dipper, it ſeems they are ſo ſilly, that they doe not compound what they ſhall
have for their labour. And under the men is written Proſelytes, that is, they
are converted to the faith of Chriſt. And under the women is written, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
of Sion: virgins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe they are chaſt to God and man; and they are
named virgins of Sion, that is, they belong to the Church of Chriſt by the
confeſſion of their adverſaries.</p>
