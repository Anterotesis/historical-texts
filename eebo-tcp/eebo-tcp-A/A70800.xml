         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
Right Honourable
Sir William Trumball,
One of the
Lords Commissioners
OF HIS
Majesty's Treasury.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THo' I have long
been Ambitious of
giving some pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Instance of the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb facs="tcp:41112:4"/>
I have for You, I
would not have presum'd
to have done it now, had
not the Book, of which
what follows is a Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
been written by an
Embassador, and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a King. The
Character which you have
so honourably maintain'd,
not only at the Court of
that Prince, but with an
Emperor greater than that
of <hi>Morocco,</hi> entitles You
to the Protection of more
finish'd Works than this;
<pb facs="tcp:41112:4"/>
the Author of which, tho'
a Person of great Skill in
Business, perhaps not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly,
thinks himself not
altogether vers'd in the
nice way of Writing:
Yet his Book contains so
many pleasant and useful
Remarks, and may disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so many Mysteries to
the piercing Eyes of a
sound Politician, that You
are Master of too much
Goodness not to allow it
a Place, on that Score, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
that admirable Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
<pb facs="tcp:41112:5"/>
which You possess
no less in Your Mind than
in Your Library. Fear,
not, <hi>SIR,</hi> I should, like
many Dedicators, attempt
a <hi>Panegyrick</hi> instead of an
<hi>Epistle;</hi> I know You are
so far from being the least
indulgent to such a Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
that You more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
avoid Addresses of
this Nature, than some,
who deserve them less,
industriously encourage
them. For still Your
Modesty seeks as much to
<pb facs="tcp:41112:5"/>
keep Your other Vertues
veil'd, as most of us Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
do to discover them;
and it has brib'd some of
them into a Concealment
of Your real Merit, in a
more liberal Manner than
the Vanity of many has
recompens'd a Publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their imaginary
Worth. I dare not then
pretend to mention those
Qualifications that endear
You to Your Country;
nor am I so partial to my
self as to desire You to
<pb facs="tcp:41112:6"/>
protect the Original or the
Translation of this Book
from the Censures of the
Reader, to whom I freely
abandon it.</p>
            <p>My whole Design is
merely the Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Favors receiv'd;
tho' at the same time You
cannot pardon this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
conferring a new one;
since I know You would
have bestow'd on me fresh
Marks of Your Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
had I consented to
spare You the Blush which
<pb facs="tcp:41112:6"/>
the sight of this will raise.
But, <hi>SIR,</hi> even those
who are not able to return
Obligations, if of a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Principle, do not love
to be too much indebted;
and 'tis some Ease at least
to Acknowledge when
we cannot Requite. I
only beg then, to let all
those who will read this
know, That I have the
deepest Sense imaginable
of Your obliging Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that singular Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
or rather Charity,
<pb facs="tcp:41112:7"/>
which, as it extends to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of our unhappy <hi>Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giés,</hi>
has made me a sharer
in the Effects of Your
Bounty, doubtless much
more than the most tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of my Attempts as a
Writer. You pitied a
Man, who, having the
real Love of a Loyal
<hi>English</hi> Subject for the
Great Prince under whom
we live, endeavours to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
as much an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishman</hi>
as he can, even in
his Writings, since he is
<pb facs="tcp:41112:7"/>
driven on the barren Coast
of <hi>Parnassus,</hi> that idle Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
Poetry, for want
of better. May Heaven
still preserve You for the
Good of Mankind, and
more particularly of Your
Country, to whom You
so wholly devote Your
Self; and may You be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me with the greatest
Zeal and Respect,</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>

Most obedient Servant,

            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Doubt not but that <hi>Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi>
has, from Time to Time,
been faithfully inform'd of what
relates to the State, Forces, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms,
and Religion of the <hi>Moors;</hi>
and indeed, what I have seen in
<pb facs="tcp:41112:9"/>
Print on that Subject, generally
agrees with what I have observ'd
while I was in the Emperor of
<hi>Morocco'</hi>s Dominions: Yet, Sir,
Your Majesty's Orders, and what I
was enjoyn'd in my Instructions,
having oblig'd me to make there
some newer and less common Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations,
I hope Your Majesty
will not dislike, that, without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
to swell the Memoirs,
which I now have the Honour to
lay before you, with superfluous
Repetitions of what some Authors
have said, I only should give, as
a kind of Supplement, such Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
as seem to have been
omitted by them, either in what
concerns the Nature and Particulars
of the Trade of that Empire, the
Character, Manners and Genius of
<pb facs="tcp:41112:9"/>
those who have the greatest share
in the Government of it, or, as
to what the Conquests of the Prince,
who Rules there at this time, may
have contributed to the Enlarging
of his Dominions, the encreasing
of his Forces, and the heightning
of that Vanity that does not reign
less in him than the other Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
by which he is so parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>When Your Majesty did me the
Honour to make choice of me to
go in Your Name to conclude with
that Emperor the Treaty of Peace,
of which for some Years he had
shew'd himself so desirous that he
even seem'd to have remov'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand all the Difficulties that
might obstruct it, in the Letter
<pb facs="tcp:41112:10"/>
which he had written about it, and
sent to Your Majesty by the Consul
of <hi>Sally,</hi> You were already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
by frequent Trials, how little
his Proposals and Promises are to
be rely'd upon.</p>
            <p>Accordingly one of the most es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
and most inforc'd Articles
in my Instructions was, That I
should take care not to be deceiv'd
by them; and therefore 'tis what
I chiefly apply'd my self to prevent,
by all the Means and Expedients
that seem'd to me most proper, to
conciliate the Artifice of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
and Ministers, with the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency
and fidelity of my Zeal for
Your Majesty's Service and Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:41112:10"/>
Even what I said to that
Prince at my first Audience, which
I insert at the end of this short
Treatise, may also convince Your
Majesty that I have not been spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of such Encomiums and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuations
as I judg'd most capable
of flattering his Ambition, and of
inclining him to concurr with Your
Majesty's Pious and Solid Designs
for the Freedom of Your Captive
Subjects, and for the security of
Your Merchants.</p>
            <p>If the Memoirs or Journal which
I sent to You of my Negotiation
in that Prince's Country, and at
his Court, have been read to Your
Majesty, You have not only seen,
that You had entertain'd very just
<pb facs="tcp:41112:11"/>
Thoughts on that Subject, but that,
far from my being able to remove
that <hi>Punic Faith</hi> so general here
at this time, or root out its Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
grown stronger than their
ancient Stock, it has not been in
my Power with all my Care and
Endeavours to shake them in the
least.</p>
            <p>Here, Sir, I might have an
opportunity to repeat the substance
of many Things which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
at length in that Journal, did
not I fear this wou'd be too foreign
to the Design of the following
sheets, which, according to Your
Majesty's Orders, are only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to the Extent, Government,
Strength, and Trade of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of <hi>Morocco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:41112:11"/>
However, I think my self ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
before I begin, to acquaint
Your Majesty, that by what the
subtle Ways and Discourses of the
King of <hi>Morocco</hi>'s Ministers
have betray'd to me of his Designs
and Resolutions, as to the offers
he makes from Time to Time to
Treat with Your Majesty, it plainly
appears, whatever his Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Sincerity may seem, that
all his Aim and utmost Intent have
always been, and will ever be only to
procure himself some Presents,
Honours, and Supplies for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining
of the Towns which the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> still hold in his Country.</p>
            <p>Besides, as this Prince and his
Ministers know very well, that Your
<pb facs="tcp:41112:12"/>
Goodness and Compassion for Your
poor Captive Subjects, are the
only Motives that incline You to
hearken to his Proposals, there is
no doubt but that he is not likely to
part with those Slaves as long as
he hopes they may be a means to
procure him the Advantages I have
mention'd; so that 'tis not to be
expected he will ever treat but
upon Terms of this nature, and
his Ministers will always endeavour
by all imaginable means, that
the effect, which they think
they ought to expect in that
case, may precede the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of what they shall Promise
on their side.</p>
            <p>There remains now nothing for
me to represent to Your Majesty,
<pb facs="tcp:41112:12"/>
but that I have taken such care
in examining what ever is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of these Memoirs, that I may
well assure You they contain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what is most conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Truth.</p>
            <p>I also make bold to promise my
self, from Your Majesties Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that You will the rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
Omissions and Defects, seeing
that, by the Journal which I had
the Honour to give You of my
stay and Negotiation in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
where I was almost always

            <head>THE
Present State
OF THE
EMPIRE
OF
MOROCCO.</head>
            <p>AS I do not design to trace
the Original of every
Part of the Empire of
<hi>Morocco,</hi> but to give
an exact Account of its Extent,
Bounds, Strength, Trade, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
so it will be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to begin with as short a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
as possible, of the Methods
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41112:15"/>
taken by the famous <hi>Muley Archyd,</hi>
King of <hi>Tafilet,</hi> and <hi>Muley Ismaël</hi>
his Brother and immediate Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
to re-unite the Kingdoms
of <hi>Morocco, Fess, Tafilet,</hi> and <hi>Sus,</hi>
with the vast Province of <hi>Dara,</hi>
under the same Power; and form
that mighty State which the latter
Rules at this time in so Arbitrary
a manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Muley Xerif,</hi> King of <hi>Tafilet,</hi> and
Father to <hi>Muley Archyd,</hi> who by
their Genealogy give themselves
out for the Offspring of <hi>Mahomet</hi>
and his Daughter <hi>Fatima,</hi> was suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
by <hi>Muley Hamet,</hi> the eldest
of 84 Sons and 124 Daughters
that surviv'd him. But <hi>Muley Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyd,</hi>
one of his Brothers, whose
haughty and ambitious Spirit dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
to obey him, did not suffer
him to wear the Crown long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disturb'd,
but with the assistance of
some of the chief <hi>Alcaydes,</hi> whom
he had engag'd to side with him,
orm'd some Designs, whose Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41112:15"/>
however, did not meet with
a Success answerable to his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Ends; for, the King having
prevented them, caus'd the <hi>Alcaydes</hi>
to be seiz'd and put to death, and
shut him up in a Prison.</p>
            <p>Yet that Prince having found
means to escape, was rather exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperated
than won by this mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Usage; and, getting some
Forces together, made some new
Attempts, whose Success was no
better than that of the former;
since he was taken and confin'd a
second time.</p>
            <p>This restraint, tho' longer and
closer than the first, did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a better Effect; for, the
<hi>Black</hi> to whose keeping the King
had intrusted him, as to the most
Faithful of his Servants, was not
Proof against the wheedling Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses
and large Promises with
which <hi>Muley Archyd</hi> ply'd him, to
get his Liberty; and the Prisoner
having plotted with his Keeper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

the manner of his Escape, got
out at last: But, persuaded it was
not safe to trust one that was thus
false to his Master, lest he should
happen to be serv'd so himself, the
only Return he made to the
<hi>Black</hi>'s kind Office was to dispatch
him out of the World, in his Flight,
with a stroke of his Scimiter.</p>
            <p>He took shelter at <hi>Zaovias,</hi> where
the <hi>Morabite Benbucar</hi> govern'd,
whom the Inhabitants of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of that Name had chosen to
be their Prince, for the sake of his
Vertue.</p>
            <p>Those who are call'd <hi>Morabites</hi>
in <hi>Africa</hi> are like our <hi>Hermits:</hi>
They seem wholly apply'd to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Holiness, and retire to
Desarts, whither the People, who
have a very great Veneration for
them, sometimes come to seek them
out, and take them out of their
solitude to set the Crown on their
Heads, as they had done to <hi>Benbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41112:17"/>
               <hi>Muley Archyd,</hi> concealing his Name
and Quality, offer'd him his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
as a common Soldier; and
that good old Man receiv'd him
kindly; employing him afterwards
in divers Capacities, upon the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
which his Merit that
exerted it self had given him; in
all which Employments he behav'd
himself so well, that in a little
time he gain'd <hi>Benbucar</hi>'s Esteem
and Friendship.</p>
            <p>At last he was discover'd by
some <hi>Arabs</hi> of <hi>Tafilet,</hi> who had
brought some Dates to sell, and
immediately saluted him as their
King's Brother. Upon which <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucar</hi>'s
Sons suspected he was not
come thus disguis'd into their
Country without some Design, and
resolv'd to have him put to death.</p>
            <p>Accordingly they contriv'd to
make him fall into an Ambuscade,
out of which, however, he escap'd,
and fled to <hi>Quivan,</hi> where, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
offer'd his Service to the Prince of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41112:18"/>
the Country, as he had done to
<hi>Benbucar,</hi> he so effectually disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
his extraordinary Worth,
that he became his Master's chief
Minister of State and Favorite.</p>
            <p>But the Authority his eminent
Post gave him, the Trust repos'd
in him by that kind Prince, and
the Love of his Subjects, which he
had industriously purchas'd, prov'd
only so many new Spurs to his
Ambition. He persuaded himself
it would not be less easie to him
to Conquer that State where he
was already so absolute, than to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge
and rise as he had done.
The Master's very Treasures serv'd
the ungrateful Favorite to bait
those on whom he cou'd not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
so well depend; and having
thus successfully drawn them in,
he in a short time with ease made
himself Master of the Prince of
<hi>Quivian,</hi> as also of his Treasures
and Country; and conceiving that
his Death was the surest means to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41112:18"/>
secure these unjust Possessions to
himself, he caus'd him to be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and then rais'd an Army with
which he dispos'd himself to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
his Resentment and former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
against his Brother.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Muley Mehemet,</hi> who had notice
given him of this, did his part to
prevent him; and to that end ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken the Field, several Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
were fought between them, in
which <hi>Muley Archyd</hi> having almost
always worsted his Brother, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
him to shut himself up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Walls of the City of <hi>Tafilet,</hi>
where his Grief for his Misfortunes,
and his Fear of his victorious Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Cruelty hasten'd his death.
<hi>Muley Archyd,</hi> thus rid of his chief
Competitor, and in a fair way of
enlarging his Conquests, pursu'd his
Victories with so much Courage,
Conduct, and good Fortune, that
he soon made himself Master also
of <hi>Sally,</hi> which was a free Town,
and of the Kingdom of <hi>Fess, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:41112:19"/>
and <hi>Sus,</hi> some of which
yielded to the Power of his Arms,
and the rest to the Terror which
they spread over the Country.</p>
            <p>He did not enjoy them so long
a Time as his Age and Fortune
seem'd to promise; for, in his own
Palace, and in his Fortieth Year,
he cou'd not avoid the stroke of
Death, which he had so often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd
in the Field. Having invited
the Nobility on a certain Festival,
and drank Wine to excess with his
most intimate Friends, which he
used to do often enough, he took
a fancy in this condition to Curvet
in his Gardens on a fiery Horse,
that ran away with him with such
a fury, as he wheel'd about under
a Walk of Orange Trees, that one
of their largest Branches broke his
Scull, and, in three days, put an
end to his Life.</p>
            <p>Good Order and Peace, which
that Conqueror began to establish
in his Dominions, were soon ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41112:19"/>
by that unexpected Death,
which happen'd in the Year 1672.
For, those of his Family whom he
had entrusted with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Kingdoms, endeavour'd
to secure to themselves the respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Countries where they Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd;
but <hi>Muley Ismael,</hi> who
prov'd the bravest, the most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and esteem'd, was also the
most successful.</p>
            <p>He first caus'd himself to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
King of <hi>Tafilet,</hi> took Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of his Brother's Treasures,
then march'd into the Field with
as many Men as he could get to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
and, having won some by
Promises or Presents, overcame
others by Force of Arms, and made
himself Master of all.</p>
            <p>Of all his Competitors, <hi>Muly Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi>
his Nephew, was reduced with
most difficulty; for, having likewise
caus'd himself to be proclaim'd King
of <hi>Morocco</hi> and <hi>Sus,</hi> and oppos'd him
with numerous Forces, this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41112:20"/>
several Sieges and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which, however, were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
so much to his Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
that at last he was forc'd to
submit as well as the rest, all his
Attempts having only serv'd to
give a greater lustre to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
and undaunted Valour of
this Prince, who owes only to these
two Qualifications the Sovereign
Possession he now enjoys of all
this Empire, whose extent is no
less considerable than its Situation.</p>
            <p>It spreads it self about 250
Leagues in length from North to
South, and 140 in breadth, from
East to West. Its limits on the
East are the Kingdom of <hi>Algier,</hi>
by which 'tis bounded at <hi>Tremesen;</hi>
on the West, the <hi>Atlantic</hi> Ocean;
the River <hi>Dara</hi> on the South; and
the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> on the North, if
you except three Fortified Places
which the Christian Princes still
hold on its Coasts, <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>agan</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
by the <hi>Portuguese</hi> on the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41112:20"/>
Ocean, and <hi>Ceuta</hi> and <hi>Melilla</hi> by
by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean,
the one at the Streights-Mouth,
the other further up. The
<hi>Spaniards</hi> had, not long since, two
other very Strong Holds on the
Ocean, <hi>Larache</hi> and <hi>Mamora,</hi> which
they have suffered to be taken from
them by <hi>Muley Ismael;</hi> the first in
the Year 1681. the other in 1689.
The <hi>English</hi> also had <hi>Tangier</hi> there,
near the <hi>Streights,</hi> but left it some
Years ago, having first ruin'd its
Port and Fortifications.</p>
            <p>So that the most considerable
Sea-Port Towns the Emperour of
<hi>Morocco</hi> has on the Ocean, are
<hi>Santa Cruz, Safy, Sally, Mamora,
Larache, Arzilla,</hi> and <hi>Tangier;</hi> and
on the Mediterranean, <hi>Zaffarina,</hi>
and <hi>Tetuan,</hi> if we may reckon the
latter among the rest, it being sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
two Leagues within Land, and
an open Town without any Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications;
yet pretty well built,
and very populous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:41112:21"/>
The Inhabitants of <hi>Tetuan,</hi> who
are said to be upwards of Fifteen
Thousand, report themselves to
be <hi>Andalusians,</hi> and most of them
speak Spanish; for every one
knows, that the Moors were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
of <hi>Spain</hi> Six or Seven Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years, and that after many
vain Endeavours, which the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
us'd to drive them out,
<hi>Ferdinand,</hi> more Fortunate than
the rest, wholly subdued them,
and forc'd them seemingly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the <hi>Roman</hi> Belief, while they
secretly plotted the ruine of the
State: But <hi>Philip</hi> III. having found
out their Designs, expell'd them
in 1610. Accordingly above One
Hundred Thousand of both Sexes,
Young and Old, left <hi>Spain,</hi> and
the greatest part of them having
shelter'd themselves in <hi>Africa,</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
at <hi>Sally</hi> and <hi>Tetuan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are <hi>White-men,</hi> pretty well
Civiliz'd, and very kind to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and Christians. The French
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41112:21"/>
Consul, and all the Merchants who
have a Settlement there, tho' of
different Nations and Religions,
besides the Duty of Three Crowns
Levied on every Ship, Tartane or
Bark that touch there, towards
the maintaining of a little Hospital,
and two Spanish <hi>Recollet Monks,</hi>
equally contribute towards the
further Charges about it. There
is another at <hi>Sally,</hi> where the same
Method is taken.</p>
            <p>Of all these Sea-Ports, not one
can be esteem'd a good Haven;
<hi>Tangier, Mamora,</hi> and <hi>Sally</hi> might
be thought the best; but there is
no coming thither but over a Bar
or Sand that absolutely hinders all
great Ships from going in; for
which Reason, neither the King
nor his Privateers can fit out any
other Vessels than Brigantines or
light Frigats that go a Cruising,
and rove on the Sea in hopes of
taking some Merchant-men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:41112:22"/>
There never is any fix'd num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of these Ships, 'tis greater or
less as there are old ones lost, or
new ones built. It consists now
in Twelve or Thirteen, of which
Six belong to the King, and the
rest to private Persons; they are
generally of Eighteen or Twenty
Guns, the biggest not exceeding
Twenty four; but they have often
Two hundred Men on Board, yet
are generally in very ill plight, by
reason of the want of Stores, Sails,
Cables, and other Rigging in those
Parts; so that if the Moors did not
now and then get some from the
English and Dutch, they would
very soon and easily be reduc'd
to a much smaller number.</p>
            <p>It costs the King of <hi>Morocco</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to maintain his Ships; the
Alcayde or Governour of the Port
where they lye, pays the Officers
and the Men; if they take any
Prizes, one half is the King's, the
other is divided between the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayde
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41112:22"/>
and the Officers, who bestow
also a small part of it on the Ships
Company; but as for the Slaves,
the King takes them all; paying
Fifty Crowns for every one of
those who do not belong to his
Moiety.</p>
            <p>Such Ships as are fitted out by
private Persons, are kept wholly
at the Charge of their Owners,
who reimburse themselves out of
the Product of the Prizes, of which
the King has a Fifth, and all the
Slaves, paying also Fifty Crowns
for every one.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Morocco,</hi> and
that of <hi>Fess,</hi> are the largest and
most considerable of the Four al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
mentioned, and the head
Cities of both have the same Names
with them. The City of <hi>Morocco</hi>
was formerly very Populous and
most Famous for its Wealth and
Beauty, but is now much fallen
from its ancient State, and does
not contain above 25000 Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41112:23"/>
its Streets seem almost un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented,
and none takes care
to repair the decay'd Buildings,
or prevent the Ruines, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of whose heaps encreases e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day, which altogether dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces
it. Its Palace and that
Mosque so celebrated for its Large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Ornaments, as well as
for its Brazen Gates, and three
Golden Balls, which were said to
be Enchanted, are now dwindled
to nothing. <hi>Muley Ismael</hi> has not
been afraid of the vain Prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of Malediction, with which
those who should dare to take them
away were Curs'd; his extream
greediness of Gold, stronger in
that Juncture than the Superstition
so common to the Moors, prevail'd
with him to cause them to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
and buried among his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible</hi>
and <hi>useless</hi> Treasure: I
shall take an opportunity, before
I have done to explain why I call it
so.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:41112:23"/>
'Tis pretended that these Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Balls were set on the top of
that Mosque by the Wife of that
great <hi>Almanzor,</hi> so famous in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
for having Conquer'd <hi>Spain;</hi>
and that this Queen, to leave a
Monument of her Grandeur to
after Ages, laid out the greatest
part of her Jewels and Dowry in
the building of that Mosque; that
these Balls had been plac'd on its
top during such a Constellation of
the Heavens as did not admit of
their being remov'd; the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect,
by the means of certain Spells
and Conjurings, having also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd
some Spirits to guard them.
They even affirm, that several
Kings who had attempted to take
them away were always hinder'd
by some accident; and the Moors,
who are very credulous in point of
Magick, had all along believ'd,
that, according to the Import of
this Spell, the Devil should break
the Necks of those who should
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41112:24"/>
dare to take them away. But
this King, less credulous and scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous,
has undeceiv'd them at last.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Safy</hi> and <hi>Mazagan,</hi> both on the
Ocean, the latter a fine large City,
in the hands of the <hi>Portuguese,</hi>
who keep in it a good Garison,
are the only Places in all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which, besides the chief City,
deserve to be mention'd; for
though its extent, which is very
large, be divided into Seven Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
it is not very Populous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
its Sandy Soil, dry and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
in most places, neither admits
of Plenty of Corn, nor of Cattle;
and abounds in nothing but Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels,
which are cheap there, besides
Copper, Wax, and Almonds, of
which great quantities are vended
in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis thought there may be in its
Plains about Thirty Thousand Huts
of <hi>Aduars,</hi> which contain near
One Hundred Thousand Men, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Garam,</hi> that is, who Yearly pay
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41112:24"/>
the King a Tribute of the Tenth
part of all they have, to which
they are liable as soon as they are
Fifteen Years of Age.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Aduar</hi> is a kind of a ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
or flying Village (there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very few of another kind in
all <hi>Africa</hi>) that consists of some
Families of <hi>Arabs,</hi> who Incamp
in Tents, which they pitch, now
in one place, and then in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
according as the goodness
of the Soil invites them to stay,
and the subsistance of their Cattle,
in which their Wealth wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists,
requires it. Each <hi>Aduar</hi> has
its <hi>Marabot,</hi> and submits to the
Conduct of a Chief, whom they
chuse among themselves; every
Family has its Tent or Hut, in
which they all lie pell-mell with
their Oxen, Sheep, Camels, Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Dogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their Misery and
Nastiness are greater than can be
imagin'd; yet from them the King
draws his most settled and certain
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41112:25"/>
Revenues: A Black of his Guard
is commonly sent to Collect their
Tributes, and, tho' alone, bestows
plentiful Bastonado's as he pleases
on the least Delinquent, non da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
either resist or complain.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Arabs</hi> remove their
<hi>Aduars,</hi> they set their Wives and
Children on Camels in some Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Conveniencies cover'd with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen-Cloth,
and contriv'd like <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
or Arches, but quite round,
which wholly secure them from the
heat of the Sun, yet at the same
time afford them means to take
the Air on which side they please.
If they have not Camels enough
to carry all their Lumber, they
load with it their Bulls and Cows
that wear Pack-Saddles; which I
don't remember to have seen any
where else.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Fess,</hi> known of
old by the Name of <hi>Mauritania
Tingitana,</hi> is of no less extent than
that of <hi>Morocco,</hi> and, like it, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41112:25"/>
into Seven Provinces; but
much more Fruitful, better Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled,
and affords a much greater
plenty of all sorts of Corn, Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
Pulse, Kitchen-Herbs, Fruits,
and Wax; its Fertility might yet
be increas'd, were there more Care
taken to Cultivate it, but the
Goodness of the Soil, that produces
almost of its self, the slothful Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of the Natives, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
themselves with what just
serves for their Subsistance, and
their scrupulous Obstinacy, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
an Exportation of Corn,
cause above half the Lands to lie
fallow.</p>
            <p>They have some Mines of Iron,
but do not know how to refine
that Metal, and can put it to no
other Use but making Nails, and
other course Iron-work.</p>
            <p>This Kingdom is bounded on
one side by that of <hi>Morocco,</hi> and
by that of <hi>Algier</hi> on the other. The
River <hi>Sebou,</hi> whose Stream is very
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41112:26"/>
rapid, runs through it, and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about half a League from its
Metropolis, afterwards loses it self
in the Ocean at <hi>Mamora.</hi> That
River is the finest in all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of <hi>Morocco;</hi> and on its Banks,
above <hi>Mamora,</hi> stands a large Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
that might yield Materials for
the building many Ships. 'Tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
said, that not far from its Spring
there is a very fine Bridge, made
of Brick and Stone, and One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty Fathom long;
which would be a remarkable and
extraordinary thing were it not
ancient; for, they are so far from
raising Publick Buildings at this
time in that Country, that not the
least Care is taken even to Repair
the High-ways, for the easier Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of Goods; tho' indeed it
must be own'd, that as there is no
Travelling in those Parts, but on
Horse-back, or with Camels, 'tis not
so absolutely necessary to repair the
Ways, as in some other Countries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:41112:26"/>
There are neither Publick Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,
Carriers, nor Posts settled in
those Kingdoms; so that all Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondencies,
which indeed are
not frequent there, are only kept
by the means of Expresses on Foot
or on Horse-back, who, however,
go and come with speed, and cost
but little; first, because the Men
and the Horses are hardy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ur'd
to Toil; and then by reason
of the cheapness of the Provisions,
of which a small pittance satisfies
them.</p>
            <p>Upon urgent and important E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergencies
they make use of Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medaries,
a sort of Camels only
differing from the rest by their
Swiftness and Leanness, which are
natural and altogether peculiar to
this kind of them; for 'tis observ'd,
as the Natives report, that a Drome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
can carry a Man as many times
ten Leagues a Day as it has been
Days asleep, and blind immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after its Birth: So that if it slept
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41112:27"/>
six Days as soon as it was born, it
performs sixty Leagues a Day, and
proportionably more or less.</p>
            <p>I saw one of this kind at <hi>Mic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keness,</hi>
with which some endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to make me believe, the
King's Uncle travell'd one hundred
Leagues in a Day; but this seems
to me to be stretch'd somewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Truth; those who assur'd me
of this, add, that the Fatigue
which attends this way of Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
is equal to its Speed, and that
it would be impossible to hold out,
or bear the Dromedary's most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
Ambling, did not he that
rides him cause himself to be ty'd
fast to the Saddle, and cover his
Mouth for fear of being stifled;
and indeed, if this be true, there is
no doubt but that a Traveller
must needs find himself intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
tir'd, at the end of such a
Journey.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Aduars</hi> of <hi>Arabs,</hi> in the
Kingdom of <hi>Fess,</hi> are judg'd to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41112:27"/>
consist of about Three hundred
thousand Men paying <hi>Garams.</hi> Its
Metropolis, that gives it its Name,
is absolutely the finest, richest, and
most trading City in all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of <hi>Morocco:</hi> 'Tis divided into
two, one call'd the <hi>Old,</hi> and the
other the <hi>New Town,</hi> both fairly
built, and stock'd with above Three
hundred thousand Inhabitants; the
<hi>Old Town</hi> is Peopled with <hi>Whites<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
and the <hi>New</hi> with <hi>Blacks;</hi> and
both have so many Gates, Bridges,
Fountains, and Piazza's; so many
<hi>Gemmes</hi> or Mosques, Colleges, and
stately Structures, that the large
Description which <hi>Dapper</hi> gives of
it, in his History of <hi>Africa,</hi> no less
deserves the studious Reader's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usal,
than all these Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are worthy the Curiosity of
such Travellers as go thither. As
for my Part, not having been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to come to it, tho' it lies
but a Day's Journey from <hi>Mic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keness,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:41112:28"/>
I am oblig'd to trust to
what others tell us of it.</p>
            <p>The other Places of Note in this
Kingdom, are <hi>Theza, Mickeness,
Mamora, Arzilla, Larache, Sally,
Tangier, Ceuta, Alcasar,</hi> and <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mickeness</hi> is the Place where the
King resides, and lies pretty high
up in the Land: 'Tis but a little
Town, but so crouded with Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
the Number of which is
said to exceed Sixty thousand, that
there is no passing through its
Streets, which besides are very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
without justling one another;
I shall speak of it more at large
before I have done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theza</hi> is a little fortifi'd Place
between <hi>Fess</hi> and <hi>Morocco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Towns lie on the Sea-Coast,
and are all Populous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and Places of great Trade:
They might have a greater Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
yet, were their Havens bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41112:28"/>
but, as I have said, the Barr
that lies all along the Coast does
not permit any such.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tetuan</hi> and <hi>Sally</hi> are the Ports
where Ships most easily and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
arrive: For which reason
many Merchants of divers Nations
have settled there, and the King of
<hi>France</hi> has establish'd a Consul in
each Place, for the Conveniency
and Safety of Trade; at least they
are appointed with that Intent,
which yet I may say is render'd
ineffectual by the barbarous and
mean-interested ways of those E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of Civility and all sense of
Honour, who, as I have seen, have
a greater Consideration for the
least Factor, with regard to the
Gain they hope to reap by him,
than for a Consul, whose Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
as being unprofitable to
them, is every Day expos'd to the
Insults of their capricious ill Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and Contempt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:41112:29"/>
               <hi>Sally</hi> is more known and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
than the rest, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of its Privateers and Haven,
which, however, is only fit to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Shipping of small Bulk and
Draught. 'Tis also considerable
for its Forts, for its two Towns
divided, as at <hi>Fess,</hi> into <hi>Old</hi> and
<hi>New,</hi> and for its great Trafick: Its
Inhabitants, who are not above
Twenty thousand, take upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the Name of <hi>Andalusians,</hi>
like those of <hi>Tetuan;</hi> it had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
some beautiful Buildings,
which the Wars and its Rebellions
have almost all ruin'd. It has put
the Kings of <hi>Morocco</hi> to some
trouble for some time, when it
strove to cast off their Yoke; but
<hi>Muley Archyd</hi> reduc'd it in 1666, by
the great Victory he obtain'd over
the famous <hi>Gayland</hi> Lord of <hi>Tetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuan,
Arzilla,</hi> and <hi>Alcasar,</hi> under
whose Protection it had put it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Its two Towns are parted by
the River <hi>Guerou,</hi> that on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41112:29"/>
has two Castles on the top of a
little Hill by the Sea; these have
a Communication by the means of
a great Wall, and contain about
Thirty Pieces of Canon in no very
good order; above the old Castle,
at the mouth of the River, there
is a small Fort with three Iron and
three Brass-Guns in it, from twelve
to fifteen Pounds Shot, to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Retreat of those Pyrats
when the are chas'd in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alcasar</hi> is also become famous by
the bloody Battle, which <hi>Sebastian</hi>
King of <hi>Portugal</hi> lost near it, with
his Life, in the Year 1578, in the
Plain between that Town and the
River <hi>Mukazem:</hi> It is little, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Peopled, and very ill built, but
stands most pleasantly by that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
with fine Gardens all round
it. <hi>Gayland</hi> most commonly chose
to reside there in a large Palace,
which is now altogether ruin'd. I
cannot forbear to mention, by the
way, that this Town may be said
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41112:30"/>
to be the Nest of all the <hi>Storks</hi> in
that part of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and their
Number exceeds that of its Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants;
I never saw so many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in one Place; which yet is
less strange if we consider that they
are safe and secure there; for, the
<hi>Moors</hi> account it a Sin to kill any
of them, and most strictly forbid
it; because they believe that God,
at <hi>Mahomet'</hi>s Request, transform'd
into those Birds a Company of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians,</hi>
who robb'd those that went
on Pilgrimage to <hi>Mecca.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ceuta,</hi> as I have said, belongs to
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who, besides that
considerable Port, hold another
call'd <hi>Melilla</hi> in the same Kingdom,
and on the Sea-side towards <hi>Algi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
or also <hi>Pennon de los Velez,</hi> a
little Fortress built on the Point
of a Rock that's surrounded by
the Sea, and almost impregnable
by its situation.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Sus</hi> is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous
to that of <hi>Morocco,</hi> about
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41112:30"/>
its South-West Part; 'tis but small,
very indifferently Peopled, and
even, in a good part of it, almost
uninhabited. There may be some
Fifteen thousand <hi>Aduars</hi> of <hi>Arabs</hi>
in its Plains, all brave, daring
Souls, and impatient of the Yoke:
It has cost this King a great deal
of Time to subdue them; neither
has he yet been able to effect that
wholly; the Inhabitants of two
Mountains still remaining free and
disclaiming his Tyranny, at the
same time that they are govern'd
by a Chief, whom they chuse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves.</p>
            <p>The most considerable Towns
in that Kingdom are <hi>Illec</hi> and <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rudante,</hi>
both large and very popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
with respect to the rest of the
Country, each having about Fifty
thousand Inhabitants. The King
sends no <hi>Alcaydes</hi> thither, as he does
to the Towns of his other Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and only sends a Captain, to
whom they give the Title of <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:41112:31"/>
who has some Officers under
him, to put his Orders in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
through the whole Kingdom;
but this with moderation. The
<hi>Moors</hi> are treated here much more
gently, or rather much less cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than at <hi>Morocco,</hi> or at <hi>Fess,</hi> and
only pay the yearly Tribute, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being liable or constrain'd to
pay any extraordinary Tax or <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rams.</hi>
This milder Usage is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the King's Politicks, lest a
severe Treatment should awake
their Inclination to rise against
him, which the Situation of the
Country does very much encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
            <p>That Part of the Kingdom which
is inhabited yields a reasonable
quantity of Corn, Pulse, Kitchen-Herbs,
Fruit, and Olives: Its Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
abound in Copper-Mines,
and are also said to have some
Gold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Santa Cruz</hi> lies on the Ocean,
within the Extent of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41112:31"/>
and is a Town of pretty
good Trade, either for such Goods
as are sent thither from <hi>Morocco,</hi>
or such as are the Product of the
Country, which are also Copper,
Bees-Wax, and Almonds; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
these, very fine Ostridge Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Tafilet</hi> is of no
great extent, having no Town of
Note besides one of its Name,
which is fenc'd only with a Wall,
but has a pretty good Castle.</p>
            <p>This Kingdom, that lies beyond
Mount <hi>Atlas,</hi> and was formerly
known by the Name of <hi>Numidia,</hi>
is all of it in an ungrateful sandy
Tract of Land, between the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarts
of <hi>Zahara</hi> and the Province
of <hi>Dara;</hi> It has on the East the
Kingdom of <hi>Morocco,</hi> from which
'tis parted by Mount <hi>Atlas;</hi> and
tho' it yields no Wheat or other
Corn, abounds in Dates; all those
that are imported through every
Part of <hi>Europe</hi> come thence; for,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41112:32"/>
the King of <hi>Morocco</hi> will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
any to be exported out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Places. That Fruit is their
daily Food, instead of Bread, with
Camel's Flesh; for, the driness of
the Country affords no sustenance
to other Cattle, unless it be a kind
of Sheep that wears neither Horns
nor Wool, which yet is said to be
always very fat and well-tasted
there: The Horses are fine, and
in great number; and wholly feed
upon Dates.</p>
            <p>Its small extent does not hinder
the King from esteeming and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it is the most Noble of all
these Kingdoms, because among
the <hi>Moors</hi> it passes for the first that
follow'd their Prophet and his <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran;</hi>
so that its Inhabitants, that are
not very numerous, would think
it a dishonour to themselves and
their Law, were they govern'd by
any but the Progeny of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;
which obliges the King to
have always one of his Sons there
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41112:32"/>
as their Governor. He who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
there at present is call'd
<hi>Muley Bensar,</hi> and is no less gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and absolute in point of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
and <hi>Garams</hi> than his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
<hi>Alcaydes</hi> are in other Parts;
this pretended Nobility no excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the People from it.</p>
            <p>That Country produces some
Indico, the Trade of which is
joyn'd by the Inhabitants to that
of their Dates; they also have a
Manufactory of certain Linnen-Cloth,
strip'd with Silk <hi>Moresco</hi>-fashion,
call'd <hi>Hayiks,</hi> which being
much worn through all <hi>Barbary,</hi>
are of a quick sale, and a gainful
Commodity, to their no small Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
towards the Payment of their
<hi>Garams.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ancient Kings of <hi>Tafilet</hi> styl'd
themselves also Lords of <hi>Dara,</hi> a
large Province adjoyning and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Kingdom, and also
much the same with it as to the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41112:33"/>
Soil, Product, Inhabitants, and way
of living.</p>
            <p>This is what, in few words, may
be said, relating to the Extent, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,
and Quality of these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms:
If any is not satisfied with
this compendious Information, he
may, if he pleases, consult <hi>Dapper</hi>
and <hi>Marmol</hi> in their Historical and
Geographical Descriptions of <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi>
As for me, whose Intent is
only to give an Idea of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
State and Government, I
thought it would be sufficient for
my Purpose, to draw this Extract
from the Whole, that I might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
apply it as the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of my Orders and Subject
requir'd it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Moors</hi> are generally but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
Soldiers, and not very
Brave; yet can manage a Horse
and use a Lance with Dexterity,
and are strong and indefatigable;
they have Wit but not Politeness,
and are Jealous, Lustful, Lyars, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41112:33"/>
Hypocrites, Cheats,
Cruel and Faithless. Those that
live along the Coast of <hi>Mauritania
Tingitana,</hi> and in the Kingdom of
<hi>Fess,</hi> are the least unciviliz'd; and
of all the Christians, whose irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable
Enemies they are, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd
with this <hi>inveterate hatred</hi>
by their Law, the <hi>French</hi> are those
they esteem and fear the most.</p>
            <p>I cannot but observe, that were
these Countries in any other Hands
than those of these Infidels, who,
by reason of their native rustical
Temper, and wilful Ignorance (that
makes them confine their Studies
to that of the <hi>Alcoran</hi>) neglect
them, and are incapable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Value, they might be
made a State equally delicious and
flourishing, as well for its Situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Pleasantness and Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brity
of its Climate, temperate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
every where on this side
Mount <hi>Atlas;</hi> as, for the <hi>Fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and other Qualifications of its
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41112:34"/>
hale and hardy Inhabitants, for the
quantity, coolness and wholsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of its Waters, for the plenty
and goodness of the Food it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
for Cattle, Horses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For
the generousness of its Soil, that
yields its Fruits almost without
help, and would be wonderful
Fertile were Care taken to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
it; for the pleasing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
variety of its Woods, Plains,
Mounds, small Hills and Vallies;
for the good Taste of its Pulse,
Kitchen-Herbs, Fruits, and Wine;
and for its convenient Situation
for Trade, and the Transportation
of all its Wares.</p>
            <p>So that I cannot but grieve, when
I think, that so rich a Treasure is,
as it were, buried in the very Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of Sloth, Ignorance, and Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
            <p>I ought now to give a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Account of the Manners, Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and Qualifications of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41112:34"/>
Prince who is Master of that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
            <p>His Name is <hi>Muley Ismael,</hi> and
he takes the Title of <hi>Grand Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe,</hi>
that is, <hi>the First and most Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
of</hi> Mahomet'<hi>s Successors;</hi> for,
as I have said, he pretends to be
descended from that Prophet, by
<hi>Aly</hi> and <hi>Fatima,</hi> his Son-in-Law and
Daughter; and is prouder of this
Parentage than of the long Train
of Kings of his Family: Which
sufficiently shows, that his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
who us'd also to style them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>Miramoulins,</hi> which signifies
<hi>Emperors of the Faithful,</hi> made use
of a Religious Pretence for their
own Establishment.</p>
            <p>And now, since I have mention'd
this, it may not be amiss to say
something of their Religion. The
<hi>Alcoran</hi> is its Foundation, and the
<hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Arabs,</hi> who explain that
Book after a particular way, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the ridiculous Expositions,
which their Doctor <hi>Melish,</hi> one of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41112:35"/>
the four Chiefs of <hi>Mahomet'</hi>s Sect
has left them of it, grounding
their Faith on certain Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Points, without which, they
give out, 'tis impossible to be
sav'd.</p>
            <p>They hold that there is but One
GOD, without any Trinity of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
that JESUS CHRIST was
a great Prophet, born of a Virgin
whose Name was <hi>Mary;</hi> that his
Incarnation was such as we believe
it, and even foretold her by the
Arch-Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> God's Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador;
that he was the holiest of
Men, and wrought many Miracles;
but that he did not die, as we
believe, having been assum'd into
Heaven; where he is in Body and
Soul, and that when <hi>Judas</hi> would
have betray'd him to the <hi>Jews,</hi> one
of his Disciples, whom God caus'd
to appear in his likeness, was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
in his stead, and that 'tis this
Disciple we adore.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:41112:35"/>
They also believe that the same
Jesus Christ is to return to live
forty Years on Earth, to re-unite
all Nations under one Belief; that
he will be laid in the Tomb which
<hi>Mahomet</hi> caus'd to be plac'd on the
Right-hand of his; that those who
profess'd the Doctrine of Christ
till <hi>Mahomet'</hi>s Coming, shall be
sav'd; but that what we now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
differs from what he taught
(which also the persecuting <hi>Jews</hi>
kept him from bringing to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection)
and that therefore those
who will not follow the Precepts
of their Prophet, whom they call
God's great Favorite, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainer
of his Will, and who was
sent by God only to finish what
the other had but begun, are to
be damn'd eternally.</p>
            <p>They admit the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi>
the <hi>Psalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> the Gospel
(as <hi>Sergius</hi> has expounded it to
them) and the <hi>Alcoran</hi> as Holy
Writ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:41112:36"/>
They believe a Heaven and a
Hell, the Resurrection and Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination;
placing the Eternal Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
that are to be the Reward of
the Faithful, in a sight of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Being, of his Angels, and
of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and, besides, in the
Enjoyment of Seventy Virgins,
with whom they are continually
to be wrapt in Extasies of Delight
without impairing, or rather anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilating,
their Virginity; they are
also fondly possess'd with the Hopes
of indulging their Appetites with
all sorts of most delicious Food,
and of bathing themselves in Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of Milk, Honey, and Rose-Water;
nay, they even believe
that the very Excrements of the
Body shall evaporate in most grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Sweats, and that they are to
take up their Lodging in Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-Houses
and stately Palaces,
built with Pearl and precious
Stone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:41112:36"/>
They have a <hi>Lent</hi> or <hi>Ramadan,</hi>
which lasts thirty Days, and keep
it so strictly, that they do not only
religiously abstain from eating or
drinking the least thing, from the
very dawn to the first appearance
of the Stars on the Evening, but
also forbear smoaking Tobacco, and
smelling any Perfumes; indeed I
must needs own that they make
themselves large amends for this
abstinence at Night, passing it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
at that time in all manner
of Luxury and Licentiousness.</p>
            <p>On the Eve of that <hi>Ramadan,</hi>
they prepare themselves for its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
by publick Rejoycings,
that are attended with discharges
of <hi>Fusils</hi> and Muskets, and with
repeated Acclamations of <hi>Allah!</hi>
more like Howlings than joyful
Shouts; every one of them watches
that he may be the first who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scovers
the Moon, and they fire
their Muskets at that Planet as soon
as they perceive it; which done,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41112:37"/>
they meet to say their Prayers,
with their <hi>Marabot</hi> at the head
of them, and kneel, rise, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
themselves on the ground se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times, still turn'd towards the
East. They have three <hi>Easters</hi>
which they keep Holy for seven
days together; however, without
abstaining from Buying or Selling,
as they do on <hi>Fridays,</hi> that are
their Lord's Days.</p>
            <p>The first <hi>Easter</hi> is kept on the
first day of the Moon that comes
after their <hi>Ramadan,</hi> and if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
to fall on a <hi>Saturday,</hi> which is
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> those of
that Nation in this Empire are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd
to present the King with a
Hen and ten Chickens of Gold, or
with the value of them in Money.</p>
            <p>On the first Day of that <hi>Easter,</hi>
the King commonly causes all the
Prisoners in the Town where he
then is, to be brought before him,
and either Absolves them, or puts
them to death, according to their
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41112:37"/>
Crimes and the humour he is in.
He put Twenty Criminals to death
after this manner on the third Day
of this <hi>Easter,</hi> which happen'd to
be the fourth after my arrival at
<hi>Mickeness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second <hi>Easter,</hi> which they
call <hi>The Great,</hi> is twenty Days after
that of <hi>Ramadan:</hi> They use then
to sacrifice to <hi>Mahomet</hi> as many
Sheep as there are Male Children
in each Family, and this in Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Sacrifice which was offer'd
by <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of <hi>Ismael</hi>
the Patriarch of the <hi>Arabian Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,</hi>
from whom they believe their
Prophet's Mother deriv'd her Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.
The King makes a publick
Ceremony of it at a Chappel, or
as they term it, at a Saint about a
quarter of a League from <hi>Micke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
but with the addition of
this superstitious Circumstance: As
soon as the Sheep's Throat has been
cut, (for they take great care not
to kill otherwise all the Animals
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41112:38"/>
they are to eat, believing they
wou'd not bleed enough another
way, which wou'd make them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
and forbidden Flesh) As soon,
I say, as the Sheep's Throat has
been cut, a <hi>Moor</hi> on Horse-back
takes it, wraps it up in a Cloth, and
gallops away with it full speed to
the <hi>Alcassave,</hi> which is the King's
Palace: Now if when he is got
thither, the Sheep is still alive, they
draw a good Omen from it, and
there is great rejoycing: But if it
die by the way, then every one goes
home very doleful, and there is an
end of the Festival.</p>
            <p>The third <hi>Easter,</hi> which falls al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
three Moons and two Days
after the second, is kept in honour
of <hi>Mahomet'</hi>s Birth; and on its first
Day the <hi>Moors</hi> eat Hasty-Pudding
in remembrance of that which was
eaten by that Prophet. They light
great numbers of Lamps and Wax
Tapers in the <hi>Mosques</hi> on the Night
before that <hi>Easter,</hi> and all their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41112:38"/>
               <hi>Talbes</hi> or Priests sing his Praise
without ceasing till Morning.</p>
            <p>They Solemnize St. <hi>John Baptist'</hi>s
Day by Bonefires, which they make
in their Gardens, where they burn
a great deal of Incense round their
Fruit-Trees, to entitle them to the
Blessing of Heaven.</p>
            <p>They admit of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> but
neither fix the Age of those that
are to be Circumcis'd, nor the time
when.</p>
            <p>They all say the <hi>Sala,</hi> or Prayer
(which they also call the <hi>Masse</hi>) four
times a Day, and once a Night, at
certain set hours, which are denoted
to them by the Cries, or to speak
more properly, by the Howlings,
which those who are appointed to
do that Office, make from the top
of those <hi>Gemmes,</hi> or <hi>Mosques;</hi> for,
the use of Bells is neither known
nor allow'd in their Religion.</p>
            <p>They very often wash their
Heads, Hands and Feet, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to cleanse and purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41112:39"/>
from all Sins by that means.
When-ever a Man has had private
converse with his Wife, or been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of some sin, he is enjoyn'd to wash
every part of his Body, none being
excepted, or repeat these words,
which are the most Sacred in their
Religion; <hi>La illa illenla</hi> Mahamet
<hi>Dara zoulla;</hi> which signifie, <hi>There
is but one God, and</hi> Mahomet <hi>is his
Messenger;</hi> for they pretend that
these words have the same efficacy
as the <hi>Bath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They never go into their <hi>Mosques</hi>
otherwise than bare-foot, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the same Formality when
they pay Visits to one another, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
leaving their <hi>Baboushes</hi> or
Shoes, at the Door of the <hi>Mosque</hi>
or House where they go in.</p>
            <p>They believe that all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
that die before they are Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
whether they be <hi>Christians,
Jews,</hi> or <hi>Pagans,</hi> go to Heaven;
but that if they live longer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
owning <hi>Mahomet</hi> as God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41112:39"/>
they are eternally undone;
however, they except the Maids,
who, having preserv'd their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity,
are reserv'd, as they pretend,
to fill up the number of Seventy,
that are to be at the disposal of
every <hi>Muslulman</hi> in Paradise, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impossible that so great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of their Religion shou'd be
found in proportion to the Men.</p>
            <p>They say that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
them to compel those, by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
usage, to profess its Doctrine,
who do not voluntarily submit to
do so.</p>
            <p>They have such a hatred for the
Name of a <hi>Christian,</hi> which in their
tongue also signifies a <hi>Dog,</hi> that they
use it as the most common and most
reproachful Term among them,
never speaking it without adding,
<hi>God confound him,</hi> or <hi>God burn his
Father and Mother:</hi> Such Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
against the <hi>Christians</hi> are the
first words their Children are taught
to utter; and when any <hi>Christians</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:41112:40"/>
are seen at <hi>Mickeness,</hi> they are sure
to be expos'd to the Curses and
Hootings of the whole Town, and
particularly of the young Fry, some
of which follow them merely to
bellow out a volley of abusive
words, or to throw Stones at them.</p>
            <p>They also firmly believe, that
those who are kill'd fighting with
<hi>Christians,</hi> go straight to Heaven;
and that they deserve no less than
an infinite Reward for destroying
those Enemies to the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> nay,
that the very Horses which are
kill'd in such Engagements, are to
go to Heaven with them.</p>
            <p>They have a very odd Maxim
concerning the Truth and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of their Words; for, Lying
and breaking their Promises, are
things of so establish'd a practice
among them, that they rather pass
there for Vertues than for Vices:
Insomuch, that one of their <hi>Talbs,</hi>
to whom I once express'd my sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
at this ill practise, made no
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41112:40"/>
scruple to own to me, that this
made one of the chief Distinctions
between their Religion and ours;
persuaded, they would soon, like
us, be Slaves to a false Belief and
Idolatry, were they, like us also,
Slaves to their Words and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>
            <p>Tho' they admit a Plurality of
Wives, they are allow'd to Marry
but four, and on them too they
are to settle a Dowry; however,
they may make themselves amends
with as many Concubines as they
can afford to keep, and may put
them all away when ever they will,
paying the former their Dowry,
and selling the latter, who are
their Slaves, or turning 'em out of
doors, yet keeping their Children.</p>
            <p>They esteem all Ideots and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Fools to be Saints, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the same of those who have
any knack at Conjuring, whom
they think to have the Spirit of
their Prophet; after the death of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41112:41"/>
these they build Chappels over their
Graves, go thither in Pilgrimage, and
upon occasion take Sanctuary there,
no places of Refuge being more
Sacred and inviolable to secure
them from the punishment of their
Crimes, or the anger of their Kings.</p>
            <p>They are wholly given up to a
thousand other Superstitions no less
odd and ridiculous; as when they
except against the Testimony of
those among themselves, whom
they can prove addicted to make
Water standing, their way being
to do it stooping like Women;
but, because an account of all these
whimsical Customs wou'd take up
too much time, and perhaps be
thought foreign to my Subject, I
will say no more on that Head at
this time.</p>
            <p>However, I must observe, that
their Women do not enter into the
<hi>Mosques,</hi> because they esteem them
uncapable of being receiv'd into
Heaven, as having been created,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41112:41"/>
they tell you, only for the sake of
propagating Mankind; yet they
say their Prayers at home; and, on
<hi>Fridays,</hi> resort to the Burying-places,
to pray and weep over the
Graves of their dead Relations;
at which time they are cloath'd in
Blue, which is the Badge of Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in their Country, as Black is
in ours.</p>
            <p>And here I think I ought not to
forget the Grief they shew at the
Death of their Friends and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
it is generally very great,
and, when the Person was of Note,
they commonly hire some Women,
who weep plentifully, and make
a very sad moan, beating their
Heads and scratching their Faces.</p>
            <p>Before the Corps is buried, 'tis
wash'd and wrap'd in a new Shroud,
then carried in a Bier, follow'd by
a great number of People, who
walk very fast, invoking God and
<hi>Mahomet</hi> aloud.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:41112:42"/>
The Dead are buried out of
Town in a Grave which is narrow
at the top and wide at bottom,
that it may be more easily fill'd
up, and that the Corps lying there
more at large, as they think, may
be in greater readiness at the Day
of Judgment, and lose no time in
seeking its Bones; for which reason
also they forbear burying two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in one Grave. Meat is also
laid on those Graves; and Money
and Jewels are buried with the
Dead, that they may not want in
the next World the conveniencies
they had in this.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> are so
strictly forbidden going into the
<hi>Mosques,</hi> that when any of them
are seen there, they must absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
abjure their Religion, or be burnt
without Mercy; and the same Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
is observ'd if they are found
to have too close and particular
a Converse with the <hi>Mahometan</hi>
Women.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:41112:42"/>
This Circumstance is also to be
remembred, That the <hi>Jews</hi> are not
allowed at any time to pass by a
<hi>Mosque</hi> without taking off their
Shoes, and are even obliged to go
bare-foot in Royal Cities, as <hi>Fess,
Morocco, Mickeness,</hi> &amp;c. on pain of
the Bastonado or Imprisonment;
from which they are not freed till
they have paid a great Fine.</p>
            <p>I must also abserve, before I have
done with the Religion of the
<hi>Moors,</hi> that their <hi>Alcoran</hi> forbids
'em to play at any hazardous Games
for Money, and that those who dare
break this Law are punishable with
the Bastonado, a Fine, or Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
so they only play at Chess,
Draughts, and a kind of Tictack,
quite different from others; neither
do they make any great use of all
these, and I did not perceive by
those I frequented, that they are
much given to Gaming. They are
not much more addicted to Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and it may very justly be said,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41112:43"/>
That Sleeping, Eating, Drinking,
Women, Horses, and Prayers share
and almost wholly engross their
time, the remainder of which is
generally linger'd out in a tedious
and unuseful Sloth; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
they are often seen sitting on
their Heels along the Walls, with
long Strings of Beads, which tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
through their Fingers with a
nimbleness equal to the shortness
of the Prayers they say at the
dropping of each Bead; for, that
Prayer barely consists in mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one of the different Attributes
of God; as in saying on one Bead,
God is Great; on another, God is
Good; on a third, God is Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite;
on a fourth, God is Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ought not to forget the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Veneration they have for
those who have been in Pilgrimage
to <hi>Mecca;</hi> they call them <hi>Hadgys,</hi>
or Saints, and are so Supersitious
on their account, that they also e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41112:43"/>
their Horses to be holy as
their Masters. They wrap the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
in Shrowds, and bury them
when they die as they would their
greatest Friends and Relations,
thinking it a Pleasure and Duty
to visit them often and see them
feed.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Morocco</hi> had one
of these Horses: The first time I
was admitted into his Presence it
was led in State just before him;
and, besides the particular Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which appear'd by the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Saddle and Harness, his
Tail was held up by a Christian
Slave, who carried a Pot and a
Cloth to receive his Excrements
and wipe him. I was told that
the King from time to time went
to kiss that Horse's Tail and
Feet.</p>
            <p>All the Horses who are thus
sanctified, are usually freed from
all manner of Service; and, if the
Masters cannot afford to keep 'em,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41112:44"/>
some Pensions are settled on them
for their Subsistance out of the
neighbouring <hi>Mosques.</hi> They are
distinguish'd by the Beads or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
about their Necks, the latter
of which are nothing but some
Writings wrapt up in Silks or
Cloth of Gold, containing the
Names of their Prophet and some
pretended Saints of their Law.
They also are as so many Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
for Criminals, like the Towns
and Chappels of the Saints already
mention'd.</p>
            <p>These Places, which are to be
seen in many Parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
are, according to their bigness,
the dwelling of one or more <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabots</hi>
or <hi>Talbs,</hi> the Priests of the
<hi>Moors,</hi> who may marry, and are
very much esteem'd there, chiefly
by the <hi>Arabs;</hi> they are maintain'd
according to the Ability or Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Founders, and lead a
lazy and luxurious Life, at the
Expence of those deluded Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41112:44"/>
who esteem themselves hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in being able to bestow large
Donations on them while they live,
or bequeath to them when they die.
<hi>Methinks these Places, and their
Foundations, may justly enough be
compar'd to our Abbeys, Priories,
and Chappels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bur resuming the Idea of the
King of <hi>Morocco'</hi>s Picture, which I
had begun, I shall observe that he
is between forty nine and fifty Years
of Age, of a tawny Complexion,
and lean; his Hair is black, but
begins to turn grey; he's of a
middle size; his Face oval; his
Cheeks hollow, as well as his Eyes,
which are black and sparkling; his
Nose is little and hook'd; his
Chin sharp; his Lips thick, and his
Mouth pretty well proportion'd:
He's extream Covetous and Cruel;
Interest and an excessive love of
Money can almost make him do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, and he's so much deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in spilling Blood with his own
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41112:45"/>
Hands, that 'tis generally believ'd
he must have put above Twenty
thousand Persons to death himself,
during the twenty Years that he
has fill'd the Throne.</p>
            <p>I am the rather inclin'd to believe
or confirm this, having my self
reckon'd up no less than Forty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
whom he killed during my
one and twenty Days stay at his
Court: And, besides, he was not
asham'd to appear before me at the
last Audience he gave me by the
Gate of his Stables, himself being
on Horse-back, with his Cloths and
Right-Arm all imbru'd with the
Blood of two of his Chief <hi>Blacks,</hi>
whom he had just butcher'd with a
Knife.</p>
            <p>Every Nation is amaz'd to find
his Subjects so submissive and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
under so excessive and cruel
a Tyranny; but they must know,
that not to speak of the general
and particular want of Power to
oppose it, they so fondly believe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41112:45"/>
that dying thus by the Hands of a
King who is a <hi>Xerif,</hi> and descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from their Prophet, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
go to Heaven, that the
greatest part among them esteem
that a Happiness which a smaller
and more judicious Number abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate,
but cannot hinder; and
indeed the latter keep at a distance
from him as much as they can, and
think themselves as happy in not
seeing him, as the mad Herd in
being kill'd by him.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding this, 'tis said
this Prince is of a pretty good
Temper when his Passion is over;
but he's subject to violent Caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o's,
that are the more dangerous;
for being always cover'd with the
Cloak of Religion, of which he
affects to appear an exact Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
and he is so firmly persuaded
that his Subjects think him such,
that for that reason, and being full
of that prevention, he assumes
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41112:46"/>
a License of doing whatever he
pleases.</p>
            <p>He only studies to be fear'd by
his Subjects, and cares very little
whether they love him or no; and
therefore they generally tremble
when they come near him, and
tho' they approach him out of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
never do it out of Good-will;
the rather, because none ought to
come into his Presence but by his
Order or Permission, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Presents.</p>
            <p>He has a great deal of Wit and
Courage, is Active, Indefatigable
and very Dexterous at all Martial
Sports, as Running with the Lance
and Horse-Exercises; in which
Pastimes I must observe, by the
way, that all the <hi>Moors</hi> are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
expert, and in this do not
seem to have in the least degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from what History so much
celebrates the ancient People of
<hi>Granada</hi> for in their Turnaments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:41112:46"/>
He drinks no Wine because his
Religion forbids it; but when he
takes Opium, or drinks a certain
Hypocras that he makes himself
with Brandy, Cloves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Anniseed,
Cinnamon and Nutmegs, which
happens pretty often, woe to him
that comes in his way when the
Fumes are got up into his Head.
'Tis also not very safe to meet him
when he's cloath'd in a yellow Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit;
for it has been long observ'd
that this Colour is a dangerous O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
when he wears it, and almost
generally fatal to some of those
who come near him at that time:
He had a Vest on of that Colour
when he gave me the Audience of
Leave all bloody; as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd.</p>
            <p>He's very much given to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and has near Four hundred
in his <hi>Alcassave</hi> for his own use, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
about Five hundred others to
wait upon these: He has One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and eighteen Male Children
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41112:47"/>
now living, besides Daughters, who
are not reckon'd, and may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two hundred: He only takes
the Sons from his Concubines,
whom he often changes, and leaves
them the Daughters, without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
them so much as will keep
'em.</p>
            <p>He's married only to four of all
these Women; his Law not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
him to have more Wives:
The rest are his Concubines and
Slaves. He's wholly govern'd by
one of these Creatures, who is a
<hi>Black,</hi> and has no manner of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
She's the Mother of that Son
whom he seems to design for his
Successor; and whom he causes to
be called <hi>Muley Zeydan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He affects to appear modest and
humble, and always makes God
the Author of the Good and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
which he does; yet he is
very vain and fond of Ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:41112:47"/>
He is Absolute in his Dominions,
and <hi>often compares himself to the
Emperor of</hi> France, <hi>who, he says, is
the only Prince that knows how to
reign like him, and make his Will
a Law.</hi> He often mentions a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which he pretends was written
by his Prophet to <hi>Heraclius,</hi> and
adds, that all the Prosperities of the
Kings of <hi>France</hi> wholly proceed
from the Religious Care they have
always taken to preserve it. As
for the rest of the Christian Princes,
he looks upon them as depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on their Subjects, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
speaks of 'em but with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>'Twas in this Sense, that to heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the great Encomiums he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on the King, in the first
Audience he gave me by the Gate
of his <hi>Alcassave</hi> or Palace, in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mean Habit, his Face muffled
up in a Snuff-Handkerchief, of a
dirty hue, his Arms and Legs bare,
sitting without Matt or Carpet
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41112:48"/>
on a Threshold by two wooden
Posts which supported the Porch,
some <hi>Alcaydes</hi> sitting by him bare-foot
on the Ground: It was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
in that Sense, I say, that, to
make me sensible of the just dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
he puts between the King
and the other Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi>
he told me, That the Emperor of
<hi>Germany</hi> was only the Companion
of his Electors; that the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> was less Master of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
than his Ministers; that the
King of <hi>England</hi> depends on his
Parliament; and that he look'd
upon all the rest as having more
the appearance of Authority than
the Thing it self.</p>
            <p>However, notwithstanding this
Absolute and Personal Empire,
with the Enjoyment of which he
flatters himself, there are few
Princes whose Minds are more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
to be prejudic'd and seduc'd
than his: Insomuch that such of
his <hi>Alcaydes</hi> as are nearest his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41112:48"/>
know how to byass and lead
him as they please; principally,
when the pretence of Religion,
Interest, or Vanity can be brought
in, to make him pliable to what
suits with their Designs.</p>
            <p>This vanity is never better gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
than when some Christian
Prince sends him Ambassadors;
then his Joy cannot be express'd, and
he always kisses the Ground when
he first spies them, and even in their
presence, in token of his thanks to
Heaven for the mighty Blessing.
'Twas thus he behaved himself as
soon as he discover'd me on a pretty
high Wall not yet finish'd, where I
had been plac'd without Seats, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
or Foot-cloth, that I might be a
Spectator by his order, of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
of 10000 Horse and 2000
Foot, which he made on purpose
for me hard by the Town; who
after they had moved some time
without order, and with great
Shouts, filed off by that Wall, all
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41112:49"/>
of them discharging their Arms
in my Face, to do me, as they
said, the greater Honour: 'Tis
true, this is their way of shewing
their Respects to each other, and
they do the same to their Princes
and Generals.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Morocco</hi> makes no
Distinction between Ambassadors,
but according to their Qualities
and their Station near their Masters.
But above all, when they bring
him Rich Presents.</p>
            <p>His Predecessors and Himself
have so well establish'd the Custom,
or, to speak more properly, the
Duty of bringing those Presents,
that they have, as it were, made
it a Law to bring them, which
their Subjects and all Foreigners
who come to their Court must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
it being not Lawful to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
there without them. 'Tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
an essential Article of their
Ceremonies relating to Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
always to begin the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41112:49"/>
that is made them by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Questions, yet softned with
some preliminary Excuse and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility:
<hi>Who are ye? Whence come
ye? What's your Business? What
do you bring?</hi> And 'tis according
as they answer to the last of these
Questions, that the manner of their
Reception and Usage are regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>'Tis also with a prospect and
desire of procuring such Presents,
that this Prince uses all imaginable
means to get Ambassadors sent him,
or to engage other States to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them; yet, when he either
desires or promises Ambassadors of
an Eminent Quality, 'tis to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
he does it much less out of
a desire of paying or receiving a
particular Respect, than to get
large Presents, always esteeming
they ought to be proportionable
to their Quality.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, he imagines that
his Greatness never appears or
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41112:50"/>
evinces it self better than by lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them; and for that reason there
is no manner of difficulty that can
be raised, or Tricks and Subtilties
that can be devis'd, but what are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
by his Ministers to succeed
in this. They also try'd with all
imaginable cunning and stiffness,
to make me submit to the Rules
which they think they have esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
by their violent proceedings
with the late Ambassadors of some
other Crowns. But that the King
might not be expos'd to resent such
an usage, I omitted nothing in that
juncture to make 'em sensible of
the difference between his Majesty
and all other Princes, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
these assuming Endeavours
with so many Reasons, and with so
much firmness and patience, that
I had the satisfaction to see, by the
Success which even his Majesty has
honour'd with his Approbation, that
I had inspir'd into them the just
Idea they were to have of whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41112:50"/>
relates to the Merit, the Power
and the Glory of his Majesty.</p>
            <p>'Tis said, that this Prince has
taken a solemn Oath never to set
free the Christian Slaves that are
under his Power, till, at least, as
many of his own Subjects be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
for 'em; and the last
Treaties which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made
with him of Ten, and since that
lately, of Four <hi>Moors</hi> for One
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> have so puff'd him up
with Pride and Presumption on
that account, that they have almost
made it impossible for other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to Treat with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mickeness</hi> is the place where he
usually resides; 'tis a little Inland
Town about 40 Leagues from <hi>Sally,</hi>
60 from <hi>Tetuan,</hi> and 12 from <hi>Fess.</hi>
'Tis very populous, having above
60000 Inhabitants, but so ill built
and unpleasant in it self, that it
might well pass for a pittiful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Town, were it not for the great
number of its Inhabitants, its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41112:51"/>
Presence and his <hi>Alcassave</hi> that
graces it, and which is almost as
large as the Town, and of a
Structure far above what I could
have thought it to have been, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to all the other Edifices I
had seen before in that Country.</p>
            <p>That Palace shews it self above
the Town, and has many Walls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it that are very high, very
thick, and very white; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
of a great number of <hi>Pavilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
or small distinct Buildings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
its two Mosques, whose <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narets</hi>
are of a considerable height.
As that Building is the first thing
that strikes the Eye when we come
near the Town, it gives a very
great Idea of it self; but it is much
lessen'd by a nearer view; for,
the whole is built with so little Art
and Regularity, that it would
puzzle the most skilfull Architect to
find out its true Disposition and
Design; and I am even persuaded
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41112:51"/>
by what I could inferr from its
outside, (for I was not permitted
to see it within) that the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who is the Author and Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of that Fabrick, cannot give
an account of it, and that he has
no other design in pulling down
and building up, as he does every
day, than to bring under, by hard
Labour and Servitude, a great
number of his Subjects whom he
employs in that Work; which is
also the usual Employment and
Punishment of the Christian Slaves,
who are forc'd to work there at
all times, and without ceasing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
Labourers and Masons thro'
Bastonadoes and Misery, under the
load of which they sink the sooner,
their daily Food barely consisting
in a very small pittance of very
brown, or rather black Barley
Bread, with Water, and lodging
only in <hi>Matamorres</hi> or Subterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
places, in which the bare
Ground is their only Bed, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41112:52"/>
they breath a very bad Air, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with noisome Smells.</p>
            <p>However, amongst this sort of
Slavery, which is so cruel and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable,
there appears a kind of
Humanity, that one wou'd not in
the least expect from that Prince's
Barbarity: For, neither Women
nor married Men are oblig'd to
Work; the former on account of
their Native weakness, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
because they say, the Charge
of a Wife, and the use they ought
to make of her, are sufficient to
excuse 'em from being incumbred
with additional Drudgeries: But
this kind of Compassion is very
much disfigured by his Avarice,
which inclines him to give 'em no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to subsist.</p>
            <p>Those who become Renegades,
are also exempted from Working,
but they are no less Slaves; for
the King makes 'em keep Guard at
his Gates, or sends them to his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caydes
in the Provinces, and these
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41112:52"/>
employ 'em in things suitable to
their Strength and Capacity. He
takes 'em with him into the Field,
and, in Engagements, always places
'em in the Front, where, if they
betray but the least design of giving
way, he cuts 'em in pieces.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Alcassave</hi> has about 45 Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments,
each of which has a
Fountain in its Yard: Its chief
Gate is very Stately, and has some
Pillars whence 'tis called the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Gate.</hi> The only Regular Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
in that Palace, are the two
Mosques and a <hi>Mishuart,</hi> or large
Yard, adorn'd within with Pillars
and <hi>Bas-reliefs</hi> of Marble, without
any figures of Animals, but with
Cyphers and <hi>Arabick</hi> Characters, in
which the most considerable of the
King's Military Exploits are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
            <p>The Stables, which they call
<hi>Rooes,</hi> are also very fine, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
of two long Galleries all Arch'd
to the right and left, there being
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41112:53"/>
from space to space, in the middle
of a kind of pav'd Way which parts
'em, some little <hi>Pavillions</hi> or Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-Houses,
that are very neat, in
each of which is a Fountain and a
Watering-place for Horses, that,
as every one knows, are extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fine in that Country, but none
of which the <hi>Moors</hi> will suffer to
be Exported on any account what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
for any Christian Country,
out of an erroneous Maxim, which
makes 'em esteem it a wrong done
to their Religion to supply us with
any, or with Corn: They have
the same Bigotry about Books,
which are there the more curious
and scarce, there being now few
or no Printing-Houses in those
Parts.</p>
            <p>The King's Gardens are in the
middle of a vast Grove of Olive-Trees,
and may be said to be fine;
Flowers, Fruits, Kitchen-Herbs, and
Trees of all sorts are to be seen
there in every Season of the Year,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41112:53"/>
but, as they lie somewhat far from
the <hi>Alcassave,</hi> this distance, which
makes 'em less convenient, causes
'em also to seem less pleasant. The
Walks are very narrow; there are
no Water-works, but some Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
glide through the Place and
serve to Water it. A <hi>Spanish</hi> Slave
whose Name is <hi>Antonio Lopes</hi> has
the Care of it. This Man seems
to be of a good Extraction, and is
kindly us'd by the King; but the
useful and profitable Service he
does him, keeps that Prince from
suffering or even promising him
ever to return to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>There are some goodly Palaces
near the King's, which are built by
some of the <hi>Alcaydes,</hi> to ingratiate
themselves with him, tho' they can
hardly expect to enjoy 'em secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
being made but too sensible by
an Experience fatal to some of
their Rank, that they shall not be
Masters of 'em any longer than till
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41112:54"/>
that Prince takes a fansie to make
'em his own.</p>
            <p>There is an Hospital at <hi>Micke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> has
lately founded there, for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting
and Relieving of Slaves,
and which is indeed a very great
help to 'em: 'Tis capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
a hundred sick Persons.
Four Recollet-Monks and a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
are constantly kept there, for
whose Subsistance his Catholick
Majesty, who caused it to be built,
has settled a Fund of Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Crowns Yearly. Neither the
Hospital nor the Religious Men
who belong to it are suffer'd in the
Town, but on account of some
Tribute, no more than are those
of <hi>Fess, Sally,</hi> and <hi>Tetuan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are in this Town, as in all
the rest of <hi>Africa,</hi> several Schools
where Children are taught to Read,
Write, Cypher, and nothing else.
When they are corrected, 'tis with
a very flat wooden Rod, with
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41112:54"/>
which they are struck on the Soles
of their Feet. All their Study con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in reading the <hi>Alcoran</hi> from
the beginning to the end, and when
a Boy has gone through his Book,
he's finely set out, and his School-fellows
lead him a Horse-back
through the Town, as it were in
Triumph, and proclaim his Praise.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> inhabit a particular
and pretty large Part of the Town;
the Place where they live is no
Neater than those where some of
their Nation dwell in other Cities.
There may be about Sixteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of 'em in the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and their Head chiefly resides
at <hi>Mickeness;</hi> it being his business
to assess 'em, and collect the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and extraordinary <hi>Garams</hi> they
are to pay. He who is in that Station
at present is one <hi>Abraham Mayma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi>
who has lost one of his Eyes, and
does not seem over-stock'd with
Sense, but is in Favour with the
King on account of the frequent
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41112:55"/>
Presents he makes him, and of the
Services he does him on any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
'Tis also by his Management
that this Prince keeps a Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
both Pecuniary and Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
with other Nations, whether
Friends or Foes. That <hi>Jew</hi> and
his Family live in a very fine House,
but all the rest have very mean Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations.</p>
            <p>Tho' they are so numerous in
these Parts, and so beneficial to
the State, they are not more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
there than in other Places;
for they are always pitch'd upon
for the meanest Employments; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but their Food is allow'd
'em for the Work and Drudgeries
they are often commanded to do.
And they are so often tax'd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil'd,
curs'd, and bastonado'd, that
they may be look'd upon as the
common Mark and perpetual Sport
of the Avarice and Injustice of the
Great, and the Aversion of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:41112:55"/>
'Tis not Lawful for 'em to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themselves against the least
Child who gives 'em ill Words, or
throws Stones at 'em; and they are
to be known from the <hi>Moors,</hi> who
always wear red Caps, by the
black Caps and <hi>Bernous</hi> they are
oblig'd to wear.</p>
            <p>Every where they live apart
from the <hi>Moors,</hi> and the Entrance
into the Place where they dwell
is guarded by some Men whom the
King appoints for that purpose,
that they may not be disturb'd in
their Business and Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
but they dare not travel
through the Country alone, or
without some <hi>Moors</hi> to protect
them; for, the <hi>Arabs</hi> and <hi>Barbarians</hi>
would certainly cut their Throats
without Mercy.</p>
            <p>However, notwithstanding, all
these outward Marks of Misery
and Scorn, in the main, they are
Richer and in a better Condition
than the <hi>Moors</hi> themselves; the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41112:56"/>
reason of which is, that they Work
and Trade, but the <hi>Moors</hi> do not;
and indeed the <hi>Jews</hi> Wives wear
most of 'em good Clothes; and, as
they do not hide their Faces like
the <hi>Moorish</hi> Women, they take
more Care of their Head-dress and
other Attire.</p>
            <p>For my part, having seen none
but <hi>Jewish</hi> Women there, I must
own that I have found several of
'em so agreeable and beautiful,
that I don't doubt but the same
Idea may reasonably be form'd of
the other <hi>African</hi> Women, whom
the Jealousie of the Men, and the
Custom of the Country, oblige to
hide themselves much more than
their own Inclination; for, 'tis
certain, that the Reservedness and
Restraint, in which the <hi>Moors</hi> keep
their Wives, serve rather to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
the Desire, which they have
naturally to run astray, than to sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle
it; and that, as these Women
have more Wit and Vivacity
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41112:56"/>
than those of <hi>Europe,</hi> these Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
inable 'em to out-do 'em
in all the Arts and Tricks by which
they may gratifie their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>They are particularly fond of
Christians because they are not
Circumcis'd, and there are no Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems
but what are us'd by some
of 'em, to intice the Slaves that
live with them, or who are allow'd
to come where they dwell.</p>
            <p>But a certain Ceremony which
is perform'd at their Weddings,
does not a little contribute to the
keeping of them in, till that time,
unless they act with a great deal
of Caution; for, when the Friends
on both sides are agreed, the Bride,
quite cover'd with a Veil, is carried
in Publick, Trumpets sounding,
and Hautboys playing, to the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms
Dwelling, and he is not
allow'd to uncover her Face, nor
look on any part of her Body, till
he has found her to be a Maid;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41112:57"/>
which done, he pulls off her Veil,
and takes off his Drawers, dy'd in
the Action, and throws 'em in the
Yard; whereupon the Women,
who had brought her thither, take
'em up singing and dancing for
Joy that she is receiv'd to be his
Wife: But if he does not find her
to be a Virgin, he has her stripp'd
of her Wedding Clothes, turns
her out of Doors without seeing
her Face, and sends her back to
her Father, whom the Law permits
to strangle her, if he has a mind to
proceed to that severity.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Moors</hi> Marry, they
send for a Cady and a Publick No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary;
the latter draws up an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
in which he sets down
the Dowry which the Husband
settles on the Wife; for, Parents
give nothing to their Daughters;
and when a Husband puts away his
Wife he's oblig'd to give her the
promis'd Dowry, and cannot mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
till four Months after; but when
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41112:57"/>
'tis the Wife that leaves the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
the Law does not give her
any thing.</p>
            <p>The fattest and biggest Women
are the most admir'd in those Parts;
for which reason that Sex never
put on any stiff-body'd Gowns, or
other streight and close Dresses
that they may become such. But this
also makes their Breasts lank and
flabby to an odious excess: They
all wear Scarves, which they tye
about their Waste, and generally
keep their Body very neat, tho'
they always go bare-leg'd: They
use a great deal of Vermilion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their Cheeks and Lips, black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their Eye-brows with the
Smoke of Galls: They colour the
Soles of their Feet and the inside
of their Hands with yellow, and
their Nails with red, and set out
their Necks, Ears, Arms and Legs
with Neck-Laces, Pendents, Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
and a world of trifling Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaws,
never thinking themselves
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41112:58"/>
handsom if they want any of these
borrow'd Ornaments.</p>
            <p>When they go abroad, they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
themselves with a large white
and very thin Veil, and muffle up
the middle of their Faces, that
they may not be seen, their Eyes
only uncover'd, that they may see
their way: They never speak to
any Man they meet, tho' 'twere
their own Husband, who could
not then know his own Wife; for
they are all cover'd alike; but
they take off all this when they
come into the Chamber of any of
their She-Friends, and are very
careful to leave their Shooes at the
Chamber-door, that the Master of
the House may not come in there;
for if he did, the Husband of the
Visitant would take it very ill.</p>
            <p>Tho' they have but one Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
amongst many, and most of
'em live together, they are not Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of one another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:41112:58"/>
No Man but their Husband is
admitted to see 'em in their Houses;
and when some Friends are invited
to a Treat, which seldom happens
there, the Man's Wives go to the
top of the House, which is like a
Terrass, or into some upper Room,
and stay there till the Guests are
gone; which always makes the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
very short; neither do
they stay to talk and divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
together, as we do in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The manner of eating amongst
the <hi>Moors,</hi> is to sit on the Ground
without Shooes, Master and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
together, round a large piece
of Leather, which is always very
greasie, and serves both for Table
and Table-Cloth. Their standing
Dish is some <hi>Cooscoosoos,</hi> a Paste
made with fine Flower, which
looks much like our sugar'd Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed,
and has been boil'd with
some young Pidgeons, Fowls, or
Mutton: They cram down this
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41112:59"/>
               <hi>Cooscoosoos</hi> by handfuls, and make
a kind of little Pellets of it, which
they fling into their Mouths; and
throw back into the Dish (which is
narrow at bottom and broad at
top, not altogether unlike a Stool-Pan)
what stuck to their Beard
or greasie Fists. As for Flesh, when
they would take up a bit, and part
it from the whole, as they never
put but their Right-hand in the
Dish, every one pulls his piece, as
a Pack of Hounds does Carrion,
till they tear it asunder; and all
this without speaking a Word du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the whole Meal.</p>
            <p>Those who live a little better,
after that Dish, which is generally
attended with a Salad, have a Brass-Bason
or Earthen-Platter of Meat
<hi>fricaseed</hi> with Honey and Almonds,
or broil'd on the Flames, or fry'd
in Oil, and some other Sweet-Meats,
after their way, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Desert;</hi> and after they have
done eating, they wipe their Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41112:59"/>
on the Edge of the Dish, or
lick 'em with their Tongue.</p>
            <p>They drink nothing but Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
because their <hi>Alcoran</hi> forbids
'em Wine, tho' not Brandy, with
which they often get drunk, using
all the same Vessel: They love al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
very much our <hi>Provence</hi> Ros-Solis,
Ratafia, Cette, and Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Water,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Sherbet and
Coffee, so used in the <hi>Levant,</hi> are
not known to 'em.</p>
            <p>The Stable is the Place which
they most commonly chuse to eat
in; and they have no other Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
after they have fill'd their
Bellies, than to visit their Wives or
their Horses.</p>
            <p>Now that I have spoke of the
<hi>Moors</hi> manner of Eating, I think
I may add a Word of their Dress.</p>
            <p>The Men wear a Shirt that is
pretty short, with broad Sleeves,
that sometimes hang down, but
more frequently are turn'd up to
their Shoulders, chiefly in Summer;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41112:60"/>
in which Season they go with bare
Arms. Under that Shirt they wear
Linnen-Drawers, that reach only
to their Knees, and leave their Legs
naked to their Feet: They have
Shooes, or rather Slippers, without
Heel's, call'd <hi>Baboushes;</hi> the <hi>Mara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts</hi>
or <hi>Talbs</hi> wear certain Pieces
cut on the Edges like a Flower-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luce,
and 'tis only by that Mark
that they are to be known and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd
from the rest.</p>
            <p>They all wear a <hi>Cafetan</hi> or
Cloth-Vest without Sleeves, of any
Colour which they fansie most, and
about this Vest a Silk Scarf, in the
fore-part of which they put a
Sheath with two or three Knives,
the Handles of which, as also the
Tip of the Sheath, they always co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
to have of some costly Metal,
or of some extraordinary Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship:
Over this <hi>Cafetan,</hi> which
is only button'd to the Girdle, they
wear a <hi>Hayick,</hi> which is a Piece of
very fine white Woollen-Stuff, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41112:60"/>
five Ells long, and one and
a half broad, and cover their Head
and whole Body with it, wrapping
themselves up in it above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Arms, not much unlike
what is to be seen in the Drape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Antique Figures of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and <hi>Israelites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They wear over all this, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
in Winter, a <hi>Bernooe,</hi> or kind
of Stuff or Cloath Cloak, edg'd
with a Fringe, whence there hangs
a kind of a Cowle behind with a
Tuft at the end on't.</p>
            <p>When they go into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
they wear a Straw Hat, but
every where else they have on their
Heads, which they always keep
shav'd, only a red Woollen Cap,
about which sometimes they put
some Muslin to make a Turbant,
provided it be not in their King's
presence; for, before him none of
'em, of what quality soever, dare
appear otherwise than with a plain
Cap on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:41112:61"/>
None but the <hi>Xeriffs,</hi> or <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met'</hi>s
Posterity, have leave to wear
a green Cap; and as for the <hi>Jews,</hi>
they are oblig'd to wear none but
black; the younger sort wear none
at all, and must go bare till they
are Twenty, unless they be Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
or either they or their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have been at <hi>Mecca,</hi> in which
cases they are allow'd to wear a
Cap when they are Fourteen.</p>
            <p>This is the Dress which all the
<hi>Moors</hi> wear, there being no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
between 'em but what
consists in the Richness of their
<hi>Cafetans,</hi> or the fineness of their
<hi>Hayicks:</hi> The <hi>Alcaydes</hi> alone are
to be known from the rest by some
Leathern Belts, Embroider'd with
Gold, which they wear over the
Shoulder, and in 'em a Scimeter; and
over this they have a <hi>Bernoo</hi> of Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
or black Cloth, without a Cowle;
even the King himself does not
go otherwise dress'd, but indeed
he always has a Coat of Mail un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41112:61"/>
his Shirt, to secure himself
from such secret Attempts as he
knows his Cruelty cannot but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire.</p>
            <p>The King's Blacks, who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
for his Guard, are also dress'd
in the like manner, and very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently,
and are seldom seen to wear
<hi>Bernoos,</hi> but generally Silk Stockins,
which they very much fancy; they
wear Scimeters, and when they are
a Horse-back, have always Lances
or Fusils.</p>
            <p>The Womens Dress is somewhat
like the Mens, from which it differs
only in the Sleeves of their Smocks
that cover their Arms, and are close
to the Wrist, and in the length of
their Drawers that come down to
the Calves of their Legs: The
Neck-bands of their Smocks are
Plaited, and commonly Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd;
their Vest is open before
to the Waste; they fasten some
large pieces of Muslin to the Sleeves
of these Vests, which would be
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41112:62"/>
much like our Womens <hi>Engage <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
but that they hang much lower:
At home they wear a very short
Petticoat, and when they go abroad
they wrap themselves up in a
<hi>Hayick,</hi> which wholly covers 'em
from the Neck to the Feet; they
also hide their Faces, so that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is seen but their Eyes. As
for their Head-Dress, it does not
much differ from that of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Women; for they wear some
Roses of Ribbon and two Tresses
of Hair, which they toss back, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
nothing on their Heads but
a single Veil or Binder. They
wear neither Shoes nor <hi>Baboushes,</hi>
but only some <hi>Shaussons</hi> of red or
yellow Spanish Leather, without
either Soles or Heels.</p>
            <p>Before I have done with this
Article, I must observe a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
which seems to me pleasant
enough: When the <hi>Moors</hi> happen
to be caught by a shower of Rain
in the Fields, having not their <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noos,</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:41112:62"/>
then to save their Cloaths
from being wet, they strip them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
stark-naked, making a Bundle
of their <hi>Hayick,</hi> Vest and Shirt,
on which they sit till the Rain be
over, and then they put on their
Cloaths, which they have kept
dry, and proceed on their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys.</p>
            <p>When I gave an Account of the
number of the King's Children,
who are so many and so ill Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
that 'tis to be presum'd se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of 'em will hardly be so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
as ever to have an Estate or
Employment, I said, that this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
seem'd to have pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one of 'em for his Successor,
whose Mother he fondly dotes on:
His Name is <hi>Muley Zeydan,</hi> and he
may be about one or two and
Twenty Years of Age: He is a
<hi>Mullatto,</hi> pretty well shap'd, and
seems not so covetous as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
tho' not less inclin'd to spill
humane Blood: He is much given
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41112:63"/>
to Debauchery, and loves Wine
and Brandy extreamly, often drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both to excess; at which time
'tis not very safe to keep him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
or be in his way.</p>
            <p>He does not lodge in the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cassave,</hi>
but dwells in a Sately Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
adjoyning, which the <hi>Alcayde
Ali Ben Abdalla,</hi> whom I shall have
occasion to mention hereafter, had
built there for himself, but of
which the King has made himself
Master, as he commonly does of
whatsoever his Subjects have that
he likes, or thinks to be convenient
for him.</p>
            <p>This young Prince has already
three Wives, and a Daughter of
the <hi>Alcayde Ali</hi> is intended to be
his fourth.</p>
            <p>He affects to seem more Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
and Generous than his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and that he may get the
reputation of being such, and be
belov'd, he does not stick to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve
his Conduct when he's

amongst his Friends and he sees
occasion. I have even been assur'd,
that he spoke his mind somewhat
freely, after the King refus'd to
keep his Word, and disown'd his
writing about the Peace he had
seem'd so much to desire should
be concluded with his Majesty.</p>
            <p>Most of the King's other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are brought up with so much
neglect, and so much unlike the
Sons of a great Prince, that there
are but few mean Actions of which
they are not capable; above all,
in what relates to Debauchery and
getting Money: They often go to
visit the <hi>Jews,</hi> to find some strong
Drink, or to pilfer something;
for they are as thievish and rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
as Kites, and don't in the
least come short of the most dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
<hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> of old in that
Art; if they meet a Slave they
search him, and take whatever he
has from him; for which reason
they and their Visits are not less
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41112:68"/>
shun'd in Private Houses, than
those of Gypsies in a Country
Market.</p>
            <p>I had a trial of this in a Visit I
was plagu'd with by one of 'em,
only some twelve or thirteen Years
old: His only Salute and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
was to lay his Hands on
whatever seem'd worth his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Neither can I better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
his coming in and his going
out, than to that of a Monkey,
who would skip you at once on
some Basket of Fruit he had spy'd
in a Room, and, having laid hold
on what he could catch, would run
out as nimbly as he came; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I came off with the loss of a
pair of Pistols and some Boxes of
Sweet-Meats: But this serv'd to
teach me to beware of the no less
dexterous Hands of his Brothers,
whom I always took care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no where but in the Yard, or
at the Gate of the Palace where I
was lodg'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:41112:68"/>
As these Children grow in Years
the King makes 'em <hi>Alcaydes,</hi> or
Governors of several Parts of his
Dominions: And, after the death
of the Father, he who is the most
in Favour, and has the strongest
Party, overcomes and kills the rest,
to secure the Empire to himself,
then puts his Favorites or his own
Children into their Places. That
Son who is with the King at his
death, is generally in a Capacity
of enslaving the rest, because he
is Master of the Arms, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of the Treasure when he can
discover it. The present Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
highly approves of this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim,
as the means whereby their
Children become Warriors, in
hopes of obtaining the Empire o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Brothers; but this daily
occasions War betwixt 'em, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
their Dominions with as much
Ease as the Conquerors re-united
'em with Difficulty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:41112:69"/>
These Children, at nine or ten
Years of Age, will mount the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
mettl'd Horses, ride them full
speed without Saddles, Boots, or
Spurs, and sit 'em all the while
with the greatest security. 'Tis
the Custom among the <hi>Moors</hi> to
ride their Horses very young thus
without a Saddle, as well for the
sake of the Horses as of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
for there the Horses are
back'd and wrought after the first
Grass.</p>
            <p>I endeavour'd in vain to inform
my self exactly of the Emperour
of <hi>Morocco</hi>'s Revenues; I found
it was altogether as impossible to
reckon 'em up, as to fix the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price
of his Humour in raising
the Taxes, and his insatiable gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
of Gold and Silver: The
Tenth of all his Subjects Goods is
the most common Assessment, as
well as the Yearly Tax upon all the
<hi>Jews</hi> of six Crowns for every
Male, form fifteen Years old and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41112:69"/>
but he lays such frequent
Impositions upon them and the
rest of his Subjects, or, to use their
Expression, such extraordinary <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rams,</hi>
assessing sometimes one Town
and sometimes another, without
any Pretence or Reason but his
mere Will, that it is very difficult
to know or fix the whole Product;
which, however, is very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
tho' he has not any Crown-Lands.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain he causes all the
Gold and Silver he receives by it,
to be melted down and buried,
(for the Taxes are seldom paid but
in <hi>Quintals</hi> or hundred weights
of Gold and Silver) that he kills
all those whom he employs about
the laying up of those Treasures,
that by these means he may become
as much Master of his own Secret
as of his Wealth; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
he often causes it to be melted
himself, and hides it without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any one privy to it; and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41112:70"/>
this made me call this Treasure
<hi>invisible and unprofitable,</hi> when I
spoke of it in the Article of the
Town of <hi>Morocco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is computed he may have thus
by him to the value of Fifty Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of <hi>Livres;</hi> which were a fine
Treasure, and a rich Mine for an
Invader to search, if he cou'd dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
and approach it.</p>
            <p>He get's a great deal out of his
<hi>Alcaydes,</hi> to whom he allows the
Revenues of their Governments;
but in return, he obliges 'em to
make him Yearly Presents at the
Great <hi>Easter,</hi> which is that when
they sacrifice the Lamb; and these
often amount to more than their
Revenue: Whence it happens
that they are as Absolute there as the
King himself, and exercise their
Authority with perfect Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
            <p>It may be said, That these <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caydes</hi>
govern all the Kingdom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Emperor's Authority; for
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41112:70"/>
there is no Parliament, no Court
of Justice, no particular Council,
nor Minister: He himself is alone
the Author, Expounder, and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Judge of his Laws, which,
except those of his Prophet, have
no other Foundation or Limits than
his Will. Nor have they any weight
or effect but through the extreme
Cruelty which he himself is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd
to exercise right or
wrong, against those who may be
more properly call'd the Victims
of his Fury or Cruelty, than of his
Justice; which does not deserve
that Name, but in respect of Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and Murtherers, whom he has
undertaken to punish, executing
them himself: And indeed he has
proceeded against them with such
Care and Success, that he has
clear'd the High-ways, which were
all pester'd with 'em before: this
ought to be accounted as one of
the most remarkable and most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
things he has done du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41112:71"/>
his Reign; the Care which
he has taken being so great, and his
Orders so exactly observ'd, in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
those who live near the Places
where the Crime is committed to
be punish'd with Death or a Fine,
that at this time a Man may travel
through all his Territories with as
much Boldness and Security, as
formerly he did with Fear and
Danger.</p>
            <p>His Authority which appears, and
is indeed so Despotic, has never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
one Superior to it, to which
it is subordinate, which is the <hi>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty'</hi>s
and his Officers, whom the King
has not the Power of Deposing,
tho' he has that of making 'em:
He as well as others submits to the
Decrees of this Jurisdiction, and
neither can disclaim it, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
himself from it, if the least
of his Subjects has a mind to cite
him before it; but, at the same
time, it must be acknowledg'd, that
a fatal Revenge, which sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41112:71"/>
wou'd follow, sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains
'em from it; therefore ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
that Jurisdiction does not
affect him unless when he consults
it, or it thinks fit to make him some
Remonstrances necessary to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and the Good of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Mufty</hi> is the proper and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Judge of Adulterers, whom
commonly he sentences to death;
he is so Absolute in what concerns
all particular Differences that come
before him, that his Sentence ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of no Appeal nor Delay: A
Bastonado is always the <hi>Primum
Mobile</hi> that hurries on the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Decree, and woe to
him that summons a richer Man
than himself to appear at his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,
or who is cited thither by
such a one; for, the <hi>Cadies,</hi> who
are in the nature of Sub-Delegates
to the <hi>Mufty</hi> in all the Towns and
Villages, always sell their Suffrages
to them who give most; and false
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41112:72"/>
Witnesses, who are never punish'd
there, are so numerous and so cheap
in that Country, that no Man
dares trust there to his own Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
nor to the Justice of his
Cause.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Alcaydes</hi> substitute one <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
in every Town or Village with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their Government, but all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Authority of the <hi>Grand
Mufty;</hi> and place there besides two
other Officers, who are fix'd as the
former, but such as they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
at Pleasure; in which, these
differ from the <hi>Cadies,</hi> over whom
the <hi>Alcaydes</hi> have not the same
Authority.</p>
            <p>The first of these Officers is the
<hi>Calif,</hi> or Deputy-Governour, who
takes care of all that relates to the
Particulars and Authority of the
Government, and takes cognizance
of all the Faults and Complaints
of the <hi>Moors</hi> and of the <hi>Jews,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
their Differences; which
ever redounds to the profit of the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41112:72"/>
               <hi>Alcayde,</hi> because the guilty or
wrangling Parties are always ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
punish'd or redress'd by the
expence of their own Money.
The <hi>Calif</hi> is accountable for this
Fine to his Governour, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of 'em have power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
any one to death, at least
without an Order from the King.
This Officer likewise assesses the
People within the extent of his
Province, fixing the ordinary and
extraordinary Taxes or <hi>Garams,</hi>
which are never levied or got in,
but by some <hi>Black,</hi> whom the King
sends on the places for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>The other Officer is the <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kadem,</hi>
a sort of Judge, whose bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
'tis to set a Tax and Price
upon Victuals and Fuel, (which
are all sold by weight) and to see
that due Order be kept in these
Matters. The Duties and Fees
which he claims and receives for
every one of these Wares, wou'd
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41112:73"/>
make this Post very gainful, if he
alone were to receive the benefit
of it; but if the yearly Presents
he is oblig'd to make to his <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayde,</hi>
and sometimes to the King
Himself, do not sweep away all his
profit, at least they diminish the
the greatest part of it.</p>
            <p>Thus much may be observ'd of
the Government of this Great King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
whose strength by Sea and
Land, and Commerce, now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
to be examin'd, that we may
perfectly know the State of it.</p>
            <p>I have already made it appear,
that its strength at Sea is inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable;
what may be said of its
Land-Forces, is, that they might
be Formidable, if this Prince knew
how to discipline his Subjects, and
had a sufficient quantity of good
Arms for them; but you may judge
of them by their real wants in these
two Points, as well as by the King's
not keeping any Forces in constant
Pay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:41112:73"/>
Whenever some Expedition is
intended, he commands his <hi>Alcaydes</hi>
to raise him the number of Men
he designs shall serve in it; upon
which it is agreed amongst them,
what each ought to furnish pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
to the extent of his
Government, where the Division
is made according to the Rolls of
those that pay Taxes: Then they
impress and force such marry'd
Men to March, as do not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
List themselves into the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
or at least they are oblig'd to
send others in their room: Two
Brothers may be taken out of three,
but they must be Marry'd, for the
younger and unsettl'd can't be
compell'd to go.</p>
            <p>These Men so rais'd, be they
Officers, Foot, or Horse-men, are
oblig'd to Mount, Arm, Equip, and
Maintain themselves at their own
cost during all the Campaign; and,
as for the most part, they have
neither Fire Arms nor Powder,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41112:74"/>
they march only with Swords,
Lances, or Staves.</p>
            <p>However, in every Town or
Village, a certain number propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to the largeness of the
Place, is continually to be in Arms,
and ready to March at the first
Command: Those only who are
design'd for Horse men, have Horses
given 'em, which they must keep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and all of this number, be they
either Foot-Soldiers or Horse-men,
are free from all Taxes: Thus
they may be said to be kept, not
at the King's Charge, but at that
of the Place to which they belong.</p>
            <p>When they are ready to give
Battle, they range their Armies
after this manner: They divide
their Horse into two Bodies, and
place one on each Wing; The
Foot is in the middle, so that the
whole is in the form of a Crescent:
They put but two Ranks of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
when they fight on a Plain;
but when they fight between the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41112:74"/>
Mountains, where they can't spread
themselves, they put more.</p>
            <p>Before the Ingagement begins
they make a great Shout, which is
follow'd with some short Prayers,
to beg of God to give 'em the
Victory. Such of the Horse as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
keep near the King's Person,
are all <hi>Blacks,</hi> and wear Fusils and
Scimeters, with Pistols at their
Girdles: Those that are more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
have partly Lances and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Musquets; as for the Foot, one
part is Arm'd with Fusils, and
t'other with Cross-bows, Slings,
Clubs, Half-Pikes, long Darts, and
Cutlasses.</p>
            <p>When they are at War among
themselves, they go but unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into the Field; but when with
Christians, then every one is eager
and proud to go, that they may
gain Indulgencies for the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Sins; and then their
Armies are very numerous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:41112:75"/>
All the <hi>Arabs</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> by
whose Dwellings the Army passes,
are oblig'd to provide <hi>gratis</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it encamps, Wheat, Meal,
Butter, Oil, Honey, and Cattle,
for its subsistance, and this upon
pain of being plunder'd of all that
they have, and cut in pieces them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
'Tis said, that upon any
pressing occasion that concerns Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the King might raise an
Army of an Hundred Thousand
Men, half of which shou'd consist
of Horse, but not above five and
twenty Thousand of 'em, at most,
wou'd be well Arm'd: 'Tis thought
the King has for that purpose ten
Thousand Musquets in his Armory,
which he keeps, as likewise his
Treasure, for that Son, whom he
designs for his Successor, that
he may leave him in a capacity of
maintaining his Crown against any
of his Brothers or others, that shou'd
dispute it with him; for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
as I have observ'd before,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41112:75"/>
that he who is Master of the Arms
and Money, soon becomes so of
all the Kingdom, which is neither
Hereditary nor Elective, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
his among the <hi>Xerifs</hi> who is
then most in Favour.</p>
            <p>There are in the <hi>Armory,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
these Musquets, a Hundred
and Fifty Pieces of Brass Cannon,
one part of which came out of the
Ship <hi>The Captain of</hi> Spain, which
was lost ten Years since before
<hi>Ceúta,</hi> and the other from the
Town of <hi>Larache,</hi> which was
retaken from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' this Prince has no regular
Forces, he has nevertheless a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Guard of three or four Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>Blacks,</hi> Arm'd with very
heavy Musquets: They are always
very young, and he chuses 'em
such, because he will not trust the
Guard of his Person to those of
a riper Age, for fear of some At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
against him: They are for
the most part Children of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:41112:76"/>
and he only provides Food
and Cloaths for 'em, but they are
better and more neatly Apparell'd
than the greatest Lords in that
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Besides this Guard, the King has
seven or eight <hi>Alcaydes,</hi> who never
approach him otherwise than bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed,
and without Turbants, but
they are allow'd to wear a red
Woollen Cap on their Heads; and
in these consists all his Court.</p>
            <p>There are three sorts of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caydes,</hi>
the chief are the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of Provinces, where they
are effectually like so many Vice-Roys;
the other are either parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Governours of great Towns,
or General Officers of his Armies:
They are all of 'em oblig'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
where their Imployments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
their attendance, and the
King keeps near him only such of
'em as are more particularly use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to him, and gives their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
leave to act for them. There
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41112:76"/>
is no considerable Officer, either for
his House or for the general or
particular administration of his
State, besides the <hi>Grand Mufti</hi> for
Affairs of Religion and Justice,
the chief Eunuch for his Wives
and <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and one chief Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer
for his Revenues, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's
Office too is passive and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensom
at best, for he never makes
any distribution of the Money he
receives, and is immediately oblig'd
to return it to the King, who lays
it up among his unprofitable and
subterraneous Hoard, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
observ'd: And as for what
concerns the ordinary Expence of
his House and his Wives, or the
occasion of some extraordinary
Charges in time of War, this <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayde</hi>
must raise the Fund out of the
Revenues of his Government; this
Prince never giving any Salary,
Pension, nor Gratuity in Money,
to any one whatsoever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:41112:77"/>
He who at present executes the
Office of High Treasurer, is the
<hi>Alcayde Abdalla Mussy,</hi> Governour
of all the Kingdom of <hi>Fess;</hi> the
administration of which Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he commits to one of his Sons,
while he himself continually keeps
at <hi>Mickeness.</hi> He is near six and
Fifty Years Old, little and Lean;
his Eyes are even with his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head;
he is of a good Aspect e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and is counted an Honest
Man, and one who keeps his word,
which is very rare among the
<hi>Moors:</hi> He is but meanly descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for his Father was a Mule-driver:
He is well enough belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
because he is an Honest Man,
and one who does good; but for
this very reason he is no great
Favourite.</p>
            <p>There is besides another Officer,
who is in the nature of Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
of the Buildings, whose Name
is <hi>Aly ben Jehon:</hi> He has the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
and takes care of all those
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41112:77"/>
that are built by the King at
<hi>Mickeness,</hi> and is so wholly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in it, that sometimes he is
whole Weeks without seeing his
Master; and he had need be very
Rich, to defray the Costs of all
the Materials, both for the inside
and outside of those Buildings,
which he is oblig'd to provide.
'Tis true indeed that his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which contains the whole
Country that lies between <hi>Micke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>Tremecen,</hi> is of a great
extent, and a very fruitful Soil;
however, I am persuaded, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the unlimitted Expences to
which this Office obliges him, that
notwitstanding all the good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
imaginable, his bare sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
is all the advantage he
makes of it at the Years end. He
is about eight and Forty Years
Old, of a large and comely Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
tho' a <hi>Mulatto:</hi> He has a
quick Eye, a ready Wit, and is
of a pretty kind Disposition: The
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41112:78"/>
Slaves that attend him daily, give
him the Character of a good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd
Man, and praise him very
much; but as he is altogether ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up by his Business, he does not
at all concern himself with Affairs
of State.</p>
            <p>He that seems to have the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
share in that, and on whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
the King seems to rely in those
Matters, is the <hi>Alcayde, Mahomet
Addo Ben Ottar,</hi> who is to this Prince
as his Chief Minister, and has there
the same Access and the same Trust
as a Favorite; and indeed, of all
them that approach him, he best
knows how to flatter his Passions
and humour him in whatever may
please him. Twelve Years since
he was Embassador in <hi>England,</hi>
and what-ever his Treatment may
have been there, he might be
thought a great Enemy to that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if his mischievous Inclination
did not make him known for such
to all others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:41112:78"/>
As he has no Government, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
quitted that of <hi>Sally</hi> to his
Brother, thus to exempt himself
from the Obligation of making
Presents to his Emperour, so he is the
less Wealthy; but has the greatest
Interest of all the <hi>Alcaydes;</hi> he is
about five and fifty Years of Age;
he has a quick Eye and an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Look; his Ways and Discourse
discover a great deal of Cunning;
he is deceitful and wicked to the
highest degree; and pretends to
be a Friend to the <hi>French,</hi> frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
saying that his Mother was born
at <hi>Marseilles,</hi> when at the same
time he loves nothing but Money,
and is pleas'd with nothing but
Mischief; he is fear'd but not at
all belov'd by the <hi>Moors,</hi> who u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversally
hate his Ministery, and
in private give him all the Curses
imaginable; he is likewise very
great with <hi>Muley Zeydan</hi> the King's
Son, and the Partner of all his
Pleasures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:41112:79"/>
The <hi>Alcayde Aly Ben Abdalla</hi>
and he are Rivals, and jealous of
each other's Interest with the King,
which causes the management of
Affairs to be difficult there: The
<hi>Alcayde Aly</hi> being always absent,
keeps up his Interest only by his
rich Presents, but <hi>Mahomet Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do'</hi>s
seems to be better establish'd
by his continual residence at Court,
and his Artifices and Method in
managing the King's Temper, to
reduce him to a necessity of never
parting with him.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Alcayde Aly Ben Abdalla,</hi> of
all those who are at distance from
Court, lives with most Grandeur
and Authority; he is Vice-roy of
the <hi>Algarbs,</hi> and Governor of the
Provence of <hi>Riffe,</hi> and of all the
Maritime Places from <hi>Zaffarine</hi> to
<hi>Sally,</hi> that has its particular Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors;
for which reason the King
wholly depends on him for what
relates to Sea-Affairs; and, as he
is very vain, he calls himself among
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41112:79"/>
Strangers Admiral of the Coasts of
<hi>Africa.</hi> Formerly he resided alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
at <hi>Tetuan,</hi> but at present
his Residence is commonly at <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier;</hi>
he is about fifty Years of Age,
and of mean Birth; being a Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
Son, yet is one of the richest
in all this Empire, and the King
receives the greatest Presents eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Year from him, the least ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
the value of 400000 <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres.</hi>
That which adds to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of his Government, is Traffick
and the Neighbourhood of the Sea,
which renders it one of the best,
and give him a great Reputation
with his Master: He is very illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and can't so much as read,
yet has a great deal of Sense, and
great Experience in Affairs, which
makes up for all; he is fierce,
haughty, full of himself, and much
puff'd up with his Fortune and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement;
he is Violent, humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and subject to Passion, in
which he spares not his best Friends;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41112:80"/>
nevertheless, when he is come to
himself, he is Gentle, Humane,
Tractable, and of a Deportment
altogether Noble and Honourable;
he does not hate the Christians,
and wou'd seem as much a Friend
to the <hi>French</hi> as an Enemy to the
<hi>Spaniards;</hi> but it may be imagin'd
that Policy and Interest have a
greater share in his Publick Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
than Truth: For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that the King continually
presses him most earnestly to get
<hi>Ceuta</hi> out of the Hands of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
the performance of which
he imposes on him at the Price of
his Head; and the more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
there is in the Towns of his
Government, the more considerable
are his Revenues and the Presents
he is oblig'd to make: This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
makes him heartily wish
that his Master were at Peace with
those Christian Princes, whom he
judges most Powerful at Sea, and
from time to time he attempts ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41112:80"/>
it with the King; but his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
with that Prince, which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
takes so great a Care to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
must needs be too weak to
prevail in spight of the continual
opposition of his Competitor; or
perhaps he presumes a little too far
on his Artifices for the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Success of his Designs;
since the King my Master has late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
been inform'd by the Report I
made him of it, that this <hi>Alcayde</hi>
discover'd no less Surprise and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
for having miscarried in
such an Affair, than Resolution and
Desire to renew his Attempts to
succeed better in it.</p>
            <p>His great Favourite, whose Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
he takes, and on whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
for the execution of all his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
is <hi>Mahomet Hadgy Lucas,</hi> made
by him his Lieutenant-General of
the Marine. This Man, whose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
is altogether at <hi>Tetuan,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd
<hi>Mahomet Addo</hi> in his
Embassy to <hi>England,</hi> which has a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41112:81"/>
little more civiliz'd him, or at least
makes him less barbarous than the
rest; he has a great deal of Sense,
and is well skill'd in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Business, speaks good <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,</hi>
is quick, cunning, laborious,
violent, a dissembler, a cheat, and
always inclin'd to do mischief,
which makes him abhorr'd, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the <hi>Christians</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi>
but by all the <hi>Moors</hi> in general:
And, in short, to draw his Picture
more exactly and in fewer Stroaks,
there is no more to be said than
this Truth, That his Temper, his
Manners, his Words, and his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
do not at all belye the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
observations on the <hi>Judas</hi>-colour
of his Beard and Hair: He
is not above fifty Years old, but
so full of Diseases, the cause of
which he attributes to Poyson,
which he pretends was given him
in some Melons by the Governor
of <hi>Ceuta,</hi> above a Year since, that
'tis to be hop'd he will not long
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41112:81"/>
hold out against the effect of those
deadly Imprecations which are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
bestow'd on him.</p>
            <p>Since this Discourse hath insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
engag'd me to give the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
and personal Qualities of such
Persons as make any distinct Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
in this State, I think I ought
not to forget a Man whom the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of having been Embassador
to <hi>France</hi> has made known there,
and of whose Quality it is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to be inform'd, that hereafter
this may serve as a Rule to those of
his own Character.</p>
            <p>'Tis <hi>Mahomet Themin,</hi> who came
thither in the Quality of Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
in 1681, and makes no other
Figure in his own Country than
that of an <hi>Amokadem</hi> at <hi>Tetuan,</hi>
that is to say a sort of puny Judge;
one of his Brothers is a Broker
there, and the other a Rope-seller;
besides, <hi>Themin</hi> obtain'd this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
there but after his return, that
he might have the means, after a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41112:82"/>
sort, to maintain an Honour to
which, in Truth, he was never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd;
for he shou'd have been
only Secretary to <hi>Hadgy Manino</hi>
Governor of <hi>Sally,</hi> the true Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador;
but his Name was inserted
without the King's knowledge in
the Credential Letter, which the
<hi>Alcayde Omar Addo</hi> his Protector
and Patron gave 'em; for which
reason he took Care at his return
neither to boast of the Honours
nor the Presents he had receiv'd
in <hi>France;</hi> the last of which he
sold at <hi>Marseilles,</hi> that none might
know of 'em in his Country, and
he might keep the Profits of 'em
to himself. No more durst <hi>Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
Manino</hi> complain, for fear of
incurring the Displeasure of the
<hi>Alcayde Omar,</hi> who at that time rul'd
every Thing, and of whom the
King of <hi>Morocco</hi> has rid himself
these five Years since for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:41112:82"/>
But to pass by these particular
Subjects of the Emperor of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco,</hi>
and speak of all those that
compose his State, 'tis to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
that there are two sorts of
'em; for some are <hi>Blacks,</hi> and the
rest <hi>White-men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first, tho' they are his Slaves,
are those he trusts most, and the
usual Executors of his Orders,
which they fulfil in such an Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and Absolute a manner, that
the most Powerful of the <hi>Alcaydes</hi>
themselves tremble at the sight of
the least of 'em.</p>
            <p>When he goes to Battel, he has
in his Army always Seven or eight
thousand of 'em, as well of Foot
as of Horse: These are his best
Soldiers, and fight always near
his Person with Fire-Arms, and he
gives the Government of Places,
or the Chief Posts in his Army,
to those whom he likes best among
'em.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:41112:83"/>
The King of <hi>Morocco</hi> from time
to time gets a Number of these
<hi>Blacks,</hi> whom he either buys or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
by force or cunning out of
their Country, and having caus'd
'em to marry, sends 'em, with some
Cattle of which he gives them
the Care and Profit, into several
uninhabited Places, where he uses
'em like a Nursery to serve him
upon occasion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>White-men,</hi> tho' they are free-born
and very numerous, being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
Natives of the Country,
yet are not the more regarded or
happy for it; and as a Token of
the little Affection and Esteem the
King has for them, he commits the
Guard of his Person to the <hi>Blacks,</hi>
to whom he gives so great an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over the <hi>White-men,</hi> that
they exact upon 'em and abuse 'em
without controul, as they please,
and when they think fit; which has
driven the latter to such a Despair
that they are ready to attempt any
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41112:83"/>
thing if they had an opportunity
and power answerable to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.</p>
            <p>Indeed most of them are so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
inclin'd to revolt, that the
knowledge which this Prince has
of it, is none of the least Motive
that induces him always to keep
'em in Fear and Subjection; and
his only Interest and Care, for the
preserving his Government in Peace
and Splendor, is to prevent and
hinder their Motions within; the
situation of his Kingdoms being
such, that he has hardly any thing,
or at least very little, to fear of any
Attempt from abroad.</p>
            <p>This will plainly appear to be
true, if we consider that his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
wou'd be inaccessible on the
side next the Sea, unless in the
Places, which, as I have already
observ'd, are in the Possession of
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portuguese;</hi> but
if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> don't take more
Care of <hi>Ceuta</hi> than they did lately
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41112:84"/>
of <hi>Larache,</hi> the strong Situation
and Fortifications of which, here
delineated, sufficiently evince that
the loss of it ought much less to be
attributed to the want of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Bravery of the Officers
and Soldiers that Garrison'd it,
than to the want of Provisions
and Ammunition, 'tis much to be
fear'd, they will suffer it to be
taken from 'em in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
which will cause the greater
surprise, since the <hi>Moors</hi> have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Instruments, nor Industry,
nor Engineers, nor Experience ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for such Expeditions: We
cannot say as much of the Town
of <hi>Magazan,</hi> where the King of
<hi>Portugal</hi> continually takes Care to
keep a strong and good Garrison.</p>

The King of <hi>Morocco</hi>'s only
Neighbours on the Land-side, are
the <hi>Negro</hi>'s on one hand, and the
<hi>Algerines</hi> on the other; from the
first of which he has nothing to
fear, as well because of the great
River and the Mountains that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
them, which wou'd render
their Attempts if not ineffectual, at
least very difficult, as for the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Advantages which he and they
receive from their Union, the
<hi>Moors</hi> having a considerable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
in <hi>Guinea,</hi> from whence, for
Salt, Iron-Ware, little Looking-Glasses,
and other pedling Toys
that come from <hi>Venice,</hi> they bring
back good quantities of Gold-Dust,
Elephants-Teeth, and a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Blacks,</hi> whose Affection the
King gains besides by his kind
Treatment, and the value he sets
upon 'em in his own Country, as
I have already observed; so that
he looks upon 'em as his own real
Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:41112:87"/>
He is not altogether so Easie on
the side of the <hi>Algerines,</hi> the fear
of whose Valour, and the facility
of entring his Country, keeps him
daily upon his Guard; but he has
the Policy and good Fortune often
to keep 'em off by the pretext of
Religion, making his <hi>Talbes</hi> and
<hi>Marabots</hi> insinuate to 'em, that
both States shou'd give God and
their Prophet an Account one Day
of the Blood which wou'd be spilt
by Wars between 'em, contrary to
their Laws. In the mean time no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but his own Weakness, and
some fatal Experiments he has
made of their Valour, as also the
Dread he has of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi>
from whom he might apprehend
some revengeful Invasion on that
side, causes him to keep in this
seeming Friendship with them:
For 'tis certain he hates 'em at least
as much as he hates the <hi>Christians,</hi>
to whom also he always compares
'em, by reason of the difference
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41112:87"/>
there is in their Faith; upon which
likewise he Treats all the <hi>Turks</hi> as
<hi>Hereticks,</hi> and if he had the least
prospect of getting their Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
either by Treachery or by
Force, he wou'd not lose the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of doing it.</p>
            <p>The Commerce in his Kingdoms
is, as it is elsewhere, generally Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to the Dealers, as well
abroad as at home; and this Prince,
more mindful of his Profit than of
his People, so well knows how be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
Trading is to him in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
by the Duties which are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
for the Importation and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
of Goods, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
his Antipathy and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possession
of this Religion be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Christians,</hi> and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
War he has with 'em, it does
not hinder him from tolerating
their Trafick, and putting all means
in practise that may conduce to his
Gain: Insomuch that there are in
his Sea-Port-Towns People of most

Nations at all times, and his <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caydes</hi>
know so well by the large
Summs they borrow, and never
wholly pay, how to cause those
Traders to stay there, whom hope
of Gain has invited thither, and
whom the first Endearments and
a shew of kind Usage induce to
settle in those Parts, that what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
soever the Wrongs, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasures,
and frequent Avarices
they are forc'd to satisfie there,
may bring upon 'em, it is seldom
possible for them to get clear, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they lose their Debts and leave
their Effects, or forego the natural
Love of their Country and of their
Liberty for the sake of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.</p>
            <p>I have been told, that those who
live at <hi>Sally</hi> are treated more kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
of which I very much doubt;
but what I have seen practis'd du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
my stay in regard of those of
<hi>Tetuan</hi> and <hi>Tangier,</hi> both on the
Captains and Owners of Ships who
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41112:89"/>
arrive there, has so strangely fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd
me, that all the Inference I
can draw thence, is, that both the
one and the other must needs have
been misinform'd, or they make
very great Profits, since they can
resolve to expose themselves there
to such an Usage.</p>
            <p>The Tenth of all the Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes
that are imported and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
is what the King claims for
his Customs, which brings him in a
very great Revenue. That which
is collected at <hi>Sally</hi> does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the <hi>Alcaydes,</hi> as doth what
is levied in the other Governments,
which is part of their Subsistance,
and for the re-imbursement of their
Charges and the Presents they are
oblig'd to make to the Prince:
And this, perhaps, is the reason
which causes the Merchants to be
better used at <hi>Sally,</hi> as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
because the Governors there
do not make it so much their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
to deal with them so strictly;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41112:90"/>
thus forbearing a severe usage, of
which they can reap no benefit, since
they are oblig'd to give a particular
Account to the King of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and pay it <hi>in specie</hi> at the Year's
end, deducting what they may have
disburs'd according to order.</p>
            <p>The Advantage which the <hi>French</hi>
find by this Commerce is, That
there they put off such Goods as
are of the growth of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and also their Manufactures
turn to a good Account; besides
the Merchants carry no Money
thither, and they ever bring back
Merchandizes of a greater Value
than what they carry'd over.</p>
            <p>The Traffick of <hi>Provence</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in Tartar and Paper, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of which is great in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,</hi>
as well as of Red Woollen
Caps, fine and course <hi>Languedoc</hi>
Woollen Cloth; <hi>Serges de Nismes,</hi>
Fustians and Dimities of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelier,</hi>
and other Places; Combs,
Silks, Linnen of <hi>Lyons;</hi> Gold-Threads,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41112:90"/>
Brocades, Damask, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask-works,
Velvet, Cottons,
Wadds, and other Commodities
from the <hi>Levant,</hi> of little Value,
but of good Sale in these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and of a better return.</p>
            <p>The Traffick which those of
<hi>Roan, Saint Malo's,</hi> and other
Cities of the Western Ocean, have
in this Empire, is almost wholly
in Linnen-Cloth, of which, 'tis
reckon'd, that what is carry'd over
and sold Yearly in that part of <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
amounts to above Two Hundred
Thousand Livres: The Barter that
is made there of all these Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes,
is in Wax, Hides, Wooll,
<hi>Ostrich</hi>'s Feathers, Copper, Dates,
Almonds, <hi>Archifoo</hi> (a Stone that is
us'd to make Earthen Ware) and
Ducats of Gold, which are bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
to those of <hi>Provence,</hi> in their
Trade to the <hi>Levant.</hi> The Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and the Jews, as I have already
observ'd, have all the Trade of the
Country, and chiefly that Abroad,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41112:91"/>
which the <hi>Moors</hi> do not in the
least care to manage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sally</hi> and <hi>Tetuan</hi> are the most
Trading Ports; Goods being most
easily Ship'd off there; <hi>Saffy</hi> and
<hi>Santa Cruz</hi> drive also a Trade for
what comes from <hi>Morocco, Tafilet</hi> and
<hi>Suz,</hi> but it is not so considerable.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Fez</hi> is, as it were,
the general Store-House of all <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,</hi>
the best Traders, and the
greatest number of Jews, who are
there above Five Thousand; are
settled at that place: These Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
buy all that comes from <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
and the <hi>Levant,</hi> and retail it
in the Provinces, from whence
likewise they take what they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
to Trade with in the Sea-Port
Towns. The Red <hi>Morocco</hi> Leather,
known here by the Name of <hi>Spanish
Leather,</hi> is drest in that City, and
is the finest in all <hi>Barbary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Trade of <hi>England</hi> is in Broad
Cloath and in Cowries or <hi>Negro's
Teeth,</hi> which are a kind of small
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41112:91"/>
white Shells that go currant in
<hi>Guinea</hi> instead of Money.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holland</hi> sends thither Woollen
and Linnen Cloth, all sorts of
Spices, Iron and Brass Wire, Steel,
Benjamin, Storax, <hi>Cinaber,</hi> little
Looking-glasses, Muslins for the
<hi>Turbants,</hi> and Arms from time to
time, with other Ammunition for
War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Italy</hi> furnishes 'em with Alum,
Gun-Powder, and great store of
Earthen Toys made at <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There comes from the <hi>Levant,</hi>
Silks, Cotton, Orpiment, or <hi>Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigmentum,</hi>
Quick-silver, Reagal
and Opium.</p>
            <p>The returns which are sent to
those Parts for all these kinds of
Merchandizes and Drugs, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than what I have set
down in the Article of <hi>France,</hi> in
proportion to the quantities that
are vended there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cadiz</hi> is the Interpost to all the
Traffick of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:41112:92"/>
for, being near to Both, it facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
of course a commodious and
sure Transportation, by the means
of <hi>Portugueze</hi> Ships that go thither
to take up the Cargo's.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Morocco</hi> is so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
of the utility of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
and so jealous of it, that
surely one of the best ways of
bringing down his Pride, and of
forcing him to reasonable Terms,
were to hinder that of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or to disturb it in such a
manner as to give 'em a dislike of
it: And it is my opinion besides,
that the Trade in the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi>
need not absolutely be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
in that Empire, since the
same things might be return'd, and
put off, by the way of <hi>Algier,</hi>
which are at <hi>Tetuan</hi> and <hi>Sally;</hi> all
that can be objected, is, that those
Goods wou'd not turn to so good
an Account.</p>
            <p>Foreign Money is not currant
in this Country, except the <hi>Spanish</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:41112:92"/>
Pieces of Eight, the Value and
Price of which are rated accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their Weight, which is
always between Sixty and Seventy
<hi>Sols</hi> or Pence. The <hi>Pistoles</hi> of
<hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Louis
d' Or's</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> pass there for no
more than Ten Livres, or Ten
Livres and Ten Sols; and besides,
they are not taken but in a Lump
as Bullion, and by Weight, to be
melted down: the Jews only take
commonly the French Silver
Crowns there for Sixty five Sols;
a great many of these Crowns
were carried out of <hi>France</hi> to that
Country, before the alteration
that was made about those Pieces,
there being much to be got by
them.</p>
            <p>The Coin that goes Currant in
this Empire is only of three sorts,
That of Gold, call'd a Ducat,
That of Silver a <hi>Blanquille,</hi> and
that of Copper, a <hi>Felouze;</hi> the
Figure of the Prince is not upon
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41112:93"/>
'em, their Law forbidding it, so
that nothing is Stamp'd upon them
but some <hi>Arabick</hi> Characters.</p>
            <p>The Ducat is worth from Six
Livres to Seven Livres Ten Sols of
our Money, and its Price, which
is never fix'd, rises and falls, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the several Occurrences,
that is to say, according to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
or want of Commerce, or
as the Ships come in more or less
frequently.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Blanquille</hi> is the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Money, and of the most fix'd
and standing Price: 'tis worth two
<hi>Sols,</hi> and Six <hi>Deniers,</hi> and it is in
this kind that generally all Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are made.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Feloux</hi> is as one of the
French <hi>Deniers,</hi> but worth a little
more; Four and Twenty of 'em

            </p>
            <p>Their way of reckoning is by
Ounces or by <hi>Meticalles</hi> (which is
the same thing in <hi>Arabic</hi> with a
<hi>Ducat</hi> in <hi>French</hi>) the Ounce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41112:93"/>
of Four <hi>Blanquilles,</hi> or Ten
Pence of our Money.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Meticalle</hi> or <hi>Ducat</hi> for the
generality is nothing real, but
such a manner of counting as by
<hi>Francs</hi> or <hi>Livres</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> its
value is fix'd at Forty <hi>Blanquilles,</hi>
or a Hundred Pence <hi>French;</hi> so
that when 'tis barely said, that a
thing worth so many <hi>Meticalles,</hi>
or so many <hi>Ducats;</hi> nay, even so
many <hi>Meticalles</hi> or <hi>Ducats</hi> of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
'tis always understood for so
many Hundred <hi>Sols.</hi> It is not the
same thing in <hi>Meticalles</hi> or <hi>Ducats</hi>
of Gold, for their Species is Real,
but their Value uncertain, as I have
already observ'd.</p>

               <head>AUDIENCES
Given to
Monsieur de St. Olon,
AT
MICKENESS,
BY
Muley Ismael,
Emperour of Morocco,
In the Year 1693.</head>
               <div type="subpart">
                  <head>The First Audience.</head>
                  <p>I Was admitted to my first Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
the 11<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1693.
at 9 in the Morning, having six
days before seen the King of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco</hi>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:41112:94"/>
in the open Field, at the
Head of 10 or 12000 Horse. I
was nine days at <hi>Mickeness,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I had this Audience, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that time was not suffer'd to
make or receive any Visits; nor
even to stir out of my Palace:
The Consul and all my Retinue
were also denied the same Liberty,
and all this time I had notice sent
me early every Morning to be
ready to be Conducted to the
King, but was put off every E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
to the next day.</p>
                  <p>The Custom of the Country,
which, they told me, was, not to
let the Embassadors see any one
till they have had their first Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
was the pretence they us'd
to justifie that kind of Restraint.</p>
                  <p>The Alcayde <hi>Hamet Addo Riffy,</hi>
Governour of <hi>Larache</hi> and <hi>Alcassar,</hi>
was sent me to be my Introducer,
attended with some considerable
<hi>Moors,</hi> and some Blacks of the
King's Guard, who secur'd us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41112:95"/>
the Throng of the People,
but not against the Hootings,
Curses, and other abusive Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
with which they Revile all
Christians: The Character of
Embassador not being able to free
a Man from them.</p>
                  <p>This Alcayde had a Brother
call'd <hi>Omar Addo,</hi> who was once
the King of <hi>Morocco'</hi>s Chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
and Favourite, but his Merit,
Authority, and Credit, gave that
Prince so much Jealousie, that he
caus'd that Alcayde to be kill'd five
or six Years since.</p>
                  <p>We all went a foot to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
tho' the King's Palace was
at a considerable distance from the
place where I liv'd, and the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was very hot; but an <hi>Vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brella</hi>
was carry'd over me, which
in some manner defended me from
the Heat of the Sun's Rays that is
excessive in those Parts.</p>
                  <p>Twelve <hi>French</hi> Slaves came after
my whole Retinue, and carry'd the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41112:95"/>
Presents I was to make to the
King of <hi>Morocco</hi> in my own Name,
consisting of very fine Arms, seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Watches of great Value, divers
Pieces of red and blue Cloth, very
rich Gold and Silver <hi>Brocades,</hi> and
two Carpets of <hi>La Savonnerie,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
large, and singularly
beautiful.</p>
                  <p>In this manner we came to the
<hi>Alcassave,</hi> the King's Palace, and
went in at a large and stately
Gate, which, from two Pillars that
adorn it, is, as I have said, call'd
the Marble-Gate. We went thro'
a long Passage, where many Blacks
of the King's Guard stood on the
Right and Left, and made a Lane
for us. On both sides of that
Passage are only some White Walls
of a considerable height, built like
all the rest of this Palace, wholly
with Lime, Plaister, and Cement
with Water, which beaten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by strength of hand, make a
kind of a very white Matter, as
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41112:96"/>
hard as Marble. At last we came
to an open <hi>Pavillion</hi> not yet fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd,
that form'd four large <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico's,</hi>
the Front of every Face
looking towards a Walk, like that
thro' which we came, and leading
to different Appartments of this
<hi>Alcassave.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They made me tarry at the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of that Pavillion, till, as
they said, they had acquainted the
King with my being there. It
was a full quarter of an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we saw him coming thro' one
of these Walks, which was also
lin'd on each side with about Two
Hundred little Blacks, arm'd with
very large Musquets, who bow'd
to the very Ground as he pass'd
by 'em.</p>
                  <p>He had a very thin Attendance
and rid a White Horse, very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
as to his fineness and the
richness of his Harness, from that
he rid on when I saw him at the
Review. He had a Launce or long
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:41112:96"/>
Pike in his hand, and was as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dress'd as the meanest of his
Subjects. He was muffl'd up to the
Eyes in a Coffee-colour'd Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief,
that seem'd pretty foul,
and was no very pleasant sight.</p>
                  <p>He alighted as soon as he came
to the <hi>Portico,</hi> and having given
his Launce to one of his Blacks,
came and sate down, without any
Matt, Carpet, or Foot-Cloth, on
the edge of a large Wooden Post
that prop'd it up. His Arms and
Legs were bare, and a Black held
a large Fan behind him, as much
to cool him, as to keep off the
Flies that swarm in that Country,
and are very troublesome. Some
Alcaydes sate on the Ground on
his Left, without Shoes or Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,
and with nothing on their
Heads but a bare red Cap: One
of 'em, however, stood on his
Right, but, like the rest, had no
Shoes on, and his Head was only
cover'd like the rest. This Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayde
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41112:97"/>
was <hi>Mehemet Ben Addo Otar,</hi>
who may be said to be his chief
Minister and Favourite.</p>
                  <p>As soon as the King was set
down, as I have said, and I had
saluted him, he began the first to
speak to me, and said twice or
thrice <hi>Tay buon,</hi> which signifies,
<hi>You are Welcome,</hi> an Expression he
always uses to denote a kind Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
to those who come near
him: After this he said to me in
<hi>Arabick,</hi> that I was a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
that he was glad to see
me, and would joyfully grant me
whatever I should ask him: To
which, after I had put on my
Hat, I answer'd him in <hi>French,</hi>
with a Complement I prepar'd,
which he patiently heard from the
beginning to the end, tho' 'twas
somewhat long, and 'tis not his
Custom to give Ear to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of such a length, without
interrupting those who make 'em,
and asking them several Questions.</p>

                     <salute>Most High, most Excellent, most
Potent, and most Invincible
Prince, Muley Ismael, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
of Morocco, King of
Fess, Tafilet, and Suss.</salute>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE Amazement and Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
which your Majesty's
Royal Aspect Commands from
those that approach you, would
confine me to a silent Admiration,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41112:98"/>
like all those who are permitted
that Happiness, had I not the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of appearing before Your
Majesty, shelter'd with the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
of the Sacred Name of the
most High, most Excellent, most
Potent, most Magnificent, most
Invincible, and ever Victorious
<hi>LEWIS the Great,</hi> the most
Christian Emperour of <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Navarre,</hi> the Eldest Son of the
Church, the Defender of the Faith,
the Sanctuary and Protector of
Kings, the Umpire and Great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis this also that gives me a
Right of assuring your Majesty,
that while the Emperour, my
Master, did me the Honour to
make choice of me for his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
at your Court, he rais'd
my Wishes and my Joy to the
highest pitch; since this would
procure me the Glory and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of seeing there a Prince,
whom all the Wonders I have
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:41112:98"/>
read and heard related of him,
made me as ambitious of seeing,
as they fill'd my Mind with Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for his Person.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, Sir, there is none
who does not perfectly know that
<hi>Muley Ismael</hi> is the most Famous
and warlike Prince that ever grac'd
the Throne of <hi>Africa,</hi> and that 'tis
your incomparable Exploits which,
combining with all the Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of your Royal Birth, made way
for your more speedy Ascent to
that Seat, and Entitl'd you to
fill it with more Authority and
Lustre.</p>
                  <p>But tho' Fame, that has taken
care to proclaim 'em, has omitted
nothing which may cause every
place to resound with your Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause,
I still find a new Subject
of Praise, in what is the occasion of
my Embassy here; and that fresh
cause of extolling your Majesty,
seems to me so worthy your
Greatness of Soul, and the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41112:99"/>
of your Subjects, that I with
Pleasure think my self oblig'd to
let 'em know what it is, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate
'em about it; that this
excellent Action of your Majesty
may not want its due Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums.</p>
                  <p>What else indeed could they
have wish'd for, after so many
Battles and Victories which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
your Friends, and subdued
your Enemies under your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
Government, than to see
its Quietness and Mildness fully
settl'd by the Marks of Tenderness
and fatherly Bounty, which you
show 'em in seeking all means pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
that none of 'em, may remain
in Chains or Slavery abroad?</p>
                  <p>'Tis doubtless only to convince
'em that you are no less fond of
being justly thought their Father,
than their King, that you have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shown a desire, and made some
steps to get free such of 'em as are
Slaves in <hi>France,</hi> and procure to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41112:99"/>
your Subjects a Peace, that is so
necessary to 'em, with those of the
Emperour my Master; by this means
to re-establish all Security, Plenty,
and Tranquility in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce:
To which his Imperial
Majesty being also willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute,
he has commanded me to
come hither, and assure you in his
Name, that he has always entertain'd
so much Friendship, and so high
an Esteem for your Majesty, that
nothing can be added either to his
earnestness to give you further
Testimonies of it, or to the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his Intentions.</p>
                  <p>At the same time I presume to
promise my self that such uniform
Dispositions will meet with all the
Success I can desire, and that the
Treaty which I am order'd to
make, to renew the Alliance and
Peace, being once concluded, as
firm and solid as is consistent with
the common Good and Wishes of
both Empires, a good Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41112:100"/>
will then be so perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish'd
that nothing will ever
be able to shake or destroy it.</p>
                  <p>These, Sir, are the Intentions
and Resolutions of the Emperour
my Master, of whose almost incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
Victories and Conquests in
his last Campaigns, I do not doubt
but Fame, that is always employ'd
to speak his Majesty's wonderful
Atchievements, has sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
you, and how in spight
of the prodigious numbers of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
since so long a time, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin'd
against the Power, the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
the Valour and the Fortune
of <hi>Lewis the Great,</hi> he has always
been so happy as to triumph over
them: This is a visible effect of
the Protection of the God of Hosts,
and of the Reward he bestows on
his Piety: May Heaven grant, that
the Union which I come to renew
between your Imperial Majesties,
may be always favour'd and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
by such a Protection, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41112:100"/>
that you may both prove for ever
the Love, the Delight, and the
Safety of your Subjects, the prop
of your Allies, the terror of your
Enemies, and the absolute Masters
of the vast Parts of the World in
which you Both Reign with so
much Glory.</p>
                  <p>After these so just and zealous
Wishes, there remains nothing,
Sir, for me to do, but most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to beseech your Majesty to be
pleas'd to accept of these Presents,
how disproportionable soever they
may be to my deep Respect, as a
Testimony of my sincere desire to
please your Majesty.</p>
                  <p>My Interpreter afterwards read
this Complement to the King in
the Moorish Tongue; and this
Prince having answer'd it in such
a manner as made us know he had
heard it with Pleasure, added some
Excuses for not having been able
to see me before, being then taken
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41112:101"/>
up by the Ceremonies of his <hi>Easter,</hi>
and said, that all the Christian
Slaves could witness this.</p>
                  <p>After this, he proceeded to speak
in the King's Praise, and enlarg'd
very much on his Power, Valour,
and Wise Conduct, as also on
the great difference which he puts
between the Emperour of <hi>France,</hi>
and all the other Potentates of
<hi>Europe;</hi> saying, That he knew not
one amongst 'em all, besides him,
that truly deserv'd the Name of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,
and that none but the King
knew, like him (<hi>for he always af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
to compare himself to his Most
Christian Majesty</hi>) how to Reign
by himself, <hi>and make himself the
absolute Master of the Fate and Will
of his People.</hi> Then repeating
what he had already said to me at
the first Interview, concerning <hi>the
Advantages which the Grand-Signior
found in the Alliance, which he had
so long maintain'd with his Majesty,</hi>
he added, that all these Motives,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41112:101"/>
joyn'd to the esteem which he had
for the rare and great Worth of
that first Monarch of Christendom,
had so much excited him to seek
also his Friendship, and made him
so impatiently desire it, that besides
the Assurances which he had caus'd
to be given His Majesty of it by
Consul <hi>Estelle,</hi> he had design'd
to have sent Embassadors to desire
his Friendship, if my coming had
not prevented him.</p>
                  <p>I answer'd, that the Emperour,
my Master, well inform'd of his
Sentiments, had dispatch'd me,
with all possible speed, to assure
him of his readiness to comply
with his Majesty's Desires, and to
renew with him, by a firm and
lasting Peace, the Bonds of a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
that would be the more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
for being altogether ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the esteem which two such
great Princes could not but have
for each other, and that, for my
part, I esteem'd my self most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41112:102"/>
and most happy in being
chosen for the effecting so agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a Project. He told me that
his Intent was also to make a firm
Peace, that he charg'd the <hi>Alcayde
Mehemet Ben Addo Otar,</hi> there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
to settle the Conditions of it;
that he was his near Relation, whom
he look'd upon as his second self;
and that he being the Son of a
<hi>French</hi> Woman, ('tis true indeed,
that this <hi>Alcayde'</hi>s Mother was of
<hi>Marseilles</hi>) I had no reason to doubt
but that I should find him alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
well-dispos'd to make a
speedy and wish'd for end of the
Business.</p>
                  <p>I reply'd, that I thank'd his
Majesty for giving me a Minister
to treat with, whose Merit and
Praise were sufficiently display'd
by the choice which so wise and
knowing a Prince made of his
Person, and that provided the
Effects were answerable to these
fair Appearances, I did not doubt
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41112:102"/>
but all things would be ended to
the satisfaction of both Parties.</p>
                  <p>He answer'd, that nothing could
contribute more to this, than a
speedy and reciprocal joyning of
the Arms of the Emperour of
<hi>France,</hi> with his against the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
our common Enemies, and
that he imagin'd a Conquest that
way to be not only very easie and
very advantagious to the King,
but also the surest means to raise
his Majesty's Power and Glory to
the highest pitch. After this, he
enlarg'd with a great deal of
warmth, and for near a quarter of
an hour, upon whatever he thought
might flatter his Passion and his
Designs on that Subject, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concluded, that he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
on the account of the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
he had a mind to contract
with his Majesty, that he ever
could deny him the Assistance he
wanted for the retaking the Towns
which they still hold in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41112:103"/>
and that he was sorry he
was not more his Neighbour, in
a Juncture that was so pleasing,
and might become so useful to
him.</p>
                  <p>To this I said, that when the
Treaty which I brought should be
concluded and ratified on both
sides, 'twould then be time to
make some Overtures to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and explain our selves on
the Necessities and Supplies that
might then unanimously be the
result of it; that this was all the
answer I could give to this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
at present; and that I could
well assure him, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
my Master, alike Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
by Land and Sea, <hi>had such
formidable and numerous Fleets in
the Mediterranean, and in the Ocean,</hi>
that they would always make
him very sensible of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
when occasion should
require it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:41112:103"/>
This equivocal Answer not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given him an opportunity to
make a Reply, he order'd the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayde
Mehemet Addo,</hi> who had
stood all the while, to take the
King's Letter which I held in my
Hands; but, as I had no mind to
deliver it, but into his Master's, I
immediately stepp'd forwards, and
ving presented it to him in a
Cloth of Gold Letter-Case, he
took it, drew it out, kiss'd it, laid
it on his Head, to show how much
he honour'd it, and then gave it
to this <hi>Alcayde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This done, I presented the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
who came with me to him,
and he receiv'd 'em very kindly:
Then I desir'd him that he would
be pleas'd to accept of some of my
Country Rarities, which I made
bold to present him with. He
look'd a long time on every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
and was very much pleas'd
with them, but above all which the
two Carpets which he thought came
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41112:104"/>
from <hi>India,</hi> and which he said he
esteem'd the more, when I had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
to what he ask'd me about
'em, that they had been made at
<hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he had examin'd every
thing one after another, he caus'd it
to be taken away by his <hi>Blacks,</hi> and
return'd me Thanks for 'em; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing,
however, That he only acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
of 'em, because the Law of his
Prophet permitted him not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
what was offer'd him in token
of Respect or Friendship; and, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
said to me that I was a good
<hi>Christian,</hi> and that he was very
well pleas'd with me, he added,
smiling, That the best Proof he
could give me of his Satisfaction and
the Esteem he had for me, was by
praying God to Convert me,
and exhorting me to become a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan;</hi>
to which I answer'd, also
smiling, That tho' I perfectly and
most certainly knew what to stick
to, I nevertheless receiv'd this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:41112:104"/>
of his Good-will with a
great deal of Thankfulness.</p>
                  <p>Upon this he beckon'd to the
<hi>French</hi>-Slaves to come near, which
they all did, casting themselves at
his Feet with their Bellies on the
Ground; then he chose out four
of the youngest, and making signs
to them to rise and step aside, told
me he gave 'em me for my Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
to which I answer'd, he
could never treat me with a more
acceptable Dish, but that I pray'd
him to consider that this would but
whet my Appetite. After this he
arose, mounted again, and order'd
I should be conducted home. The
<hi>Alcayde Mehemet ben Addo Otar</hi>
waited on me back as far as the
Marble-Gate, and came to pay me
a Visit from the King immediately
after I had din'd.</p>
                  <p>Towards the Evening I went
to see <hi>Muley Zeydan,</hi> the King's
Son, who, after some Complements
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:41112:105"/>
on both sides, told me also, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
me with a <hi>French</hi> Slave who
was by him, That as a Token of
his Gratitude for what I brought
him (for I did not come there
empty handed) he gave him me for
my Supper; to which I answer'd,
returning him my Thanks, That
having already been made sensible
by the Fame of his Exploits, how
well he imitated the King his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Valour, I was much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
to see and experience, that
he could also so well imitate him
in Generosity.</p>
                  <p>The following Days having been
spent in examining our Treaty
with the King of <hi>Morocco'</hi>s Minister,
and that Prince being determin'd to
go on an Expedition which he had
design'd against some <hi>Moors</hi> in the
Neighbourhood of <hi>Oran</hi> who had
revolted, I was sent for with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation
at Seven a Clock in the
Evening, without any Notice gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41112:105"/>
me before, to take my Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Leave; that Prince ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken a Resolution to dismiss
me but the Day before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                  <head>The Audience of Leave.</head>
                  <p>I Had my Audience of Leave the
Nineteenth of <hi>June:</hi> The Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
at my going to it were
like those of the First, but the
Humour and Designs of the King
of <hi>Morocco</hi> and his Ministers made
it quite different, as to the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singness
of the Conversation, and
its Conclusion.</p>
                  <p>I had notice given me as I went
that the King was in a very ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and almost besides himself,
having just then dispatch'd two of
his Chief <hi>Blacks</hi> with a Knife.</p>
                  <p>This having given me some op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to prepare my self ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
in some manner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the Horror and Surprize
which the Condition I found him
in might otherwise have rais'd; and
that had doubtless been much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
had not this warning preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it.</p>
                  <p>I was had further into the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41112:106"/>
than the first time, and went
as far as the out-side of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
which seem'd to me very fine
and neatly kept.</p>
                  <p>That Building consists of several
large Arches to the Right and Left,
of which each Horse has his own
apart, and is only fasten'd to a
Stake and Fetlocks. Here are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Racks nor Mangers; for the
Horses eat on the Ground; which
Custom takes place, as I was told,
because the <hi>Moors</hi> themselves eat
thus, and therefore would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
more Privilege and Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
to those Animals than they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
themselves.</p>
                  <p>After I had spent some time in
viewing that Place, I saw the King
at some distance, coming to me
mounted on a very fine white
Horse, in very rich Harness, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Gold-Saddle on, and all its
Trappings of the same; and the
<hi>Poitral</hi> set with precious Stones in
some places.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:41112:107"/>
He held a Lance in his Hand, of
the shape and length of our Pikes,
on which he lean'd between whiles.
His Face was uncover'd, and he
was finely dress'd; but, besides a
yellow Vest that he had on, (which
Colour I have already said has been
observ'd by his Subjects, to have
been almost ever fatal to some of
'em, when worn by him) his right
Arm and his Clothes were still all
stain'd with the Blood of those
Wretches whom he had just kill'd;
and indeed his Face and Looks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
a wild and furious Air that
represented to the Life the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of that Action.</p>
                  <p>He was only attended with a few
Slaves and <hi>Blacks,</hi> all quaking for
fear; for his Rage had quite scar'd
away every one of his <hi>Alcaydes:</hi>
However, some of 'em came near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by degrees during the Audience,
which that Prince began himself
with his ordinary Complement of
<hi>Taybuon;</hi> upon which I made him
that which follows.</p>

                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I understand that your Majesty is
going on some Glorious Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
I come to wish you a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Success in it, and, according to
your Custom, a Victorious Return.
<hi>Here the King interrupted me, saying
twice or thrice with his Eyes lifted
up to Heaven,</hi> Exhallah, Exhallah,
<hi>which signifies</hi> God grant it! God
grant it! <hi>After which I went on
thus</hi>— I can assure your Majesty
I shall carry the News of it with
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41112:108"/>
Pleasure to the Emperor my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
if I can at the same time give
him an Account, as I hope I shall,
of the Performance of what you
writ and caus'd to be signifi'd to
him concerning the Peace, by the
Consul of <hi>Sally.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, <hi>as the Words and Writings of
Kings ought not to be alter'd,</hi> I
should wrong your Majesty's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
could I harbour the least suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of the Fidelity of your Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
on this behalf. Your Majesty
knows how nearly it concerns
your Honour and Interest, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
as well your Subjects as the
different Nations that are at your
Court of this Truth. And 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
on these Grounds that I am
willing to believe I ought to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
your Minister's Silence, (since
by your Order we discours'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
about the Treaty, which I
show'd him and put into his Hand)
only to the Pleasure which your
Majesty was pleas'd to reserve to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41112:108"/>
your self, of signifying to me the
happy and wish'd-for Conclusion
of it, and principally, concerning
the Article about setting free on
both sides the Slaves of the two
Nations; about which your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
would not treat.</p>
                  <p>However, SIR, I think it my
Duty to represent to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
that a Thing which you have
so publickly desir'd, and which you
can so easily accomplish, ought to
have been sooner decided, and not
be put off till so short a time as
seems remaining till your depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
You have shown a Desire
of having a Peace; you have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
or demanded an Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
to conclude it, and have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
so forward, that you did
me the Honour to tell me when
I came near you, That you were
ready to have sent one to <hi>France</hi>
on that Account, had not I come
as I did.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:41112:109"/>
However, I have been in your
Dominions these two Months, and
these three Weeks at your Court;
you have receiv'd me with Marks
of Satisfaction and singular Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
I have presented you my Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and tho' the Commissioner,
whom you appointed to examine
'em, made some very unexpected
Objections on things already set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
by your Majesty, I neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
show'd him, in three Articles,
which most certainly deserv'd not
to have such Difficulties started,
that I had a mind to conciliate
Things with all imaginable Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
that the said Treaty might
be concluded with mutual Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                  <p>Yet since that time he seems to
have had a mind to obstruct this
business, and make it impossible,
by a new and unheard-of Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which might cause the World
to doubt of your Majesty's having
a real Desire for a Peace, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41112:109"/>
make it impossible it
should last, did your Majesty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in it. I have convinc'd him of
it by strong Reasons, which I
would again repeat to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
were I not persuaded you
have been inform'd of it.</p>
                  <p>Thus, SIR, I have now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else to do, but to desire, that
before you go you will be pleas'd
to Approve and Sign this Treaty
which I offer you; and I assure you
that I shall leave this Country with
Content, if when I hear of the
Continuation and Progress of your
wonted Conquests, I can at the
same time acquaint my Master of
the Effect and Performance of your
Royal Word, which hath procur'd
me the Honour and Pleasure of
satisfying the great Idea I had
conceiv'd of your Majesty.</p>
                  <p>

THe King of <hi>Morocco'</hi>s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to this Complement,
and all the Discourse that pass'd in
this Audience ran upon some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals,
so extraordinary, so little
consonant to the Motives he had
discover'd to procure this Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and so contrary to the Letter
he had writ to the King about it,
which he solemnly disown'd, that
I thought that decency oblig'd me
to consult the Reputation of that
Prince, so much as to bury 'em in
Silence, rather than expose him too
much to the Publick Blame by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
them.</p>

               <opener>In the Name of God, who is Good,

               <opener>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:41112:112"/>From the Servant of God, who is
most High and Victorious by God's
Appointment, and puts his Trust
in him in all his Vndertakings, the
Miralmumunin or Prince of the
True Believers, who fights in the
way of the Lord of this World
and of the other, The Prince of
the high Tribe of Hachem, Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael
the Son of Al Xerif of the
House of Hassan.</opener>
               <p>THis is to let your Majesty
know, That a Christian
Merchant, Son to your Consul <hi>Estel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi>
came to our High Court, where
he said that he had in his Hands
an Order and Credentials from
your Majesty; then produc'd a
Letter, which, as he pretends, came
from you; by which, Authority is
given him to conferr with us, as
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41112:112"/>
he shall think most convenient,
concerning your Affairs and Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and even to act in your Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
at the Court of our High Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
whom God preserve.</p>
               <p>We made no doubt but that the
Letter and Credentials came from
you, but would have nothing to
do with the said <hi>Estelle,</hi> not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it proper to treat with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
those Affairs; because he is
a Merchant, and not one of the
great Lords of your Court, or one
of your chief Officers; for it does
not belong to Merchants to treat
with Kings, or manage Affairs in
which Princes are concern'd: A
Merchant may speak about what
relates to his Trade; he may also
use his Endeavours to carry News
on both sides, and transmit a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
or be the Bearer of a Letter,
and do this for both Parties. This
he may do, but that's all a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant's
Word can be good for, and
no more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:41112:113"/>
Therefore, if your Majesty have
really a design to enter upon a
Treaty, to the purpose and with
sincerity, you may send us one of
the Great Lords of your Court,
on whose Words we may depend
and rely, and with whom we may
Treat upon his coming to us with
that Design and to that Purpose:
Or, if you rather desire we should
send you one of our best Servants
and greatest Lords of our High
Court, you may send one of your
Ships to convey him from our
Country to yours, and we will
send such a one without delay with
good Powers and Credentials.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The chief Affairs about which we
are to treat with you, is concerning
the Slaves of your Nation who are
with us, that an Exchange may be
made of one</hi> Christian <hi>for one</hi> Moor,
<hi>Man for Man.</hi> We only desire of
you, those of <hi>Sally,</hi> and of the
Town adjoyning call'd the <hi>Rabat,</hi>
as also those of <hi>Tetuan,</hi> of <hi>Fess,</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:41112:113"/>
of <hi>Alcassar,</hi> and of <hi>Mickeness,</hi> who
have been taken within these ten
Years, some about six Years, some
four Years, and some since that
time; for, as to those of other
Towns than such as I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
or who have been taken
above ten Years since, we do not
care to treat about them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if you think it fit, send one
of your Officers, for whom you
have an Esteem, and order him to
bring all the above-mention'd
Slaves that are in <hi>France,</hi> and come
with them at the Mouth of one of
our Ports, and we shall treat with
him in the most convenient man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
possible. We will give him
your Salves, and receive our own
of him, Man for Man; so that, God
willing, he shall not go back with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doing his Business. As for
your sending a Person of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or one of your Ships to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport
our Embassador, you may
use your Discretion in doing either
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:41112:114"/>
of the two, which you shall think
most convenient.</p>
               <p>'Tis God that gives Success to
our Undertakings, and in whom

               </opener>
               <p>THis is to let you know, That
we are troubled that you
should leave us without having
done any thing: When you ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd,
we were just ready to take
the Field to reduce the Nation
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:41112:115"/>
call'd <hi>Benjamer,</hi> that unjustly us'd
to maintain a Commerce with the
<hi>Christians,</hi> contrary to our Order.
We caus'd ten thousand Horse to
march towards them, and cut in
pieces all that made any resistance,
took part of 'em Prisoners and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas'd
the rest. You arriv'd while
were in the midst of our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
for that Expedition; and
when you came into our Presence,
we thought it was to propose to us
something of Moment, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
us that you were ready to
joyn with us against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
and take Measures together how
to attack and overcome 'em: In
which Case we would have done
whatever you could reasonably
have desir'd: We did even let you
know that we would conclude
such a Treaty with you as there is
between you and the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior,</hi>
who is our Brother in the
Law of the Faithful: And in this
Expectation we rejoyc'd for your
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:41112:115"/>
coming, and signified as much as
soon as you came before our High
Throne, which God protect. But,
<hi>as you only came to speak of the</hi>
French <hi>Slaves, and for nothing else,</hi>
and that you did not fulfil the
Commission which we had given
to the Son of <hi>Estelle,</hi> the Christian
Merchant, which was to chuse and
bring us some Coats of Armour,
some rich and rare Scimiter, some
precious Jewel out of your Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's
Treasure, and other Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Curiosities, such as might
be acceptable to us, we have not
thought fit to give you any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Hearing. We wonder you
would repose a Confidence in a
Christian Merchant, such as <hi>Estelle,</hi>
who is not to be trusted; and that
you should even bring him hither
with you; for, could about two
hundred Slaves we have of yours
be worth your Coming? We have
not thought fit to grant 'em you,
because we are not like the <hi>Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines,</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:41112:116"/>
and others of their stamp,
with whom you use to treat of such
Matters; but had you brought
some rich Presents, or propos'd
some Business of Moment, as is that
we just mention'd, then we would
have hearken'd to you indeed, and
even have left our Army to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with you, and have exchang'd
the <hi>French</hi> Slaves which we have,
for such of our Subjects as are in
your Kingdom.</p>
               <p>However, our faithful <hi>Aly</hi> the
Son of <hi>Abdalla,</hi> perceiving that you
were come back from <hi>Mickeness</hi>
without effecting what you intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
has made you stay a while; and
as he is perfectly acquainted with
all the Affairs that relate to the
Marine and the Ports committed
to his Charge, as also whatever is
convenient for each of them, we
have given him our Orders, and
whatever he shall do shall be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
by us; for we were not
willing to let you go back till you
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:41112:116"/>
had some Reason to be satisfi'd;

this that we have now sent you

               <p>I Receiv'd yesterday, by the Hand
of the <hi>Alcayde Aly ben Abdalla,</hi>
the Letter which your Majesty did
me the Honour to send me, and I
have not in the least been sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
at the Confirmation which
it brings of the News which Fame
has already taken Care to publish
here, of the Progress of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
Arms; for still your Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
must be attended with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:41112:117"/>
As for what that Letter menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Motives of my Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
to your Court, I will do my
self the Honour to acquaint your
Majesty in few Words, That none
can ever believe there could have
been an occasion for it, more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
and more suitable to the
State of Grandeur and Glory in
which your Majesty is at present,
Than an Alliance, and firm Peace
with the Emperor my Master,
whose Power and Vertues, your
Majesty so well knows, are at this
time become the Envy, the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and the Admiration of all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, SIR, you cannot have
forgot, that you let the Emperor
my Master know, and writ to him
your self by the Consul <hi>Estelle,</hi>
whom you twice caus'd to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>France</hi> on that Subject, that
there was nothing which you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
more earnestly, than a sincere
and solid Agreement about that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:41112:118"/>
Peace. You have even show'd
your self so forward in this, that
you were pleas'd to tell me pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
at my first Audience, That,
had my Arrival been delay'd but
some Days, you would have sent
some Embassadors to his Imperial
Majesty, to give him all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Assurances about it.</p>
               <p>Had your Majesty, when you
sent the Consul, had those Desires
that seem to have been suggested
to you since, 'tis to be imagin'd
you would have charg'd the said
Consul to make some Overtures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them to the Emperor my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;
and according to the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and Resolutions which his
Imperial Majesty might have taken
about 'em, I should then have had
the same Orders and Powers to
treat of 'em with your Majesty's
own Person as I have been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
with, by the Emperor my
Master, concerning those things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
which you writ to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:41112:118"/>
But there is some Reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that your Majesty at that
time had been pleas'd to follow the
no less judicious than zealous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the <hi>Alcayde Aly,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
knows what may be most for
your Majesty's Interest, who truly
loves your Person and your Glory,
and whom I ought to assure you I
have found here to be the most
faithful and most loving of your
Subjects. Had your Majesty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
no other, you would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
have follow'd, and brought to
a happy End your first Designs,
which, besides the Profit and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they would have procur'd to the
Commerce of your Subjects, would
also have made you Formidable to
your Enemies.</p>
               <p>I hope, SIR, that when you
shall seriously have weigh'd those
Counsels, and imparted your Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to that faithful <hi>Alcayde,</hi> you
will again pursue such Resolutions
as are most consistent with your
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:41112:119"/>
Interest, and that you will approve
what the Esteem and Respect I
have for you oblige me to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to your Majesty; assuring you
that if I were so happy as to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to contribute towards the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
for you, of the Emperor
my Master, what I know to be so
necessary and advantageous to you,
I would endeavour it with all the
Zeal you can desire of him, who is
entirely,</p>

Which the

Wrote and sent to the King,

Monsieur de St. OLON.</head>

               </opener>
               <p>THis is to let your Majesty
know, That as soon as your
Servant, the Embassador, arriv'd
on the blessed Lands under our
Dominion, we had Information gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:41112:120"/>
us of it by our faithful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor
and Servant the <hi>Alcayde Aly,</hi>
the Son of <hi>Abdalla,</hi> who desir'd us
to give him Leave and the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Orders to cause him to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
to our Court: This we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
granted, believing that he
only came to treat of Affairs of the
greatest Consequence, such as wou'd
be a means for us to obtain what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we should desire of you, and
for your Majesty all that you could
desire of us.</p>
               <p>But after he was come to our
High Throne, and we had spoken
to him, and ask'd him many Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
about this, we found that
he had only some Proposals to
make relating to the Slaves, and
we did not find that he had the
Power which is requisite to treat
with us of other Affairs; so that
what he came about, having not
seem'd to be of Consequence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
we did not think fit to
treat with him about it; for 'tis
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:41112:120"/>
certain that what was the Subject
of his Embassie, might as well have
been done even by the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Merchant, whose De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
were very much inferior to
his.</p>
               <p>As soon as he withdrew out of
our Royal Presence, we left the

Servant the <hi>Alcayde Aly,</hi> the Son

Command and Authority
with which he is intrusted by our

Cities, Towns, and Tribes of our

leave to Negotiate with your Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador,
and he has sufficient Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

the greatest Consequence, in case
this Embassador have also some full

               <p>I Must acquaint your Majesty, that
as soon as your faithful Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador
<hi>de St. Olon</hi> came to us with
his Attendants, we had several
Conferences with him, and ask'd
leave of our Victorious Monarch,
that he might come from this Place
to his Court; and having obtain'd
it, we procur'd him the means to
arrive at this Glorious Throne.
After his return from the Court of
our Master, as we then resided in
the City of <hi>Tangier,</hi> (which God
protect) your Embassador writ to
us, and let us know, that he had
not ended what he desir'd of the
Court of our Emperor; for which
reason we speedily sent again to his
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:41112:122"/>
Majesty several Letters with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated
Instances, to desire him
that he would explain his Will in
that Affair: This we did two or
three times, and he as often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
Answer, letting us know
that 'twas his Intent to negotiate a
Treaty of true Peace in plain and
sincere Terms, concerning some Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the greatest Consequence,
that it might remain sirm and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
by the means of which Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
most important and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Undertakings might be
compass'd: And, in short, <hi>such a
Treaty as is between your Majesty and
the People of</hi> Constantinople.</p>
               <p>But, it seems, <hi>this Embassador is
only come about the Slaves;</hi> now 'tis
certain their Number is so inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
and of so small a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that if he had demanded
'em <hi>gratis</hi> of our <hi>Mullana</hi> (whom
God cause to triumph) he would
not have refus'd 'em on your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
account.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:41112:123"/>
The Emperor my Master did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
let me know, that he had not
the least thing to object against the
Treaty that relates to the <hi>Marine;</hi>
yet that he does not much value
that Affair, and that there is no
need to make a Treaty for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
of so small a consequence.</p>
               <p>This is the summ of what the
Emperor my Master (to whom
God grant Victory!) answer'd to
the Instances I made on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:
As for our Part, God is our
Witness, that we have acted for
your Embassador, in whatever he
desir'd, as we would have done for
our selves, and perhaps more.</p>
               <p>And finally, I have made it my
Business to conferr with him seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
and privately, and we have
discours'd together a long while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
several Points which he has

               <p>WE received your Letter,
and understood the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of what you writ to us.
You desired us to take care of the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:41112:124"/>
Embassador <hi>De St. Olon;</hi> you must
know, that as soon as he came to
us, and Landed at the place where
we were, we gave an Account of
it to the King our ever Victorious
Master, and having ask'd his leave
for him, he permitted us to let him
come to him, imagining he was
come with a large and full Power
from you; but when he was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
at the Royal Court, and His
Majesty had enquir'd of him, he
found that he had no Power to
enter into a Negotiation, <hi>but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Slaves;</hi> for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
he could not have a further
Conference with His said Majesty,
for want of sufficient Power for
that purpose.</p>
               <p>Since he came back from Court,
I writ two or three Letters to our
Emperour concerning that Affair,
and he return'd me this Answer;
That he had already told me he
gave me full Power to make what
Agreement I should think fit with
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:41112:125"/>
the Embassador; provided I did
find he had full Power to treat of
some Affairs of great Moment, that
would be a means to fulfil what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
can be desir'd of you; but
not to come to any Terms if he
had not such a Power.</p>
               <p>Now the Emperour, our ever
Victorious Master, has writ to
yours, and fully inform'd him of
this Affair. We our selves also
have had some private Conferences
with your Embassador <hi>De St. Olon;</hi>
in which we have open'd our mind
to him, letting him know what
we desir'd, and fully acquainted
him with every thing.</p>
               <p>When he arrives at your Court,
and shall have given you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of these things, be pleas'd to
write to us, to let us know your

OBSERVATIONS
To be made.</head>
               <p>A Colonel of <hi>Spanish</hi> Horse,
who was a Slave at <hi>Micke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
Treated with the King of
<hi>Morocco</hi> about his Freedom, which
he was to have for a very rich
Sword which had been formerly
taken from a King of the <hi>Moors,</hi>
and which <hi>Muley Ismael</hi> had a great
desire to get out of <hi>Spain</hi> where
'twas kept: This Officer did not
only cause it to be got and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to this King, not doubting
but he might rely on his Word,
but gave him also with it a valuable
Rarity; hoping by this means to be
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:41112:126"/>
the sooner and more genteely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd.</p>
               <p>At first he thought he had not
been mistaken in his Measures;
for the King of <hi>Morocco</hi> took the
Sword and Present with such Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
of Joy and Satisfaction,
as besides his Freedom that had
been promis'd him, got him that
of his Servant, about which they
had not agreed; he also gave him
a Letter, by which he gave Orders
to the Alcayde <hi>Aly Ben Abdalla,</hi>
Governour of <hi>Tetuan,</hi> to let him
go out without the least Molesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but a private Order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them having been sent away
before the Letter, the poor Officer
soon found himself depriv'd of his
Hopes, and of the return he had
reason to expect for his Present.</p>
               <p>His Complaints and Petitions
were as unsuccessful as his Bargain
with the King, and procur'd him
no other Answer from the Alcayde,
but that the King his Master had

                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:41112:128"/>
forgot, when he releas'd him, that
he had had taken a solemn Oath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to set free any Men of his
County, but by an exchange of
Ten <hi>Moors</hi> for one <hi>Spaniard;</hi> so
that he was not to expect his
Freedom but on those Terms.</p>
               <p>In vain he pleaded, that he had
made an Agreement with the King;
that he had given him a Sword ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
with a Present besides,
and show'd the Letter for his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
All these Expostulations
were as ineffectual as they were
Just; so that after many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations
and Delays, this Officer,
who was also a Man of Quality,
could not get away 'till he
had got Eleven <hi>Moors,</hi> whom he
had still the Power to procure out
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and of whom he gave
Ten for himself, and One for his
Man; nay, they reckon'd it a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
favour that they let his Servant
come off so cheap.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:41112:128"/>
This is a late and very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Example, that shows us how
far we may depend on the Words
and Promises of this Princes and his
Alcaydes.</p>
               <p>Here is another of the same kind.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Moor,</hi> whose Name is <hi>Hadge
Achmet,</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco,</hi>
having been taken and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
into <hi>France,</hi> after he had been
a Slave Eight and Twenty Years in
the Gallies, found means to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
himself by an Exchange that
was to be made of him for one
<hi>Venelle</hi> of <hi>Provence,</hi> who was also
a Slave at <hi>Mickeness:</hi> This, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to an Agreement with
the King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> who gave
his Word of it to <hi>Venelle;</hi> which
he confirm'd in Writing to <hi>Achmet,</hi>
promising, that as soon as this <hi>Moor</hi>
should arrive in <hi>Barbary,</hi> the <hi>French</hi>
Man should be immediately sent
back into his own Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:41112:129"/>
The Agreement being thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
and perform'd, on the part
of <hi>Venelle'</hi>s Relations, <hi>Hadgy Achmet</hi>
is set free, gets to <hi>Mickeness,</hi> casts
himself at his King's Feet, gives
him thanks for his Liberty, and
begs of him That of the <hi>French</hi>
Slave, which was to be the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
and the Price of it.</p>
               <p>The Prince tells him he is a Dog,
that he cheated him, that he can
get Ten Thousand Crowns for <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelle,</hi>
that he does not intend to
release him, and that for his part,
since he is free, he has no more to
ask or to do, but to go home about
his Business.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moor</hi> wondring at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal,
and being mov'd with a
sentiment of Honour (so-much the
more to be esteem'd in him, as 'tis
uncommon amongst those of his
Nation) complains of this Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
tells the King of his Royal
Word and Writing, and intreats
and presses him, either to perform
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:41112:129"/>
it, or give him leave to go back
to <hi>Marseilles.</hi> The King denies his
Writing, and refuses to grant
<hi>Achmet'</hi>s Request, commands him
to hold his Tongue, and be gone
home, not without Threats of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
usage, and even of Death it
self, if he persists to trouble him.</p>
               <p>However, things have remain'd
thus 5 Years, yet this honest <hi>Moor</hi>
has not stir'd from <hi>Mickeness,</hi> where
yet he has not means to subsist, and
complains aloud of the wrong the
King has done him; neither does he
lose any opportunity to present him
self to the King, and make his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
protesting to all his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caydes,
with a <hi>Roman</hi> Firmness and
Courage, that he will rather suffer
himself to be cut to pieces, than
leave the Court without obtaining
either <hi>Venelle'</hi>s Liberty, or leave
to Surrender himself to <hi>Venelle'</hi>s
Relations at <hi>Marseilles,</hi> and fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
into the Slavery from which
he was only freed with that Proviso.</p>

This <hi>Achmet</hi> is a Man of good
Sence, and was every day with
me at <hi>Mickeness,</hi> to press me to
speak on his behalf, that the King
might consent to this, or Release
<hi>Venelle;</hi> assuring me that he would
rather dye a Thousand times, than
suffer such an Injustice: He fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
me where-ever I went, and
even when I had an Audience; so
that he has often given me no less
occasion to admire his Constancy
and Honesty, than to wonder at
the King of <hi>Morocco'</hi>s Patience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him; the more, since that
Prince's Humour inclines him to
kill his Subjects with so little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>So unjust a Proceeding hath yet
more fully convinc'd me, that there
is little or no reason to rely on
that King's Promises whether Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal
or in Writing.</p>
