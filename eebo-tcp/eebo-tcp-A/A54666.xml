         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>ions into one heap or Volume: and having thus knit them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60469:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to offer them up to the publique disquisition.</p>
            <p>Before I made farther in this Discourse, I must affirm that even in Paradise there was Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration or Distinction of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, since God did more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially exhibite his presence in that part of the Garden, when he descended to commune with <hi>Adam,</hi> than in any other porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it; and thence in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred pages, it is affirm'd that <hi>Adam</hi> upon his Defection fled from the presence of God. In Times subsequent to this, we find that there was no Nation so rude or wildly Barbarous, but did set apart some solemn or publique places for the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of their imaginary Deities; if they Sacrific'd to their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60469:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Gods or powers, that had the Care or Tuition of the Earth, they erected there Altars on the plain Superficies of it; if to the Infernal Powers, they did it <hi>in Cryptis &amp; Abditis Spelunca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> in Grots, Caves, and other gloomy Recesses; if to the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial or Supernal Deities they offer'd up their Sacrifices, they then perform'd that Devotion, on the Brows or Tops of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; and it is very probable, that this later Custom of theirs, had its Derivation from the <hi>Prosouchae</hi> or Oratories amongst the Jews, which sometimes seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near the Margin of a Spring, Brook or River, but most commonly upon the Edge of a Mountain, and it is as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the <hi>Encaenia,</hi> or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60469:9"/>
Feasts, Instituted at the Devoting or Consecrating their Temples to the Worship of their Gentile Deities, was first ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the Feast of Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation amongst the Jews; A Feast (say the Rabbins) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in something was renewed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those things are only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted consecrated, which are separated from their Common, and dedicated to some new and Holier use.</p>
            <p>From these Premises I may justly Collect, that God who alwayes lov'd Order, and was apt to hear Holy and prudent prayers, hath often declar'd, that he loves Publique Places, because of their Order, Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, and Necessity for the Solemnity of Worship, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60469:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath affirm'd, that he will dwell in them, not that they are Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to Him, but that he is pleas'd to make them so to us; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n publique places we decline singularity, as in our Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Oratories, we avoid Hypocrisy. But I have too much digress'd, I now proceed; And I shall first endevour to trace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out when Parishes were originally distinguished and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from each other. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I shall discover the Grounds and Reasons on which Churches were Erected and Dedicated. Thirdly, I shall make a Survey of their Frame and Contexture within, and how in times of an Elder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription they were contriv'd for the Celebration of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60469:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Performances, and other practical Duties and Offices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fourthly, I shall make some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the original institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Oblations, Obventions, Tithes, and other Payments which did both enhance and secure the Dignity and Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Ecclesiastical State. Fifthly, I shall represent in a Compendious Prospect, upon what foundations, and upon what considerations the right of Patronage was invested in Lay or Secular Persons. When Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes were first divided, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction or intelligence, (Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity exhibites to us from those Registers and Records which might enlighten our knowledge as to that particular,) is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and obscure. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60469:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
received Opinion is, That Pope <hi>Evaristus,</hi> under <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> about<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Year 110. peradventure observing that too diffused and numerous a Multitude (like too much fuel cast upon the flame) did rather Choke and extinguish, than any way multiply the heat of De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the Emperour, and then Pope <hi>Dionysius</hi> taking the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a benigne and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious Edict, issued out by that Prince in favour of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (from whose farther perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and torture he had not long before been deterr'd, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60469:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>In <hi>England</hi> this pious example had such an influence and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Aspect, that about the Year 636. <hi>Honorius</hi> Arch-bp. of <hi>Canterbury</hi> began to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the people under his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>are and inspection, within the Boundaries of their several divisions and Parishes, which design of his was farther prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, inlarg'd and confirm'd by his successor Arch-bp. <hi>Theobal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> about the Year 677. In which posture and condition this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath ever since continued.</p>
            <p>Parishes being thus institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there appear'd a subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent necessity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of erecting of Churches and Oratories, where the Celebration of Divine Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices might multiply the growth of Christianity, which was yet
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60469:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but in its Infancy and Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; after their first Erection and Establishment, Antiquity (as it is evident from several Monuments of Venerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription) impos'd the Name of <hi>Tituli</hi> upon them. For in the Life of Pope <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> we read that <hi>In Roma ille insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit.</hi> 21. <hi>titulos;</hi> that is, in the Dialect of Elder times, one and twenty Churches.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Titulus</hi> (as <hi>Sanctius</hi> observes) is <hi>Signum aliquod se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Monumentum, quod docet latere aliquid, aut accidisse cujus nolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus perire Memoriam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Churches then were antient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Tituli,</hi> either from a name Metaphorically borrowed from Goods belonging to the Princes Exchequer, that had
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60469:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
some sign imprinted upon them, that they might be known whose they were; So the sign of the Cross was put upon the Churches, to make it known they were mark'd out and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd for Gods Service: or else they were nam'd <hi>Tituli,</hi> because the respective <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> did antiently derive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their several Titles from them. See <hi>Baronius, Anno Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi> 112. They were likewise stiled <hi>Memoriae Martyrum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause antiently Churches were built <hi>Supra Cryptas Martyrum;</hi> that is, upon those Vaults and Repositories, where the Dust and Reliques of the antient Martyrs were originally trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd up. Now, if you will know why Antiquity with such
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60469:13"/>
industrious Piety did Erect these Monuments, now called Churches, over the Ashes of these glorious Assertors and Champions of Christianity, and after devoted them to their names; these subsequent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marques or Notes upon the first institution, will sufficiently insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate to the Reader the Reasons of this primary Consecration.</p>
            <p>I. That the Memory of those excellent Persons might be so preserv'd, that after they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the glorious fate of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom it might not be bury'd in so cheap a Tomb as Oblivion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the example of such eminent Champions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated in these lasting Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, might in succeeding Ages excite others, if any fresh On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60469:13"/>
should be made on Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, with the same magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to assert it as these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them had done, since they beheld so Venerable an Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate was set upon their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance for dying for it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That in future times they might be rescued from an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>njurious and sacrilegious deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station, when Posterity should find they were devoted to the Memory of those who had with such an inexpugnable passive fortitude defended the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Cross, and had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd Christianity to a stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious fertility, with the double compost of their Ink, and of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heir Blood.</p>
            <p>Having thus traced out the original institution of Churches,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60469:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the Reasons of their Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; we shall now unlock their Dores, and view their contrivance within, and there, upon a serious Survey, Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we shall find cast them into this Method and Order.</p>
            <p>When the indulgent and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Piety of the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians began more visibly to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest it self, those Churches they erected, were frequently, if not generally built in an Oval Figure, or like some of our Ships long and narrow, and bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out on both sides, near the midst whereof the <hi>Pastopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> (we may call them the Pews) for Men and Women were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd, and in the midst the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops seat was plac'd, call'd in Greek <hi>Bema,</hi> from its assent,

the Womens Desks or Pews, by whose care and inspection they were kept neat and in their just order, Younger Men &amp; Women, if there were any conveniency of place, sate; if not, they were engag'd to stand, the Women be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the graver Matrons, the Men behind their Seniors; Boys were placed with their Fathers, and Girls with their Mothers.

            <p>The <hi>Absis</hi> amongst the Primitive Christians, was the upper part of the Quire near the Altar, where Penitents by Imposition of hands were usually absolved.</p>
            <p>In the Primitive times, these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral stations in the several Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective <hi>Churches</hi> were consign'd to those who were blasted more or less (that is gradually) with

Between these Courts was an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of 15 steps whereon were sung by the <hi>Levites</hi> the Gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Psalms, beginning at the 120, and concluding at the 134. Fourthly, there was <hi>Atrium Gentium</hi> or <hi>Immundorum,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the Service of those Gentiles who were properly styled the <hi>Proselites</hi> of the Gates; this Court was divided from the other Courts by an eminent Traverse Wall three Cubits high, adorned with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Pillars of equal distance, to which St. <hi>Paul</hi> alludes when he asserts that our Saviour by his Tragedy on the Cross had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled the Partition Wall: And out of this Court Divines likewise affirm that our Saviour did expel those Buyers and Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60469:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that had defil'd it by an impious and injurious Profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So amongst the <hi>Levites,</hi> there were first the <hi>Punies</hi> or <hi>Tirones,</hi> who from their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood till the Five and Twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth year of their Age learn'd the Duty of their Offices. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Graduates,</hi> who were those who having spent four years Study in the Law were able to answer and oppose in it. Thirdly, <hi>Licentiates,</hi> who did actually exercise the Priestly Function. And Fourthly <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> or <hi>Rabbins,</hi> who were in Degree the most Eminent.</p>
            <p>Indeed many of the Jewish Ceremonies were imitated by our Saviour under the Gospel: The Apostles were answerable to the <hi>Missi</hi> or Messengers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60469:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Jews, being sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad into all Nations by Christ to gather in Sinners to their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, being that <hi>peculium</hi> which of all others he counted most his Due, having paid so dearly for it on the Cross: as they were amongst the Jews sent by the High Priest to fetch in the Dues of the Temple. So also the Imposition of Hands, a Form of Benediction amongst the Jews as antient as <hi>Jacob</hi> himself, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 14. in blessing <hi>Josephs</hi> Sons, was often used by our Saviour to the same purpose. And even the two Sacraments are of this Nature: Baptisme related to the washing in use amongst the Jews at their admitting or Initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating <hi>Proselites;</hi> and Christs ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Bread and giving Thanks,

So the word <hi>Ecclesia</hi> from the Assemblies Sacred or Civil amongst the Jews is made use of to signify the Christian Church which Christ was to gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. So the <hi>Presbyteri</hi> or Elders amongst the Jews are brought by the Apostles to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify an Order in the Church, and <hi>Presbyteria</hi> Colledges of many of them together, call'd by <hi>Igna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

or Councel of Elders that were join'd to <hi>Moses</hi> in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to facilitate the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to him. The Deacons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Primitive Christians were instituted in Imitation of the Treasurer or Steward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Jews, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the place where the Goods which they were to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stibute were kept, was corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent to their <hi>Gazo-philaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> or Treasury: So the Bishop also amongst Christians is a Transcript of the Head of the Congregation amongst them.

Lastly, others assert that that Clause, <hi>For thine is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sdom, the Power, and the Glory, or ever and ever,</hi> was annexed to the Lords-prayer, as parallel to that Form of Speech intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced amongst the Jews in the Time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly interwoven in the Close of their Prayers, <hi>viz. srom an</hi>

            <p>Now these Soveraign or Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Gods were in the vogue and Estimate of elder times of so sublime and venerable an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as they might not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned with the address or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of earthly Applications, or with the care or managery of inferior and terrestrial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, &amp; therefore they brought in, by way of supply, that mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle sort of Divine Powers which they called <hi>Daemones,</hi> to be an Order of Agents and Ministers, or else as Mediators between the Soveraign Gods &amp; Mortal Men; and this is that <hi>Plato</hi> affirms in his <hi>Simposium,</hi> God is not (says he) approached by men, but all that Commerce and Intercourse

which is betwixt the Gods and Men, is performed by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Daemons or Inferior Deities.

of these were the <hi>mali Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii,</hi> or the <hi>torvi Daemones;</hi> hence they represented them under the affrightful Notions of <hi>Erinnies, Eumenides, Larvae, Spectra, Lemures,</hi> and other hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Appellations, and erected Temples and Altars, wherein with Sacrifices and Oblations, they endeavoured so to mollifie and appease their fury, that they might be redeem'd from that dammage and prejudice which might else like a Black Tempest have descended upon them.</p>
            <p>This Discourse leads me to peruse the Original of these Daemons, whom upon a serious Scrutiny I find to be only the Souls or Spirits of some Deceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heroes Canoniz'd and Deifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Superstition of elder

               <hi>Philo Biblius</hi> in his Preface to his Translation of <hi>San Coniat hon,</hi> the ancient <hi>Phoenician</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian, delivers what he had observed and deduced out of the same Author, and might be Ministerial to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Understandings who should read him; namely, that all the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Phoenici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> from whom the rest extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it, esteemed those their <hi>Dii Medioxumi,</hi> who had found out any thing profitable for the Life of Man, or had deserved well of any Nation, so that they worshipp'd these as Gods, ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting

Statues, Obelisques, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages and Temples unto them; and more especially they gave the Names of their Kings (as to the Elements of the world) so also to these reputed Gods; for they esteemed the natural Deities of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and those which were in these, to be solely and properly Gods; so that their Deities were ranged and marshalled into two distinct Orders, the one Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and the other Eternal.</p>
            <p>And to this purpose <hi>Hesiod</hi> speaks in his Poems, when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that luxuriant Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>Phansie,</hi> Poets entitle themselves to, he tells us, that when those happy men, that flourished in the first and Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Age of the world, had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60469:37"/>
this Life; great <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> promoted them to be Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that is, Keepers or Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, Protectors and Patrons of Humane Nature, and Earthly Mortals, Overseers of their good or evil works, Dispensers of Riches; and this he affirms is that Majestick Royalty they are invested with. To abet all that hath been discours'd of before, <hi>Plato</hi> in his excellent Treatise <hi>De Rep.</hi> would have all those that had fallen with Honour in the Field, to be enroll'd in <hi>Hesiod's</hi> Golden Register, and to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to the preheminence and dignity of Daemons, and the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to be consulted, how they should be both enterr'd and honour'd; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ever afterwards their Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers

to be approach'd with the same Reverence and Esteem as Addresses were made to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positories and Tombs of other Daemons.

Thus have we trac'd out, and unvail'd the Original Genealogy of Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, according to the most ancient Opinion, and general Notion of the Gentiles; But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A Transcript of which Charm or Address, as it is set down by <hi>Macrobius</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60469:43"/>
Ceremonies and Enclosures of their City; to go away from them, and to strike some terrour and astonishment into that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and City; and having left it, to come to <hi>Rome</hi> to me and mine; and that our Cities, Places, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Ceremonies, be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and better lik'd of you; and that you would take the charge of me, of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of my Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or as we may know and understand it; if you do so, I vow to build you Temples, and to appoint solemn Sports for you. When they invok'd the Infernal Gods to depart a City, they touch'd the Surface of the Earth; when they mention'd the Supernal Deities, they ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted their hands to Heaven;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60469:44"/>
when they recited their Vow, they affix'd their hands to their Brests.</p>
            <p>And indeed this may appear a probable reason why God so frequently in the sacred Pages with the menace of the severest penalties, and other formidable prohibitions, does deter the <hi>Jews</hi> from framing any Graven Images, to bow down before them and worship them, because the universal Assertion of the Gentiles was, their Gods or Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were Tenants to those gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Mansions.</p>
            <p>I should now represent a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister of those Tutelary Deities the Gentiles stil'd their <hi>Dii Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nores</hi> or Daemons, or <hi>Dii Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oxumi,</hi> or <hi>Deastri;</hi> but before I advance farther in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60469:44"/>
I shall make some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious Remarques on those they call'd their <hi>Dii Majores,</hi> or their greater and more eminent Deities, and then subjoin a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of the other. As for the <hi>Dii Majores,</hi> that were the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors and Tutelary Guardians of the Grecian States, they were circumscrib'd within a narrow Circle, their whole Number swelling but to a List of twelve Namely, <hi>Jupiter, Juno, Saturn, Sol</hi> or <hi>Apollo, Luna</hi> or <hi>Diana, Mars, Mercury, Minerva</hi> or <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, Neptune, Pluto</hi> or <hi>Orcus, Vulcan,</hi> by them stil'd <hi>Mulciber;</hi> and lastly, <hi>Venus</hi> or <hi>Urania,</hi> or <hi>Lilithia,</hi> or <hi>Anaitis;</hi> for so she was named by the <hi>Phoenicians, Syrians,</hi> and <hi>Arabians:</hi> To whom the <hi>Romans</hi> superadded
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60469:45"/>
these eight, <hi>viz. Bereinthia,</hi> or <hi>Cybele,</hi> or <hi>Vesta;</hi> for under all these Appellations she was ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the <hi>Romans,</hi> which flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from one and the same Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <hi>Coelus, Ops</hi> or <hi>Tellus, Bacchus, Alcides</hi> or <hi>Hercules, Ceres,</hi> and lastly, <hi>Proserpina,</hi> and <hi>Janus:</hi> Now to some of these they gave special Attributes; some of the principal of which I shall now recite. <hi>Jupiter</hi> by the <hi>Romans</hi> was called <hi>Jupiter Stator,</hi> or <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> the Stayer; because in a Fight between <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> King of the <hi>Sabins,</hi> when the <hi>Romans</hi> began to retreat, <hi>Romulus</hi> vowed to erect a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to him, under that Attribute, if he would infuse new courage into the faint and drooping <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and stop the flight of the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60469:45"/>
one, and the victorious progress of the other, which accordingly (say the <hi>Roman</hi> Historians) being effected, <hi>Romulus</hi> paid and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd his Vow, and <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in subsequent Ages, was in that devoted Temple ador'd, under that Notion. Secondly, He was nam'd <hi>Jupiter Lapis;</hi> hence <hi>per Jovem Lapidem jurare,</hi> does frequently occur in the Roman Antiquities; now the reason of this Attribute was this; In those publick Contracts the <hi>Romans</hi> entred into, either with their Allies, or Enemies, they cast away a Stone, with this Imprecation annex'd to it, May <hi>Jupiter</hi> that is the great Witness to this solemn Contract, so reject and cast away us, as we do now this Stone, if we by a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60469:46"/>
false and injurious violation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe this signal and publick Stipulation. In relation to this practice of theirs, <hi>Grotius</hi> in his Treatise <hi>De Jure Belli &amp; Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> discourses excellently well; his words are these: <hi>Qui per Lapidem jurat</hi> (says he) <hi>si falsum juraverit perjurus est, quia non te audit Lapis loquentem, sed pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit Deus fallentem.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he subjoins this reason to fortifie what he had discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of before. <hi>Neque honos ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus deberi potest Deo</hi> (says he) <hi>si nihil praestet colenti; nec ullus metus si non irascitur non colenti.</hi> Thirdly, He was <hi>Jupiter Labra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus,</hi> from his being portray'd or insculp'd on ancient Coins and Images, holding an Axe or Hatchet, which amongst the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60469:46"/>
               <hi>Grecians</hi> was the Symbol, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliphick of Justice. Fourthly, He had the Appellation of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter Pistor,</hi> or the Baker; and the reason of this Attribute was, because when the <hi>Gauls</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged the Capitol, and much distressed the Garrison, <hi>Jupiter</hi> instructed the <hi>Romans</hi> in their sleep to fling out their Bread to them; which caused the <hi>Gauls</hi> to abandon the Siege, believing the Capitol to be well furnish'd and stock'd with Provision to secure it against the Distresses of an approaching Famine. He had other Epithetes of less Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; some of which I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon, and the rest entomb in silence; as <hi>Nenius,</hi> God of Hospitality, <hi>Philus</hi> God of Love,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60469:47"/>
               <hi>Neterius,</hi> God of Fellowship; <hi>Homogenius,</hi> God of Kindred; <hi>Phratrius,</hi> God of Tribes; <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horeius,</hi> God of Oaths; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate to us, what a respectful or cautious regard men should have of Hospitality, Love, Fellowship, Kindred, Tribes, and Oaths. But he had two sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Attributes bestowed upon him by the Gentiles; namely, <hi>Jupiter Teretrius,</hi> and <hi>Elicius: Jupiter Teretrius</hi> was call'd so from the Globous Figure of the Earth, which is <hi>teres &amp; rotun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and which he is insculp'd with in ancient Coins, sometimes supporting it in his hand, and sometimes treading upon it with his Foot; or rather from <hi>teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Hostes,</hi> from wasting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying the Enemies of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:60469:47"/>
Grandeur. Secondly, He was stil'd <hi>Jupiter Elicius, ab eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendo Suppetias,</hi> because when the <hi>Romans</hi> were engag'd in perplexed difficulties, he rescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them from those prejudices by an extraordinary Supply and Support.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Juno</hi> likewise had several Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles attributed to her. She was stil'd <hi>Nebo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Baaltiis</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and <hi>Soti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cena, Sospitatrix,</hi> and <hi>Opipena</hi> amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> because she was favourable and helpful to Women, in the agony and pangs of Child-birth; hence that usual Address of the teem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Roman</hi> Ladies, <hi>Juno Lucina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer opem.</hi> Then she was named <hi>Curetis,</hi> the Goddess of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and <hi>Populonia,</hi> the Goddess
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60469:48"/>
of the People: She had also the Epithite of <hi>Juno, Gamelia,</hi> and <hi>Juga,</hi> or <hi>Jugatina,</hi> that is, the Goddess of Marriage; in order to which, she had the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Appellations of <hi>Interduca,</hi> because she was supposed to be assistant to persons at their Inter-Marriage; <hi>Domiduca,</hi> because she conducted them home; <hi>Unx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ia,</hi> because the Posts of the house where the Nuptial Feast was solemniz'd, were anciently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with Oyl, the Embleme of Joy and Festivity; and <hi>Cinx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ia,</hi> either because by her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, the <hi>Cestus</hi> or Virgin Zone was more successefully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, or else because the Posts of the Bridal Mansion were bound about with Chaplets and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands: She likewise was known
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60469:48"/>
by the Title of <hi>Juno Caprotina</hi>' and was stiled so because she was entituled to the protection of the Trees called <hi>Caprosici,</hi> one of which bordered upon the margin of the Camp of the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of their Maid Servants, gave a signal Defeat to <hi>Posthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Livius,</hi> General of the <hi>Fidenates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturn</hi> was stil'd <hi>Chronos,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which Notion they prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Time, and from hence the Ancients affirmed him to be the Son of <hi>Coelus</hi> and <hi>Ops,</hi> or <hi>Tell us,</hi> because Time is measured by the Motion of the Heavens, and the Vicissitudes and Seasons of the Earth; and therefore they painted him holding a Sithe, to suggest to us that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:60469:49"/>
which in the vulgar appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension was so inexpugnable, but the Sithe of Time could mow it down, or subvert it. He was likewise nam'd <hi>Sterculius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casue he first instructed men with Dung or Compost to till and manure the Earth; and some antiquated Coins that still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his memory, have on their Reverse the Sculpture of a Ship, by which is intimated, that he was the first that taught men the Art of Navigation; for which he was exceedingly honoured by the <hi>Tyrians</hi> and <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> under the Notion of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com</hi> and <hi>Moloch,</hi> both derived from the Punick word <hi>Melech,</hi> which in that Dialect imports as much as King, as <hi>Milce</hi> does Queen; or else because he was

               <hi>Janus</hi> is by <hi>Bochartus</hi> deem'd to be but a Transcript of <hi>Noah;</hi> first, because <hi>Jajin</hi> in the Hebrew signifies Wine, of which <hi>Noah</hi> was the first Inventer. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Because he was anciently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sculp'd with two Faces, which is exactly parallel to <hi>Noah,</hi> who looked backwards npon the old World that perish'd under the angry Baptism of an Universal Deluge; and forwards upon the Universe newly started out from that publick lnundation. And thirdly, upon very ancient Coins, where the Signature of <hi>Janus</hi> is insculp'd on the one side, there
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60469:57"/>
is the Figure of a Ship endorsed or impress'd on the Reverse, which preserves the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of safety and shelter that <hi>Noah</hi> receiv'd in that wooden Isle the Arke.</p>
            <p>There were many other Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetes that these <hi>Dii Majores</hi> of less moment and importance, which were borrow'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from some Hills, Cities, and Regions where they were ador'd, which are exactly deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered by <hi>Lillius Giraldus</hi> in his <hi>Syntagmata Deorum,</hi> whither I refer the Reader.</p>
            <p>Before I leave this Discourse, because it conduces much to the understanding of ancient Coins, and Medals, I shall represent how the Fictions of the Poets did describe these Deities to be
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60469:58"/>
drawn in their Celestial Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots. <hi>Jupiter, Sol, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Neptune</hi> had theirs conducted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long by Horses; <hi>Bacchus</hi> had his manag'd by Linces and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; <hi>Saturn</hi> by Dragons; <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> by Stags; <hi>Luna,</hi> or the Moon by Oxen; <hi>Juno</hi> by Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks; <hi>Cybele</hi> by Lions; <hi>Ceres</hi> by Serpents; <hi>Pluto</hi> by four black Horses; <hi>Mercury</hi> in stead of a Chariot, had Wings annex'd both to his Head and Heels; <hi>Venus</hi> had hers attended on by Swans, Doves, and Sparrows, the last of which is excellently well pourtrayed and descanted on by the Greek Epigrammatist, and thus made to speak English;</p>

of an execrable Impiety: Nay, such a venerable esteem did the Gentiles ascribe to the Temple of <hi>Apollo Pythius,</hi> that it was judg'd a Crime of a black Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture but to walk in it; and by the Law of <hi>Pisistratus</hi> was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with death.

            <p>I shall now proceed to offer up a concile Scheme of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices themselves, whose Mode and Method is thus decipher'd; None were to approach the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar until they were first purified; nor must the Victim be laid on it, until it had receiv'd its Lustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Meal and Holy Water, gather'd from their Lavatory, stil'd <hi>Chernips.</hi> Some sprinkling of this Water was strewed on the standers by, after a Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand snatched from the Altar had been first drench'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish'd in it, and then some sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Meal was cast on them. This done, the Priest offered up his Orizons, and then the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was conducted to the Altar with the Head downwards, if
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60469:72"/>
it were devoted to the Infernal Gods, but upwards, if it were dedicated to the Celestial; the Heart, Spleen, Liver and Fat were offered to the particular Deities, the residue of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim was a Feast for the Priest and People, consuming the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the Day in a licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and vitious Festivity: when the <hi>Greeks</hi> sacrificed to <hi>Vesta,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> to the <hi>Lares,</hi> they devoured the whole Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; hence <hi>Lari Sacrificare,</hi> was to eat up all: Persons of a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner capacity offered Meal or Cakes, the same with the <hi>Roman Mola,</hi> to which those of richer Demeasne added the mixture of Wine and Oil. These frugal Sacrifices are stil'd by <hi>Pindar,</hi> Supplicating Sacrifices, suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60469:72"/>
to us, that there was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more Devotion manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in these mean and thrifty oblations, than there was in more splendid and pompous Victims: They were accustomed to try if the Sacrifices would prove ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to their Gods, by pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a Cake upon the Head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Horns, which were in solemn Feasts guilded; if the Beast was compos'd and quiet; it was judged to be a fit Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; but if disorder'd and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous, it was rejected. In all Sacrifices <hi>Vesta</hi> was first invok'd; to intimate the antiquity and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Fire (of which she was made the Patroness by the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>) in those oblations. In the morning they us'd to sacrifice to their gods, in the evening to their
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60469:73"/>
Demi-Gods or Heroes. The <hi>Greeks</hi> did not as the <hi>Romans,</hi> grind the Corn they plac'd on the Head of the Victim, but laid it on the Mass to demonstrate the ancient Mode of Feeding, before grinding of Corn was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted. They were accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed also after the Sacrifice and Feast, to burn the Tongue of the Beast, and sprinkle Wine on it, to specifie, that after eating and drinking, the Tongue should be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obliged to Silence, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing divulged that was uttered in times of Festivity: This Rite was also solemnized to the honour of <hi>Mercury,</hi> who was in their Estimate the Patron of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence, and Deity of Sleep; and therefore about that time that was devoted to Repose, the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60469:73"/>
Tongue was sacrificed. The <hi>Grecian</hi> Priests were accustomed in an irregular Dance to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Altars, beginning first at the left hand, to insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the motion of the Zodiack, which is from the West, and was by ancient Astronomers sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the left part of the world; then they began their measures at the right hand to demonstrate the motion of the first Sphere, which is from East to West.

            <p>Having taken in pieces most of the Ingredients that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the Gentile Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I shall now describe those Festivals customary amongst the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi> first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were a principal part

of their Religion: secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many held some correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and proportion with the Feasts of the <hi>Jews;</hi> so that it is probable they were first copied from that Original.</p>

They entitle their first instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Dioscuri,</hi> or <hi>Castor &amp; Pollux. Anacalypteria</hi> were Feasts dedicated by the Rusticks to <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their Corn and Fruit; it was also observed by Brides up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their entrance into Marriage, because then the Bride that had been before cloistered up in her Fathers House, began to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd and discover'd; hence the Presents the Bridegroom en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed her with, had the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of <hi>Anacalypteria. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thisteria</hi> were Feasts devoted to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> observ'd in the Moneth <hi>Anthistorion,</hi> supposed by the Learned to be <hi>August,</hi> named so because the <hi>Athenian</hi> Children were then crowned with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands of Flowers. <hi>Aletis</hi> was a

Feast that preserv'd the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Icarius</hi> and <hi>Erigone.

               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:60469:87"/>4. <hi>Augurium,</hi> so called <hi>ab A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium garritu,</hi> was a prediction from the Chirping or Chattering of Birds; as also from the sounds and voices heard they knew not whence, nor on what occasion. In which latter kind the death of <hi>Caesar</hi> was divined, from the clattering of Armour in his House; and the poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Germanicus,</hi> by the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Trumpet of its own accord; In the former, an Owl screeching in the Senate-house, was deemed ominous to <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus;</hi> and a company of Crows following <hi>Sejanus</hi> to his House, with great noise and clamour, was judg'd to be fatal to hat great Favorite; and so it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>It is to be observed, that the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60469:87"/>
Priests that managed these My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries were attir'd in <hi>Chlaenâ,</hi> that is a Garment (as <hi>Ferrarius de re vestiaria</hi> expounds it) of Purple Cloth, lin'd with Wool, to whose Treatise, for more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Information I refer the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>It is now expected I should unvail that mysterious Learning of the Ancients that lay folded up in the Aenigmatical and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorical Mythology of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; but this I hope I shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish in a Treatise I am now designing to offer up to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick view, Entituled, <hi>The Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Growth, and Improvement of Heraldry,</hi> wherein I believe I shall give the World and the Reader a plenary satisfaction: I had almost forgot to decipher
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60469:88"/>
the several Species of Musick in use amongst the Ancients, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Greeks</hi> at the solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of their Festivals, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rituals above said, some part of which was in subsequent times, when the Mists of Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity were dispelled, annex'd to the Retinue of Christian Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and introduc'd into the <hi>Basilica's</hi> or greater Churches, about the Year 300<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was the time of their Erection, the Christians by this Artifice en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring so to oblige and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear them, that they might bring them to be enamour'd on the Faith of Christ, when they should see that a prime Rite of theirs was adopted into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of its Religion, and made to wear a Christian Habit, that
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60469:88"/>
before was invested with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane one. But because I shall be a little more diffusive on this Subject, I shall give this brief Original of the ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Musick, and so determine this Treatise.</p>
            <p>When Musick was introduced into those Churches, Antiquity call'd the <hi>Basilica's,</hi> or their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Churches, &amp; which we now stile Cathedrals, which were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected about the Year 300, is uncertain; only it is probable, that about this time of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> it was incorporated into the Christian Discipline, and that upon two Considerations; First, as <hi>Augustine</hi> well observes, <hi>Ut per oblectamenta aurium as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surgeret animus ad Pietatis affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum;</hi> that by the Obligation
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60469:89"/>
of the Ear, the mind might be raised to an affectionate delight in piety; or secondly, that by an easie and symbolical compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Gentiles (in whose Temples, to improve the solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their Sacrifices, and other publick Devotions, Musick was in use many Ages before) they might so engage and endear them, that they might bring them by degrees within the pale of the Christian Church: Indeed this was customary in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times for the Bishops of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> those Ages, observing that the Gentile Priests us'd the Ring, Staff, and Mitre (as <hi>Philostratus</hi> asserts) practis'd those Rituals too, and in the highest detestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Follies, thought they might wisely enough imitate
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60469:89"/>
their innocent Customs, and Priestly Ornaments, and hoped they might better reconcile their minds to the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by compliance in Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials, than exasperate them, by rejecting their ancient and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Ceremonies; for so the Apostles invited and enticed <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism</hi> into Christianity. Now amongst the Ancients there were three Distinctions of Musick; First, the <hi>Ethick</hi> or <hi>Lidian,</hi> which consisted of Long Notes or Spondees, fit to calm the Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and raise the Affections, and this is supposed to be that Musick which <hi>Elisha</hi> called for to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
