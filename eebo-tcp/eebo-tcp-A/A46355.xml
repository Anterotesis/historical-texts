            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>§. For the credit of the perſon, <hi>William Juniper, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Gosfield,</hi> I knew him many years, while I liv'd at <hi>Bocking;</hi> he dwelling at <hi>Gosfield</hi> a mile from me, and oft working in his Trade as a <hi>Bricklayer,</hi> at Squire <hi>Wentworths</hi> Houſe, the Lord of <hi>Bocking</hi> my next Neighbour; who would ſometimes tell me merrily, that <hi>Goodman Juniper</hi> had ſtrange Fancies, Dreams and Viſions, but withall that he was a very honeſt man.</p>
            <p>I took little notice of the Man, or his Fancies, ſuppoſing him to be but a weak and crazy minded Man, whoſe ſimplicity and Honeſty were the beſt Apology for all he ſaid; poſſibly without fraud or affectation, but mixt with ſome Fatuity.</p>
            <p>After ſome years, now full of trouble and terror, when the new Modelled Army had ſhewed the King, the two Houſes, their own Aſſociates, and all the world, what <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> what <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> they would be, by levelling all things in Church and State, to a Democracy, Stratocracy and Anarchy; about the year (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member 1649.) in the ſpring time <hi>Juniper</hi> comes, one morning betimes to my Houſe, very importune to ſpeak with me; being told by my ſervants, that I was not yet riſen, he deſired he might have acceſſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57257:4"/>
to my Chamber, which I permitted him, (looking upon him as a very harmeleſſe poor man) when he was come to my Chamber dore, he told me (after the uſual civility of a good morrow) that he was that night commanded to come to me, and to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to me what I ſhould Preach, <hi>Holineſſe to the Lord, Holineſſe to the Lord, Holineſſe to the Lord;</hi> which he repeated three times with an Emphaſis; &amp; ſo took his leave; haſtning though a wet morning to go to Four or Five other neighbour Miniſters, and ſound the ſame Alarme to them.</p>
            <p>This ſudden and odd acceſſe of <hi>Juniper,</hi> confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med me in the thoughts, that he was a little crazy; full of Fancies, and more to be pitied, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
            <p>Afterwards as our Engliſh Affairs grew perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, deplored and deſperate, my Neighbour Mr. <hi>Wentworth,</hi> would now and then intimate to me what ſtrange confidences <hi>Juniper</hi> had of a Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Reſtoration of the Church and Kingdom. How he had foreſeen and foretold many Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which were come to paſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet nothing could ſo weigh with me as to give <hi>Juniper</hi> any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to think that I had the leaſt conſideration or confidence of his Dreames, Viſions, and Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>Yet at laſt hearing from divers hands many ſtrange expreſſions of his, referring to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique; I ſent for him one day, as deſirous alone and at leaſure to ſpeak with him, and to ſee whether the man had ſuch defects or darknings of reaſon, as might wholy impute his Fancies to a crazy brain, or melancholly dotage; or whether there were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57257:4"/>
any thing extraordinary and remarkable in him.</p>
            <p>§. He very Officiouſly came in a faire Summers morning to my houſe, and walking with him alone in the very pleaſant walks of my Garden, I told him, that I had heard many ſtrange things relating to our times, which were Fathered on him; I ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conjured him as in Gods ſight to tell me the truth of things; I told him he could not be ignorant how great a ſinne a lye was, eſpecially when being forged in a mans own heart and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he ſhould impute it to God, as a Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Viſion, or prediction.</p>
            <p>§. The good man (now above Sixty years old) of a very comely and honeſt aſpect, with great plainneſſe of Speech, gave me thanks for my favour to him, that I would vouchſafe to ſpeak with him, and to admoniſh him of that duty in truth-ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which he owed to God, to his own Soul, and to all Men; profeſſed to me he would not ſpeak any thing but what was repreſented to him as true; For Sir, ſaid he, I fear God, to whom I muſt give account of my words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus ſounded the ſincerity of the Good Man, and finding him a true <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> not only with out any feining, guilt or affectation, but ſo ſerious and conſciencious, ſo knowing in the Scriptures, ſo judicious in his Religion, ſo ſteddy in his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo diſcreet in his Expreſſions, and ſo pious in his Converſation; I had then a further <hi>curioſity</hi> to ſee the bottom of his buſineſs; and intreated him to tell me, ſince what time he had perceived any of theſe impreſions on his ſpirit or fancy, or what he thought of them? how they were upon review preſented to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57257:5"/>
him? whether he had them Waking or Sleeping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. The good man with great Veneration of God, and more reſpect to me than I could deſerve; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring me againe of the truth of what he ſhould relate to me, thus began;</p>
            <p>§. Sir, The experiments I have had of theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions at ſundry times upon my mind in the night have been both ſleeping and waking, or as it were between both; I ſuppoſe they begin in my ſleep, and when I am aſſuredly awake, they do ſtill continue with ſo quick and clear repreſentations to me, that I cannot well diſtinguiſh the difference of them, as to my imagination; either ſleeping or waking: They are alwayes ſo exactly the ſame in my mind and memory; they make ſo deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on me, that I never forget them. All particulars are ſtill the ſame before me, as they firſt appeared.</p>
            <p>§. I asked him what was the firſt inſtance in this kind which made him take notice of ſuch Fancies beyond ordinary Dreams? This he told me was thus; I had been married (Sir) Seaven years and had no Child (a bleſſing deſirable to the poor as well as the rich) for which I beſought God with more then ordinary earneſtneſs of devotion; ſoon after I dreamed I had a Sonne, and ſaw the Child in ſuch a party coloured Garment: according to the time of life (which was his very words) the Lord gave me a Child by my Wife; who (unwillingly) made it's firſt Coat of a ſtuffe ſo coloured, as I ſaw in my Dream; which ſeemed to me as ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all inſtance, that this Child was a gift of God in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to my prayers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:57257:5"/>§. After this the Troubles and Terrors of times comming on, to the ruine of our Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, I was (quoth he) much afflicted in my ſoul to ſee the ſad diſſentions raiſed between the King &amp; the two Houſes of Parliament; having learned in the word of God, that the honour of true Chriſtian Religion, conſiſts much in the patience and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Subjects to their lawful Kings. The War growing hot, and little hope of Peace, (my heart being full of Fears) I had this Dream in the Night; Paſſing by ſuch a Neighbours Houſe to a Water-Mill (which he named) and having two little <hi>Beagles</hi> following me, (a ſport of foot Hunting, which he had ſometimes uſed in his younger dayes) there came out two great Dogs, Full and Fat, which fell on my Beagles, and worried them exceedingly; At which I was ſo moved, that to preſerve them, I laid on as hard as I could with this Quarter ſtaffe, (which was now in his hand as he uſed to walk with it) upon the great Curs, but in vain; for they were ſo ſmooth and fat, that no ſtroke would fix on them, to make them feel the ſmart; upon which I called to the Miller, whoſe thoſe Dogs were, and asked him, if he were not aſhamed to ſee his great Curs, thus abominably worry my two little Beagles; he with indifferency, anſwered, it was no wonder; for (ſaith he) my Dogs are called <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power;</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this anſwer I was the more <hi>amaz'd,</hi> becauſe I bethought my ſelf that my two Beagles were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ I interrupted him, Goodman <hi>Juniper,</hi> would you call any Dogs by thoſe Names of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:</hi> No (Sir) replyed he, God forbid, but in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57257:6"/>
my ſleep they were thus preſented to me; as ſo nam'd; the <hi>interpretation</hi> he eaſily made, according as he thought the juſtice of the <hi>Cauſes</hi> and <hi>Merits</hi> of the parties would bear. For he was a moſt Loyall Subject to his King, and a moſt Religious Sonne of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> a lover of Truth and Peace.</p>
            <p>§. After this, (as he then told me) he had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dream a good while before the King was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; in this manner, I was walking in ſuch fields (naming them) by the hedge ſide, over which as I ſometimes looked, I ſaw a great company of people as Souldiers, Horſe and Foot in confuſed motions: while I got on the higher ground to ſee more exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what the matter was; I ſaw men flying this and that way, many faln and ſlain on the grounds, and amidſt the Corps, one that lay higher than the reſt by himſelf, with Robes or Garments about him very goodly, as if he were ſome great perſonage or Prince, but beſmeared with blood; while I beheld with grief this ſpectacle, I ſaw a Woman in a rich mantle of purple come riding amain to that dead Corps, and caſting her ſelf upon it ſhe rent her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, tore her hair, and fell into a moſt bitter Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, being forſaken of all: This he told me ſeemed to him to repreſent the death of the King and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> deploring it with ſuch bitterneſſe, as that Tradegy deſerved; which ſoon after came to paſſe.</p>
            <p>After this (as he proceeded) the Year before King <hi>Charles</hi> the Seconds coming to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> I had another Dream; My thoughts I ſaw a goodly young <hi>Lion</hi> in a large Field; the other Beaſts, as <hi>Horſes, Bulls, Bears, Aſſes, Wolfes, Dogs, Hares, Foxes,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57257:6"/>
Apes,</hi> with others, that followed him with ſuch a perulant and ſcornful importunity of geſture and noiſe, as that they would be gladly rid of him; and ſhewed they had reverence for him. The <hi>Lion</hi> marched away without betraying any fear; but yet ſo, as he ſeemed not pleaſed with ſuch rude company: when he was quite gone out of ſight, all the <hi>beaſts</hi> gathered together as in a round, and ſitting down on their hinder parts, made their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>noiſes</hi> as loud as they could, bellowing or roaring, or braying, or howling, or crying out in a kind of hideous triumph and joy, that they had thus driven the <hi>Lion</hi> out of the Field, and forced him to hide himſelf from them. The event was ſo evident an interpretation and completion of this prediction, as nothing could be more eaſie and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the good man, than to ſee how his thoughts were adapted to thoſe things, which he lived to ſee fulfilled.</p>
            <p>§. Soon after this, when an horrible darkneſſe with all manner of licencious confuſion and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous oppreſſion, had covered the face of all things in Church and State, (the glory of <hi>England</hi> in its eſtabliſhed Religion and excellent Lawes, (which were formerly carried on by the ancient ways of Government <hi>Regal</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi>) being now quite departed;) in the ſame year. He had another Dream or impreſſion on his mind; which he rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me;</p>
            <p>5. My thoughts I was in ſuch a Church atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon thoſe holy Duties, which I there expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted (as indeed he was a very diligent and devout attendant upon thoſe ſervices both on the Lords
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57257:7"/>
day and other occaſions,) while I was looking when Prayers ſhould begin, and the <hi>Miniſter</hi> come, I ſaw of thoſe, which were gathered together (no very great Congregation,) ſome prating and talking, ſome playing and toying, others rude and loud; I was in the Chancel, and being much offended at this rudeneſs in the Houſe of God, I lift up my ſelf on a Seat to ſee that there were no men of worſhip (that was his word) in the Church; when I ſaw three or four (who ſeemed Gentlemen of ſome faſhion,) I took the boldneſſe to call to them; Gentlemen, you ſeem men of worſhip, it is a ſhame to have this rudeneſſe and profanneſſe in the Houſe of God, pray be pleaſed to command them to leave: They looked careleſly on me, as not regarding what I ſaid, nor concerned to keep better order: I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended till the Miniſter came, hoping then there would be ſilence and ſoberneſſe: After I had long looked; me thoughts a <hi>Miniſter</hi> came, as through an obſcure and narrow paſſage of the wall, into a very little Pulpit; when he there appeared, there was no regard had, but the former noiſe, and rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe continued; which gave me ſo great <hi>an offence,</hi> that again I called aloud as before, for regard to be had to the Houſe &amp; worſhip of God; But in vain: The <hi>Miniſter</hi> could not be heard, nor at laſt could I ſee him, a thick miſt of darkneſſe, as ſmoke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between him and the people, which hid the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the eye of the Congregation; this was to my great grief: Afterwards walking ſoftly into the Church-yard as weary of this fruitleſſe attendance, me thoughts, I ſaw a kind of graſſe which is called <hi>penny graſſe,</hi> all withered in the ground, where
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57257:7"/>
it had flouriſhed before in great plenty.</p>
            <p>This Prediction he lived to ſee fullfilled, in thoſe perſecutions which were ſeverely carried on by potent factions againſt all the conſtitutions of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the inſolencies daily uſed in Churches, and in the Mechanick Uſurpation of the Pulpit, and in the contempt generally brought on all decent and orderly Religion, by thoſe whoſe deſignes were to be advanced only by Schiſme, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Falſity and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>6. To all theſe he added, at that time, which was Five or Six years at leaſt before the Kings happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration; this laſt Viſion or Dream, which he thus told me: Me thought (ſaid he) I was in ſuch a large Field, and looking about me, I ſaw from the Eaſt a very goodly <hi>Lion</hi> coming at a ſtately pace; on the <hi>Weſt</hi> I ſaw all ſorts of Beaſts coming towards him, with all reverent and lowly behaviour, crouching and fawning. The <hi>Lion</hi> advanced till he came into the midſt of the Field, and the higheſt place of it, there he ſate down on his hinder part with ſuch <hi>Majeſty,</hi> as ſeemed to keep all the Beaſts in aw; they came in very lowly manner toward him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating themſelves, and at laſt they lay on the ground quietly round about him, but at a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; The <hi>Lion</hi> uſing no revenge upon any of them, ſate compoſed in great ſtate and quiet.</p>
            <p>I ſaid, <hi>Goodman Juniper,</hi> this ſeems to import the Kings peaceable and happy Return again to his Kingdoms, and that we may live to ſee all people ſubject to him. <hi>He replyed,</hi> Sir, I nothing doubt of that; God will certainly Reſtore his Majeſty, and ſubdue all his enemies; though I may not live to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57257:8"/>
ſee it, yet your <hi>Worſhip</hi> may: Thus he; Then profeſſing, by many words, his ſincere and unfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned truth in relating theſe things, as they were evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently at ſeveral times and years repreſented to him, and ſo vehemently impreſſed on his mind, that he ſtill remembred the circumſtances of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, time and place; this houſe, that field, and this tree, which ſeemed to attend his Dream. He aſſured me, that he did not delight to tell theſe things, as having any boaſt in them; nor did he uſually doe it, but ſparingly to ſome ſober friends, as occaſion offer'd and they deſired. But he had ſeen the verifying of ſome things, and this made him the leſſe doubt that the others would be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in God's due time, which he heartily prayed; That ſo the King and Church, or Religion and Laws, Peace and Piety might be again reſtored to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. After this Diſcourſe we parted, and I never ſpake more with him; for he died within one year or thereabouts. I having this immediate relation from him, and finding him, as of a very ſober and ſettled mind, ſo very conſtant, exact and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious, in what he ſaid or did: that he was a plain man, of no great fancy, reach or invention; of no vapour, flaſh or oſtentation, but pious, honeſt and prudent: I preſently after his departure from me, ſet down in writing (as is formerly touched) the <hi>ſum</hi> and main of what he told me; and which I have now (to my beſt remembrance) imparted to the world; not under the <hi>Authentick Authority</hi> of any Spirit of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> but onely as offering theſe things to ſober and wiſe men, who can better
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57257:8"/>
judge, of proportions between the <hi>Predictions</hi> and their accompliſhments, neither of which are to be ſo lightly conſidered, as not to acknowledge ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtrange in ſuch a ſeries or ſucceſſion of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances ſo diſtinctly repreſented; in ſuch very apt <hi>Figures,</hi> or ingenious Emblems, and theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with ſuch ſutable <hi>Events;</hi> nor was either the <hi>humour</hi> of the man to be ſuſpected, being ſo plain Hearted and Religious, nor yet his condition to be deſpiſed, being a very good Chriſtian, living com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably by his calling as one that fear'd God with all his heart; a man of a ſtrickt and holy Life, without any tincture of Faction or Schiſme, a Lover of Truth, Holineſſe, Order and Peace. I confeſſe I ſo much valued his words, after I had thus perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally confirred with him, that I have oft told them to others long before the dawning <hi>of his Majeſties returne:</hi> ſo I did believe and do, that there might be ſomething of a Diviner ſtroke or Beame ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time upon the good mans devout ſoul, whoſe heart and waies were ſo upright before God, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive before men.</p>
            <p>§. 'Tis true, I have heard and read as in <hi>Neptre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane</hi> and others, many things relating to the former <hi>Tragedies of our times,</hi> as portends preſages or Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and ſome of them from perſons of good credit, which forbids me to deſpiſe them wholy, though I do not much dote upon them.</p>
            <p>§. I know all Hiſtories antient and late, Divine, and Humane, Eccleſiaſticall and Civill are full of ſuch like ſeries of Divinations and Dreams, Previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Predictions, as in thoſe which Sir <hi>Henry
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57257:9"/>
Wotton</hi>'s Father had with many others, to which the private and publick events have oft correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; from what genius or temper of ſpirit, of body, or mind they ariſe; whether from a preſaging power, native in the rational ſoul, which may ſometimes if rightly diſpoſed and cleared as it were through little <hi>cranies</hi> or <hi>creviſes,</hi> look forward, and foreſee things to come beyond its ſenſes: or whether there be ſuch a (<hi>ſpiritus mundi</hi>) general correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency or conſpiring of that one harmonious ſpirit, which is in all things under the Sun, that by ſome conſent, or ſecret <hi>ſympathies,</hi> it ſo affects ſome mens minds and fancies, who are tuned and fitted for ſuch ſpecial impreſſions, that they have ſome ſenſe of things to come, while yet their neerer cauſes are wrapped up and undiſcloſed: Or laſtly, whether the wiſe and bleſſed God may not be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſometime to grant ſome ſuch <hi>ſpecial indulgence</hi> to ſome men, as to St. <hi>Paul</hi> in a dark night and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall ſtorm, eſpecially in caſes where providential Riddles ſeem ſo <hi>contradictory</hi> to the rules of right <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>juſtice,</hi> to Morality and Religion, where the ſcandal of mens actions, pretending to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is exceeding great; where their hypocriſies are moſt impudent, cruel and oppreſſive (as in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thauaſius</hi> his ſpeech of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, <hi>Nubecula cito tranſibit,</hi> that he was but a cloud which ſhould ſoon vaniſh.) Laſtly, where even ſuch as <hi>fear</hi> God, are prone to be grieved and perplexed at the long <hi>proſperity</hi> of wicked men; (who ſpeaking lyes in hypocriſie, ſeek to make God the Patron and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of their <hi>ſins,</hi>) I will not determine any thing: only this I am confident of; That there was
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57257:9"/>
nothing of <hi>falſity, vanity, affectation,</hi> or <hi>oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in this <hi>Good man:</hi> Nor were the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon his <hi>fancy</hi> tranſient and volatile, as is uſual in Dreams, which ſoon loſe themſelves, and vaniſh without any retriving, but theſe were ſtill pregnant and conſtant, the ſame in their quick repreſentation, not impertinent, as to the aſpect of our Affairs, nor yet extravagant, or unapt as to the Schemes or Emblems, and appearance of them; which made me think them not wholy unworthy my notice of them, nor of my communicating them upon this occaſion to others; who may if they are wiſe, make a good uſe of them; if they are vain &amp; fooliſh people, theſe will not much add to or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from that folly, which is moſt predominant in them. This is certaine, there is no effect but hath it's cauſe, though nothing be more uncertain than to aſſigne the Genuine and proper cauſes of things, eſpecially ſuch as are under no regular method and courſe of elementary nature; but fall under that infinite variety, which befalls the ſoul of man in its motions Senſible, Fancyfull, Rational and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; Among which none have more in all Ages amuſed the world, than thoſe which have been in the way of Dreams, concerning which who ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be ſatisfied, ſhall do well to read thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Ancient and Modern, who have made the beſt calculations of them. This is ſure, nothing is leſſe to be ſeriouſly regarded by wiſe men, than Dreames, which are as pebles on the Sea ſhore, of various formes and colours, none like another; yet among theſe ſometimes there may be found one or two that are very ſplendid and precious
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57257:10"/>
ſtones, no way to be undervalued or lightly caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: and ſuch it may be theſe were, and will by others as well as my ſelf, be eſteemed.</p>
