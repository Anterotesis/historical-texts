            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable the Lord <hi>Ellesmere,</hi> Lord Chancellor of England.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE shew of antiquity in matters of religion being so plausible to the multitude, and so sorcible to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the simple; I maruell not, my good Lord, if our aduersaries the Papists, who shew themselues also aduerse to truth, do both commonly and willingly entitle their errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous doctrines concerning the worship of Saints and Images, the Popes indulgences, Purgatory, and all their traditions and trash, though neuer so new, <hi>the Old Religion.</hi> Your Lordship also well knoweth, what paines <hi>Parsons</hi> the <hi>Iebusite</hi> hath taken in his bookes <hi>of Three Conuersions,</hi> to prooue, that the ancient inhabitants of this land were conuerted to that religion, which is now professed and taught at <hi>Rome,</hi> not doubting, but if he can prooue it so ancient, that the same will soone be admitted as true, as being deriued from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and most ancient and sincere Bishops of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hauing therefore commiseration of the ignorance of sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Papists, and willing to consirme good Christians in the truth, and to arme the weake against the assaults of such sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, I haue vndertaken to examine his whole discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the three supposed conuersions of <hi>England,</hi> wherein
<pb facs="tcp:21479:3"/>
               <hi>Parsons</hi> indeuoureth to prooue the antiquitie of Popish religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> within this Iland, seeking from the true religion professed here to bring vs back to the haeresies and captiuitie of <hi>Rome,</hi> more odious farre then that of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And this I vndertake not because he deserueth to receiue any long or curious answer, but rather to shew. his consorts, that he bringeth nothing, which cannot easily be answered.</p>
            <p>Some do esteeme the booke very much in regard of the strangenesse and noueltie, promising not only a narration of the planting of religion in <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Austin</hi> the Monke, but also a confirmation of the history of King <hi>Lucius,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leutherius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and new tidings of a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of <hi>Brittaine</hi> wrought by <hi>S. Peter</hi> himselfe: matters of which many will be glad to heare. But he that diligently peruseth what he hath written, shall soone lose all his longing. For whether we consider the subiect of this discourse, or the manner of handling the same, there is nothing that can any way satisfie the reader. The proofes stand vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> coniectures. The authors stile is harsh and vneuen. His rehearsals thick and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious. His purpose fond &amp; foolish. Three things he striueth to prooue. First, that this land was thrise conuerted to religion by preachers sent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Rome,</hi> viz. by <hi>S. Peter, Eleutherius,</hi> and <hi>Austin.</hi> Secondly that the same was conuerted to no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion then that, which is now preached and mainteined at <hi>Rome.</hi> And thirdly that therefore we are now to learne reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and to receiue direction and gouernment from thence. But the first is very euill performed. For of the first conuersion by <hi>S. Peter</hi> he is scarce able to bring any coniecture. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond seemeth fabulous. The third concerneth not the whole land, but only a few <hi>Saxons.</hi> In the second he hath altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther failed, not being able to prooue either his <hi>Tridentine,</hi> or Decretaline doctrine concerning the Pope, the Masse, the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb facs="tcp:21479:3"/>
Sacraments, the worship of saints and idols, and such like matters in question out of the histories of those ti<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s. In the third point he trauaileth in vaine. For why should <hi>England</hi> be more subiect to <hi>Rome</hi> for receiuing the Christian faith from thence, then <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> from whence the sound of the Gospell went into all lands? In the second part of his three Conuersions he seemeth to make great inquirie for our Church and religion in former times. But when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, but we hold all the Christian faith either taught expressely by the Apostles and holy Fathers of the Church, or explaned in the sixe generall Councels; and do only condemne the corruptions of later time brought in by the Decretals and Schoolemens frapling disputes; he sheweth himselfe a blinde searcher, that can neither see, nor sinde our faith and Church before these late dayes. Physitions say, that melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like men are much subiect to dreames. Melancholici saith one of them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. It seemeth therefore, that <hi>Parsons</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this booke of three Conuersions, wherin so many dreames and fancies are conteined, did ouerflow with melancholy. But writing the second part of his treatise it seemeth, that he was in a dead sleepe, and had his senses so bound, that he could neither feele, nor see any thing. In time past, they say, he was able to write well: but now his bookes are like the coynes, of which one in <hi>Plautus</hi> talketh. The last are the worst.</p>
            <p>And this I doubt not to make to appeare in this my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, the which I make bold to present to your Lordship, as a testimoniall of my thankefulnesse, and a pledge of my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction &amp; loue. And the rather, for that, as your Lordship hath bene a principall helper to free me of my troubles, so you may first taste of the fruite of my trauailes. It is more then a yeare since I first framed this treatise, but could not publish it by reason of my other occasions and disturbances. But now that
<pb facs="tcp:21479:4"/>
your bountifull fauours haue giuen me some time of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I thought I could not better employ my life and breath, then in the common defence of the truth. Vouchsafe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, my good Lord, to accept of this small present, and to take both the gift and giuer into your protection. And so I shall be more free to do God seruice, and more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to employ my selfe for his Church, and alwayes rest</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is an old trick of heretikes, Christian Reader, to grace their leud opinions with faire titles. <hi>Sub falso praetextu &amp; spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie pietatis,</hi> saith <hi>Constantine</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Euseb. de vit. Constant. lib. 3. ca. 62.</note> speaking to heretikes, <hi>semper delinquentes, omnia contagione vestra contaminatis.</hi> So <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> albeit he talketh of popish religion, which is nothing else but a mixture of <hi>Iudaisme, Paganisme,</hi> and Heresie; yet doth he giue out, that he contendeth for Christian religion. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine albeit the Masse, wherein the whole seruice of God (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of Papists) consisteth, be but a late pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and their popish opinions meere nouelties, and strange fancies; yet would he make men beleeue, that the Masse was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by <hi>Christ,</hi> and that these new doctrines were taught by <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest of the Apostles of our Lord and Sauiour <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> In his Epistle Dedicatory he calleth the English Papists <hi>the off-spring, and children of the first professors of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie</hi> in this Iland. And yet no children could further degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from their ancestors, then the moderne Papists from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Christians, as by many particulars may be demonstrated. Their faith concerning the foundations of Christian religion, concerning Christs office, and humane nature, concerning the Church and Sacraments, concerning the ministery and policy of the Church, nay co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Law and the Gospell, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether different from that faith which the first Christians of this Iland professed. And were not the difference so great as we find it, yet what needed this babling fellow to search antiquitie for proofe of his three imagined conuersions of the ancient inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of our countrey to Christian religion? Let him shew, that the doctrine of popery which we refuse, is Christian religion, and that it was first taught by Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in Britany, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and that will suffice without more adoe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21479:5"/>
But herein the poore fellow faileth most grossely. Nay where he needed not, blindly he plungeth himselfe into diuers diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, offering to prooue, that the ancient inhabitants of this land were conuerted vnto Christian religion by <hi>S. Peter, Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius,</hi> and the Monke <hi>Austin:</hi> matters farre beyond the reach of his abilitie, and impertinent. For neither doth he prooue, that the <hi>Britaines</hi> were thrise by them conuerted, nor would it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage his cause being prooued, seeing the decretaline and wicked doctrine of Popes, which all true Christians refuse, is of a late and different note from that faith, which those three taught and professed, and which was of ancient time planted in this Iland.</p>
            <p>The which, that it may euidently appeare, I haue for thy bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter satisfaction thought good to examine this whole treatise <hi>of three Conuersions,</hi> in volume big, in value small, in discourse idle, in proofes weake and simple, and altogether vnworthy any long answere, were it not that some men suppose, that he hath sayd somewhat, where God wot his whole treatise is nothing but vaine talking, and tedious discoursing to no purpose. <hi>Eadem at<expan>

            <p>In his Epistle Dedicatory he giueth the title of <hi>Catholikes</hi> to <hi>English</hi> Masse-priests and their consorts. But that is the point in question. He calleth them also <hi>the worthy children</hi> of the first professors of the Christian faith in this land. But the testimonie of a bastard shall neuer make bastard professors true <hi>Christians.</hi> Further it is not like, but his prouision will faile him before the end of his iourney, that beginneth so impudently to beg at his first setting forth, and so presumptuously to take for granted matters in controuersie. <hi>Finally,</hi> vnder the name of the <hi>Christian catholike faith,</hi> he goeth about to commend the corruptions and trash of the Romish church, as the <hi>Macedonian</hi> heretikes did their hereticall poyson. <hi>Venenum melle illitum, nempe catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co

            <p>He sheweth reasons of his dedication, but all false. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall he euer prooue, that <hi>Papists</hi> professe the Christian ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith first planted in <hi>England,</hi> nor deriue their pedegree from the first Christian <hi>Britains,</hi> or <hi>Saxons.</hi> His best reason is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgotten or ouerslipped, <hi>viz.</hi> that such patcheries are most properly due to such patrons.</p>
            <p>Against true Christians he inueigheth with open mouth, as if they were <hi>heretikes,</hi> and <hi>intruders on the right of the catholike church.</hi> But that is a common practise of men of his sort, to fall to rayling and lying, when by truth they cannot stand. <hi>Hierome in his 2. apology</hi> against <hi>Russine,</hi> speaking of Heretikes, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicti de perfidia</hi> sayth he <hi>ad maledicta se conferunt.</hi> And <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In fauour of the <hi>Papists</hi> he braggeth, that he hath <hi>produced the sentences and arrests of all Christian Parliaments of the world, to wit, the determination of all the highest ecctesiasticall tribunals.</hi> But if by Parliaments he meane generall Councels, he abuseth his clients, and all the world. For it were great simplicitie, if vpon his word they should suppose, either that Popery is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by ancient generall Councels, or that the late conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of <hi>Laterane, Constance, Florence</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> ordered by the Popes directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were lawfull Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels. He doth also erre grossely, if he affirme it. Finally he contradicteth his owne holy fathers pleasure, if he affirme the Councell to be aboue the Pope, and the highest tribunall on earth.</p>
            <p>The words of the Apostle, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. he applieth to such Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists as haue bene of late time called in question for treason and felony, as if they did not only <hi>beleeue in Christ, but also suffer for him.</hi> Whereof the second is euidently false, as publike records testifie; the first is doubtfull, seeing heretikes cannot be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted true beleeuers.</p>
            <p>Likewise he abuseth other scriptures 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. and <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. like the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> endeuouring to wrest the sacred word of God to his owne fancies, and fabulous discourses. <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare

            <p>Neither could he conceale the stirres that haue bene in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> betweene the secular priests, and the Iebusites, although good it were for him, that they were neuer remembred, he being conuinced by the testimonie of his owne followers in diuers discourses written of this argument, to be a <hi>Machiauelian,</hi> 2 <hi>traytor, and a diuell.</hi> Here also he applieth the words meant of our Sauiour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. to <hi>Antichrist</hi> the destroyer, as if he <hi>rising vp could co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand winds &amp; seas, and cause calmes;</hi> who indeede ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther causeth stormes, then calmes; warres, then peace; and is the firebrand of troubles throughout all Christendome. Further he entitleth him <hi>Christes substitute.</hi> But his outragious persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods saints, shew him to be <hi>Christes</hi> aduersary, rather then substitute. Commission or act of substitution he sheweth none. But of the other we find diuers argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. and 11. 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. <hi>Apocalyp.</hi> 13. and 17. which in my bookes <hi>de pontif.

            <p>In an addition to his epistle he triumpheth ouer Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of pious memory, and raileth at her, as <hi>a persecutor,</hi> whose clemencie her greatest enemies cannot chuse but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge: and he among the rest, if he were not vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. But herein the heathen Philosophers do accuse him. <gap reason="foreign">

Neither if he had bene wise, would he haue mentioned these two examples, himselfe in apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacie being like the one, and the Pope in crueltie and pride
<pb facs="tcp:21479:6"/>
farre surpassing the other.</p>
            <p>From railing he falleth into a veine of flattering the King, whom he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pareth vnto <hi>Constantine.</hi> And yet not many yeares since, in his most trayterous booke of titles he sought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue this <hi>Constantine</hi> of the crowne of <hi>England,</hi> and to conuey the same to the Infanta of Spaine, who now condemneth the glosing companions flattery. And very lately the gunpowder Papists by his direction attempted to destroy him, and his whole house. Thus with the time this <hi>Iebusite</hi> can change his note, singing that only which maketh for his profit. <hi>Modo palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atus, modo togatus.</hi> Now he playeth <hi>Dolman,</hi> now <hi>N. D.</hi> But as <hi>Ambrose</hi> sayth writing against <hi>Auxentius, vnum portentum est, duo nomina,</hi> that is, one monster, two titles. Yet such is the folly of this parasite, that thinking to praise the King, he doth greatly dishonor him, comparing his royall Maiesty to diuers not yet conuerted to Christianitie, and implying, that the King is no Christian.</p>
            <p>He talketh of the Kings preseruation; yet may we probably suppose, that he had a finger both in <hi>Percies</hi> treason discouered in Nouember last, and in <hi>Clerks and Watsons</hi> practise executed at <hi>Winchester</hi> not long since, for intending the destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the kings Maiesty, and the subuersion of the realme, as appeareth by a publike edict against them.</p>
            <p>In commending the Kings booke, he condemneth his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: as if any could be more dishonored, then by imputation of want of religion. Againe he contradicteth himselfe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the king <hi>for feruent and extraordinary affection of piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and godlinesse:</hi> and yet presently after taxeth him as being addicted <hi>to vanity, and inanity of sects and heresies, where no ground, no head, no certaine principle, no sure rule or methode to try the truth can be found.</hi> Which his vaine and idle sconce shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer either iustly impute to that religion, which his Maiesty professeth, or cleanly auoyd in that sect, which he followeth, being a pack of impieties, blasphemies, heresies, nouelties, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certeinties, contradictions, absurdities and fooleries. The <hi>first</hi> we verifie by diuers treatises written in defence of our religion, wherein we declare, that the same is not only built vpon the
<pb facs="tcp:21479:7"/>
immoueable rocke <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> the writings of the Prophets and Apostles bearing witnesse vnto it, and full of sincere wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; but also approoued by Councels, Fathers, consent of nations, miracles, yea and by the bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> for many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. The second is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by the schoole doctrine of the Masse, of the Sacraments, of the Pope, of Purgatory, Indulgences, works of supererogation, and such like. For what more impious, then to say, that Christes body may be really eaten of dogs or hogs eating the Eucharist? What more blasphemous, then to giue Gods honor to stocks, stones, and to Antichrist? What more hereticall then to destroy <hi>Christes</hi> humane nature, and office, and to worship Angels, Saints and Images? What more new then the doctrine of <hi>Constance, Florence, Trent,</hi> concerning the massing sacrifice, the communion vnder one kind, the subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of accidents without substance, indulgences and such like? What more vncertaine, then popish religion, that dependeth vpon the Popes determination, a man oftentimes blind, vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and variable? What more contradictory then that Christes body should be both visible and inuisible, aboue and below, dead and aliue at one time? What more absurd then to limite the catholike church within the diocese of Rome, or to say with the <hi>Donatists,</hi> that it is perished out of the whole world, saue in one corner of the Romish church? <hi>Finally</hi> what more foolish, then the apish toyes of Masse-priests at the altar, of massing Bishops in consecrating Churches, and such like super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious ceremonies?</p>
            <p>In his Preface he endeuoreth to prooue, <hi>that man is mutable,</hi> by his owne example, that hath so often altered his intention in his treatise of three Conuersions. But that is little for his credit, or the credit of his cause. For what if he turne like a weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocke, and renounce religion? would he haue all his countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to prooue apostates like himselfe? Truth also is constant, and alwayes like it selfe. But falsehood varieth, and false tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers differ in the defence of falsehood. <hi>Noua ipsa rursum inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uata emendatione scindis, emendata autem iterum emendando condemnas,</hi> sayth Hilary to <hi>Constantius.</hi> The like we may say to this motley and changeable Iebusite, who being vncertaine in
<pb facs="tcp:21479:7"/>
his resolution, and leauing matters formerly purposed, brought forth matters neuer designed, for a calfe presenting his readers with a hedgehog. Afterward he exhorteth men by the example of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> to the search of Catholike Religion, &amp; condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the sluggishnes of them, that are carelesse in this behalfe. But his words are contrary to the Romish practise, that forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the reading of Scriptures in vulgar tongues without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and maketh it mortall sinne for a lay man to dispute of religion. Much, certes, it were to be wished, that men would do as he sayth, for then should Christians easily espy the iugling of <hi>Papists,</hi> and see, that popery is not Catholike, as it differeth from the faith professed in the church of England. <hi>Dagon</hi> cannot stand before Gods Arke, nor darkenes continue, when light appeareth.</p>
            <p>To preuent perillous courses, and to giue light, where cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinty of religion lyeth, he sayth he hath framed his treatise <hi>of Three Conuersions.</hi> But alas, the poore ideot is so farre from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the certeinty of his religion, as the East is from the West. For what assurance can he haue of religion, who doth beleeue neither Propheticall, nor Apostolical writings, nor other article of faith without the Popes resolution, and for his proofes alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth <hi>Simeon Metaphrastes, Surius, Baronius,</hi> and other fabulous writers, and vaine and vncertaine traditions, of which he hath no certeinty? Againe his pamphlet of <hi>Three Conuersions</hi> doth principally handle matter of history, and not matter of faith or doctrine. Lastly, he doth rather seeke to draw men into danger both of soule and body, by seeking to bring Gods people back to the thraldome of <hi>Babylon,</hi> then to keepe them from any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Neither doth he handle in his treatise any point here by him promised. In this preface, I confesse, he compareth the Church to a mansion house, and seuerall points of doctrine to parcels of land belonging to the same, promising that he will make proofe, that the right of the Church belongeth to the <hi>Romanists,</hi> as true owners of the mansion house built in the clouds by <hi>Parsons,</hi> and <hi>that we are but vagrant and contemptible persons.</hi> But first there is great difference betweene the Church, and a mansion house: the Church being a mysticall body, and
<pb facs="tcp:21479:8"/>
being scattered here and there, and not being appropriated to any family, city, or nation: and a mansion house being a ciuill and artificiall building situate in one place, and belonging to one family or sort of people. <hi>Secondly</hi> seuerall points of doctrine are rudely compared to seuerall parcels ofland, which are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall, and may be translated from one to another, whereas points of Christian doctrine are matters spiritual, and cannot be held &amp; truly professed, but by the members of the true Church. In like sort the <hi>Arians by their grosse similitudes depraued such matters, as were well spoken,</hi> as sayth <hi>Athanasius orat. 4. contr. Arian. Incorporalia</hi> sayth he, <hi>corporaliter excipientes, quae probè dicta erant, deprauarunt.</hi> Thirdly neither shall he euer prooue, that the right of the Church belongeth to the Pope and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, nor shall he exclude vs from the precincts of the true Church, howsoeuer in his Luciferian pride he do here despise and scorne vs. His marks of Antiquitie and Succession are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the proper notes of the Church, nor were they so to be taken, can he, if by succession he meane discent of true doctrine, either take them from vs, or giue them to the Popes adherents, who rather belong to the synagogue of <hi>Sathan,</hi> then to the Church of God.</p>
            <p>In the latter end of his Praeface he taketh vpon him the person of a Doctor, and layeth downe <hi>foure points of consideration about matters of faith. The first is, that our articles of faith are aboue mans reason. The second, that they haue sufficient arguments of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility. The third is, that it behooueth vs to haue a pious affection. The fourth is, that some articles of our faith may be demonstrated and knowne by force of humane reason.</hi> But first, he sheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a vaine and arrogant companion, that in matters where he is party, taketh on him to be a Doctor, not distinguishing betwixt a barre, &amp; a Doctors chaire. Secondly, all thèse schoole-points are matters far distant from the argument of <hi>Three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersions,</hi> which he vndertaketh to handle. For I hope he will not affirme, that his Three Conuersions be matters of faith. Thirdly, his first and last point contradict one another. For if all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of our faith are aboue mans reason, as he sayth, handling the first point, then are not some articles of faith demonstrable by force of reason: which is also the doctrine of the Apostle,
<pb facs="tcp:21479:8"/>
who sheweth vs, <hi>that the naturall man vnderstandeth not the things of the spirit of God.</hi> Fourthly, by <hi>pious affection</hi> he absurdly vnderstandeth a good opinion of the Pope and his slaues the <hi>Iebusites,</hi> and Masse-priests. But how can <hi>Christians</hi> haue a good opinion of them, whom holy Scriptures declare to be false tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and vpholders of the kingdome of Antichrist, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience declareth to be professed enemies of piety and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? Fiftly he concludeth very absurdly, <hi>because some matters of faith are demonstrable by reason, that he hath so discussed matters in his treatise of Three Conuersions, as that all matters thereby may be cleared.</hi> For neither doth his treatise properly concerne matter of faith, nor hath he done such glorious acts, as he braggeth of. Finally these points do little relieue <hi>Parsons.</hi> For if we are to talke of matters of religion with great reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and submission, then are the writings of the Schoolemen sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dalous, that dispute <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>contra</hi> in all matters of religion. <hi>Parsons</hi> also dealeth very lewdly, who attributeth more to Philosophical demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then to arguments inducing vs to beleeue matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Next if there be matters sufficient in religion to induce vs to beleeue, then are not the articles of Popery to be beleeued, we hauing more inducements to reiect them, then to beleeue them. <hi>Thirdly</hi> if matters are to be scanned before they be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as <hi>Parsons</hi> inferreth; then most blind are the Papists, that beleeuing the Pope and his adherents to be the Church, drinke vp all the abhominations, which the whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> doth present vnto them, without all examination, whether they be consonant to holy Scriptures &amp; the faith of the ancient Fathers, or not. <hi>Fourthly</hi> if matters are to be examined with serenitie of mind, why are Papists forbidden to reade our bookes, to heare our reasons, nay without licence to reade the Scriptures? Why do they condemne them, whose cause they refuse to heare or know? Lastly this his treatise of Three Conuersions is not such a braue peece of worke, as he imagineth, nor shall he gaine any one iote ofhis cause thereby. For first; it is either false that the ancient <hi>Britains</hi> were conuerted by <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> or else very doubtfull. Likewise it is a matter questionable, whether <hi>Austin</hi> the Monke, or some other did first conuert the <hi>Saxons</hi> to the <hi>Christian</hi> faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21479:9"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> admit the ancient <hi>Britans</hi> had bin conuerted by <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and by <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> and the <hi>Saxons</hi> by <hi>Austin</hi> the Monke; yet this maketh nothing for Pope <hi>Clement the 8.</hi> or <hi>Paule the fift,</hi> that is, no more like to <hi>Peter</hi> nor <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> then a Cheshire cheese to the bright Sunne. <hi>Peter</hi> was a holy Apostle, and fed <hi>Christes</hi> sheepe, <hi>Eleutherius</hi> was a godly Bishop, and preached the Gospell, which <hi>Clement</hi> and <hi>Paule the fift</hi> doth not. Againe <hi>Clement</hi> and <hi>Paule the fift</hi> challenge two swords, and haue a temporall Kingdome, which those two neuer had, nor challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. This <hi>Clement</hi> and Pope <hi>Paule</hi> mainteine many hereticall doctrines established in the Popes Decretals, and late Popish conuenticles, which neither <hi>S. Peter,</hi> nor <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> nor <hi>Austin</hi> euer heard of. Finally neither are the <hi>Romans</hi> subiect to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> although the Gospell first came to them from thence, nor owe we ought to <hi>Rome,</hi> albeit those that first conuerted the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> had come from thence. To those that first taught vs we are obliged to render thanks. But <hi>Parsons</hi> like a foolish logician would thereof inferre, that we are now to yeeld obedience to the Pope, because <hi>Peter</hi> preached first in <hi>Britaine.</hi> He might as well inferre, that the <hi>Romans</hi> are to be subiect to the <hi>Turke</hi> that sitteth at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> for that the Gospell came first to them from thence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly</hi> those exceptions which he taketh to vs and our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are most vaine and friuolous, as the discourse ensuing shall declare. Wherefore, as we haue already ripped vp his rude and ragged epistle, aduertisement, and preface; so now, Godwilling, I purpose to discouer the vnsufficiencie and foolery of the rest of his frapling discourse. I do not thinke thou shalt finde a booke of that bulke so void of all proofe, or good matter, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be some that proceedeth from the same author.</p>
            <p>Reade therefore I beseech thee both our writings with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, and iudge according to equity, and so shalt thou hereafter be made more wary in esteeming such huge volumes fraught with nothing but idle tales, grosse lyes, loose collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to say all in one word, <hi>Iebusiticall</hi> and Popish vanity and foolery, and learne to discerne shadowes from substance, and errors from truth.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this controuersie betwixt our aduersaries and vs, about the first conuersion of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> to Christian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, thrée points are principally to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, &amp; resolued. First, whether the <hi>Britains</hi> were first conuerted to the faith by <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and by <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> and the <hi>Saxons</hi> by <hi>Austin</hi> the Monke. <hi>Secondly</hi> whether these thrée, or any one of them taught that faith, which now the Pope and his adherents professe, and we refuse. And <hi>thirdly</hi> what the moderne Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can challenge of vs, by any fauour done to our auncestors by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> boldly affirmeth, that the ancient <hi>Britains</hi> were conuerted to the faith first of all by <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and next by <hi>Eleutherius</hi> a Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> And thirdly that <hi>Austin,</hi> sent by <hi>Gregory</hi> the first, did first preach the faith to the <hi>Saxons.</hi> But the first co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersion supposed to be wrought by <hi>Peter</hi> we deny. Of the second we haue cause to doubt. Of the third our aduersaries haue no cause to boast.</p>
               <p>He impudently auoucheth, that these thrée taught the same doctrine, which the church of <hi>Rome</hi> now holdeth, and which we refuse. We wonder at his impudency, and laugh at his folly, that attempteth to prooue any such matter.</p>
               <p>Thirdly vpon these supposed conuersions he concludeth,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21479:10"/>
                  <hi>that England and Englishmen haue particular obligation to <note n="a" place="margin">Part. 1. ca. 1.</note> the church of Rome aboue other nations.</hi> He would haue said, if he durst for shame, that therefore we are to be subiect to the <hi>Romish</hi> church, and to receiue her doctrine &amp; trash, I would say, traditions. We say, that we owe nothing but hatred to the Popes, and later church of <hi>Rome,</hi> hauing receiued no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from thence, but wrongs, and disgraces, and losse. If any thing we owe, it is to those, which tooke paines to preach the true faith among vs, and not to the <hi>Romanists</hi> and their agents, that now go about to turne vs from the faith, and to destroy his Maiesty, and our countrey by treason.</p>
               <p>That <hi>S. Peter</hi> neuer preached the Gospell in <hi>Britaine</hi> these reasons are sufficient to perswade vs. <hi>First,</hi> it is apparent <hi>Galat. 2.</hi> that the preaching of the Gospell to the vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised was committed vnto <hi>Paul,</hi> and the preaching of the same to the circumcised, to <hi>Peter.</hi> The direction also of the first epistle of <hi>S. Peter</hi> sent to the <hi>Iewes</hi> dispersed throughout <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Asia and Bithynia</hi> doth prooue it true. How then is it likely, that <hi>S. Peter</hi> leauing the circumcision com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his charge, should preach to the vncircumcision committed to others charge? Or how could he, that preached to them in <hi>Asia</hi> spare so much time, as to make a iourney to preach to them in <hi>Britaine?</hi> Againe can any man thinke, if he had preached to the <hi>Britains</hi> at the time of the writing of the first and second epistle, that he would not as well haue mentioned them, as the Easterne nations? That the second epistle was written to the same persons to whom he had directed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first, it appeareth by these words <hi>2. Pet. 2. This se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond epistle I write to you. Baronius</hi> also confesseth, that he wrote this epistle a litle before his death. It cannot therfore be surmised, that he preached to the <hi>Britains</hi> after the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this epistle, nor that he would neglect them more then others, if at any time he had preached to them.</p>
               <p>Secondly if <hi>Peter</hi> preached the Gospell in <hi>Britaine,</hi> either he preached in <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour his dayes, or vnder the reigne of <hi>Nero.</hi> And so some of our aduersaryes say he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21479:10"/>
preached vnder the reigne of <hi>Claudius,</hi> as <hi>Baronius,</hi> some vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reigne of <hi>Nero,</hi> as <hi>Eisengrenius</hi> in his Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>turics. But <hi>Eusebius</hi> in <hi>Chronico</hi> sayth, that after his comming to <hi>Rome he preached the Gospell there, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued Bishop 25. yeares. vbi Euangelium praedicans</hi> sayth he, <hi>25. annis eiusdem vrbis Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus perseuerat. Baronius anno Christi 58.</hi> relateth, how <hi>Peter,</hi> being expulsed out of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Claudius,</hi> preached to the Westerne nations. But <hi>Onuphrius in annotat. ad vit am Petri</hi> sayth, that being expulsed by <hi>Claudius</hi> out of <hi>Rome,</hi> he went not westward, but eastward, and returned first to <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> where he was present at the Councell at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and afterward sate <hi>7. yeares Bishop</hi> of <hi>Antioch. Ibidem,</hi> sayth he, <hi>7. annis vs<expan>

                     </expan> ad Claudij obitum, &amp; Neronis imperium perman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit.</hi> The report also of his 25. yeares continuance in <hi>Rome</hi> is imprebable. For if he were martyred, as some say the 13. as others the 14. yeare of <hi>Nero,</hi> then could he not be Bishop there 25. yeares, <hi>Paule</hi> being conuerted to <hi>Christ</hi> some yeare or more after <hi>Christes</hi> passion, and afterward abiding in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia</hi> three yeares, and 14. yeares after finding <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> as may be gathered out of the words of the Apostle <hi>Galat. 2.</hi> It is not likely also, that he could suddenly go fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Hierusalem</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> being sent to preach to all natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The best witnesse of <hi>Peters</hi> being Bishop of <hi>Rome 25.</hi> yeares is <hi>Eusebius</hi> his Chronicle: but he testifieth also, that he sate <hi>25. yeares</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> which is a plaine contradiction to all sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of that matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Peter</hi> preached in no place, but he there ordeined Bishops and teachers, and founded Churches. But in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> we do not reade, that either he ordeined Bishops, or founded Churches, or left any memoriall of his being there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the tradition of the church, which is a part of the word of God, as the Papists beleeue, ascribeth the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of <hi>Britaine</hi> to <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathaea</hi> and his fellowes. <hi>Capgraue</hi> in his legend of <hi>Ioseph</hi> affirmeth, that they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the word of God in <hi>Britaine</hi> with great confidence, and this, he sayth, they did the 63. yeare from <hi>Christs</hi> incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. <hi>Anno,</hi> sayth he, <hi>ab incarnatione domini 63. fidem Christi</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Fiftly no one <hi>English</hi> Chronicle doth so much as once mention the comming of <hi>Peter</hi> into <hi>Britaine.</hi> Is it then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that <hi>Simeon Metaphrastes</hi> the writer of the <hi>Greeke</hi> le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend, liuing in <hi>Greece,</hi> or <hi>Caesar Baronius</hi> the calculator of <hi>Romish</hi> traditions and legends, singing Masses at <hi>Rome,</hi> should better know what was done in <hi>Britaine,</hi> then the ancient Chroniclers of the <hi>Britaine</hi> nation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly</hi> of ancient writers of Ecclesiasticall histories no one sayth, that <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle first preached to the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi> Neither doth any ancient father of the church mention any such matter, but rather ascribe that labour either to <hi>Paule,</hi> as doth <hi>Theodoret in commentar. in epist. ad Timoth. &amp; lib. 9. de curandis Graec. affect.</hi> and <hi>Sophronius in serm. de natiu. Dom.</hi> and <hi>Venantius Fortunatus:</hi> or to <hi>Simon Zelotes,</hi> as <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephorus lib. 2. cap. 40.</hi> and <hi>Dorotheus in Synopsi:</hi> or to <hi>Aristobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> as doth the same <hi>Dorotheus,</hi> and some late writers. But if <hi>Peter</hi> had first founded the Church of <hi>Britaine,</hi> it is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that all authors would either haue concealed so glorious an action, or else haue attributed the same to others.</p>
               <p>Finally the aduersaries themselues for the most part confesse, that <hi>Ioseph of Arimathaea</hi> did first conuert the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> to the faith of <hi>Christ.</hi> So sayth <hi>Capgraue</hi> in his legend of <hi>Ioseph.</hi> So sayth <hi>Sanders</hi> in his preface to his sclanderous booke of <hi>schisme. Britannos</hi> sayth he, <hi>ad fidem Christi primus conuertisse, primam<expan>

                     </expan> Ecclesiam in illa natione crexisse perhibetur Iosephus ab Arimathaea.</hi> Lastly <hi>Parsons</hi> himselfe in his late <hi>Ward-word</hi> knew no more, but of the two conuersions, as he calleth them of <hi>England,</hi> the first vnder <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond vnder <hi>Gregory</hi> the first. Wherefore either now, or then he vttred vntruth.</p>
               <p>The arguments and testimonies produced by <hi>Parsons</hi> to prooue <hi>S. Peters</hi> preaching in <hi>Britaine,</hi> are weake and friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. First, saith he, <note n="a" place="margin">Part. 1. ca. 1. pa. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>of S. Peter himselfe, to haue bene in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land or Britany, and preached, founded Churches, and ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Priests and Deacons therein, is recorded out of Greeke
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21479:12"/>
antiquities by Simeon Metaphrastes a Graecian.</hi> But first it may be a question, how he knoweth, that <hi>Simeon Metaphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes</hi> a <hi>Graecian</hi> sayth so, and that out of Gréeke antiquities, seeing he poore idiot vnderstandeth no Gréeke, nor hath read any Greeke antiquities. he quoteth therefore <hi>Metaphrastes apud Surium 23. Iuny.</hi> but <hi>Caesar Baronius</hi> in his Annales quoteth <hi>Metaphr. 29. Iuny.</hi> Secondly he wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth both <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastes &amp; Surius,</hi> adding to their words. Thirdly albeit he had reported their words truly, yet neither are we to giue credit to <hi>Metaphrastes,</hi> a lying pedant, liuing in <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> some 700. yeares agone, and writing more lyes then leaues, nor to <hi>Surius</hi> a superstitious Monke, and a professed enemy of the truth. Finally neither doth <hi>Metaphrastes</hi> nor <hi>Surius</hi> name one Church founded, or one Bishop ordeined by <hi>Peter,</hi> nor is <hi>Parsons</hi> able to name them.</p>
               <p>His second reason is deriued from the testimony of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi> in his epistle to <hi>Decentius</hi> in the chapt. <hi>Quis nesciat. dist. 11.</hi> But first there is no mention in that epistle made of <hi>Britaine.</hi> neither can the same be well vnderstood by the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands lying betwixt <hi>Italy, France, Spaine, Africa, and Sicilia,</hi> but rather some Ilands of the Mediterranean sea. Secondly this epistle is euidently counterfet, and conteineth a most notorious vntruth. For he saith, <hi>that none did institute Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or teach in Italy, France, Spaine, Afrike, Sicily, and the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands betweene them, but S. Peter and his successors:</hi> which is clearely refuted by the preaching of <hi>Paule</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> of <hi>Iames</hi> in Spayne, of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Dionysius</hi> in France, and is conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced not only by the testimony of histories and fathers, but also by the infallible authority of scriptures, which testifie of <hi>Paules</hi> preaching in <hi>Rome</hi> and other places of <hi>Italy,</hi> that receiued no authority fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Peter.</hi> The Glosse therfore to salue this sore, and to help this lye, by <hi>alius</hi> in that Chapter, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth <hi>contrarius.</hi> As if <hi>Innocent</hi> had said, that none did preach contrary to <hi>Peter</hi> in all those places. And <hi>Parsons</hi> to adde some weight to his light argument addeth these words vnto <hi>Innocentius, or his schollers,</hi> falsifying the deposition of his owne witnesse. Finally, these words of <hi>Innocentius</hi> do
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21479:13"/>
not imply, that <hi>Peter</hi> preached in <hi>Britaine,</hi> but some of his successors. The third testimonie brought for proofe of this first conuersion, is taken out of one <hi>William Eisengrene</hi> his first Centurie. But it is of no more weight, then the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of <hi>Isegrime</hi> the wolfe in the booke of <hi>Reinard</hi> the foxe, the fellow being a weake author, and a party in this cause. Furthermore he plainely contradicteth <hi>Caesar Baronius.</hi> For where he saith, that <hi>Peter</hi> preached in <hi>Britaine</hi> in the raigne of <hi>Claudius,</hi> Sir <hi>Isegrime</hi> writeth, that <hi>he founded Christian Churches in England vnder Nero,</hi> if <hi>Parsons</hi> say truly. So ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars confound themselues like <hi>Cadmus</hi> his broode one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending against another, and each cutting his fellowes throte.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parsons</hi> his fourth testimonie is out of <hi>Gildas de excid. Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanniae,</hi> where he saith <hi>the priests of Britaine did vsurpe S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Apostles seate with impure fecte.</hi> But this sheweth, that al bishops teaching <hi>S. Peters doctrine</hi> do sit, after a sort, in S. <hi>Peters</hi> chaire, rather then that <hi>S. Peter</hi> placed a speciall chaire, and sate as Bishop in <hi>Britaine;</hi> of which neither <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> nor other authenticall author giueth the least significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Saint Augustine de Agone Christiano c. 30.</hi> teacheth vs, that these words spoken to <hi>Peter, Louest thou me? feede my sheepe, belong to all Bishops. Cùm ei dicitur,</hi> (saith he) <hi>ad om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes dicitur, Amas me? pasce oues meas. Cyprian, Hierome, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus,</hi> and other Fathers call all Bishops the Apostles suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, albeit the Apostles did not there sit, or teach, where the Bishops haue their sea, which are tearmed their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.</p>
               <p>Fiftly he alleadgeth the testimonie of <hi>Alred Rienual a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stercian</hi> Monk, recorded by <hi>Surius 5. lanuarij, who about 500: yeares agone,</hi> as he saith, <hi>wrote, that S. Peter appearing to a holy man, shewed him, how he preached himselfe in England.</hi> But neither can <hi>Parsons</hi> name this holy man, vpon whose credit this report dependeth, nor is any credit to be giuen to <hi>Surius,</hi> or to his legends, or to such fained dreames and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations, as he reporteth. In the meane while the <hi>Papists,</hi> if they be not wilfully blind, may sée how <hi>Parsons</hi> gulleth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21479:13"/>
them with lyes and fables out of <hi>Simeon Metaphrastes,</hi> and <hi>Surius,</hi> and discerne what a braue péece of worke his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of thrée Conuersions is, that is founded vpon dreames, reuelations and fables, testified onely by authors of legends, fat crammed Monkes, and professed enemies of the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally,</hi> in the same Chapter he discourseth of the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of <hi>Paule, Simon Zelotes, Aristobolus,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimathaea</hi> in <hi>Britaine.</hi> He collecteth also some suspitions, out of <hi>Gildas, Nicephorus</hi> and others, as if the <hi>Britains</hi> were conuerted by some <hi>Romaines,</hi> which being Christians went with <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperor against the <hi>Britains.</hi> But what maketh all this to proue, that the <hi>Britains</hi> were first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted by <hi>Peter?</hi> We are hereof to conclude the contrarie ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For if mention be made of <hi>Simon Zelotes,</hi> and <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolus,</hi> and others of more obscure note for preaching in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine;</hi> it is not like, that the preaching of <hi>Peter</hi> here in this <hi>Iland</hi> should haue bene suppressed in silence, if there had bene any such thing. <hi>Parsons</hi> surmiseth, that those that went with <hi>Claudius</hi> into <hi>Britaine</hi> were sent thither by <hi>Peter.</hi> But that is his owne foolish conceit and vaine imagination. No auncient Writer doth testifie any such thing. Thus then we may sée, that all <hi>Parsons</hi> his discourse concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of <hi>Britaine</hi> by <hi>S. Peter</hi> is subuerted, and brought to nothing. Let vs therefore consider, what is to be thought of the other two supposed conuersions.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the pretended conuersion of <hi>Lucius</hi> king of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and of the <hi>British</hi> nation, to Christian religion by <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius</hi> bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his agents.</head>
               <p>The report of the conuersion of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and their king <hi>Lucius</hi> vnto the faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> although beléeued by <hi>Parsons</hi> and the <hi>Romanists,</hi> as an article of their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible faith; yet for many iust respects may well be called into question. First the name of <hi>Lucius</hi> séemeth rather to sauour
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21479:14"/>
of the Latine, then of the <hi>British</hi> language. Neither can it be said, that he receiued this name in baptisme. For he is so called before he was baptized as well as after, neither doth any Author mention this change of name.</p>
               <p>Secondly, about this time, when <hi>Lucius</hi> is said to haue raigned king of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and long before, the <hi>Romaines,</hi> as histories report, had brought the whole countrie vnder sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, and into the forme of a prouince, which admitteth no king. <hi>Beda de gestis Anglor. lib. 1. cap. 3.</hi> speaking of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> the Emperor saith, that in few dayes he brought most of the Iland vnder his subiection. <hi>Intra paucissimos dies</hi> (saith he) <hi>plurimam insulae partem in deditionem recepit.</hi> Afterward in the same booke and 11. chapter he sheweth, how the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans dwelt &amp; possessed all vnto the banke cast vp vpon the frontiers of <hi>Scotland</hi> by <hi>Seuerus.</hi> Neither is it materiall, that after this the <hi>Britains</hi> endeuored to recouer their aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient libertie. For vnder the raigne of <hi>Commodus,</hi> as <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolinus</hi> testifieth, all the stirres in <hi>Britanny</hi> and other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries were pacified. <hi>In Britannia, Germania, &amp; Dacia</hi> (saith he) <hi>imperium eius recusantibus Prouincialibus omnia per duces sedata sunt.</hi> In the times also of <hi>Domitian,</hi> and <hi>Adrian,</hi> which liued not long before <hi>Lucius</hi> his supposed raigne, we read in <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus,</hi> that the <hi>Britains</hi> liued in subiection to the <hi>Romaines.</hi> How then could <hi>Lucius</hi> in this time rule all the Iland of <hi>Britaine,</hi> as is supposed by the authors of this fabulous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion vnder king <hi>Lucius? Baronius annal. tom. 2. anno 183.</hi> answereth, <hi>that Lucius raigned beyond the wall.</hi> But that sheweth plainely, that this report, as it is recorded by <hi>Bede</hi> and <hi>Geffrey of Momoutb</hi> is vtterly false. For the one repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that the Britaines vnder <hi>Lucius</hi> were conuerted; the other, that all <hi>Britanny</hi> was conuerted from <hi>Paganisme,</hi> and not a few <hi>Britains</hi> onely beyond the wall of <hi>Seuerus,</hi> as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romus</hi> is driuen to confesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> no authenticall authors make mention of this storie. The first spreaders of this report séeme to be <hi>Damasus</hi> in his pontificall, and <hi>Bede</hi> in his storie <hi>de gestis Anglorum,</hi> and <hi>Ado.</hi> Whereof the first deserueth litle credit among the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21479:14"/>
papists. The second reporteth too many things by heare-say. The third is a fabulous Writer. From them, it seemeth <hi>Galfridus Monumetensis, Martinus Polonus, Platina</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue borrowed this fable. The matter as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors report it, is no way probable. <hi>Malmesburiensis in fastis</hi> speaking of <hi>Lucius</hi> saith, <hi>he receiued the faith with the whole nation of the Britains.</hi> But that is altogether improbable: for at that time the <hi>Romaines</hi> professing <hi>paganisme</hi> ruled al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all <hi>Britaine. Galfridus Monumetensis hist. Brit. lib. 4. ca. 19.</hi> saith, <hi>that the preachers sent by Eleutherius did abolish pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganisme almost throughout all the Iland. Cùm per totam ferè in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulam</hi> (saith he) <hi>paganismum deleuissent.</hi> A matter repugnant to all authenticall histories, which testifie that the <hi>Romans,</hi> that then ruled in <hi>Britaine,</hi> and a great part of the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, professed and maintained paganisme, vntil the raigne of <hi>Constantine.</hi> The same man saith further, that in the whole Iland there were <hi>28. Flamines,</hi> or principall priests, and thrée <hi>Archiflamines,</hi> and that king <hi>Lucius</hi> in the place of <hi>Flamines</hi> appointed Bishops, and for <hi>Atchistamines</hi> substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Archbishops. But these are also matters neuer before heard of. For neither had <hi>Lucius</hi> power ouer the whole Ile, as before is declared, nor had the <hi>Britains</hi> any such <hi>Flami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> or <hi>Archiflamines,</hi> nor among the <hi>Romaines,</hi> that had <hi>Flamines,</hi> were any <hi>Archiflamines</hi> appointed ouer <hi>Flamines.</hi> This historie therefore of king <hi>Lucius</hi> may well be parago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the tales of king <hi>Arthur, Sir Tristram,</hi> and <hi>Lance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot du lac,</hi> or of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the Pope <hi>de gestis Romanorum ca. 81.</hi> or of <hi>Rowland</hi> and <hi>Oliuer</hi> in the legend of Romish Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> there is great variance betwirt the reporters of this narration, especially concerning the time, when it should be done. <hi>Baronius</hi> saith, <hi>Lucius</hi> was conuerted during the raigne of <hi>Commodus</hi> the Emperor of <hi>Rome anno Dom. 183.

               <p>Some report, that <hi>Eleutherius</hi> sent <hi>Fugatius</hi> and <hi>Damianus</hi> to <hi>Lucius,</hi> as <hi>Platina in Eleutherio.</hi>

Galfridus hist. Brit. lib. 4. cap. 19.</hi> saith, <hi>Eleutherius</hi> sent <hi>Faganus</hi> and <hi>Duuanus,</hi> and with him consenteth <hi>Ponticus Virunnus. Malmesburiensis lib. de antiq. Glaston. Eccles.</hi> calleth these messengers <hi>Phaganus</hi> and <hi>Deruianus.</hi> The historie of <hi>Landaffe</hi> calleth the Doctors sent by <hi>Eleutherius, Eluanus</hi> and <hi>Meduinus,</hi> and with him consenteth <hi>Caius lib. 1. de antiq. Acad. Cantabrig.</hi> If then truth cannot dissent nor vary from it selfe, how can we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the narration concerning <hi>Lucius</hi> to be true, that is so diuersly reported? Againe, if the king onely, or some few with him were conuerted to Christianitie in the time of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leutherius,</hi> then was religion rather continued, and enlarged by his agents, then restored being lost. Which appeareth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21479:15"/>
also in this, that the king heard of the persecution of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, &amp; of Christian religion before he sent to <hi>Eleutherius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But suppose, that <hi>Lucius</hi> was indéed conuerted to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion about the time reported in the storie: yet it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that those that conuerted the king were rather <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> then Romaines. That is apparent <hi>first</hi> by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the <hi>Annales of Burton</hi> cited by <hi>Caius lib. 1. de antiq. Acad. Cantabrig.</hi> which affirme, that <hi>diuers Doctors of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge were baptized anno 141.</hi> But what should they need to send for <hi>Romains,</hi> when they had Christian Doctors among themselues? <hi>Secondly,</hi> the same is proued by the historie of <hi>Landaffe</hi> alleaged likewise by <hi>Caius,</hi> which testifieth, that <hi>Eluanus</hi> and <hi>Meduinus,</hi> that were sent to baptize <hi>Lucius</hi> were <hi>Britains. Thirdly,</hi> the sound of the names of those which were sent to <hi>Lucius,</hi> doth rather declare them to be <hi>Britains</hi> then Romaines. For whether we call them <hi>Eluanus</hi> and <hi>Meduinus,</hi> or <hi>Phaganus</hi> and <hi>Deruianus,</hi> or <hi>Faganus</hi> and <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanus;</hi> they will hardly be drawne to sound like Latine. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally <hi>Capgraue in Iosepho, Malmesburiensis in hist. Glaston.</hi> and <hi>Caius</hi> in his booke of the antiquitie of <hi>Cambridge</hi> do declare, that Christianitie once planted by <hi>Ioseph</hi> was alwaies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the land by those, which succeeded him. What then néeded the <hi>Britains</hi> to runne to <hi>Rome</hi> to fetch a commission to baptize the king, vnlesse it were to winne a litle glorie by the reputation, which the <hi>Romains</hi> then had in the world?</p>
               <p>Againe, albeit we should grant, that they were <hi>Romains</hi> that baptized king <hi>Lucius;</hi> yet what glorie can hereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound either to <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> or to the <hi>Romains?</hi> For <hi>Eleuthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> neither preached to the <hi>Britains,</hi> nor once mooued a foote from <hi>Rome.</hi> Neither could those <hi>Romaines</hi> that are said to be sent into <hi>Brittaine,</hi> speake the language of <hi>Britains,</hi> or teach them Christianitie. Nor is it so great a matter to baptize king <hi>Lucius,</hi> who, if euer there were any such, was like to the <hi>Caciques</hi> of the Indians, or the petty kings of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude this point, this fable seemeth to be deuised by some fauourers of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that indeuour to draw all nations to like that sea, as the fountaine of many
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21479:16"/>
fauors: and yet it is neither probably related, nor maketh any thing to the purpose, for which it was first forged, and afterwards by diuers related and enlarged.</p>
               <p>Let vs then sée what <hi>Rob. Parsons</hi> is able to make of this matter. First he saith, <hi>that these two conuersions vnder two famous Popes of Rome, (viz. Eleutherius</hi> and <hi>Gregorie) are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Part. 1. cap. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>and registred by the whole Christian world.</hi> But what is this to the purpose, if it were true, séeing neither of them did much cooperate in the conuersion of the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Saxons?</hi> And being false, who doth not sée, that the noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious impudencie of this <hi>Iebusite</hi> deserueth to be censured of all the Christian world? <hi>Caius</hi> for his principall proofe of the baptisme of king <hi>Lucius</hi> alleageth letters patent of king <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur. Beda</hi> saith onely, that <hi>Lucius</hi> was christened <hi>per manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Eleutherij,</hi> that is, <hi>by the commandement of Eleutherius.</hi> The rest that go further are writers of legends, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible fellowes speaking all vntruth to win the Popes fauour. Of <hi>Gregorie</hi> and <hi>Austin</hi> the Monke we shall speake, when their turne cometh. Furthermore, albeit <hi>Gregorie</hi> and <hi>Eleutherius</hi> were Bishops, and famous men in the Church for their painfull labours, and constancie in teaching the truth: what is that to the Popes of our time, that are rather Wolues, then shepheards, loyterers than labourers: infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous persecutors of Christians, then conuerters of Pagans to the <hi>Christian</hi> faith, maintainers of errors then teachers of truth? <hi>Parsons</hi> calleth them successors to <hi>Eleutherius</hi> and <hi>Gregorie:</hi> but neuer shall he shew, that these two called themselues <hi>Vniuersal bishops,</hi> or <hi>Heads of the church,</hi> or took vpon them to depose kings, or to giue away kingdomes, or to ride vpon mens shoulders, or to giue their féete to be kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Is he not then ashamed to compare such monsters to such holy men, and to ascribe the prayse of good Bishops to those, that are no Bishops, nor good men?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Further he sheweth, how matters passed in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, which he supposeth, and how <hi>Lucius hearing of the horrible persecutions of Christians in Rome,</hi> and how <hi>two worthy Senators called Pertinax and Tretellius, had bene late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21479:16"/>
conuerted from paganisme to Christ,</hi> and that <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius then liuing, began to be a friend to Christians, as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Legate in England told him, &amp;c. sent men to Rome to demand preachers of Eleutherius the Pope, who directed to him two Romaines named Fugatius and Damianus.</hi> And the cause hereof he assigneth to be, <hi>for that he vnderstood the chiefe fountaine of religion to be at Rome,</hi> and <hi>was not contented with instructions by Christians at home.</hi> But in this and the rest of his narration of <hi>Lucius</hi> he telleth many grosse lies learned by him of his father <hi>Lucifer,</hi> the father of pride, &amp; lies. For <hi>first,</hi> it is not like, that this was the occasion of <hi>Lucius</hi> his ambassade to <hi>Rome,</hi> considering that in the latter end of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> and beginning of <hi>Commodus</hi> his Empire, we do not reade of any such horrible persecutions against <hi>Christians,</hi> as he reporteth. <hi>Secondly,</hi> this sending to <hi>Rome,</hi> which <hi>Parsons</hi> imagineth to haue fallen out in the raigne of <hi>Marcus Aurelius, Baronius</hi> referreth to the second yeare of <hi>Commodus. Thirdly,</hi> the conuersion of two Senators <hi>Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax</hi> and <hi>Trebellius,</hi> by <hi>Parsons</hi> called <hi>Tretellius,</hi> is not repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any authenticall Writer. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> if <hi>Lucius</hi> were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie to the <hi>Romaines,</hi> as <hi>Parsons</hi> sayth, it is not likely, that an Ambassador did reside with him, or that he had any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the <hi>Romaines. Fiftly,</hi> he sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Preachers, but baptisme, as <hi>Galfridus, Beda</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masus</hi> testifie. <hi>Sixtly,</hi> neuer can it be shewed, that <hi>Lucius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeued <hi>Rome</hi> to be the fountaine of religion. For it séemeth rather to be worldly respect, then respect of religion, that moued him to send to <hi>Rome. Finally,</hi> I haue before shewed, that those which were sent to <hi>Lucius</hi> were <hi>Britains,</hi> and not <hi>Romans:</hi> neither doth any authenticall Writer affirme the contrarie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For proofe of his grosse leasings he saith, <hi>that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion vnder king Lucius is testified in auncient bookes of the liues of Romaine bishops, attributed by some to Damasus, by ecclesiasticall tables and martyrologies, by Bede, by Ado Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Treuers, by Marianus Scotus, and all Authors since.</hi> But all this testification amounteth to nothing, but onely
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21479:17"/>
to make proofe of <hi>Parsons</hi> his notorious ignorance and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie. For first the aduersaries themselues giue no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite to those notes, that passe vnder the name of <hi>Damasus. Secondly,</hi> nothing is more ridiculous, then to alledge lying legends, and moth-eaten martyrologies for authenticall proofes. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> neither doth <hi>Bede</hi> nor <hi>Damasus,</hi> nor <hi>Ado</hi> speake one word of the conuersion of <hi>Britaine,</hi> nor say, that <hi>Lucius</hi> was christened by any <hi>Romaine. Fourthly, Ado</hi> was not bishop of <hi>Treuers,</hi> as <hi>Parsons</hi> ignorantly affirmeth, but of <hi>Vienna. Fiftly, Marianus Scotus</hi> doth differ in time from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and yet saith little for <hi>Parsons</hi> his purpose. <hi>Finally,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all, nor many writers after him do report this storie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To answer our obiections concerning the great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences concerning the time, wherein this conuersion is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be made, and the obseruation of Easter after a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion diuers from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he saith first, <hi>That there is no small varietie found among principall Writers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout principall points and mysteries of our faith, as about the coming of the Magi, the martyrdome of the Infants, the time of Christ his baptisme, yea also of his passion, what yeare and day each of these things happened.</hi> But first he sheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be a leud and blasphemous companion, that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the historie of <hi>Christs</hi> passion, and of other high points of our religion, to the fable of the conuersion of <hi>Britaine</hi> by <hi>Eleutherius.</hi> Wo were we, if we had no better assurance of <hi>Christs</hi> passion, and other matters of Christian religion, then <hi>Parsons</hi> hath of his supposed conuersion of <hi>Britaine</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Lucius.</hi> Furthermore, it is one thing to varie about the times of things authentically testified in holy Scripture, to haue passed, though the certaine day and time be not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and to varie about the times of things, of which there is no authenticall assurance. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> there is no materiall controuersie about the time of <hi>Christs</hi> passion, but it may well be decided out of holy Scriptures. The like we may say of the Infants put to death by <hi>Herod,</hi> and of the coming of the <hi>Magi.</hi> But about the time of the supposed conuersion of <hi>Britaine</hi> by <hi>Eleutherius</hi> his agents, there are manifest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21479:17"/>
insomuch, as not onely the time, but the report it selfe is made very doubtfull.</p>
               <p>He answereth further, and <note n="a" place="margin">Part. 1. p. 80</note> saith, that <hi>if it were granted, that the Brittaines obserued Easter after the fashion of the East church, and that Simon Zelotes preached the Gospell in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland; yet it proueth not, that the faith of Britanny came not from Rome.</hi> As if it were likely, that schollers in such a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie would dissent from their first maisters, or else that <hi>Simon Zelotes</hi> were either sent from <hi>Rome,</hi> or did not ayde the <hi>Britains</hi> in their first conuersion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally,</hi> he spendeth many idle words in cauilling with the <hi>Magdeburgians,</hi> and <hi>M. Foxe</hi> of reuerent memorie. But for asmuch as he neither proueth, nor refelleth any thing materiall, we should wrong ourselues and the reader, if we should follow the gosling wandring vp and downe, that hath lost himselfe in the Labyrinth of his owne fancies and fooleries.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of <hi>Austin</hi> the Monke his coming into <hi>England,</hi> and of his preaching and proceeding here.</head>
               <p>FOr the sending and preaching of <hi>Austin</hi> the Monke to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> our aduersaries haue some better colour of reason, then for the sending of any <hi>Romaines</hi> by <hi>Eleutherius</hi> to the <hi>Britains.</hi> For neither is it denyed, that <hi>Gregorie</hi> did send, or that <hi>Austin</hi> came to <hi>Ethelbert</hi> king of <hi>Kent.</hi> But what is all this to the purpose? For neither can the modern <hi>Romaines</hi> vant of the acts and prowesse of <hi>Gregorie</hi> or <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi> nor doth any aduantage redound to the moderne syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of <hi>Rome</hi> by their merits, as we shall declare anone. Furthermore neither is <hi>Gregorie</hi> to be tearmed the Apostle of the inhabitants of this Iland, nor are the Papists to make any great crackes for any thing done either by <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> the first, or by his Legate <hi>Austin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Gregorie</hi> the first was our Apostle, as in <hi>Bede</hi> to flatter the <hi>Romanists</hi> he is called, it cannot be proued. For
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21479:18"/>
first he cannot say, as the Apostle did, <hi>Galat. 1. Not of man, nor by man.</hi> For he was not called immediatly by <hi>Christ,</hi> as were the Apostles, but was ordained by bishops, and chosen by the Cleargie and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the agents of <hi>Rome</hi> themselues confesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> it was not sayd to him, as to Christs <hi>Apostles Matth. 28. Go teach all nations.</hi> Nor did he presume to take vpon him that charge. Nay, expresly he condemned the title of <hi>Oecumenicall or Vniuersall bishop.</hi> But he was onely cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ordained to gouerne the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie is he, if he did approue himselfe faithfull in his calling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he had no grace of working miracles, or prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, as <hi>Christs</hi> Apostles had, nor could he speake with tongs, as the Apostles did. Nay, it is apparent, that he was very vnskilfull both in the Gréeke and Hebrew tongues, which notwithstanding <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> for the vnderstanding of Scriptures accompteth necessarie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> he neither preached himselfe, nor sent <hi>Austin</hi> to preach to the <hi>Britains,</hi> or to the <hi>French,</hi> or other nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side <hi>Saxons</hi> onely; of all which notwithstanding the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this countrie are descended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally,</hi> he preached not himselfe to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> nor séemed to be sent vnto them, but abiding quietly at <hi>Rome,</hi> sent <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> and other <hi>Italian</hi> Monkes to preach vnto them. How then is he tearmed the Apostle of the English, to whom he was neither sent, nor came, nor preached?</p>
               <p>That neither he, nor <hi>Austin</hi> deserue great praise for the conuersion of the <hi>Saxons</hi> or <hi>English,</hi> it is proued <hi>first,</hi> for that <hi>Gregorie</hi> himselfe did nothing, but send and command o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who notwithstanding were not the first conuerters of the <hi>Saxons.</hi> For it were absurd to thinke, that the <hi>Saxons</hi> hauing so many Christian <hi>Britains</hi> liuing both among them, and neare vnto them, had no notice of <hi>Christian</hi> reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion vntill the coming of <hi>Austin.</hi> That the <hi>Britains</hi> liued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Saxons</hi> the practise of conquerors doth shew, who do not kill such as submit themselues, but rule them and command them. So did the <hi>Romaines</hi> in time past conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21479:18"/>
                  <hi>Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Gallia,</hi> and other countries. So did the <hi>Normans</hi> entring into <hi>England.</hi> And so did the <hi>Saxons</hi> also deale with the <hi>Britains. Malmesburie lib. 1. de gest. Angl. ca. 2.</hi> speaking of the <hi>Saxon</hi> king <hi>Cerdic,</hi> testifieth, <hi>that the men of the countrie being once ouercome did willingly yeeld to obey him. In eius iura volentes concessêre,</hi> saith he, Likewise <hi>lib. 1. cap. 3.</hi> speaking of <hi>Hengists</hi> Captaines: <hi>Cum Prouincialibus</hi> (saith he) <hi>congressi, profligatis<expan>

               <p>Further we reade, that <hi>Berta Ethelberts</hi> wife was a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian woman, and had with her a Christian Bishop named <hi>Luidardus,</hi> by whom the king and his people could not chuse but receiue some notice and tincture of Christian Religion. This is plainely related by <hi>Beda hist. Angl. lib. 1. cap. 26. Antea ad eum (saith Beda</hi> speaking of <hi>Ethelbert) fama Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianae religionis peruenerat, vipote qui &amp; vxorem habebat Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam de gente Francorum nomine Bertam, quam ea conditione à pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentibus acceperat, vt ritum fidei ac religionis suae, cum Episcopo, quem ei fidei adiutorem dederant, nomine Luidardo inuiolatam ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uare, licentiam haberet. Capgraue</hi> in the legend of <hi>Lethardus</hi> containing diuers traditions of the Romish Church spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this matter, calleth him <hi>Austins</hi> precursor, and saith, <hi>that he prepared him a way, and an entrance into the country. Praecursor</hi> (saith he) <hi>&amp; ianitor venturi Augustini.</hi> And againe: <hi>Parauit ei viam, ingressum &amp; locum.</hi> Wherefore, as the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> liuing among the <hi>Saxons</hi> shewed them a light of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> religion, so <hi>Luidardus</hi> and <hi>Berta</hi> were the first, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the heart of <hi>Ethelbert</hi> king of <hi>Kent,</hi> to receiue <hi>Christian</hi> religion, and not <hi>Augustine,</hi> whose language he litle vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, and whose person he accepted, no question, for his Quéenes sake, and at the perswasion of <hi>Luidardus.</hi>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> although some <hi>Saxons</hi> were conuerted by <hi>Austins</hi> meanes, yet most of them were conuerted by others. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:21479:19"/>
baptized the sonne of <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> that was a pagan. The king of <hi>Northumbers</hi> marying <hi>Edelburg</hi> the daughter of <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> by her perswasion was christened by <hi>Paulinus. Erpwald</hi> the king of the Castangles receiued the faith by the perswasion of king <hi>Edwine. Osric</hi> and <hi>Eanfrid</hi> kings of the <hi>Deirans</hi> and <hi>Bernicians</hi> were baptized in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Many Northerne <hi>Saxons</hi> were also conuerted to religion by the meanes of king <hi>Oswald</hi> and <hi>Finan</hi> a <hi>Scot. Birinus</hi> ordained by <hi>Asterius</hi> bishop of <hi>Genua</hi> conuerted the <hi>West-Saxons. Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> was baptized in <hi>France,</hi> and raigning in <hi>Essex</hi> caused many to embrace Christian religion. <hi>Peda</hi> king of <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles</hi> was baptized also by <hi>Finan</hi> a <hi>Scot. Vlfride</hi> consecrated bishop by <hi>Ailbert</hi> bishop of <hi>Paris</hi> conuerted to <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Southsaxons.</hi> And all this is testified by <hi>Henry of Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> With him also agrée for the most part <hi>Beda, William of Malmesburie</hi> and diuers other Chroniclers. It is therefore euident, that <hi>Austin</hi> performed either litle or nothing, those conuersions of <hi>Saxon</hi> nations being wrought by others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> it is most apparent, that neither the <hi>French</hi> nor <hi>Britains,</hi> of which the inhabitants of this land consist as much as of <hi>Saxons,</hi> were conuerted by <hi>Austin.</hi> Not the <hi>French,</hi> for that <hi>Austin</hi> was not sent vnto them, and for that they had receiued Christianitie long before. Not the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> for that <hi>Austin</hi> was sent to <hi>Saxons,</hi> and not to <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi> Secondly, the <hi>Britains</hi> were <hi>Christians</hi> long before <hi>Austins</hi> coming into <hi>England,</hi> neither did <hi>Christianitie</hi> after their first conuersion euer faile amongst them, as is euident by the testimonie of <hi>Bede, Capgraue</hi> and others. Not long before the arriuall of <hi>Augustine</hi> many <hi>Britains</hi> about the time of Caster being newly baptized, went out with the rest, vnder the conduct of <hi>Germanus,</hi> to fight against the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> and obtained a great victorie, as we may reade in <hi>Bede lib.</hi> 1. <hi>hist. Angl. cap 20.</hi> Likewise in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell assembled by <hi>Austin,</hi> and mentioned by <hi>Beda lib.</hi> 2. <hi>hist. Angl. cap.</hi> 2. there appeared diuers Bishops of the <hi>British</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thirdly, the <hi>Britains,</hi> as <hi>Beda</hi> writeth, refused to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21479:19"/>
themselues to <hi>Austins</hi> iurisdiction, and to accept his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Finally, it appeareth, that <hi>Austin</hi> did rather worke the subuersion, then the conuersion of the <hi>Britains,</hi> anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Saxons</hi> to destroy them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly, Austin</hi> shewed extreame cowardire in coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>England,</hi> and hardly was perswaded to set forward, as we may reade in <hi>Bede, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>hist. Angl. cap. 23.</hi> Coming al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so into <hi>Kent</hi> he was not able to speake one word of <hi>English,</hi> nor to preach, vnlesse it were by his interpreter. Lastly, he was ordained Archbishop of <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Eltherius</hi> bishop of <hi>Arles,</hi> at the commandement of <hi>Gregorie.</hi> But <hi>first</hi> such feare or cowardice beséemeth no Apostolike man. Secondly, faith cometh by hearing, and vnderstanding, and not by commission or outward signes. It séemeth therefore, that <hi>Austins</hi> Interpreters did rather conuert the <hi>Saxons,</hi> then <hi>Austin</hi> himselfe. Finally, what power had either the bishop of <hi>Arles,</hi> or <hi>Gregorie</hi> to appoint Archbishops in <hi>England?</hi> And how cometh it to passe, that now more Archbishops are here then one, if his order had any force? That these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions are true, <hi>Beda</hi> will witnesse. <hi>Percussi timore inerti</hi> (saith he) <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>hist.

               </p>
               <p>Whatsoeuer then was done by <hi>Austin,</hi> the same concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned none, but a few <hi>Saxons</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> and such as were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by him. Neither did he deserue more, then is due to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry minister of Gods word and Sacraments, that by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and baptizing gaineth soules vnto <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> The <hi>Normans,</hi> and Northern, and West. <hi>Saxons</hi> are nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to him.

If therefore <hi>Rob. Parsons</hi> meane to gaine any thing by the labours of <hi>Gregorie</hi> or <hi>Austin,</hi> he must proue first, that these two did preach to the auncient <hi>Saxons, Britains, French</hi> and other inhabitants of <hi>England. Next,</hi> that the present Pope is like vnto <hi>Gregorie:</hi> the malignant race of Masse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priests and Iebusites to <hi>Austin. Thirdly,</hi> that all Churches erected by Preachers sent from other nations, are to subiect themselues to the Churches and Bishops that sent them. And finally, if he will haue vs to kéepe vnitie with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he must proue, that the same is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther departed from <hi>Christ,</hi> nor from the doctrine of <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Gregorie.</hi> If not, he doth but cast feathers against the wind, and both tire himselfe with writing, and vexe his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with examining his fooleries, and idle imaginations.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IIII.</hi> That the moderne doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which the Church of <hi>England</hi> reiecteth, was either oppugned by <hi>Peter, Eleutherius, Gregorie</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi> or at the least vnknowne vnto them.</head>
               <p>BUt what would it aduantage <hi>Rob. Parsons,</hi> if he could proue, that either the auncient <hi>Britains</hi> were conuerted to the faith by <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> or the ancient <hi>Saxons</hi> by <hi>Gregorie</hi> and <hi>Austin,</hi> séeing the moderne doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is now reiected, was either oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by them, or at the least neuer knowne vnto them?</p>
               <p>Now the Romanists prohibite holy Scriptures to be read publikely in vulgar tongues, as dark and vnprofitable, and condemne those that reade them translated into vulgar tongues without licence. But the Apostle <hi>S. Peter, 1. Epist. 2.</hi> exhorteth all Christians though newly regenerate, <hi>to desire the sincere milke of the word.</hi> And <hi>2. Epist. 1.</hi> sheweth, <hi>That they do well, that take heede to the words of the Prophets, as to a light shining in a darke place.</hi> Neither néed we doubt, but that all <hi>Peters</hi> true successors maintaine the same doctrine. <hi>Gregorie in Ezechiel. homil. 10.</hi> doth commend Scriptures,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21479:20"/>
                  <hi>as meate and drinke</hi> and <hi>lib. 2. Moral. as a glasse.</hi> It is not likely therefore, that he would prohibite Christians to eate and drinke, and to behold themselues in a glasse, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may learne to informe themselues in matters of faith, and to reforme their manners.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now they teach, that the holy Scriptures to vs are not authenticall, nor canonicall, <hi>vnlesse the Pope deliuer them, and consigne them.</hi> And this is the meaning of <hi>Bellarmine li. de notis Eccles. cap. 2.</hi> where he saith, <hi>that the Scriptures do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon the Church;</hi> and of <hi>Stapleton</hi> in his booke written in defence of the authoritie of the Church. But <hi>S. Peter 2. Epist. 1.</hi> saith, <hi>that the word of the Prophets is most sure vnto vs. We haue</hi> (saith he) <hi>a most sure word of the Prophets.</hi> And <hi>Gregorie</hi> in his preface vnto his Commentaries vpon <hi>Iob,</hi> saith, <hi>that in vaine we search for the writers of Scriptures, when we faithfully beleeue, that the holy Ghost was the author of the booke. Quis haec scripserit</hi> (saith he) <hi>valdè superuacuè quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur, cùm tamen author libri Spiritus Sanctus fideliter credatur.</hi> Which is as much, as if he should say: that the authoritie of Scriptures, in regard of vs, proceedeth not from the writer, much lesse from the teacher or propounder, but from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now the Romanists teach, that the books of the <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees</hi> and such like are canonicall Scriptures, and equall to other books of the old Testament. But <hi>S. Peter 2. Ep. 1.</hi> where by the word of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophets he vnderstandeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scriptures, excludeth from the ranke of Scriptures of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old Testament, al books not written by Prophets, of which sort are the books of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> being written long after the times of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachy</hi> the last of the Prophets. <hi>Gregor. lib. 19. moral. c. 17.</hi> doth say plainly, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> books of the <hi>Machabees</hi> are not canonical.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now they affirme, <hi>that the Pope is the foundation</hi> &amp; head of the Church. But the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth vs, that <hi>Christ</hi> is the head of the Church, and that the same is built vpon the Apostles and Prophets, <hi>Christ</hi> being the chiete corner stone: and we may not thinke, that the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> taught any other doctrine. <hi>Greg. lib. 4. Epist. 82.</hi> naming <hi>Peter</hi> and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21479:21"/>
other Apostles saith, <hi>they were not heads, but members of the Church. Sub vno capite</hi> (saith he) <hi>omnes membra sunt Ecclesiae.</hi> Neither is it credible, that <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> or <hi>Austin</hi> taught any other doctrine.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When <hi>Cornelius,</hi> as we reade <hi>Act. 10.</hi> did fall at <hi>Peters</hi> feet, and adored him, <hi>Peter</hi> would not suffer it. And <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Eleutherius</hi> were far from admitting men to kisse their slippers. But now the <hi>Romanists</hi> giue the bastonata to those that wil not worship the Pope, and ordinarily the Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth adoration, and suffereth great Princes to kisse his feete. Of late some are said to haue disputed, that <hi>Latria</hi> is due to the Pope.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now also the bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> haue giuen ouer prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and feeding the flocke. But the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorteth all Bishops, and Elders <hi>to feed the flocke, that dependeth on them.</hi> And <hi>Greg. in pastor. p. 2.</hi> saith, <hi>That all bishops take on them the office of a Preacher or Cryer. Praeconis officium suscipit</hi> (saith he) <hi>quisquis ad sacerdotium accedit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Now the Popes carry themselues, as Lords ouer their flocke, and entitle themselues <hi>Oecumenicall, or Vniuersall bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</hi> But <hi>Peter 1. Epi. 5.</hi> forbiddeth Elders to beare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, <hi>as Lords ouer Gods heritage</hi> And <hi>Greg. lib. 4. Epist. 78. &amp; 80.</hi> condemneth this title of Uniuersall and Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call bishop, as proud and Antichristian.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Now they that take vpon them to curse kings, and to raise rebellion against them, and to thrust them out of their royall seates, as appeareth by the wicked Buls of <hi>Paule the 3.</hi> against <hi>Henry the 8. of England,</hi> of <hi>Pius the 5. &amp; Sixtus the 5.</hi> against <hi>Q Elizabeth,</hi> and the wicked Decretais of <hi>Greg. the 7.</hi> against <hi>Henry the 4.</hi> and of <hi>Gregorie the 9.</hi> and <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent the 4.</hi> against <hi>Friderick the 2.</hi> But the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer cursed <hi>Nero,</hi> albeit he was a most cursed fellow, nor went about to depose him. Nay contrariwise, he exhorteth all <hi>Christians</hi> to submit themselues to kings and gouernors. Likewise <hi>Eleutherius &amp; Gregorie</hi> were obedient to temporall Princes. <hi>Greg. li. 4. ep. 78.</hi> calleth the Emperor his most <hi>pious Lord,</hi> and submitteth himself euen in an Ecclesiastical cause
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21479:21"/>
to his order. <hi>Pijssimi Domini scripta suscepi,</hi> (saith he) <hi>vt cum fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre &amp; consacerdote meo debeam esse pacificus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Now they teach, that the reprobate &amp; wicked men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the <hi>Romish</hi> faith are true members of the Catholike Church, as appeareth by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> discourse <hi>de Ecclesia mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litante.</hi> They include the same also within the precincts of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church. But <hi>S. Peter 1. Epist. 1.</hi> sheweth, that it consisteth of <hi>the elect, according to Gods foreknowledge, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed</hi> in <hi>Pontus, Galatia,</hi> and other countries. <hi>Gregorie in Cantic. 4.</hi> saith, <hi>that the holy Church is called hortus conclusus,</hi> that is, <hi>a garden walled round about,</hi> because it is of euery side so enuironed with a wall of charitie, that no reprobate person may come within the number of the elect. Likewise in the 28. book of his <hi>Morals,</hi> he concludeth all the elect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the measure of the Church. Neither doth it appeare, that either <hi>Eleutherius</hi> or <hi>Austin</hi> did teach otherwise.</p>
               <p n="10">10. They now teach vs to doubt of our election and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But <hi>S. Peter</hi> exhorteth vs, <hi>2. Epist. 1. to make our calling and election sure.</hi> Which were a most vaine exhortation and request, if no man could assure himself of his saluation. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> or <hi>Gregory,</hi> or <hi>Austin</hi> in this dissent from him.</p>
               <p n="11">11. They now teach priests to offer for quicke and dead, and Christians to receiue the Sacrament vnder one kind. But <hi>Peter</hi> kept <hi>Christs</hi> institution inuiolably, which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the Sacrament is to be receiued vnder both the kinds of bread and wine, and not to be offered for quick and dead. <hi>Gregory</hi> also <hi>homil. 22. in Euang.</hi> sheweth, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple receiued both kinds. <hi>Quid sit sanguis Agni</hi> (saith he, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the people) <hi>iam non audiendo sed bibendo didicistis?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. They make their followers beleeue that <hi>Christs</hi> natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bodie is really vnder the formes of bread and wine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it cannot be felt, nor séene there. But <hi>Peter</hi> knew that <hi>Christ</hi> had no other body, but such a one, as might be felt and séene. And <hi>Gregorie lib. 14. moral. c. 31. &amp; 32.</hi> imputeth this as an heresie to <hi>Eutychius,</hi> that <hi>mens bodies after the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection should be impalpable, and inuisible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:21479:22"/>
13. They giue out, that we may redéeme our sins with sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and gold, buying and procuring Indulgences, and with our owne satisfactions both in this life and in Purgatorie. But <hi>S. Peter 1. Epist. 1.</hi> saith expresly, <hi>We are not redeemed with siluer and gold,</hi> but <hi>by the precious bloud of Christ. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> likewise <hi>in Psal. 5. Peenit.</hi> saith, that our Redeemer is called <hi>excelsus,</hi> or high, because none, beside God, could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déeme vs out of the hands of our enemies. And <hi>lib. Moral. 9-cap. 30. Non valent virtute propria</hi> (saith he) <hi>ab humano genere supplicia sequuturae mortis expleri:</hi> that is, <hi>No man by his owne power can satisfie for the paines in the world to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. Now in celebration of the holy Eucharist they haue added a number of prayers for quicke and dead, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and confessions to Saints &amp; Angels. But the Apostles, as <hi>Gregorie</hi> testifieth <hi>lib. 7. Epist. 63.</hi> did consecrate, saying <hi>onely the Lords prayer.</hi> And in his time and long after the formes now vsed were not receiued.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Neither <hi>Saint Peter,</hi> nor <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> nor <hi>Gregorie,</hi> nor <hi>Austin</hi> did make the traditions of the Church equall to the word of God written. Nay <hi>Gregorie</hi> vpon the <hi>Canticles, cap. 2.</hi> saith, that <hi>in Christ alone we find wholesome meate.</hi> But if in <hi>Christ</hi> alone; then not in the Popes traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="16">16. None of them did euer speake vnreuerently of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, or call them <hi>a killing letter,</hi> or a <hi>matter of strife,</hi> or a <hi>nose of waxe,</hi> or <hi>a shipmans hose,</hi> or such like, as do our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries.</p>
               <p n="17">17. None of them did make the Latine translation of the Bible more authenticall, then the originall Tert. Nay <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> albeit he had the gift of tongues, yet did he not write in <hi>Latine,</hi> but in <hi>Greeke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. Neither did <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> or <hi>Gregorie</hi> call himselfe <hi>the spouse, or rocke of the Church, or Christs Vicar or substitute.</hi> Nor did either <hi>S. Peter</hi> or <hi>Austin</hi> allow such proud titles.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Neither did <hi>Gregorie</hi> the first, nor any before him call himselfe <hi>King of Kings,</hi> or <hi>Supreme Monarch of the Church.</hi> Nay <hi>Gregorie</hi> rather delighted in the name and title of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21479:22"/>
seruant of seruants, and the rest of the bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> in ancient time were humble men, and detested these proud titles.</p>
               <p n="20">20. In the times of <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Austin,</hi> neither the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of. Sacraments, nor those formes &amp; rites, which now the Synagogue of <hi>Rome</hi> vseth, were established. If <hi>Parsons</hi> will maintaine the contrary, let him make proofe, that the words vsed in the popish sacraments of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> and <hi>Extreme Vnction,</hi> were knowne &amp; practised in those times. Let him also shew, that Priests were then appointed <hi>to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for quick &amp; dead.</hi> Now if he cannot find these formes in the time of <hi>Gregory;</hi> he will be much more puzzeled to find them in the daies of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> or <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. The Master of the Sentences <hi>lib. 4. dist. 11.</hi> confesseth frankly, <hi>that he knoweth not, whether the conuersion in the Eucharist be substantial, or not. Qualis sit illa conuersio</hi> sayth he, <hi>an formalis, vel substantialis, vel alterius generis, definire non suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio.</hi> Much more difficultie then shall <hi>Parsons</hi> find, to prooue his Transubstantiation out of the doctrine of <hi>Austin, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, Eleutherius,</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. <hi>S. Peter</hi> knew no other Priesthood, but that which was common to all Christians, neither did he acknowledge any sacrifices of <hi>Christians</hi> but spirituall. Neither <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> nor <hi>Gregory,</hi> nor <hi>Austin,</hi> euer heard, that a Masse-priest did either offer vp <hi>Christs</hi> body and bloud really, or, as we reade in the Canon of the Masse, take vpon him to be a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator for <hi>Christes</hi> body and bloud.</p>
               <p n="23">23. It is impious to thinke, that either <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Gregory,</hi> or any in those times beléeued, that <hi>hogges</hi> and <hi>dogges</hi> ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting consecrated hoasts, did with their mouthes eate and swallow downe into their belly the body of <hi>Christ,</hi> as the Schoolemen, and most Papists now teach.</p>

Peter</hi> neuer put the Sacrament in pixes, nor adored it, <hi>as his Lord and God.</hi> Neither do we find, that either <hi>Elcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius,</hi> or <hi>Gregory,</hi> practised any such matter. For it was first ordred by <hi>Honorius</hi> the third, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacrament should be kept in pixes, and worshipped after the moderne fashion.</p>

25. In the Romish ordinall we finde no prayers for the dead, nor any priuat masses, nor masses for warre, peace, plagues, or for hogges and horses and such like vses. If then the same be thought to haue procéeded for the most part from <hi>Gregory,</hi> and from others that succéeded him, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that these abuses came in after his time.</p>
               <p n="26">26. The forme of hosts and singing cakes not much bigger then a counter, and the image of the crucifixe vpon them, and the idolatrous worship of <hi>Latria</hi> giuen to them was vtterly vnknowne in <hi>Gregories</hi> time, and long after.</p>
               <p n="27">27. The old ordinall of <hi>Rome</hi> doth shew, that the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of penitents was not made to Saints or Angels in <hi>Gregories</hi> time, or before him.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Neither in <hi>Gregories</hi> time, nor before him, do we find, that any godly Bishop commanded, that the publike Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of the Church should be sayd in Latin, or Gréeke, or other language not vnderstood by the common people, or that he suffred the Sacraments to be administred in tongues not knowne of the vulgar sort. Nay the Apostle <hi>Paule 1. Cor. 14.</hi> sheweth plainely, that praiers in a tongue not vnderstood are fruitlesse, which doctrine, no question, antiquitie much respected.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Now the <hi>Romanists</hi> will haue all Churches to follow <hi>Rome,</hi> as their Mistresse in all rites and ceremonies. But <hi>Gregory,</hi> as <hi>Bede</hi> testifieth <hi>lib. 1. hist.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21479:23"/>
defaced in Churches: yet did neither he, nor any Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> before him allow the worship of them. <hi>Quòd ea ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari vetuisses, omnino laudauimus,</hi> saith he, <hi>lib. 9. epist. 9. ad Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> speaking of images of Saints. And again, <hi>Si quis imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes facere voluerit, minimè prohibe, adorare verò imagines omnibus modis deuita.</hi> that is, <hi>if any will make images, foibid them not; but by all meanes, auoid the worship of images.</hi> But <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Eleutherius</hi> neither worshipped images, nor suffered them to be made in Churches. None of them, certes, nor <hi>Austin</hi> himselfe did thinke or teach, that the crosse, or cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixe is to be worshipped with <hi>Latria. Austin</hi> comming to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> had a crosse of siluer, and the image of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour painted in a table, as <hi>Bede lib. 1. hist. Angl. ca. 26.</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, but he sayth not, that either the crosse or image was worshipped with <hi>Latria,</hi> or otherwise, either by him, or by others.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Both <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Austin</hi> vsed Letanies. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they pray to the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> nor to <hi>Peter,</hi> nor <hi>Paule,</hi> nor to other Saints. <hi>Austins</hi> Letany, as we may reade in <hi>Bede, hist. Angl. lib. 1. ca. 16.</hi> was nothing, but a praier dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to God.</p>
               <p n="34">34. <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Austin</hi> estéemed much the reliques of Saints: yet did neither of them digge their bodies out of the graues, and put them in shrines to be worshipped, as is the fashion of papists of our time.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Neither did <hi>Gregory</hi> take vpon him to canonize, or vncanonize Saints, or to appoint Masses to be said, or holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes to be kept in their honor. And if this will not be prooued of <hi>Gregory,</hi> much lesse will it be shewed, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eleucherius</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> euer taught or allowed any such canonization of Saints, or Romish worship giuen them.</p>
               <p n="36">36. <hi>Gregory</hi> allowed Purgatory (as it seemeth) <hi>for small faults,</hi> yet did he not beléeue, that men did satisfie in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory for the temporall paines of mortall sinnes, nor that the bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> by his indulgences could deliuer men out of Purgatory. As for <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thought, nor taught, that our sinnes are purged by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21479:24"/>
other meanes, then by the bloud of <hi>Christ,</hi> which, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle sayth, <hi>1. Iohn. 1. cleanseth vs from all sinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="37">37. That the soules of the godly are tormented by diuels in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or that the bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> by their plenary indulgences, and <hi>Buls of Iubiley</hi> could deliuer soules from thence, was farre from the thought of <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Gregory,</hi> and much more of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> and Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> These are deuises of late Dopes, and frapling Schoolemen, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the Decretals of <hi>Boniface the eight,</hi> and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the sixt extr. de poenit. &amp; remiss.</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Henriquez,</hi> and others in their treatises of Indulgences and Purgatory.</p>
               <p n="38">38. Neither did <hi>Gregory,</hi> nor <hi>Austin,</hi> nor any before them teach, that the grace of God was nothing but <hi>charity,</hi> or that charity is the forme of faith, as do the moderne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable powdermen papists, and their associates.</p>
               <p n="39">39. Farre also it was from their thought, that men are predestinate to saluation, or reprobated and destined to damnation for works foreseene in them. For the Apostle <hi>Rom. 9.</hi> doth prooue the contrary by the example of <hi>Esau and Iacob,</hi> and addeth this reason, <hi>that the purpose of God might remaine according to Election, not by works, but by him that calleth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="40">40. None of them euer taught, that men are iustified by mariage, or orders, or confirmation, or extreme vnction, or by eating fish or such externall obseruances, as our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries now teach.</p>
               <p n="41">41. Nay they beléeued not, that <hi>christian</hi> men were iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the works of the law, or that they could perfectly fulfill the whole law, &amp; loue God with all their hart, soule, &amp; affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For as the Apostle saith <hi>Rom. 4. the Law causeth wrath.</hi> Againe, if man could perfectly fulfill the law, then might he liue without all sinne, which is the heresie of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> as <hi>Augustine de haeres.</hi> and <hi>Hierome aduers. Pelag. lib. 1.</hi> testifie.</p>
               <p n="42">42. Neuer did any of these foure, or other ancient Father teach, that <hi>christian</hi> men were able, not only to fulfill the whole law, but also to do works of <hi>supererogation,</hi> and more
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21479:24"/>
then the law requireth: or else, that the state of perfection did consist in beggery or pouerty, forswearing of mariage, and obedience to monkish rules.</p>
               <p n="43">43. Finally, because it were infinite to prosecute all the singular differences betwirt <hi>Austin, Gregory, Eleutherius</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> of one part, and the moderne Popes and the <hi>Iebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites</hi> on the other, I will bring all into one briefe summe. I do therefore pray <hi>Robert Parsons,</hi> because he contendeth, that now no other doctrine is taught in <hi>Rome,</hi> beside that which in times past was deliuered by <hi>Gregory, Austin, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leutherius,</hi> and the holy Apostle <hi>S. Peter;</hi> that he will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of his <hi>Iebusiticall</hi> fauor plainely to demonstrate: <hi>First,</hi> that the particulars aboue mentioned were by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowne, beléeued and taught; And next, that the rest of the Romish doctrine established partly in the Popes Decretals, and partly in the conuenticles of <hi>Laterane,</hi> of <hi>Constance,</hi> of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> and partly professed and proposed by <hi>Pius the fourth,</hi> which the Church of <hi>England</hi> reiecteth and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth, differeth nothing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that forme of doctrine and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some words, which they deliuered to their hearers in their time. If he performe this, he shall shew himselfe a great master; if not, his cause falleth, his hope of mastership peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth, and his dreames of a Cardinals hat, are at their last period.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> A briefe answere to <hi>Parsons</hi> his fond and friuolous discourse, wherein desperatly he vndertaketh to prooue, that the faith now professed in <hi>Rome</hi> vnder <hi>Clement the 8.</hi> is the same, and no other, then was taught by <hi>Eleuthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> in time past.</head>
               <p>VNto our argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts <hi>Rob. Parsons</hi> in his treatise of <hi>three Conuersions</hi> maketh no answere. And yet he could not be ignorant, that these and many more arguments are
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21479:25"/>
brought against his cause. Nay it appeareth, that it will be as easy a matter for him to turne himselfe into a woodcock, as to maintaine his booke of <hi>Three Turnings.</hi> Only, least he should séeme silent, he setteth on a brasen face, and <hi>Pag. 8.</hi> desperatly promiseth to proue, that the faith of <hi>Rome</hi> is, and was all one vnder <hi>Eleutherius, Gregory,</hi> and <hi>Clement the 8.</hi> lately raigning. He should haue added <hi>S. Peter</hi> also, if he would haue mainteined his argument of <hi>three Conuersions.</hi> But he knew, that there is too maine a difference betwixt <hi>S. Peters</hi> catholike epistles, and <hi>Clements</hi> vncatholike De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals. In the processe also of his discourse concerning the faith of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> and <hi>Gregory,</hi> compared to the confession of <hi>Clement the 8.</hi> he runneth on confusedly and absurdly, turning and winding vp and downe, like a man that hath lost his way, and is caried without direction, he knoweth not whither. In his discourse there are thrée maine faults. <hi>First,</hi> he doth not iustifie all those points of popery, which are now holden by <hi>Clement the 8.</hi> at the least, if the Pops beléeue the moderne <hi>Romish</hi> faith, nor prooue them to haue béene beléeued and taught by <hi>Eleutherius</hi> and <hi>Gregory. Next,</hi> he neither proposeth his matters resolutely, nor in proouing them proceedeth orderly. <hi>Lastly,</hi> he barely toucheth some points in controuersie, but neither dare handle the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall matters taught by the <hi>Romanists,</hi> nor can prooue that which he promiseth. And this God willing we shall demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate out of the mans owne words, folowing as well as we can the file and order of his disordred discourse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 7.</hi> He threapeth kindnesse vpon vs, and would beare vs in hand, <hi>that we dare not deny, but that both Masse and Images were in vse in Gregories time in the Romane Church and faith, and so brought into England by Augustine.</hi> But first he speaketh strangely, where he sayth, <hi>Masse and Images were in vse in the Romane faith.</hi> For <hi>Masse</hi> is song or sayd at the Altar, and Images are painted, or made in bosse vpon walles, or other places. But faith is properly in the heart, though declared with the mouth, and consisteth neither in Imagery, nor Massing foolery, but in receiuing the sauing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21479:25"/>
word of God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> if by the vse of the Masse and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges he vnderstand the moderne doctrine and practise of the Romish Church concerning these two points, he wrongeth vs, and abuseth his reader, saying <hi>we dare not deny, that the Masse and Images were in vse in the Romane church in Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries time, and so brought into England by Augustine.</hi> For by the old Romish ordinall it appeareth, that <hi>Gregories</hi> Masse was most vnlike the moderne Masse of the <hi>Romanists.</hi> That forme ouerthroweth priuate Masses, halfe Communions, prayers for the dead, the carnall reall presence, transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, the reall propitiatory sacrifice for quick and dead, and the whole forme and frame of the moderne <hi>Romish</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non and Masse. <hi>Gregory</hi> also, as we haue declared, absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned the worship of Images, and neuer acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the Crosse or Crucifixe was to be worshipped with <hi>Latria.</hi> Finally, albeit <hi>Augustine</hi> named Masses, and had a crosse and an image; yet it appeareth not, that his Masse was like the moderne Masse, or that he worshipped the crosse or the image, or planted them in the Church. <hi>Bede</hi> mentioneth no such matter, where he mentioneth them. If by Masse he meane a dimission of the people, and by the vse of images vnderstandeth an historicall vse of them, he relée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his cause nothing. For neither do we contend about words, nor deny all historicall vse of images. To help the matter a little he sayth, that <hi>Austin and his fellowes entred into Canterbury in procession with a crosse, and image of our Sauiour in a banner.</hi> But <hi>Beda</hi> conuinceth him oflying, who sayth <note n="a" place="margin">Lib. 1. hist. Angl. cap. 26.</note> he brought <hi>Christes image in a table. Veniebant</hi> sayth he, <hi>crucem pro vexillo ferentes argenteam, &amp; imaginem Domini Saluatoris in tabula depictam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For proofe, that <hi>Eleutherius</hi> held the faith now professed by <hi>Clement the 8.</hi> he remitteth vs <hi>Pa. 8. &amp; 9.</hi> to the <hi>Magdebur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, Cent. 2. &amp; cap. 4. de doctr.</hi> But his proofe is weake, and witlesse. For first in that place there is no mention made either of <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> or <hi>Clement.</hi> Secondly albeit we should graunt, that <hi>Eleutherius</hi> consented with all those that liued in that age in their erroneous or incommodious spéeches
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21479:26"/>
(which notwithstanding we haue no reason to beléeue) yet can it not thereby be prooued, that he consented with <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the 8.</hi> or <hi>Clement</hi> with him. For albeit we reade in <hi>Ignatius</hi> this phrase <hi>Offerre,</hi> and <hi>Sacrificium immolare,</hi> and like phrases in <hi>Irenaeus, Cyprian, Tercullian,</hi> and <hi>Martialis,</hi> who mentioneth also <hi>Altars;</hi> yet it foloweth not, that the <hi>Romish</hi> sacrifice of <hi>Christs</hi> body and bloud for quick and dead, or the moderne Canon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Masse, or Transubstantiation, and the rest of the Romish Masses ceremonies were knowne to these ancient Fathers. For all those termes, which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vsed being taken and meant spiritually, and being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of spirituall sacrifices, make nothing either against vs, or for our aduersaries Masses, or massing formes. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> although the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> in these times complaine of some declining in Christian doctrine of some men, which <hi>Parsons</hi> grossely interpreteth and calleth <hi>the falling away of Christian doctrine:</hi> yet they taxe but few men, and say not, that any agreed in all or most points with the <hi>Papists. Fourthly</hi> what the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> do yéeld, let them yeeld for themselues: we do not in all points take ourselues bound to allow their sayings, nor finde any such inconuenience in these termes, as the Fathers vnderstood them, as the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburgians</hi> pretend. <hi>Finally, Rob. Parsons</hi> must speake of more then one point of consent, or else he will shew himselfe vnwise to parallele <hi>Clement the 8.</hi> with his triple Crowne to the humble martyr of Christ <hi>Eleutherius.</hi> This testimony therefore out of the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> maketh little for his purpose. But therein he doth properly bewray his owne folly. For he citeth <hi>Tertullian lib. de coen. Dom.</hi> where he neuer wrote any such booke; and did not vnderstand the <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgians,</hi> who vse these words, <hi>Tertullianus de coena loquens in lib. de culiu foeminar.</hi> Lastly the words, <hi>inclinatio Doctrinae,</hi> he translateth <hi>the falling away of Christian doctrine:</hi> as if euery thing, that did decline, did fall away; or else, as if doctrine might be sayd properly to fall away, and not rather men to decline from the sinceritie of doctrine.</p>
               <p>Afterward, <hi>Pag. 25. and 26.</hi> he telleth vs, how <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:21479:26"/>
                  <hi>epist. 45. glorieth, in that his Church of Carthage in Africa, and all other the Churches vnder her in Mauritania and Numidia, had receiued their first institution of christian faith from Rome, as from their mother,</hi> and <hi>that he calleth the Roman Church matricem ceterarum omnium.</hi> And <hi>that Tertullian saith, that the authority of his church came from Rome.</hi> And lastly, <hi>that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine in Psal. contr. parte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Donati, had no better way to defend his church of Hippo and others to be truly Catholike, then to say, that they were daughters &amp; childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the church of Rome.</hi> But first, this maketh nothing for his purpose, which should proue, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of the moderne church of <hi>Rome</hi> varieth not from the ancient church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Secondly most grossely doth he either mistake, or belye these Fathers, for neither doth <hi>Cyprian epist. 45.</hi> say, <hi>that his church of Carthage and all churches vnder her in Mauritania and Numidia, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued their first institution fió Rome.</hi> Nor doth he once men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Rome,</hi> but some ignorant fellow hath added <hi>Rome</hi> in the margent, where it is plaine he speaketh of the generall Catholike Church. Further he doth not say, that <hi>Mauritania &amp; Numidia</hi> were vnder <hi>Carthage:</hi> for they are prouinces en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire of themselues, and diuided from <hi>Carthage,</hi> as <hi>Caesar Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> might haue informed him. All which also is made cleare by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of <hi>Cyprian lib. 4. epist. 8. Vt Ecclesiae Catholicae matricem &amp; radicem agnoscerent, &amp; tenerent.</hi> saith he, <hi>Sed quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam latiùs fusa est nostra prouincia, habet etiam Numidiam &amp; Mauritaniam cohaerentes.

Donati</hi> neither saith, that <hi>Hippo</hi> and other Churches were the daughters of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <hi>Hippo.</hi> It appeareth therefore, that <hi>Rob. Parsons</hi> had ouerwatched himselfe when he wrote these fooleries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 101.</hi> he goeth about to refell our argument, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that there was not in <hi>Rome</hi> the same faith in the dayes of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> that is now, because then there was no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or knowledge either of the vniuersall authority of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21479:27"/>
bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of the name or vse of Masses, or of sacrifice propitiatory for quick or dead, or of Transubstantiation, or worship of Images. But first he marreth our argument by adding and detracting. To the bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> he adioyneth the Church, leaueth out our exception against the doctrine of the Masse, and worship of Images, and putteth downe only the <hi>name and vse of masses,</hi> and <hi>vse of images in churches.</hi> But to forbeare to censure him for his iugling, let vs sée, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception he maketh to our argument. If, saith he, this conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence should be admitted, then would it follow, <hi>that the name and doctrine of the blessed Trinity, the two distinct na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and one person in Christ, his two distinct wils, the virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our blessed Lady both before and after her childbirth, the proceeding of the Holy Ghost as well from the Sonne, as from the Father, should not be admitted.</hi> But the fellow sheweth himselfe not only impudent, but also most blasphemous, to compare such false, wicked, &amp; impious doctrines, as Papists now maintaine, to the principall and highest mysteries of our faith concerning the Trinity, and Christs two natures, and the proceeding of the holy Ghost. For who kneweth not, that these articles are plainly proued out of Scriptures, and declared in Councels, &amp; receiued by most ancient Fathers? but the doctrine of the sacrifice of the Masse for quick &amp; dead, of the Monarchy and vniuersall authority of the Pope, of Transubstantiation, and popish worship of Images, is not only not to be prooued, but also to be disproued by holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The same is also contrary both to decrées of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and authority of Fathers, as hath bene declared in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers treatises of those seuerall arguments. We only will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge some few. First then the sacrifice of the masse for quick and dead is repugnant to <hi>Christes</hi> institution, that ordeined the Eucharist to be distributed &amp; receiued, and not to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp for quick and dead. Next to holy Scriptures, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that say that carnall sacrifices are ceased, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of <hi>Christ</hi> was once only to be offered, that <hi>Christ</hi> is a priest after the order of <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> and that the sacrifices of <hi>Christians</hi> are spirituall and not carnall. Finally if <hi>Christes</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:21479:27"/>
body be not really present, nor the bread &amp; wine transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated into his body and bloud, then the papists themselues must néeds co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, that the Masse is no sacrifice propitiatory for quick &amp; dead. But that is proued by the words of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, bread and wine being named, after consecration, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> testimony of Fathers that expound these words, <hi>hoc est corpus meum,</hi> figuratiuely, by the analogy betwixt the signes and things signified, which by transubstantiation is quite ouerthrowne, and by diuers other arguments.</p>
               <p>For the Popes monarchy and vniuersall authority, there is no one word in scripture, nay scriptures shew, that all the Apostles were called, and authorized alike; and that is also expressely affirmed by <hi>Cyprian de simpl. praelat.</hi> Furthermore, the Popes agents cannot shew either co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission or practise for this authority, for more then a thousand yeares after <hi>Christ. Gregory,</hi> as I haue shewed, condemned the title of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall bishop as Antichristian; neither can it be shewed, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope either made lawes, or ordeined bishops, or iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all causes throughout the whole church, vntil <hi>Antichrist</hi> of the temple of God had made a denne of theeues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> ouerthroweth the humane nature of <hi>Christes</hi> body, and supposeth it neither to be visible, nor pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, repugneth to the words of institution, and common co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of Fathers, that declare bread &amp; wine to remain after consecration, taketh away the analogy betwéene the signes and things signified, and bringeth in the heresie of <hi>Euty ches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The worship of images is contrary to the law of God, <hi>Exod. 20.</hi> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> decrées of Councels, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of Fathers, and abolisheth all true religion. God forbiddeth vs expresly to make either graue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> image or likenes, to the intent to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship it, or to bow downe to it. The Councell of <hi>Eliberis c. 36.</hi> forbiddeth any thing that is worshipped to be painted on walls. <hi>The 2. Councel of Nice,</hi> though it allow some worship done to images, yet expresly sheweth that <hi>Latria</hi> or diuine honor is not to be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to any image. The Councel of <hi>Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> abrogated the acts of the idolatrous conuenticle of <hi>Nice</hi> allowing the worship of images. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> tore downe a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21479:28"/>
vaile, that had an image of <hi>Christ,</hi> or some Saint painted on it. <hi>Gregory,</hi> as before I haue shewed, vtterly condemned the worship of Images. Finally <hi>Lacta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius lib. 2. Instit. diuin. c. 19.</hi> saith plainely, <hi>There is no religion, where there is an image.</hi> Most odious therfore and blasphemous it is to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison betwixt the articles of our Christian faith, and these damnable doctrines contrariant to Religion and truth.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding to demonstrate these points of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne <hi>Romish</hi> faith, <hi>Parsons</hi> promiseth to take <hi>two wayes of proofe, the one</hi> as he calleth it, <hi>negatiue, and the other affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue;</hi> and by them he vanteth, <hi>that he will make our folly to appeare to euery indifferent man.</hi> But whatsoeuer he is able to performe against vs, against himselfe he bringeth an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proofe of his owne folly. For what can be supposed more absurd, then to offer to prooue an affirmatiue, by a negatiue, or contraxiwise? and yet such is <hi>Parsons</hi> his wisdome, that he offereth vs this abuse. Further he séemeth not very well to vnderstand himselfe, where he talketh of <hi>negatiue proofes.</hi> For albeit he standeth vpon his denial, and resolueth to put vs to proue, yet he deserueth a garland for his eminent folly, that estéemeth his owne bare and blockish denyall an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is not ashamed to call it <hi>negatiue proofe.</hi> His mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that we are not able to shew, that either the points aboue mentioned are contrary to the doctrine and practise of the Christian church in <hi>Eleutherius</hi> his time &amp; after, or that they came into the church afterward. And therefore he inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of <hi>S. Augustine lib. 4. de bapt. ca. 24.</hi> that seeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole church for some time hath receiued the doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> popes Monarchy, the Romish masse, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, and the worship of Images, the same is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by authority of the Aposties. But first we haue shewed this doctrine to be contrary to the practise and faith of <hi>Christes</hi> Church. Secondly we are able to shew how euery of these doctrines entred by little and little into the Church, and that long after <hi>Eleutherius</hi> his time. The Churches of <hi>Romes</hi> primacy ouer other Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to enter by a graunt of <hi>Phocas.</hi> The popes tyranny by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21479:28"/>
vsurpation of <hi>Gregory the 7.</hi> The péeces of the Masse when they were added, we may sée in <hi>Walafridus Strabo, Platina, Nauclerus</hi> and <hi>Polydore Virgill.</hi> Transubstantiation was first established by <hi>Innocent the 3.</hi> The worship of Images <hi>by the second Councell of Nice</hi> got credit. Yet were these doctrines neuer perfited, vntill the late conuenticle of <hi>Trent,</hi> nor could they euer be receiued of the whole Church. For to this day the <hi>Greek</hi> Church neither acknowledgeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes authority, nor beléeueth <hi>transubstantiation,</hi> or receiueth the Popes masse, or popish purgatory, or his doctrine of <hi>Images.</hi> Nay the French at this day refuse the decrées of the conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the Emperour protested against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Synod.</p>
               <p>Little therefore doth <hi>Augustine</hi> help, but to confound <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> his cause, albeit his words are not to be vnderstood of all false doctrines, whose certaine originall and author is not alwayes knowne, but of ceremonies in the administration of sacraments and gouernment of the Church.</p>
               <p>But sayth <hi>Parsons, Pag. 111.</hi> although the word <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi> was added by the Councell of <hi>Lateran,</hi> as these words <hi>Consubstantiall, Trinity,</hi> and the like in the first Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Nice,</hi> yet the substance of the article <hi>(viz.</hi> concerning transubstantiation) was held from the beginning. And this he endeuoreth to prooue by the authority of <hi>S. Ambrose, lib. 4. 5. &amp; 9. de Sacramentis,</hi> and out of these words, <hi>Non valebit sermo Christi, vt species mutet elementorum?</hi> And againe, <hi>Sermo Christi, qui potuit de nihilo facere, quod non erat, non potest ea quae sunt in id mutare, quod non erat?</hi> But first he sheweth himselfe a shamelesse creature, to compare the mystery of the holy <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and of the <hi>consubstantiality</hi> of the Sonne with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both being prooued cléerely by Scriptures, with the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of <hi>transubstantiation,</hi> that is so repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to Scriptures, faith, authority, and common sence. <hi>Secondly</hi> he wrongeth the famous Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> to equall it to the conuenticle of <hi>Lateran</hi> vnder <hi>Innocentius the 3</hi> nay vnder the kingdome of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> &amp; in the times of darkenes. <hi>Thirdly</hi> he séemeth little to vnderstand what passed in the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> that supposeth that Councell <hi>first</hi> to haue established the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the <hi>Trinity. Fourthly</hi> he auoucheth an vntruth impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21479:29"/>
where he saith, the article of transubstantiation was held from the beginning. For I haue shewed before, that the Master of Sentences knew it not. And in my books <hi>de Missa</hi> I haue ouerthrowne transubstantiation by the testimonie of <hi>Ambrose.</hi> These two sentences which he alledgeth outof <hi>Ambrose,</hi> make nothing for <hi>Parsons.</hi> For he will not deny, but that <hi>species,</hi> or formes remaine, where as <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith they are changed. Againe, <hi>Ambrose</hi> will not haue any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther change in the elements, then is wrought in our rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, or in the iron of the hatchet of one of the sonnes of the Prophets, <hi>4. Reg. 6.</hi> or in the vnion of the two natures in <hi>Christ,</hi> as is euidently seene <hi>lib. de ijs qui initiantur. ca. 9.</hi> and <hi>de Sacrament. lib. 4. ca. 4.</hi> This mutation he wil haue to be such, that <hi>the things still remaine. Vt sint quae erant, &amp; in aliud commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur.</hi> The same Father <hi>lib. 6. de Sacram. ca.</hi> 1. saith we receiue bread. <hi>Tu,</hi> sayth he, <hi>quia accipis panem, diuinae eius substantiae in illo participaris elemento. Fiftly</hi> he bewrayeth singular ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or negligence, that citeth the ninth booke of <hi>Ambrose de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentis,</hi> where he wrote but sixe, if those sixe bookes at all were his, and alledgeth these two places, as out of <hi>Ambroses</hi> booke <hi>de Sacramentis,</hi> that are not there to be found, but are deriued out of his booke <hi>de ijs qui initiantur ca. 9.</hi> Finally he grossely belyeth <hi>Ambrose,</hi> where he sayth, <hi>he auerreth the change of natures of elements and of one substance into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> for he doth neither talke of the change of natures, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, nor substances.</p>
               <p>To prooue the article of the Popes supremacy, of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of images, and of the sacrifice of Masse to haue bene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes beléeued in the Church, he alledgeth neither autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor reason, but only saith, <note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 113.</note> 
                  <hi>that although we appoint certaine times when these things began, yet we dare not stand to any certaine time, nor can alledge the certaine authors of them.</hi> But as in his owne proofes, so in reporting our asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he vseth notorious falshood and impudencie. For we do not say, as he reporteth, <hi>that the Pope challenged this su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi> which now in some countries he possesseth, <hi>vnder Pope Gregory,</hi> and <hi>Phocas the Emperour,</hi> but that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to encroch by litle and litle, and that <hi>Boniface the 3.</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21479:29"/>
of <hi>Phocas,</hi> that <hi>the seate of Peter should be esteemed chiefe of all Churches,</hi> as <hi>Platina saith in Bonifacio 3.</hi> The rest, we say the Popes obteined partly by fraud, and force of armes in the time of <hi>Gregory the 7.</hi> and diuers of his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors. The authors of the Masse, and of the worship of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges both entring by degrées, we alledge most certainely out of their owne histories, and stand to our allegation so firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Rob. Parsons</hi> notwithstanding his great cracks thought best to passe ouer the matter in sad and déepe silence. That <hi>heresies could not creepe into the church without being espied,</hi> we graunt, &amp; therfore shew how popish heresies grew to be contradicted by the most auncient and sound Fathers: and that <hi>Rob. Parsons</hi> had litle reason to stand vpon this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, or his negatiue proofe, as he ridiculously calleth it.</p>
               <p>His affirmatiue proofe also is not much better. First, he <note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 123.</note> citeth the names of <hi>Irenaeus, Iustine Martyr, Athenagoras, Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> for proofe of the Popes supremacy, fréewill, merit of works, the sacrifice and ceremonies of the masse. But very wisely he maketh only a muster of names without making them to speake, lest in the places quoted either they should hap to say nothing, or else to speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the producents cause. Only he could not, as he sayth <hi>Pag. 129.</hi> omit one place out of <hi>Ireney lib. 3. aduers. haeres. ca. 3.</hi> beginning, <hi>Maximae &amp; antiquissimae ecclesiae &amp;c.</hi> but first he choppeth off the beginning of the sentence, which sheweth, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tradition of other churches is no lesse to be regarded, then that of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> citeth the <hi>Romish</hi> churches tradition only, not as head, but <hi>for auoiding tediousnes. Quoniam valde longum est,</hi> saith he, <hi>in hoc tali volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine omnium Ecclesiarum enumerare successiones, maximae &amp; anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quissimae &amp;c.</hi> Secondly absurdly he translateth these words, <hi>ad hanc ecclesiam propter potentiorem principalitatem necesse est omnem conuenire ecclesiam,</hi> in this sort, <hi>for that vnto this church, in respect of her more mighty principality, it is necessary, that all churches must agree, &amp; haue accesse.</hi> Whereas <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his meaning only is, that euery church should haue respect vnto the church of <hi>Rome</hi> in respect of her greatnes &amp; dignity, and not subiect it selfe or agree vnto it. Thirdly he collecteth very
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21479:30"/>
absurdly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> because Christians did respect y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of <hi>Rome</hi> much, while it kept the faith sincere, now also all churches are to respect it, being departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faith, &amp; tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nizing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all others. For why should we rather respect that church, then the church of <hi>Ephesus &amp; Smyrna,</hi> whose succession and tradition <hi>Irenaeus</hi> then no lesse respected, then that of <hi>Rome?</hi> Mainely therefore doth <hi>Parsons</hi> conclude vpon <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his words, saying, <hi>lo here the principality of that church co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed.</hi> For by the Popes supremacy far greater matters are now vnderstood, then <hi>Irenaeus</hi> euer gaue to <hi>Rome,</hi> or vnderstood by principality.</p>
               <p>Next he vrgeth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Magdeburgia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> against vs. But neither do we allow whatsoeuer they say, nor do they bring any thing to help <hi>Parsons</hi> to proue, that the moderne faith of <hi>Rome</hi> was professed by <hi>Eleutherius</hi> bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> True it is, that in the <hi>2. Century c. 4.</hi> vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> title of <hi>Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious opinions, and stubble of some Doctors,</hi> they alledge <hi>Ignatius epist. ad Rom.</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus lib. 3. c. 3.</hi> and <hi>centur. 3. c. 4.</hi> do mislike <hi>Tertullian</hi> for giuing the keies only to <hi>Peter,</hi> and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Church is built vpon him. Likewise they ta<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> for some spéeches. But it is plain ideotisme héerof to conclude, that either <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or <hi>Tertullian,</hi> or <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> or <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> doth hold &amp; maintaine the bishop of <hi>Romes</hi> authority, which now he challengeth. <hi>Parsons</hi> séemeth not to haue read <hi>Cyprian.</hi> No way, certes, he can be thought to vnderstand him, that nameth <hi>Salonius</hi> for <hi>Sidonius,</hi> and supposeth <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Vrbanus,</hi> and <hi>Sidonius</hi> named in that epistle to be holy Fathers, and to haue affirmed, that there ought to be one chiefe Bishop in the catholike church, wheras these three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from the side of schismatikes, that in euery church had erected a bishop of their own faction, began now to hold, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in euery seuerall church, there ought to be but one bishop. Furthermore neither he nor the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> do well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand <hi>Cyprian lib. 4. cpist. 8.</hi> For indéede he speaketh not of the Romane church, but of the vniuersall church. The like may be sayd of <hi>Cyprians</hi> booke <hi>de simplic. Praelat.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally if <hi>Parsons</hi> vpon the words of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or <hi>Origen,</hi> can conclude the primacy challenged by the Pope, he shall well
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21479:30"/>
deserue a Cardinals hat. But in the meane while, he must content himselfe with a garland of Fore tayles for his insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnious fopperie, that by such weake surmises thinketh to proue the faith of <hi>Eleutherius &amp; Clement</hi> the 8. to be all one.</p>
               <p>He should also haue alledged the testimonie of the <hi>Magdeburgians,</hi> as yeelding the Fathers to make for the popish sacrifice of the Masse, for transubstantiation, &amp; the worship of images: but therein he faileth. Onely he talketh idlely of certaine frauds practised by them in citing the Fathers, and toucheth them for dissenting from the Fathers in matters of Frée-will, Iustification, Repentance, Good workes, Fasts, Uirginitie, kéeping of Holy dayes, Martyrdome, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of Saints, Purgatorie, Traditions, Monasticall life, Reliques, and such like points. But all this is nothing to the purpose. For neither are we bound to performe and make good euery priuate mans singular opinions: nor do the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> note any great matters of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt themselues and the Fathers: nor do they alwaies ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their sentences out of the authenticall writings of the Fathers: neither do they meane and comprehend all, as oft as they speake against one or two: nor finally doth it follow because some one or two Fathers do dissent in some one or two points from vs, that either al the Fathers make against vs, or that all, most, or any do ioyne with the Papists. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Parsons</hi> therefore would be admonished by some of his friends, to leaue this vaine and roauing discoursing, and scholerlike to conclude somewhat against that religion, which he hath forsaken, and we do professe, and beleeue to be most Catholike, and auncient, and Apostolicall.</p>
               <p>For proofe that the religion now professed in <hi>Rome</hi> is the same, which was brought into <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Austin</hi> the Monke, he referreth vs <hi>p. 152.</hi> to <hi>Stapletons Fortresse of faith,</hi> as he called it. But he should remember, that the same for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse was taken, and ouerthrowne by <hi>M. Doctor Fulke</hi> of worthie memorie, and that in such sort, that the builder and author of that foolish fortresse, durst neuer vndertake to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire the ruines thereof. Furthermore, he is to vnderstand,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21479:31"/>
that <hi>Stapletons</hi> discourse containeth a briefe recapitulation of certaine ceremonies and abuses in doctrine, which were in practise about the coming in of <hi>Augustine</hi> into <hi>England.</hi> But neither were they matters of any importance, nor were they generally receiued, nor were they agreable to the formes now receiued, and vsed in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

Thirdly,</hi> we do not so much contend about the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons brought in by <hi>Austin</hi> the Monke, as those which now the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would thrust vpon vs. <hi>Parsons</hi> therfore ought to shew, that now the same religion is professed' in <hi>Rome,</hi> which was brought in both by <hi>Eleutherius</hi> and <hi>Austin</hi> into <hi>Britaine</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and not so much to prate of the times betwéene <hi>Eleutherius</hi> and <hi>Austin.</hi> Howbeit it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that euen in these times superstition and false doctrine began to créepe into some corners of the Church contrarie to that forme, which was receiued from the Apostles, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in <hi>Eleutherius</hi> his times. Some began to talke doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Purgatorie, others to pray priuatly to Saints. In the administration of the Lords Supper some rites began here and there to be practised diuers from Apostolicall orders. Of Fréewill and of Workes some began to talke philosophical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, others to aduance mans merits. Churches were built in honour of Saints, and their Reliques worshipped. <hi>Austin</hi> he brought in an image of <hi>Christ</hi> in a table, and a siluer crosse, and began to chaunt Letanies; which <hi>Rob.

albeit all the Iebusites in <hi>Rome</hi> should helpe him with their suffrages, will neuer proue to haue bene knowne or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in <hi>Eleutherius</hi> his time. <hi>Pa. 181.</hi> he proueth altars in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> out of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and afterward altars of stone, and sacrifices, and vowes, and othes made to Saints out of <hi>Gildas.</hi> He alledgeth also <hi>Optatus,</hi> and <hi>Augustine,</hi> for proofe of <hi>altars,</hi> and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Masse. But neither doth the name of Masse, or altars, or sacrifices, or vowes prooue the <hi>Romish</hi> Masse, altars, sacrifice, vowes, or the <hi>Romish</hi> doctrine of these points, as at large hath bene declared in my bookes <hi>De Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,</hi> and <hi>De Monachis</hi> against <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> nor do we stand vpon names or termes, nor are these the principall points of <hi>Romish</hi> religion, which we impugne: nor is the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of <hi>Gildas</hi> authenticall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Part. 1. chap. 10.</hi> he telleth vs <hi>of a Church built in the honor of Saint Martin, where Austin song, prayed, and said Masses;</hi> of a <hi>Tribunes daughter restored to sight by Germanus his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and application of reliques, of a prayer made to Saint Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban, of honoring Martyrs sepulchers, of Alleluia, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruance of Lent, out of Bede.</hi> But therein he spendeth his labour in vaine. For neither were the Masses then said, nor the honor then done to Saints reliques, nor their obseruan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces like to those, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now practiseth. Beside that, <hi>Bede</hi> speaketh of things past after the manners of his time, and reporteth many things by heare-say. <hi>Parsons</hi> also to helpe the matter translateth these words of <hi>Bede lib. 1. hist. cap. 18. Beatum Albanum Martyrem auctori Deo per ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum gratias petierunt:</hi> thus, <hi>They went to the sepulcher of S. Alban, prayed to the Saint largely.</hi> But there is no such mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be forced out of the words. Finally, these points are not great in regard of the rest of the <hi>Romish</hi> religion, which we refuse.</p>
               <p>Out of <hi>Galfridus Monumetensis</hi> he gathereth that <hi>Dubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> was the Legate of the Apostolike sea, and that there were <hi>Procession, Organs,</hi> and singing in the Church. Out of <hi>M. Bale, M. Foxe, Trithemius</hi> and others, that before <hi>Austins</hi> time there were diuers learned men and preachers among
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21479:32"/>
the <hi>Britains,</hi> whereof some were instructed at <hi>Rome,</hi> some were sent from <hi>Rome,</hi> some built Monasteries, some were Monkes. But neither doth that make any thing for proofe, that they either held that religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which <hi>Eleutherius</hi> taught, or taught that Romish religion which <hi>Parsons</hi> now profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.</p>
               <p>Finally, he affirmeth, that the religion taught by <hi>Austin,</hi> was catholike and confirmed by miracles, and sheweth how it was planted and continued without interruption to these times. But that which is the point in controuersie, <hi>viz.</hi> that the religion established by the conuenticles of <hi>Lateran, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, Florence, Trent,</hi> and by the Popes Decretals since <hi>Innocent</hi> the thirds time, is the same, that was preached by <hi>Austin</hi> the Monke, the wise disputer doth scarce mention, and no way proueth. Of this his loose dispute then I inferre <hi>first,</hi> that seeing he would haue vs to embrace the religion preached in <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Eleutherius</hi> his agents, and by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi> we are to renounce all those heresies, false doctrines, and abuses, which since the time of <hi>Austin</hi> haue bene brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> is not able to proue the carnall reall presence, nor transubstantiation, nor the sacrifice of Christs bodie and bloud offered really in the Masse for quicke and dead, nor halfe Communions, nor the Popes tyrannical supremacie, nor his Indulgences, nor the worship of Images, nor Purgatorie for satisfaction for the temporall paines of mortall sinnes, nor the rest of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish</hi> doctrine by vs refused, to haue bene preached by those, that first planted <hi>Christian</hi> religion in this countrie.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the vanitie and foolerie of <hi>Parsons</hi> his whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of three Conuersions of <hi>England.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HItherto we haue discoursed of <hi>Parsons</hi> his falshood, who will needes beare the Reader in hand, that this land
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21479:32"/>
hath not onely bene thrice conuerted to the faith by Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers that came from <hi>Rome,</hi> but also to that faith, which now the Pope and his adherents do professe. Now therfore it resteth, that we speake somewhat of the vanitie and foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his whole purpose, that by this discourse hopeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime vs backe to the subiection of the Pope. Two things it séemeth, he aymeth at in this worke. The first is, to bring the King, the Cleargie, the Nobles, and people of <hi>England,</hi> vnder the Popes obedience, and into the captiuitie of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> The second is, to perswade vs to like of the <hi>Romish</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and all the abhominations of <hi>Antichrist</hi> figured in the whore of <hi>Babylon.</hi> But to effect this purpose, this labour is wholy vnsufficient.</p>
               <p>For first, no Bishop or teacher ought to desire any such dominion, or rule ouer Gods people, as the Pope preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to be due vnto him. Our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> expresly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth such rule vnto his Disciples. <hi>The Princes of nations</hi> (saith he) <note n="a" place="margin">Mallb. 20. Marc. 10. Luc. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>beare rule ouer them,</hi> and afterward, <hi>but it shall not be so with you.</hi> Likewise Saint <hi>Peter</hi> dehorteth the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church to affect domination, or popish tyrannie ouer the Lords <hi>heritage. Neque dominantes in Cleris,</hi> saith he. Hereupon <hi>Bernard</hi> writing to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> applieth this to him, and sheweth, that the Apostles were forbidden to affect this domination, and Lordlinesse. <hi>Planum est</hi> (saith he) <hi>lib. 2. de Consid. ad Eugen. Apostolis interdicitur dominatus. I, ergo tu, &amp; tibi vsurpare aude, aut dominans Apostolatum, aut Apostolicus dominatum.</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paule</hi> also 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. sheweth, that the Apostles themselues had no dominion <hi>ouer Christian mens faith,</hi> so that he might impose yokes vpon their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. <hi>Not</hi> (saith he) <hi>that we haue dominion ouer your faith, but we are helpers of your ioy.</hi> Finally, our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> forbiddeth his disciples to affect to be called <hi>Rabbi,</hi> or <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and sheweth, that this is <hi>Pharisaicall. Gregorie</hi> also dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liketh the title of <hi>Vniuersall Bishop,</hi> and reason sheweth, that it is a note of great pride to desire to be called the generall Master, or teacher of the whole Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> the people of God may not subiect themselues
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21479:33"/>
to any such tyrannie. <hi>Stand fast</hi> (saith the Apostle <hi>Gal. 5.) in the libertie, wherewith Christ hath made vs free, and be not entangled againe with the yoke of bondage.</hi> And againe, <hi>Col. 2. Let no man at his pleasure beare rule ouer you, by humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of mind, and worshipping of Angels, aduancing himselfe in those things, which he neuer saw, rashly puft vp with his fleshly mind.</hi> Which words do directly belong to the Pope, who pretending humilitie, and calling himselfe <hi>Seruant of seruants:</hi> yet teaching worship of Saints and Angels, and telling newes out of Purgatorie, and strange things, which he neuer saw, affecteth Lordship and rule ouer the Church of God. There cannot be assigned a more proper marke to know the adherents of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> then the slauish bondage and subiection of the papists to the Pope, who ruleth in their consciences, and marketh them for his slaues, as we reade <hi>Apocalyps. 13.</hi> with the brand of Antichristianitie. <hi>He made all both small and great,</hi> (saith <hi>Iohn) rich and poore, free and bond to receiue a marke in their right hand, and in their foreheads.</hi> But let such beware, how they continue in this bondage: and let others that are frée, take héede how they suffer themselues to be entangled with the yoke of Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian tyrannie. For as we reade <hi>Apocal. 14. Such as worship the beast, and his image, and receiue Antichrists marke in their foreheads, or in their hands, shall drinke of the wine of the wrath of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, experience teacheth vs, that the Gospell began to be preached first at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and from thence went foorth into all lands. And our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> speaking to his Apostles, <hi>Act. 1.</hi> saith, <hi>They shall be witnesses to him, both in Hierusalem, and in all Iudaea, and to the vttermost part of the earth.</hi> Yet neuer did either the Bishops, or Church of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> claime dominion, or superioritie ouer the whole Christian Church for that cause. Why should then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretend a greater priuiledge, where they say <hi>Peter</hi> preached, and sent out teachers to conuert diuers cities and nations, then the Church of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> where our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe preached, and from whence as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21479:33"/>
we reade, <hi>Mat. 28.</hi> and <hi>Act. 1.</hi> he sent his Disciples to preach in all the world, and to teach all nations?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we reade in histories, that the Churches of <hi>India</hi> were planted by preachers sent from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and that <hi>Philip</hi> out of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Gallia</hi> sent preachers into <hi>Britaine.</hi> For so <hi>Capgraue</hi> writeth, citing <hi>Freculphus</hi> for his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. It is said also, that <hi>Dionysius</hi> coming from <hi>Athens</hi> preached the Gospell in <hi>France,</hi> and that <hi>Iames</hi> coming from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> preached first in <hi>Spaine. S. Augustine Epist. 162.</hi> and <hi>170.</hi> testifieth, that the Gospell came into <hi>Afrike</hi> by the meanes of preachers, that came out of the East country. Finally, our histories do teach vs, that the Northerne <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xons</hi> were conuerted by <hi>Finan</hi> a <hi>Scot,</hi> and that the <hi>Irish</hi> were conuerted to the faith by <hi>Patricke</hi> a <hi>Britaine,</hi> and that the <hi>Frizelanders,</hi> and diuers <hi>Germaine</hi> nations were taught re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by preachers out of <hi>England.</hi> Yet neither are the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Churches subiect to the Bishops of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> nor the <hi>English</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> or the <hi>French</hi> to the bishops of <hi>Athens,</hi> or the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> or the <hi>Africans</hi> to the Easterne Church, or the <hi>Frizelanders</hi> or <hi>Germains</hi> to the <hi>English.</hi> Is it not then a mad conceit of <hi>Parsons,</hi> to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, because for many ages past it is reported, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> were conuerted by preachers sent from <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Church of <hi>England</hi> should be subiect to the Pope or Church of <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> saith, <hi>lib. 3. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. haeres. cap. 3.</hi> was founded by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paule.</hi> Neither néede we make any question, but that they came from <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi> Diuers stories also say, that <hi>Peter</hi> for some time sate Bishop of <hi>Antioch.</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">In Chronico.</note> 
                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith, <hi>He was 25. yeares Bishop at Antioch.</hi> If then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do yéeld no subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction either for matters of faith, or gouernment to the Church of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> or <hi>Antioch,</hi> from whence, the Papists cannot deny, but that the first founders of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did come: <hi>Parsons</hi> is but a simple fellow, to vrge this matter of Conuersion so much, séeing the <hi>Romanists</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and their holy Fathers the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> regard
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21479:34"/>
it not one strain.</p>
               <p>Finally, if our owne Bishops, to whom we owe subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Lord, should teach any other Gospell, then that which was preached by the Apostles of our Sauiour <hi>Christ,</hi> we are not to follow them. Nay we are to pronounce them <hi>Anathema. Though we</hi> (saith the Apostle, <hi>Gal. 1.) or an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell from heauen should preach vnto you otherwise, then that which we haue preached vnto you, let him be accursed.</hi> But the Pope aud his adherents preach vnto vs otherwise, and publish doctrines in their Decretals, and acts of the conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of <hi>Lateran, Constance, Florence,</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> not onely diuers from the Apostles preaching, but also contrarie vnto it, as partly we haue shewed, and also shall be readie to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerre to <hi>Parsons</hi> his face, though neuer so much steeled with impudencie. Had they then any right to teach or gouern vs, as they haue not: yet by the Apostles rule we are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them <hi>Anathema.</hi> And as for <hi>Parsons,</hi> we are to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him a weake fellow, that hath spent the quintessence of his silly learning and vnderstanding to proue that, which profiteth him nothing.</p>
               <p>If we owe any thing to the <hi>Romaines,</hi> it is to those, if any such were, that tooke paines to teach vs the faith of <hi>Christ.</hi> As for the moderne <hi>Romanists,</hi> that seeke to turne vs from true religion, nay that séeke to blow vs vp, we owe them nothing. Furthermore, as well may it be concluded, that the Pope and his adherents the <hi>Iebusites</hi> are to be subiect to the great <hi>Turke,</hi> that now ruleth at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> or to his <hi>Mufti</hi> or chiefe Bishop there, because from thence came the preachers that first founded the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as that we are to be subiect to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Pope, because the auncient <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> were first conuerted by preachers, that came from <hi>Rome.</hi> For the <hi>Turkes Mufti</hi> is as good a Bishop, as the Pope, and the Popes religion is not much lesse corrupted in many points, then that of the <hi>Turke.</hi> Howsoeuer it is, the <hi>Turkes</hi> call themselues <hi>Musul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> or True beléeuers, as the Papists call themselues <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes.</hi> Finally, I cannot better compare <hi>Parsons,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21479:34"/>
subiection and obedience of this pretended Conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to any, then to him that would inferre, that the Pope is Lord of the whole world, because sometime <hi>Rome</hi> was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris of the world, or that the <hi>Romains</hi> haue obligation to the <hi>Turkes</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> because they possesse the citie and country of <hi>Troy,</hi> from whence it is said, the auncient <hi>Romains</hi> are descended.</p>
               <p>But saith <hi>Parsons, pa. 28. Irenaeus, Tertullian de Praescript. Cyprian lib. 4. cap. 8. Augustine and others are wont to vrge greatly against Heretikes, that if our Church be the daughter and disciple of the Church of Rome, then ought it to runne to her in all doubts and difficulties of faith.</hi> But first, no one of these Fathers speaketh one word in the places quoted of our Church. <hi>Secondly,</hi> they do not affirme this of any other Church. Why then doth he not bring foorth his testimonies that hath bene so often taken halting in false alledging the Fathers? <hi>Irenaeus lib. 3. aduers. haeres.</hi> saith, that euery Church ought to haue respect to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> then, for her eminent principality. And others regarded her, when she florished in pietie. But what is this to the moderne Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is departed from the faith, pietie, and vertue of the auncient Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Againe, if other Churches in old time had no great respect to <hi>Rome</hi> professing the faith; no Church is now bound to hearken to her, being departed from the faith. Finally, albeit in ancient time other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches did consult in matters of difficultie with the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> yet this prooueth not, that in matters of faith, or ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remontes they were to adhere to her, or that they ought to acknowledge the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> for their Monarch. Doth it not then appeare, that <hi>Parsons</hi> his worke is as fraile as a Spiderwebbe, and as full of foolerie, as frailtie, vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to proue matters, which he could not performe, and which being proued do rather make against him, then for him?</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> That the late Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> haue deserued nothing of <hi>England,</hi> or the English nation, but hatred and detestation.</head>
               <p>GLadly would <hi>Parsons</hi> haue concluded, if he durst, that the <hi>English,</hi> being first conuerted to the faith by the <hi>Romains,</hi> are now to be subiect to the Pope both in matters of doctrine, and Ecclesiasticall gouernment. But well he vnderstood, that the consequent was leud and foolish. He doth now therefore <note n="a" place="margin">Part. 1. ca. 1.</note> say onely, <hi>That England and English men haue particular obligation to the sea of Rome,</hi> leauing it to euery mans priuate supposall, what that obligation is. But we do no more yeeld to this, then to the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</p>
               <p>For whereas the inhabitants of <hi>England</hi> are descended either of the auncient <hi>Britains,</hi> or <hi>Saxons,</hi> or <hi>Danes,</hi> or <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Frenchmen:</hi> first, the auncient <hi>Britains</hi> and their ofspring do owe nothing either to <hi>Austin</hi> or <hi>Gregorie.</hi> For when as the Bishops of the <hi>Britains</hi> came to conferre with <hi>Austin,</hi> most proudly he sate in his chaire, and would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them with any signe of humanitie or reuerence. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum est</hi> (saith <hi>Bede lib. 2. histor. Anglor. cap. 2.) vt venientibus illis sederet Augustinus in sella.</hi> He confesseth also, that the <hi>Britaine</hi> Bishops <hi>noted his pride.</hi> And it appeareth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly in this, that ambitiously he sought to be the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>England,</hi> and to rule ouer the <hi>Britains.</hi> Againe, when the Bishops of <hi>Britaine</hi> refused him as their Archbishop, and would not submit themselues to his commandements, he animated the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and stirred them to warre against the <hi>Britains. Austin being refused of the Bishops</hi> (saith <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Grey</hi> in his Chronicle,) <hi>and others the learned of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, made such complaint thereof to Ethelbert king of Kent, that foorthwith he leauied his power, and marched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and flue them in most cruell wife, hauing no more
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21479:35"/>
mercie on them, then a Wolfe vpon a sheepe.</hi> Another old <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Chronicle testifieth, <hi>That Augustine went with the army to the warre,</hi> and that such of the <hi>Britains,</hi> as were sent to intreat for peace, <hi>were killed without pitie.</hi> That <hi>Augustine</hi> was the cause of this warre and murther, we may probably also gather out of <hi>Bedes</hi> historie. For he doth not onely shew, that the greatest slaughter was made of the Monkes of <hi>Bangor,</hi> that resisted <hi>Austin,</hi> and gaue counsell against him, but also that <hi>Austin did threaten them and foretell them, that they should haue warre. Augustinus</hi> (saith he, <hi>lib. 2. hist. cap. 2.) fertur minitans praedixisse, quòdsipacem cum fratribus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipere nollent, bellum ab hostibus forent accepturi.</hi> Neither is any cause alledged of this warre against the <hi>Britains,</hi> but that <hi>Augustine</hi> was by them reiected. Is not then <hi>Austin</hi> to be taken as a braue Apostle and conuerter of nations to the faith, that came with Pagans against <hi>Christians</hi> with fire and sword, because they would not vndergo his yoke? To excuse this matter they alledge the words of <hi>Bede,</hi> as they pretend, who speaking of this murther, saith, <hi>That Austin was dead long before.</hi> But a man of meane iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may see, that these words are thrust into <hi>Bede</hi> by some falsarie. For how could <hi>Austin</hi> be dead long before, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this warre, as <hi>Bede</hi> reporteth, ordained <hi>Iustus and Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> Bishops? Do dead men reuiue againe to ordaine Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops? Furthermore, these words of <hi>Austins</hi> death before the murther of the <hi>Britains</hi> are not found in the <hi>Saxon</hi> transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Beda</hi> made by King <hi>Alured.</hi> Finally, both the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and <hi>Flores historiarum</hi> do witnesse, that <hi>Austin</hi> died three yeares after the execution done vpon the <hi>Britains.</hi> The <hi>Britains</hi> therefore are not bound to <hi>Rome,</hi> that sent this proud and cruell man amongst them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the same much obliged to <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> if he did, as is said, send Preachers into <hi>Britaine.</hi> The reasons I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alledged.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Danes, Normans,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and their discen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants they are cleare also from this obligation. For the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists,</hi> albeit they séeke out all colours to beautifie the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21479:36"/>
Popes chaire, yet say not that preachers from <hi>Rome</hi> did conuert them to the faith.</p>
               <p>It resteth then, that all the weight of this obligation to <hi>Rome,</hi> which <hi>Parsons</hi> aduanceth so magnifically, must rest vpon a few <hi>Saxons</hi> or <hi>English.</hi> But this cannot be great, as I haue shewed, seeing the <hi>Saxons</hi> were not then the greatest part of the inhabitants of this land, nor generally conuerted by the <hi>Romaines,</hi> as hath bene declared.</p>
               <p>But were the auncient <hi>English,</hi> beholding in times past to <hi>Gregorie,</hi> or <hi>Austin;</hi> yet the inhabitants of <hi>England</hi> for this sixe hundred yeares and vpward, haue bene litle behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their adherents. For first they haue vsed all force and fraud to plant their false, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, and idolatrous Religion in <hi>England,</hi> as their sending of Legates, Agents, Archpriests, Iebusites, and Masse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priests, when they durst openly, and now of late priuily, and the rebellions, and warres stirred vp by them against the Kings and Princes of <hi>England</hi> do declare. If then we are neither to hearken to false Prophets, nor dreamers of dreames, nor to spare them, or fauour them, that would draw vs from the seruice of God to Idolatrie; then are we to detest the Pope and his idolatroùs Agents, whose massing Religion and worship of Saints and Images, is nothing else but refined paganisme, and grosse I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie. Againe, <hi>If we are to marke them, and auoid them, that cause diuision and offences, contrarie to the doctrine, which we haue receiued from the Apostles,</hi> as <hi>Saint Paule</hi> exhorteth vs, <hi>Roman. 16.</hi> then are we to haue no communion nor fellowship with the Pope, which indeuoureth to diuide vs from the Catholike Church, and to draw vs from Apostolicall doctrine to his leude Decretaline Heresies and Traditions. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> they haue by their cunning engines drawne infinite treasure out of <hi>England,</hi> impouerishing both the Kings and people of this Iland by their manifold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions. <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> doth in sundrie places complaine of the oppressions made by the Pope and his Agents,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21479:36"/>
and <hi>in Henrico tertio</hi> saith, <hi>That England by the Pope was made like a vine left to the open spoile of euery one, that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, for the most part they haue concurred with our enemies, and by all meanes oppugned our nation. <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> writing <hi>Harolds</hi> life sheweth, that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Pope sent a Standard to <hi>William</hi> the conqueror, when he came with fire and sword against the <hi>English</hi> nation. <hi>Papa</hi> (saith he) <hi>vexillum Willelmo in omen regni transmisit.</hi> And call you this a fauour to ioyne with him, that came to conquer our countrie, and to cut the Englishmens throats?</p>
               <p>In the dayes of <hi>Henry the 2.</hi> the Pope fauoured both the Kings disloyall subiects, and open enemies, as appeareth by the discourse of matters passed betwixt him and <hi>Thomas Becket.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Innocentius the 3</hi> excommunicated King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and sought to depriue him of his kingdome. By his malitious courses the King lost <hi>Normandie,</hi> and was forced to surrender his Crowne into his Legats hands. <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> testifieth, that he gaue the <hi>English</hi> for slaues to the <hi>French. Sententiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter definiuit</hi> (saith he) <hi>vt Rex Anglorum Ioannes à solio regni de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poneretur.</hi> He committed the execution of this sentence to the <hi>French</hi> King, and for his labour determined, that he and his successors should perpetually enioy the kingdome of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. Vt ipse &amp; successores sui regnum Angliae iure perpetuo possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derent.</hi> And may we thinke, that any is so brutish, as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, that we are beholding to the Pope, that giueth vs as a prey vnto our enemies? Certes, vnlesse we had read it in <hi>Parsons</hi> the Popes parasite, we could hardly haue beleeued it. In the end albeit he could not bring vs into seruitude: yet he wanted not much, to make our King and country tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</p>
               <p>That noble and victorious Prince King <hi>Edward the third</hi> found none, that more ouerthwarted him and disturned the course of his victories in <hi>France,</hi> then the Pope, as his letters, menaces, and practises reported in Histories de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:21479:37"/>
To forbeare to speake of ancient wrongs done to our Princes and nation by other Popes, see (I beséech you) the indignities offered to king <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. and his subiects by that impious Pope <hi>Paule the third,</hi> and to his daughter Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memorie and her people, by that lousie friar <hi>Pius the fift, Gregorie the 13.</hi> and <hi>Sixtus the fifts</hi> sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, rayling, and outragious Buls. <hi>Paule the third</hi> rayleth on the King, interditeth the kingdome, depriueth his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of trade, and giueth them as slaues to those that could take them. <hi>Prohibet commercium cum Anglis, (saith Sanders in his Glosse vpon the Popes Bull) foedera cum Henrico dissoluit, Henrici sequaces tradit in seruitutem.</hi> Looke what rage or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice can deuise, that he vomiteth out both against the King, and our nation. And will <hi>Parsons</hi> haue our nation to submit themselues to such monsters? or can any find in their hearts to yéeld to such tyrants?</p>
               <p>Against <hi>Queene Elizabeth, Pius Quintus,</hi> as appeareth by the discourse written of his life, first stirred vp her subiects, and when that serued not, he animated both <hi>Spaniard</hi> and <hi>French</hi> against her, and her people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gregorie the 13.</hi> by his Legate <hi>Sanders</hi> stirred the <hi>Irish</hi> to take armes against our nation. The same man, when force serued not, animated the assassinor and murtherer <hi>Parry</hi> to lay violent hands vpon her person, not omitting withal any course to hurt or trouble her subiects.</p>
               <p>In the end, by the procurement of <hi>Sixtus quintus,</hi> the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Armada,</hi> supposed and ridiculously called <hi>inuincible,</hi> came vpon vs, with a full intention to depose the Quéene, to destroy her true subiects, and to marke the rest for slaues. And can any man thinke well of the Pope, so long as any memorie of this action remaineth? It is no maruell then, if the Pope set on that traiterous companion <hi>Allane</hi> to speake all the dishonor he could both against the Prince and her nation, seeing he intended the totall destruction of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and her subiects. But if we search all histories, we shal neuer find a more bloudie and sauage enterprise, then that which the Papists of late attempted, resoluing to extinguish
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21479:37"/>
the Kings line, to destroy the King, his Nobles and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Parliament assembled, and vtterly to subuert the state. Our nation then hath great obligation to the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> and their adherents: but it is to hate them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test them, and resist them, as most bloudie and malitious enemies of our nation for many yeares.</p>
               <p>But saith <hi>Parsons</hi> in his <hi>Ward-word, Our nation hath bene twise conuerted by the labour and industrie of that sea.</hi> And since he saith, <hi>The same hath bene thrise conuerted from Paganisme to Christian Religion.</hi> So absurdly doth he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found himselfe in his owne deuise. But neither can he proue his Conuersions: nor should we grant them, could he win any thing at our hands, but hatred and indignation against the late Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> which are so degenerated, that they seeke to destroy both the bodies and soules of those, whose auncestors auncient Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> are said to haue gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this may serue to answer <hi>Parsons</hi> his patcherie tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the obligation, which <hi>England and English men owe to Rome.</hi> Now because the same man euery where telleth vs of the succession of <hi>Romish</hi> Bishops, and gladly would smoother the fame of Pope <hi>Ioane:</hi> albeit the same be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what impertinent to the matter of <hi>Three Conuersions;</hi> yet shall we examine the title of the Popes succession, turning a litle out of the way, to obserue our aduersaries exorbitant procéeding.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> That the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> of this time are not the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> but rather of Pope <hi>Ioane.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MUch doth <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> boast of the succession of Popes, especially <hi>Part. 2. cap. 1.</hi> and giueth out, <hi>that it is of great importance, for triall of true Religion. Bellarmine De not is Eccles.</hi> and diuers others his consorts estéeme it a <hi>principall marke of the Church.</hi> But when the matter shall
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21479:38"/>
be throughly discussed, he shall well perceiue, that he hath no cause so much to boast of these conceits, séeing neither the Popes are successors to <hi>Peter,</hi> or the auncient Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor the succession of Popes is any marke of the Church, or proper triall of true religion.</p>
               <p>The first is proued by these arguments. First, no man can claime right of succession, but either by right of testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or proximitie of bloud, or some law or laudable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome. For that is the opinion of all Lawyers, where they talke of successions. But <hi>Clement the 8.</hi> and his predecessors for diuers ages, can neither produce any Will made by <hi>S. Peter</hi> declaring the moderne Popes to be his successors, nor any law or custome grounded on the old or new testament. Neither can they shew, that they are of his kindred or affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, whereby they may seeme to haue right of succession. The like also we may say of <hi>Eleutherius.</hi> Secondly, all suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors either do succéed, as heires, in the whole right, or as Legataries in some special bequest of land, goods, or right, or else as executers of any office, or charge. But if <hi>Clement the 8.</hi> should claime to be <hi>Saint Peters</hi> heire, or a Legatarie; then must he shew some testament, or will, or lawe made in his fauour. If he claime to succéed him in office, then must he shew both records, how he holdeth his office, and also acts, which may declare him, to haue truly executed <hi>Saint Peters</hi> office. Likewise if he claime to be <hi>Eleutherius</hi> his successor, he must both shew a lawfull title, and declare, that he hath executed <hi>Eleutherius</hi> his function. But neither can he exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite any proofe for hïs title of Apostolicall or Episcopall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, neither doth it appeare, either that he worketh mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or teacheth all nations, as did <hi>Saint Peter,</hi> or that he preacheth or baptizeth, as did <hi>Eleutherius.</hi> Wherein then haue <hi>Clement,</hi> and his predecessors employed themselues? Forsooth, in stopping the preaching and procéeding of the Gospell, and in murthering the Saints of God, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the kingdome of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> None of them (certes) can shew any title, either from <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> or other godly Bishop.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:21479:38"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Popes claime to be <hi>Vniuersall Bishops,</hi> and <hi>heads and spouses of the Vniuersall Church.</hi> But that neuer came into the head of <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Eleutherius.</hi> Nay <hi>Gregory lib. 4. epist. 82.</hi> speaking of <hi>Peter,</hi> and other Apostles saith, <hi>they are not heads, but members of the Church vnder one head. Sub vno capite,</hi> sayth he, <hi>omnes membra sunt Ecclesiae.</hi> Likewise in the title of Decumenicall or <hi>Vniuersall Bishop</hi> he sheweth, that the Pope doth rather follo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>w <hi>Lucifer,</hi> then <hi>Peter,</hi> or any godly Bishop. <hi>Quis</hi> sayth he, speaking of the title of vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Bishop, <hi>in hoc tam peruerso vocabulo, nisi ille, ad imitandum proponitur, qui despectis Angelorum legionibus secum socialiter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutis, ad culmen conatus est singularitatis erumpere?</hi> He sayth also, that none of the Prelates of that sea would euer be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by so prophane a title. The Apostle <hi>Paule</hi> sheweth, that there is but one head and spouse of the Uniuersall Church, that is <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> forbad <hi>S. Peter</hi> and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles so to beare rule ouer <hi>Christians,</hi> as temporall Kings did ouer nations. Neither do we find that <hi>S. Peter,</hi> or <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius</hi> did transgresse <hi>Christes</hi> commandement. If then the Pope doth rule, not as Princes ouer nations, but as King of Kings, &amp; challengeth power to depose Kings, then is he not <hi>S. Peters</hi> or <hi>Eleutherius</hi> his successor. <hi>S. Bernard</hi> sayth, the Pope cannot both beare this rule, and succeed <hi>Peter</hi> in his Apostleship. <hi>Plane ab alterutro prohiberis; si vtrum<expan>

                  <hi>Fiftly, Peter</hi> exhorted Christians. 1. <hi>epist. 2.</hi> to obedience to Kings and gouernours, and <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> no question, did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his exhortation. Where either of these perswaded <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> to take armes against their superiors, or tooke vpon them to depose Emperours and Kings, and to tread vpon their necks, we reade not. <hi>Clement</hi> therefore and his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, that haue taken vpon them to depose Kings, and haue troden vpon their necks, and raised their subiects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, are rather successors of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> and the Emperors of <hi>Romains,</hi> then of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Eleutherius.</hi>

But the Popes now do not either y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> office of Apostles in going about to teach all nations, or the office of a Bishop in teaching the flock of <hi>Christ,</hi> and gouerning the same according to the Apostles Canons. What do they then? Forsooth, they encourage <hi>Assassins</hi> to murther Princes, and, as <hi>Paule</hi> the fift of late did, graunt Indulgences to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and powdermen to blow vp the King, his Nobles, and Commons assembled in Parliament, and to shead innocent bloud.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Peter</hi> diligently fed the flock of <hi>Christ</hi> according to the charge giuen him by <hi>Christ.</hi> Neither neede we to doubt, but that <hi>Eleutherius</hi> did the same.

               <p>The Popes therefore of late time neither succéed <hi>Peter,</hi> nor <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> nor the ancient Bishops of <hi>Rome.</hi> But if they succéed any, they succéed Pope <hi>Ioane.</hi> Their spirituall fornications and idolatries, their golden cup, wherein they propound their abhominable doctrine to the world, their whorish deceits and frauds, their whorish forhead and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie, their bloudie massacres and crueltie declare them properly to succéed her, and to be of néere affinity to the whore of <hi>Babylon Apocalyp. 17.</hi> This history <hi>Rob.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21479:40"/>
no man can note of partialitie in this behalfe.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Iohn the 8.</hi> or as some number the Popes, <hi>the 7.</hi> was a woman, first <hi>Radulphus Flauiacensis</hi> in his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle doth testifie. This man was a Monke of <hi>Benets</hi> order, and liued about the yeare of our Lord <hi>930.</hi> as <hi>Trithemius</hi> reporteth.</p>
               <p>Secondly <hi>Marianus Scotus</hi> doth report the same. <hi>Anno Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini 854.</hi> saith he, <hi>anno Lotharij 14. successit Leoni Ioannes mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier.</hi> He sheweth also, <hi>that she sate two yeares, fiue moneths, and foure dayes.</hi>

But this doth nothing relieue their credit, but rather blot them both with the infamy of this whoredome, and also with corruption and falsity. Their owne consciences must néedes herein witnesse against them, séeing they know, that these words are found as well in printed bookes, as in ancient manuscript copies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martinus Polonus</hi> our fourth witnesse telleth plainely, <hi>that this woman desguised in mans apparell went with her lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to Athens, proued learned, returned to Rome, was chosen Pope, begotten with child, and deliuered neere S.

               </p>
               <p>The same history is recorded by him that wrote the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nales of <hi>Auspurg anno Domini 855.</hi> he therefore filleth the eleuenth place.</p>

Albert Crantz, Baptista</hi> of <hi>Mantua, Iohn Lucidus, Iohn Stella, Nauclerus in Generat. 29. Iohn Henaldus,</hi> and <hi>Peter Messias in Silua var. lect.</hi> Finally, least any man might forget a matter so memorable, the same report was represented in imagery both in the stréete of <hi>S. Clement at Rome,</hi> and in the Cathedrall Church of <hi>Siena:</hi> and that might haue béen yet sene of euery man, but that <hi>Pius the 5.</hi> ashamed of the lechery and whoredome of his predecessor,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:21479:41"/>
caused the statue of marble representing this Tragicall acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be throwne into <hi>Tiber.</hi> Finally no man euer denyed, or contradicted this report, vntill the time of <hi>Onuphrius</hi> a hungry parasite of the Pope, and a lying Friar, who to win some fauour of the Pope, began first to call this history into question, and desperatly to face out the matter.</p>
               <p>If then <hi>Rob. Parsons</hi> and his consorts had not faces of proofe, they would haue béene ashamed, being but late vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starts, and contemptible fellowes, to haue opposed their bare credits against the authority of so many authenticall and vnpartial witnesses in matters done so long before they came out of the bottomlesse pit. They answere and deuise, what they thinke most fitting to discredit the report, or to help their cause. But all is but like dust cast into the ayre, that falleth on the heads of them that cast it, and blindeth their owne eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parsons pag. 389.</hi> answereth and saith, that albeit some such thing had hapned, <hi>yet it had not preiudicated the Church of Christ.</hi> But had any such thing hapned, then had he no reason so stiffly to deny it. Againe, albeit the Catholike Church be not preiudiced by the intrusion of men or women incapable of Ecclesiasticall function, yet the same would wholy ouerthrow the discent and succession of Romish Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, vpon which the <hi>Romanists</hi> do so much depend. For if heretikes, and men or women, vncapable of Ecclesiasticall function, do thrust into the line of Bishops, then is the line of true Bishops interrupted. But of heretikes <hi>S. Augustine</hi> giueth vs knowledge <hi>epist. 165.</hi> that they may enter among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romish Bishops, where he saith, <hi>What if a traytor in those times should haue crept in?</hi> Of persons incapable, the story of Dame <hi>Ioane</hi> the Pope giueth testimony.</p>
               <p>He correcteth therefore his first answere, and vpon better aduice sayth, that <hi>this whole story of Pope Ioane is a meere fable,</hi> deuised first by <hi>Martinus Polonus</hi> a simple man, that telleth many things by heare-say, and continued by those that fauoured the German Emperours contending against the Pope. And to proue this, he alledgeth first, that <hi>Anasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:21479:42"/>
Audomarus, Luitprandus, Regino, Hermannus Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus, Lambertus Schafnaburgensis, Otho Frisingensis,</hi> and <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spergensis,</hi> after <hi>Leo the 4.</hi> place <hi>Benedict the third,</hi> and next that <hi>William of Malmesbury, Henry Huntington, Roger Houeden, Florentius Vigorniensis,</hi> and <hi>Matthew of Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> make no mention of this woman-pope. And thirdly, that <hi>Alphred</hi> liuing in <hi>Rome</hi> when Pope <hi>Leo</hi> died, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, must needes haue knowne, that one of his owne countrey had beene Pope, if any such matter had then fallen out. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that in ancient manuscript copies of <hi>Marianus Scotus,</hi> and <hi>Sigebertus</hi> this story is not set downe. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> that <hi>Leo the 9.</hi> in the contention betwirt the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constantinople</hi> obiected to <hi>Michael</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that diuers Eunuches, had béene Bishops there, and as is sayd, a woman also, which it is not likely he would haue done, if the same might truly haue béene sayd of the sea of <hi>Rome.</hi> And lastly, that the story con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth diuers improbabilities, and contradictions. But that the story should be fabulous, or a matter feined, it is not like, being recorded in so many histories, and authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call writers. That <hi>Martinus Polonus</hi> did first report this matter no man hath reason to beléeue, séeing the same so plainely set downe in <hi>Radulphus Flauiacensis, Marianus Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and <hi>Sigebertus Gemblacensis. Baronius</hi> sayth, that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianus Scotus</hi> was the first brother of it. Neither was <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Polonus</hi> so simple a fellow, as is pretended, being the Popes penitentiary, and a writer in that kind equall to the best of his ranke. That y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fauourers of the Emperour should brute this matter abrode to defame the Pope, is a méere fiction. For it cannot be shewed, that any Emperour in the contention betwixt the Emperours and the Popes did euer cast out any such matter against the Pope. <hi>Rob. Parsons</hi> his arguments brought forth to proue this history to be a fable, are like his owne head, that is, brutish and blockish. For first it is no good argument to conclude from the authority of two or thrée of the Popes parasites negatiuely, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>they omit a matter tending to the Popes defame, ergo</hi> no such
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:21479:42"/>
matter was done. <hi>Secondly</hi> he alledgeth a counterfet author called <hi>Audomarus.</hi> He may do well to shew, who he was, being neither mentioned by <hi>Baronius</hi> nor <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> where they talke of this matter. <hi>Thirdly</hi> it is ridiculous to inquire of our country writers of matters done at <hi>Rome,</hi> or to thinke that they would speake any thing tending to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the Pope, whose sworne slaues they were. Beside that the author of <hi>Fasciculus temporum</hi> sheweth, that this woman-pope was not forgotten, but of purpose omitted by the writers of histories, because of the slander that might thereof redound to the sea of Rome. <hi>Fourthly</hi> no man can tell, whether <hi>Alphred</hi> knew any such matter, or not. Nay it is not very certaine, that either he, or his father were in <hi>Rome</hi> about the time of Pope <hi>Ioans</hi> deliuery. But had they bene at <hi>Rome</hi> about this time; yet might they well know Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> to be English, although not a woman. <hi>Fiftly</hi> if in ancient manuscript copies of <hi>Marianus Scotus,</hi> and <hi>Sige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Gemblacensis</hi> this history be not found; it is plaine, that the agents of the Romish Church, men infamous for falsitie, haue razed the same out. And that may appeare first by the testimonie of <hi>Fasciculus temporum,</hi> who sheweth the cause of the blotting out of Pope <hi>Ioans</hi> name; next, by anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent manuscript copies; and last, by the testimonie of <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> who maketh <hi>Marianus Scotus</hi> the first deuiser of this matter. So hard is it for lyars and forgers to consent toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Sixthly</hi> it may be a question, whether the letters of <hi>Leo the 9.</hi> to <hi>Michael</hi> be counterfet, or not. But were they written by him, as is reported; yet raylers oftentimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect the same crimes one to another. Finally, there is no such discordance in the circumstances of the history, but that there are farre greater in matters, which the Romanists be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue to be most true. Letters, and names, and places, and times may be easily mistaken, and yet the matter repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted may prooue most true. Likewise it is no strange thing for one person to be called of two places both <hi>Anglicus</hi> and <hi>Maguntinus.</hi> That <hi>Athens</hi> then was a place famous for studie, it may be gathered out of Gréeke histories, no
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21479:43"/>
one writer certes holdeth the contrary.</p>
               <p>The Popes therefore of this time, if they please, may be successors of Pope <hi>Ioane,</hi> whom we haue manifestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated to haue béene Pope, but the successors of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> and other godly ancient Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> they cannot iustly terme themselues.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> That the succession of <hi>Romish</hi> Popes is neither marke of the Church, nor meanes of triall of the truth.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>BEllarmine lib. de not. Eccles. ca. 8.</hi> would gladly haue the succession of the <hi>Romish</hi> Bishops to be a marke of the Church. And <hi>Rob. Parsons</hi> doth estéeme the same a matter <hi>of great importance for triall of true religion,</hi> and prooueth it in the best sort he can <hi>Part. 2. Ch. 1.</hi> How much they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused, these reasons may declare. First the succession of Popes is of no greater force or vertue then the succession of the priests of the law. For from them they borrow diuers titles and prerogatiues. But the high priests of the <hi>Iewes</hi> did oftentimes withstand the Prophets of God, and <hi>Vria</hi> the high priest in the time of <hi>Achaz</hi> as we reade <hi>4. Kings 16.</hi> erected a strange altar in the Temple. Finally, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Christ,</hi> and his Apostles, and all their doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> the Apostles in their time could not trie their religion by the succession of Bishops, nor was succession then a marke of the Church. For neither did the Apostles succéed the high priests, or sacrificers of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> nor as yet had the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> any successor. But the marks and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Church are always the same. Neither can we looke for better triall and proofe of religion, then that which the Apostles had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Paule</hi> wrote his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous epistle vnto it, had no succession of Bishops. Yet was
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:21479:43"/>
it then the true Church. Neither néede we to make que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, but that the same had all conuenient meanes for the triall of truth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The succession of Bishops in the Church of <hi>Antioch, Hierusalem</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> neither was a certaine marke of the Church, nor a meanes to try the truth. And this, I thinke, our aduersaries will not deny. But if they should, it may easily be prooued, for that Ecclesiasticall histories teach vs, that the Bishops of those seas haue fallen into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers grosse heresies, and are now condemned for heretikes by the sea of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The Churches of <hi>Antioch, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> to this day shew the Catalogues of their Bishops. Likewise <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis in Commonit. Cap. 34.</hi> sheweth the successors of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> for diuers ages. Likewise doth <hi>Epiphanius haeres. 34.</hi> shew, who for diuers yeares suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded <hi>Valentinus.</hi> Yet <hi>Parsons</hi> will not grant, that either <hi>Valentinus,</hi> or <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> or their followers were true Catholikes; neither will the Papists confesse, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> of the Churches of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> or the people of <hi>Antioch</hi> or <hi>Alexandria</hi> are the true Church, or that by the succession of their Bishops truth may be tried.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If by succession of Bishops either the Church, or the truth might certeinly be discerned and tried, then could not Bishops erre, or teach peruersely. But histories teach vs, that diuers great Bishops haue grossely erred, as <hi>Liberius,</hi> and <hi>Honorius the first</hi> in <hi>Rome, Macedonius</hi> and <hi>Nestorius</hi> in <hi>Constantinople.</hi> And this the Apostle speaking to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops assembled at <hi>Miletus, Act. 20.</hi> doth clearely shew. <hi>Of your owne selues</hi> saith he, <hi>shall men arise, speaking peruerse things to draw disciples after them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally the aduersaries themselues sometimes confesse, that succession is no certaine marke of the Church. <hi>Lyra</hi> in his postill vpon the 16. <hi>of Matth.</hi> sayth, <hi>that the chiefe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops haue bene found to haue departed from the faith.</hi> But what triall is to be had by succession, if Bishops may depart from the faith? <hi>Bellarmine de not is Eccles. ca. 8.</hi> sayth, that we
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21479:44"/>
cannot conclude necessarily, that the Church is there, where is succession of Bishops. <hi>Non colligitur necessariò,</hi> sayth he, <hi>ibi esse Ecclesiam, vbi est successio.</hi> But were they resolued to stand vpon this succession, yet would the same draw with it the ruine of the Popes cause. For neuer shall they be able to shew a number of Bishops professing or holding the doctrine of the Popes Decretals, and of the late conuenticles of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran, Constance, Florence</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> vntill of late yeares.</p>
               <p>But, saith <hi>Parsons Part. 2. Ch. 1. Augustine was held in the Church by the succession of Bishops.</hi> And <hi>Tertullian de Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script. aduers. haeretic. doth challenge heretikes to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat of succession.</hi> And <hi>Irenaeus</hi> proueth <hi>by the succession of Roman Bishops the true succession, and continuation of one and the selfe same Catholike faith.</hi> Likewise hée alledgeth <hi>Hierome,</hi> who in his Dialogue against the <hi>Luciferians</hi> saith, <hi>We are to abide in that Church, which being founded by the Apostles, doth indure to this day:</hi> And <hi>Augustine lib de Vtil. credend. ca. 17.</hi> that sheweth how we are not to doubt to rest in the lap of that Church, <hi>which notwithstanding the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of heretikes about it, by successions of Bishops from the Apostles seate, hath obteined the height of authority.</hi> Finally he telleth vs <hi>Pag. 283. how 70. Archbishops of Canterbury were all of one religion.</hi> But first we must vnderstand, that the ancient Fathers talking of succession, neuer speake of the externall place, and bare succession of Bishops without respect to the truth of doctrine. <hi>Irenaeus lib. 4. Ch. 43.</hi> would haue those Bishops harkned vnto, which succeede the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, <hi>which with the succession of their Bishoprick haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the certaine gift of truth, according to the will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Tertullian lib. de Praescript. aduers. haeret.</hi> sheweth, <hi>that the persons are to be approued by their faith, and not faith by the persons. Non habent haereditatem Petri,</hi> saith <hi>Ambrose lib. 1. de Poenit. cap. 6. quifidem Petrinon habent.</hi> That is, <hi>they haue not right to succeed Peter, or Peters inheritance, that hold not the faith of Peter. Nazianzen de laudib. Athanasij,</hi> saith, <hi>that they are partakers of the same chaire, or succession, that hold the same doctrine, as they that hold contrary doctrine, are to be

Augustine contr. epist. funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. c. 4.</hi> reckneth diuers things ioyntly with the succession of Bishops, which reteined him in the Church, and among the rest <hi>sincerissimam sapientiam,</hi> the sincere wisdome of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian doctrine. But <hi>Parsons</hi> must proue, that the succession of Bishops only is a sufficient argument of truth. Likewise <hi>Augustine</hi> in his booke <hi>de Vtilit. credendi. ca. 17.</hi> talketh not of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, but of the Catholike Church, whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority notwithstanding he placeth after the primary foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Scriptures. Likewise <hi>Hierome</hi> speaketh of the Catholike Church, &amp; not of the particular Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Finally, neuer shal it be proued, nor is it likely, the later Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> before the reuerend Father &amp; most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Martyr Bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> receiuing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new Decretals of the Pope, &amp; the decrées of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conuenticles of <hi>Lateran, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> and <hi>Florence,</hi> but that their faith differd much fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the

first Bishops of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which liued before the times of these conuenticles, that authorized these new corruptions. If then <hi>Rob.

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> That the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the true Church of God, and holdeth the Apostolike and Catholike faith.</head>
               <p>AS <hi>Esau</hi> hated <hi>Iacob</hi> because of his fathers blessings, as we reade <hi>Gen. 27.</hi> so <hi>Rob. Parsons,</hi> the more it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God our heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly Father to blesse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of <hi>England,</hi> the more hatred doth he shew against his countrymen and brethren. In the first part of his treatise of <hi>Three Conuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> he endeuoureth to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> slaues to the Pope. In the second he raileth at them, as <hi>vagrant persons,</hi> and <hi>strangers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods Church,</hi> and people without succession of teachers from the Apostles, and deuoid, as he saith, <hi>of all demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and euidences, to proue themselues to be Christes Church.</hi> But if those be Gods true Church, which heare his word with attention, and beléeue it, and receiue the Sacraments according to Christs institution, and séeke to worship God with true deuotion, and to liue after their Christian profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; then is the Church of <hi>England</hi> Gods true Church. For although <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others do spend much time in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king exceptions against our doctrine, practise in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and manners; yet can none of them either proue any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in the doctrine which we teach, or the administration of Sacraments which we practise, or in the rules concerning Gods worship or common manners, which we follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> those Christians which professe and beléeue all the Apostolike faith, and condemne all those errors and false doctrines, which the Apostles condemned, and endeuour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feinedly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:21479:45"/>
to liue according to their profession, are the true Church. For that is a property of <hi>Christes</hi> shéep to heare his voice, &amp; not to follow strangers, as we reade <hi>Iohn. 10.</hi> The Apostle also sheweth <hi>Ephes. 2.</hi> that the faithfull are built vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> being the chiefe corner stone. But the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> beléeueth and professeth all the Apostles faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth whatsoeuer is contrary to the same. Neither can the aduersary iustly charge vs, that we allow any false worship of God, or breach of his holy ordonances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> for matters of Faith, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, Gods worship and seruice, beléeueth &amp; followeth whatsoeuer is either expressely commanded in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or out of them deduced in ancient generall and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Councels, condemning also whatsoeuer is by ancient Councels or Fathers declared to be contrary to the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, Christes true Church is a diligent and wary kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of doctrines committed to her, and changeth nothing at any time, deminisheth nothing, addeth nothing, cutteth not off things necessary, nor addeth things superfluous, looseth not her owne, nor vsurpeth things belonging to others,</hi> as saith <hi>Lirmensis Commonit. ca. 32.</hi> Likewise <hi>ca. 34.</hi> he saith, it is the property of Catholikes, <hi>to keepe the doctrine of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers committed to them in trust, and to condemne prophane nouelties.</hi> Who can then deny the name of Catholikes vnto vs, but such as are false Catholikes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly,</hi> all Churches, that belong to <hi>Christes</hi> body, which is gathered and gouerned by his word, nourished and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued by his holy Sacraments, and inspired and led by his holy spirit and grace, belong to <hi>Christes</hi> Catholike Church. But nothing can be alledged by the aduersaries, but that these properties belong to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the members thereof, and those which communicate with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth in all things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the Catholike &amp; Apostolike Church that is spred ouer all nations, &amp; hath continued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning, &amp; shall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue to the end, &amp; which hath a most certaine succession of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21479:46"/>
true Bishops, which adhereth to <hi>Christ</hi> only, &amp; to his word, and whose faith is confirmed with miracles, and most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible testimonies. If <hi>Parsons</hi> will deny this, let him cease his railing against vs, and his vaine babling about imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent matters, and forbeare to impute vnto vs the names of factions, which we renounce, and the faults of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which we defend not, &amp; proue somewhat substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tially.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seuenthly</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> is iustified by the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our aduersaries: for with them we professe one faith in all articles conteined in ancient Creedes, with them we receiue the same Scriptures, with them we allow the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Eucharist, &amp; Baptisme, with them we admit the most ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t generall Councels: and finally, whatsoeuer was deliuered by the Apostles to be obserued, that we obserue. What is then the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? Forsooth, they haue added to the Apostles faith, to Christes Sacraments, Scriptures, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolike doctrine &amp; lawes: and that we refuse, for that it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, and beside, yea sometime contrary to the Canon of Scriptures, which is the perfect rule of faith. Unlesse therfore our aduersaries will stubbornly reiect the Apostolike faith, the canon of Scriptures, the Sacraments, and the ancient formes of Ecclesiastical gouernment, &amp; condemne the same, they cannot deny y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Church of <hi>England</hi> to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true Church. Finally, all those exceptions, which either <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow,</hi> or <hi>Stapleton,</hi> or <hi>Hill,</hi> or any of their consorts haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our doctrine or manners, are cleared, &amp; so answered, that still the aduersary, though neuer so full of words, resteth si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced. <hi>Parsons</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> second part of his treatise of <hi>Three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersions of England</hi> by him pretended, goeth about to shew, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is no part of the Church vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersally dispersed, and that hath continued throughout all ages. But his arguments are so vaine, that I make this an argument to iustifie the cause of our Church. For if he and his consorts can take no iust exception either to the faith, or manners of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> then doth it follow, that the same is the true Church of <hi>Christ, Et inimici nostri iudices,</hi> and <hi>our enemies therein iudge against themselues.</hi>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XI. Parsons</hi> his idle discourse Part. 2. of his Treatise, wherein he pretendeth to seeke for the originall and discent of the Church of <hi>England</hi> from the Apostles times downward, is examined &amp; refuted.</head>
               <p>IT is a simple part, according to the common prouerbe, in the midst of a riuer to aske, where is water; or in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of trées, to enquire for wood. Yet <hi>Parsons</hi> séemeth not much wiser, who in the Scriptures and writings of ancient Fathers euery where finding the Apostolike and Catholike Church, with the which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of <hi>England</hi> holdeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, doth notwithstanding still enquire, where our Church was in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles time, &amp; the ages after. But it séemeth, he was vnwilling to sée, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he was loth to find. His search certes, and manner of procéeding, and whole dispute about this matter as it is tedious, and full of words, so it is fond, foolish, and void of substance and concludent argument.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>2. Part</hi> of his turning Treatise <hi>chap. 1.</hi> he alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth diuers testimonies out of <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Hierome,</hi> and <hi>Augustine,</hi> concerning the succession of Bishops, and the force thereof. But what (I pray you) doth that make against vs, who do well allow of that faith, which was taught and maintained by those Bishops succeeding one another in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Churches, which they mention? Nay, if <hi>Parsons</hi> talked of no other faith or doctrine, then that which those holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers speake of, and did not hide in this catalogue of good Bishops, a multitude of false teachers, and Heretikes much vnlike to the former; the controuersie betwixt vs wold soone be ended. Furthermore, where he will not allow them to be the true Church; which in all points of faith consent with the Apostles and ancient Fathers, and disagrée in nothing, but will néeds exact a discent of our faith by a catalogue of Bishops; we want not therein an answer sufficient. For the Bishops of <hi>Britaine</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> that haue continued since the first plantation of Religion, by <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathaea,</hi> and other Apostolike men haue still retained the Apostolike faith, and the Sacraments instituted by Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:21479:47"/>
True it is, they retained them, but yet with many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, although nothing so many, as are now establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> since the wicked conuenticle of <hi>Trent.</hi> Although then the Church of <hi>England</hi> haue purged away certaine abuses: yet the substance of doctrine, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments we haue not changed, therein varying in nothing from the Apostles, or auncient Bishops of <hi>Christs</hi> Church for many hundred yeares after <hi>Christ.</hi> But the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> and their adherents within these fiue hundred yeares haue brought in a new Scholasticall &amp; Decretaline doctrin, especially since the conuenticle of <hi>Trent,</hi> which neither the Apostles nor auncient Bishops euer knew, nay which is opposite to their doctrine and faith. It appeareth therefore, that this argument of succession doth rather make for vs, then for our aduersaries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> he beareth vs in hand, that <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> being pressed with this argument of Succession, did make the Church inuisible. And that <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and the <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgians</hi> dissenting from them, and ouercome with proofes concerning the visibilitie of the Church, did grant it to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, yet so, as it did consist not in the externall conspicuous succession of Bishops, and Councels, but rather in those, which following the Apostolike Church and faith kept themselues from common corruptions of others. But not they did dissent, but <hi>Parsons</hi> doth either mistake or misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. For all of vs do affirme, that the vniuersall Catholike Church is inuisible, because it containeth all the members of <hi>Christs</hi> Church of all times and all ages. Likewise all of vs beléeue, that particular Churches are alwaies visible, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit not so, that euery one is able to discerne, which is the true Church, which not. For that is a matter of reason and discourse, and not of sense, and that being true, all heretikes and infidels would discerne, which is the true Church, and cease to persecute it. Likewise we say, that the true Church is not alwaies in peace and prosperitie. Nay, oftentimes the same is persecuted, and driuen to hide it selfe as it did in the Apostles time, and during the times of the first persecutions
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:21479:47"/>
vntill the raigne of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and as the Scriptures do foretell it, should do in the persecution vnder the raigne of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> Ridiculously therfore doth he alledge Scriptures and Fathers speaking of the visible Church. For they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther speake of the Catholike Church, as it comprehendeth all Christians, nor of the glorie of the Church in all times. He doth also proclaime either his owneignorance, not set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe, what we hold, nor knowing how we distïn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, or else impudently misreporteth our doctrine, that he might thereby take some occasion the rather to stander it, and to cauill with his aduersaries. Finally, he doth leudly and contumeliously speake of <hi>Christs</hi> Church, hiding it selfe in time of persecution, tearming it <hi>A companie of few, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, and contemptible people lurking from time to time in shadowes and darknesse, and knowne to few or none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 294.</hi> he cauilleth at <hi>M. Foxes</hi> words, where he saith, that commonly none see it, but such onely as be members and partakers thereof. For his meaning is, that none can see it to be the true Church, but such as are members thereof. Although all those, that persecute it, do see the men, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Church. His similitude also of the truth, and true Church agréeth well. For albeit men be visible; yet this point, <hi>Which is the true Church,</hi> is not a matter of sense, but of the vnderstanding, and the Church, as it is <hi>Christs</hi> body, is mysticall, albeit it consist of visible men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Part. 2. cap. 2.</hi> he telleth vs, <hi>How the Montanists and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionists bragged of martyrdome,</hi> and how <hi>Cyprian</hi> inueigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth against the Martyrs of the <hi>Nouatians,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> against those of the <hi>Euphemites,</hi> and how <hi>S. Augustine</hi> dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the Martyrs of the <hi>Donatists.</hi> But to what purpose, God knoweth, vnlesse he would either put vs in mind of the false traiterous Massepriests and <hi>Iebusites,</hi> that being put to death in <hi>England</hi> for felonie and treason, as in the end, the secular Priests themselues confesse, are calendred in the <hi>Romish</hi> Churches tables for Martyrs, or else to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace those godly Martyrs by this vngodly comparison, that suffered death for the testimonie of truth in <hi>Q. Maries</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:21479:48"/>
bloudie raigne. Which if he do, then he is as farre guiltie of their bloud, as the wolues that shed it, and is rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the vengeance of God, then any answer from man.</p>
               <p>In the same Chapter he endeuoureth to shew some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences bewixt the Martyrs of the primitiue Church, and vs, as for example, that <hi>Saint Andrew sacrificed daily an imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate lambe vpon the altar.</hi> That <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> is said to <hi>offer sacrifice,</hi> and <hi>Laurence</hi> his Deacon to <hi>dispence the Lords bloud,</hi> and that, as <hi>Prudentius</hi> saith, <hi>The holy bloud did fume in siluer cuppes.</hi> That <hi>Cyprian</hi> said, <hi>Sacerdotem vice Christi fungi, &amp; sacrificium Deo Patri offerre.</hi> But <hi>first</hi> the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, if any be, is in termes, and not in matters of faith. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we do not disallow these termes simply, if they be rightly vnderstood, as the auncient Fathers meant them. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the words of <hi>S. Andrew</hi> are drawne out of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend. Bernard in Serm. de S. Andrea</hi> is quoted for them, yet in neither of his Sermons hath he them. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the words of <hi>Prudentius</hi> must néedes be vnderstood figuratiuely, vnlesse they will haue their sacrifice to be bloudie. <hi>Lastly,</hi> these words do make more for vs, then for the Papists. For that sacrifice, which <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> do speake of (for here I will take no exception to the words of <hi>Andrewes</hi> Legend) doth signifie onely the representation of <hi>Christs</hi> sacrifice in bread and wine. <hi>Cyprian. lib. 2. Epist. 3.</hi> by the sacrifice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth bread and wine, and not <hi>Christs</hi> body and bloud really present. <hi>Panem &amp; calicem mixtum vino,</hi> saith he, <hi>obtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit.</hi> And againe: <hi>Sed &amp; per Salomonem Spiritus sanctus typum Dominici sacrificy praemonstrat immolatae hostiae panis &amp; vini, sed &amp; altaris &amp; Apostolorum facit mentionem.</hi> Furthermore, the same shew, that the Deacons did then distribute the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords cuppe to the people: which Papists now admit not. Lastly, <hi>Sixtus</hi> suffering for the confession of <hi>Christ</hi> is liker to Bishop <hi>Ridley,</hi> then to the triple-crowned Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> who suffereth not, but rather persecuteth such Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, as professe <hi>Christ.</hi> The reall sacrifice of <hi>Christs</hi> body and bloud offered for quicke and dead, out of these words cannot be proued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:21479:48"/>
Afterward he telleth vs <hi>p. 310.</hi> how <hi>Constantine</hi> built foure Churches in <hi>Rome,</hi> dedicating them to our Sauiour, to <hi>Saint Iohn Baptist, S. Peter, S. Paule,</hi> and <hi>S. Laurence, ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them with Images, &amp;c.</hi> And hauing told his tale, he run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth out into a discourse of the glorie of that Church, and in great pride asketh vs, where our poore, obscure, and troden downe Church, as he calleth it, was at this time, and for 300. yeares before. But vpon such small victories, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himselfe a vaine fellow, to make such triumphes. This tale of <hi>foure Churches dedicated to Saints, and adorned with Images,</hi> is borrowed out of the Legend, and is repugnant to the Fathers doctrine. <hi>Lactantius</hi> saith, <hi>There is no religion, where there is an Image or simulachrum. Saint Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>that temples are not erected to Saints, but that their memories are there honored.</hi> The same Father <hi>lib. de vera Relig. cap. 55.</hi> speaketh both against Images, and religious worship of Saints. <hi>Non sit nobis religio humanorum operum cultus.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Non sit nobis Religio cultus hominum mortuorum.</hi> As for the spreading and splendor of <hi>Christs</hi> Church in <hi>Constantines</hi> time, the same argueth, that the Church is gouerned and beautified by godly Princes, such as <hi>Constantine</hi> was, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then by godlesse Popes, such as <hi>Clement</hi> was. To his question I answer, that the Church in <hi>Constantines</hi> time was that Church, with the which in faith and Sacraments we communicate, and from which the <hi>Romanists</hi> are depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, subiecting themselues, not to such godly Princes, as <hi>Constantine</hi> was, but to the Pope, and to his vngodly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaline and prophane schoole doctrine, which is diuers from the faith of those times, as (God willing) we shall shew anone. They do also come nearer to the old Heretikes <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> the <hi>Gnostickes, Marcionists, Valentinians, Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> and the rest mentioned by <hi>Parsons pag. 312.</hi> then we. To the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> that suffered martyrdome, the Popes are as like, as <hi>Nero</hi> to <hi>Saint Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 314.</hi> and in the pages following he chargeth vs with holding some heresies condemned in the primitiue Church, <hi>As of the false Apostles, that beleeued onely faith to be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:21479:49"/>
to saluation without workes,</hi> of the Heretikes mentioned by <hi>Ignatius apud Theodoretum Dial. 3. Who did not confesse, that the Eucharist was the flesh of our Sauiour Christ; of the Nouatians, that did not annoint those, which were baptized by them, nor receiue the Sacrament of Confirmation, nor graunt Priests power to absolue from sinne; and of the Manichees, that denyed mans Free-will.</hi> But these obiections are nothing, but either calumniations, or méere cauils. For first we do not hold, that a bare and solitarie faith deuoid of workes doth iustifie, as those false Apostles did, against whom <hi>S. Iames, S. Peter,</hi> and others do inueigh, and as the Papists in effect do, which make euery wicked man professing their faith, and receiuing their Sacraments a true member of <hi>Christs</hi> bodie, and absoluing hand ouer head all, that come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. Secondly we do not deny the <hi>Eucharist</hi> to be <hi>Christs</hi> flesh sacramentally. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we do not refuse absolution to the penitent, as did the <hi>Nouatians,</hi> nor was <hi>Nouatus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for denying <hi>Confirmation</hi> to be a Sacrament, (for neither the name, nor thing was then in vse in the Church) but rather for neglecting a ceremonie then vsed. <hi>Finally,</hi> we do not denie, that man sinneth voluntarily, as did the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees,</hi> but onely that he hath not fréedome of will, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may discerne, and do workes tending to the attaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the kingdome of heauen, as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> directly, and Papists after a sort do teach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 318.</hi> and <hi>319.</hi> he saith, that <hi>Origen and other Fathers do inuocate Angels, and Saints, and are therefore condemned of the Magdeburgians Centur. 3.</hi> But first the words of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen homil. 1. in Ezechielem,</hi> and of other Fathers may be so expounded, as that they rather sound an affection, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, and a Rhetoricall Apostrophe or turning of their speech to the Saints and Angels, then a set forme of prayer. <hi>Secondly,</hi> diuers bookes cited for proofe of this point seeme either to be bastards, or else corrupted by falsaries. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it is an absurd conceit, to attribute that, which is haroly to be prooued of one or two Fathers, to all the rest, that speake so much against the same. <hi>Finally,</hi> there is great difference
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21479:49"/>
betwixt the words of the Fathers, and of the moderne <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiaries, Missals,</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> directly framed in honor of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints, as we shall shew (God willing) when we come to speake of that controuersie.</p>
               <p>Unlesse therefore <hi>Rob. Parsons</hi> can find better arguments, he shall not proue, that the Church for 300. yeares after <hi>Christ,</hi> did dissent from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in matters of faith and Sacraments. The like we may affirme of the next 300. yeares, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Constantine</hi> to <hi>Gregorie</hi> the first. And that shall appeare by the simple arguments, that he bringeth to proue a difference betwixt vs and the Church of those times. The <hi>Donatists</hi> (saith he) <hi>p. 329. said, that they were the onely Church, and called the succession of Bishops in the Church of Rome, the chaire of pestilence.</hi> He telleth vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>how Saint Augustine, Optatus, and others, obiect against them, that they cast the blessed Sacrament of the altar to dogs, ouerthrew altars, broke Chalices and sold them, cast a bottle of Chrisme out of the Church window, shaued Priests heads to take away their vnction, turned Nunnes out of their monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the world, polluted all Church stuffe.</hi> But what is all this to vs, that neither take vpon vs to be the only Church, as the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Donatists</hi> do: nor call the ancient Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> or their chaire, the <hi>chaire of pestilence?</hi> The Popes chaire we confesse is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chaire of pestilence, but Popes are no Bishops, but the heads of <hi>Antichrists</hi> kingdome. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, God forbid, that any of vs should throw the <hi>Eucharist</hi> to dogs, or breake Communion tables, or else abuse Gods Ministers, or any thing dedicated to holy vses. But our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers do commonly shaue priests heads, and not seldome do priests and Friars dishonest Nunnes, and make litle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of their owne Church stuffe. <hi>Parsons</hi> therefore to make some shew, as if we did agree with the <hi>Donatists,</hi> and himselfe and his conforts not, doth grossely belye <hi>Augustine,</hi> who hath litle or nothing of that, which he is made to say; and leudly salsifie <hi>Optatus.</hi> For he doth not once name the <hi>Sacrament of the altar, but the Eucharist:</hi> nor speake of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries,</hi> but onely of women professing chastitie, which he
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:21479:50"/>
calleth <hi>Castimoniales.</hi> But such at that time liued without Monasteries, and were vnlike to Nunnes. Likewise the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars of <hi>Christians</hi> then were of wood: and this Chrisme was reserued for extraordinarie vses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 330.</hi> and <hi>331.</hi> he chargeth vs to hold with the <hi>Euno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians,</hi> and <hi>Nouatians, Aerians, Iouinian, Heluidius,</hi> and <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantius.</hi> But first we do not say with <hi>Eunomius,</hi> that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of sinnes doth not hurt a man, so he haue faith. Nor do we say, that he that is a true and faithfull Christian, will commit grieuous sinnes. Nor did <hi>Eunomius</hi> talke of the true Christian faith, but of his owne faith. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we do not deny power to Priests to reconcile penitent sinners, as did the <hi>Nouatians,</hi> or after a sort to forgiue sinnes, that is, by Gods word to loose sinners, and to declare their sinnes forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Thirdly, <hi>Aerius</hi> was condemned for <hi>Arianisme,</hi> which we detest. He had also priuate opinions concerning set fasts, which our Church liketh not. <hi>Lastly,</hi> he condemned the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the auncient Church, that vsed to make a commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the dead, and to giue thankes for them in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Eucharist: whose doings, as we will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, so their practise for manifold abuses brought in by Masse priests and Friars we are not bound to follow, euery Church hauing libertie herein to edification. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> we admit not <hi>Iouinians</hi> heresie of equality of sinnes, neither was <hi>Iouinian</hi> condemned either for saying, that euery transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the law was mortall sinne in his owne nature, or for teaching the abuses of Monkish life and profession, as we do. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> we do not with <hi>Heluidius</hi> oppugne the perpetuall virginitic of the blessed Uirgin, nor in all respects equall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with virginitie, nor was he to be condemned, if in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of <hi>merit</hi> of eternall life, he equalled mariage with bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie. <hi>Finally,</hi> neither was <hi>Vigilantius</hi> to be condemned in speaking against the superstitious worship of dead mens bones, nay sometime of the bones of other creatures, or the abuse of burning tapers and candles at noone day, nor did <hi>Hierome,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wrote against him allow inuocation of Saints, or the filthy and swinish life of Monkes, that we condemne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:21479:50"/>
To make some shew, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> from <hi>Constantine</hi> to <hi>Maurice</hi> the Emperor, and <hi>Gregorie</hi> the first, <note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 333. and pages following</note> he alledgeth first, that <hi>M. Foxe</hi> speaketh nothing of these thrée ages, nor of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, that then flourished in the East or West Church, and in <hi>Britaine</hi> it selfe, or of their doctrine. And all this he supposeth to haue bene omitted, because it made much against him, and nothing for him. Otherwise he thinketh, he would haue set downe somewhat, vndertaking to set foorth at large the whole race &amp; course of the Church from <hi>Christ</hi> to our times. Next he saith, that the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> in their fourth, fift, and sixt Centuries speaking much of the Doctors of the thrée ages from <hi>Constantine</hi> downward, find nothing for themselues, but rather against themselues: as for example in the matter of <hi>Free-will,</hi> where they say in the <hi>4. Centur. c. 4.</hi> that almost all the Doctors of that age <hi>speake confusedly, and against the manifest testimonies of Scripture,</hi> and in the Paragraffe of <hi>repentance,</hi> where they say, it is handled by the Doctors of this 4. age <hi>thinly and coldly.</hi> And likewise in the matter of the <hi>reall presence,</hi> where they cite the Fathers abundantly, saue in the matter of the sacrifice, where they reprehend them: and finally, in the controuersie of <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes, satisfaction, inuocation of Saints,</hi> and concerning ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, where they reprehend the Fathers. But all this brabblement about <hi>M. Foxe,</hi> and the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> is to no purpose. For first, what if either they should haue omitted, or spoken any thing, which they should not? It is a vaine thing to imagine, that all this should be imputed to vs. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the reason why <hi>M. Foxe</hi> speaketh so litle of the <hi>4. 5. and 6. ages,</hi> and of the Fathers then flourishing was, for that we acknowledge that faith, which was then professed, and adioyne ourselues to that Church. What then needed any long discourse to deduce our Church throughout those ages, when the same is euery where apparent in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of that age, whose faith, if we might haue restored without the leauen of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> lately brought in, the controuersie betwixt vs and our aduersaries would
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21479:51"/>
soone be ended. Furthermore, it was not his purpose to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle controuersies: and therefore no maruell, if in euery que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion he did not set downe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sentences of the Fathers. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> do in some points concerning <hi>free-wil, repentance, the sacrifice, good-works, inuocation of Saints,</hi> and such like, mislike some of the Fathers. But he is a very sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ideot, that therefore would conclude, that they ioyne with the Papists in their moderne heresies. Likewise they alledge the Fathers for proofe of a certaine reall presence. But it is not that corporall and carnall presence of the body and bloud of <hi>Christ,</hi> of which the Papists dreame. <hi>Finally,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit in some small things the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> taxe some one or two of the Fathers, or rather those authors, which haue published counterfeit books vnder the name of the Fathers: yet in the matters of greatest moment they shew the true Fathers to make, for vs. And that shall be made good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Rob. Parsons,</hi> if leauing his bangling about these small aduantages, he list to deale with vs in any substantial point of controuersie.</p>
               <p>In the 4. chapter of his second part, and diuers chapters following, he handleth the discent of times from <hi>Gregorie</hi> the first, vnto the preaching of <hi>Iohn Wicleffe,</hi> and therein spendeth much vaine talke to small purpose. For although in those times the tyranny of the Pope increased, and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish life began to be in request, and the worship of Images, and Saints departed, together with diuers friuolous cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, by litle and litle entred, and Priests were separated by the Popes practises from their lawful wiues: yet the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Christian Religion remained still in the Church of <hi>England</hi> all this while, and the corruptions, that then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to enter, were nothing in comparison of that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed afterward, nor generally receiued. In those times neither was the Pope accounted the head or spouse of the Uniuersall Church, nor did he vndertake to depose Kings before <hi>Gregorie the 7.</hi> or to ouerrule all Churches. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>England</hi> tooke not themselues to be subiect vnto the Pope vnder paine of damnation, nor did he much encroch
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:21479:51"/>
vpon them before the times of <hi>Henry</hi> the second King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> The doctrine of the carnall reall presence, of transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, of the sacrifice of Christs bodie and bloud in the Masse, of worshipping the Sacrament with <hi>Latria,</hi> and of Images with the same worship, that is due to the Original, of the seuen Sacraments, and of the degrées of merits of workes, and workes of supererogation, of the force of frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will in iustification, of the Popes two swords, and superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ouer generall Councels, and his power in Purgatory, and in granting Indulgences and such like, was not then knowne in <hi>England,</hi> but was deuised afterward by schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Canonists, and established by the Popes Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and wicked conuenticles assembled by their comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. Nay albeit the Popes by all meanes sought to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due <hi>Christian</hi> Kings, and to bring all Ecclesiasticall prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to their owne disposition, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> the Priests of their wiues: yet could they not do this, but in long time, and after great contradiction of many. Of this discourse then two things may be gathered direct against <hi>Rob. Parsons</hi> his cause. The first is, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> from the time of <hi>Gregorie the first</hi> to <hi>Alexander the thirds</hi> time, was not subiect to the Pope, nor had receiued the wicked and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable doctrine contained in the Popes late Decretals, and deuised in the Conuenticles of <hi>Lateran, Constance, Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Trent,</hi> and published in the prophane disputes of schoolemen. The second is, that the tyrannie of the Pope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning first in <hi>Alexander</hi> the thirds time to be felt in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> increased by litle and litle vntill King <hi>Henry the eight</hi> his raigne, and that the greatest corruptions of popish do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine entred into <hi>England</hi> after his time. Of which two points we may conclude, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> from the time of <hi>Austin</hi> vntill the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, in fundamentall matters of faith did communicate with vs, and not with the moderne Papists, whose principall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions haue entred since.</p>
               <p>In the 9. 10. 11. and 12. Chapters he quarrelleth with <hi>Master Foxe,</hi> for building the Church vpon <hi>M. Wicleffe,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21479:52"/>
Sir Iohn Old-castle, Husse, M. Luther, M. Caluin, Zuinglius, and others, holding,</hi> as he saith, <hi>many dangerous points of doctrine, and differing from themselues &amp; from vs, and many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> noted of diuers great crimes.</hi> But while he quarelleth with others, he bewrayeth his owne grosse ignorance. For it is not <hi>Master Foxes</hi> meaning to frame a new Church of <hi>Christ</hi> from <hi>Master Wicleffes</hi> time downeward, or to affirme, that there was no Church in the world for certaine ages before <hi>Wicleffe:</hi> but rather to shew, that the Church in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and by little and little being corrupted since the time of the Fathers, by the pride and false doctrine of the Popes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan much to degenerate in the adherents of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Which <hi>Wicleffe</hi> and his followers in <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Valdenses</hi> and <hi>Albigenses</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and some in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie</hi> beganne at length to discouer. But in our times the same by <hi>Luther, Caluin, Zuinglius,</hi> and other godly men was both more openly discouered, and Christianly refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is no maruell, if <hi>Wicleffe,</hi> and <hi>Husse,</hi> and others, that first beganne to discouer the abuses of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, did not see all. For God had appointed a certaine time, when the man of sinne should be reuealed; and no man is so cleare sighted, that he can see into all the abuses of Heretikes, without helpe and direction of many. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this to be ascribed more vnto <hi>Wicleffe,</hi> and such, as haue laboured in the reformation of the Church, then to others, which haue their singular opinions, and by their errors declare themselues to be men. Furthermore, by this we collect, that we are to build our faith vpon none, but the Apostles and Prophets, which by speciall dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the holy Ghost haue declared vnto vs the will of God. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> many heresies are falsly imputed both vnto <hi>Wicleffe,</hi> and vnto <hi>Iohn Husse,</hi> and vnto euery one, that hath opposed himselfe against the <hi>Romish</hi> faction. As for example, they say that <hi>Wicleffe</hi> taught, <hi>That God must obey the Diuell,</hi> and that <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> added a fourth <hi>Person to the Trinitie,</hi> matters contrarie to the whole forme of their doctrine. Diuers errors also they haue
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:21479:52"/>
ascribed to the <hi>Valdenses, Albigenses,</hi> and <hi>Bohemians.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may we maruell, if they haue slandered the dead, seeing they spare not the liuing, making their credulous followers beleeue, <hi>That we make God the author of sinne,</hi> and <hi>speake vnreuerently of Christ.</hi> They haue also laid most false impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations vpon <hi>Luther, Caluin, Zuinglius,</hi> and other our tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. Further, we are not to maruell, if they haue char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Sir Iohn Oldcastle,</hi> and diuers others the followers of <hi>Wicleffes</hi> doctrine with treasons, and rebellions, and other enormous crimes. For so did the heathen deale with the first Christians, as appeareth by the Apologies of <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, Arnobius,</hi> and others. And now they cease not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime against our doctrine, as if the same were enemie to the Magistrates authoritie: the which is not more troden vnder foot by any, then by the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the Papists themselues haue many singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar opinions in diuers points of doctrine. Why then should they impute vnto vs the dissentions of priuate men? And why may not all be good Christians, holding the substantial points of Christian faith, and varying in nothing from the grounds of true doctrine concerning the holy Trinitie, Christs incarnation, the Sacraments, Gods worship, and manners? Finally, as errors did not altogether enter into the Church, so neither can they be all at one time, and by one man, or one age reformed. In all the principall points concerning the abuses of Poperie, both the Churches of <hi>England, Scotland, France, Germany,</hi> and other nations not subiect to the yoke of <hi>Antichrist</hi> do very well agree. And we doubt not, by the grace of God, to sée <hi>Antichrist</hi> confounded with the spirit of Gods mouth shortly, by a generall vnion in the rest.</p>
               <p>Finally, in his last chapter he compareth <hi>M. Foxe</hi> to a craftie Broker, that vseth fraud in selling of his wares, whereas the <hi>Romanists</hi> sell like royall Merchants. He deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth also to his reader three differences betwixt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists &amp; vs, saying, first, <hi>That we contemne the Church,</hi> &amp; next, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we <hi>define it falsly,</hi> &amp; thirdly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we <hi>assigne common &amp; obscure
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:21479:53"/>
markes thereof,</hi> whereas the Papistes do all contrarie. But of this comparison, because it is his owne, he may boldly take both parts to himselfe, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iust cause. For as the Pope selleth Religion, and all diuine matters in grosse, and like a royall Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant: so <hi>Parsons</hi> and such like pedlars and palterers fell, as they may, by retayle, now bargaining for one part of the Church, then for another: now selling one sinne and then another. In assigning his differences, he differeth not from himselfe, but as alwayes, so now also he belyeth his aduersaries. For neither do we make so litle estimation of the Church, as he reporteth, nor do we giue such a definition of the Church as he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, nor are our markes giuen out of the Church, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther common, or improper. On the other side they value not the Church one rush, making the same a slaue to Antichrist: nor do they define the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, not touching the life and soule of it, but onely certaine outward qualities: nor do they bring other markes then those, that may fit the Pagans and Turks better then the Papists, as the name Catholike, vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality, continuance, succession, vnitie, prosperitie, and such like do shew. If <hi>Parsons</hi> will maintaine the contrarie, let him answer a booke of mine <hi>De Ecclesia,</hi> written against <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> wherein this is declared at large. If not that; yet let him leaue his idle wandring discourse, and come to a point: and then we doubt not but to make his ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie ware knowne. And thus an end of this woodden constables search. Of which we may conclude, that it will be a hard matter to find out a more idle searcher, or foolish search.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> That the Church of moderne Papists was not visible in the world for more then a thousand yeares after <hi>Christ,</hi> and neuer was fully setled, nor plainely visible in <hi>England.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Church of <hi>Christ</hi> saith <hi>Hierome in Psalm. 133. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth not in walles, but in the truth of doctrine. There is the Church where is true faith.</hi> So likewise euery Church is to be estéemed according to the doctrine, which it teacheth: and of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> we are to make accompt, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the walles of the Churches there, but according to the doctrine, which now that Church professeth. If then there cannot be shewed a Church in the world for a thousand yeares professing that faith and doctrine, which now the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holdeth and professeth; we may boldly say, that the Church of <hi>Papists,</hi> as now it standeth, was not visible for a thousand yeares after <hi>Christ.</hi> Nay it is plaine, that such a Church, as the <hi>Papists</hi> now haue, was neuer yet planted in <hi>England.</hi> So farre is <hi>Parsons</hi> from his accompt, when he supposeth, that the faith and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that now is, hath alwaies continued since the first preaching of the Gospell, and bene visible in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That we say true, it appeareth first, for that no Church did euer esteeme traditions and holy Scriptures <hi>with like af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> before the decree of the conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi> ratified by <hi>Pius the fourth Anno Domini 1564.</hi> The Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> before that time neuer had any such conceit of tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to beleeue them to be the word of God, and equall to Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> no Church in the world did make the old Latine vulgar translation of the Bible authenticall before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the moderne Papists forbid men to reade the Scriptures translated into vulgar tongues without licence,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21479:54"/>
and command the seruice to be said in Latine, Gréeke, and Hebrew: which languages the common people vnderstand not. But such a Church and so malignant and enuious of the knowledge and profit of Christians was not seene in the world before the assembly of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. For a thousand yeares after <hi>Christ,</hi> and longer, it was lawful for laymen and all Christians to dispute, argue, and reason of matters of Christian Religion. And so long this Popish Church was not seene in the world, that prohibiteth laymen so to do.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The moderne Papists teach, that <hi>Christs</hi> naturall bodie is both in heauen and earth, and vpon euery altar where any consecrated host is hanged, where he is neither felt, seene, nor perceiued, and all at one time. But the Church vntill the times of the <hi>Trent</hi> conuenticle euer belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that <hi>Christ</hi> had a solide, visible, and palpable bodie. And certes, very strange it were if the Catholike and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall bodie of <hi>Christ</hi> shold be visible, &amp; not his natural body.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They teach, that <hi>Christ</hi> was a perfect man at the first instant of his conception, and that he knew all things, and was omniscient as man, both then and alwaies.

They say also that the authoritie of Scriptures in regard of vs doth depend vpon the Church, that is, as they say, vpon the Pope, Cardinals, Masse-priests, Monkes, and Friars. But the true Church hath alwaies taken this to be deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie to the Maiestie of God, and of holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="8">8. They teach, that the Pope hath two swords, and a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple crowne as King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.

               <p n="13">13. They teach, that the Pope is supreme iudge of all matters of controuersie in religion. But the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> euer thought it a matter absurd, to make a blind man iudge of colours, or an vnlearned &amp; irreligious fellow to be iudge of matters of learning and religion.

               <p n="43">43.

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> That <hi>Parsons</hi> maketh no conscience to wrest and corrupt holy Scriptures.</head>
               <p>THus we sée the substance of <hi>Parsons</hi> his two first bookes of <hi>Three Conuersions</hi> quashed, and brought to nothing. But because he hath committed diuers other faults, which in the sequele of our discourse we could not particularly insist vpon, we haue thought it good to referre their further examination to this place. For whatsoeuer bragges his followers do make of this braue worke, yet by examination it will appeare, that the Author hath fouly abused and mistaken Scriptures, corrupted, falsified, and falsely alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Fathers, and other Authors, bragged of himselfe and his conforts most vainely, taken things in question as granted most simply, erred in historyes and other authors most childishly, applyed Scriptures and spoken of God and matters concerning God most blasphemously, beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued himselfe toward his Prince most disloyally, lyed and calumniated honest men most impudently, alledged mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters making against himselfe most sottishly: and to reduce all into a briefe summe; that this whole treatise is nothing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:21479:59"/>
else, but a fardle of false allegations, corruptions, lyes and fooleries.</p>
               <p>That he maketh no conscience to wrest and peruert the words of holy Scriptures, it appeareth by these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. In the front of his booke, which he like a man of a front &amp; face without shame entituleth, <hi>A treatise of Three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersions of England,</hi> he tumbleth two sentences of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture together, and maketh one of two. He doth also wrest them both contrary to the meaning of the holy Ghost. For whereas <hi>Deuter. 4.</hi> whence his first place is taken, we are willed <hi>to enquire of ancient times,</hi> and thereof to learne Gods great works in deliuering his people, he applyeth the words of that text to the times of late Popes, and to their trash and traditions. And out of the words, <hi>Deut. 32.</hi> whence his second place is taken, where we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>to remember the old dayes of our forefathers, &amp;c.</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stnuateth, that we are to looke back to the Popes Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and corruptions of former times. But the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture sendeth vs to the Prophets &amp; Patriarks, and the people of God, which were eye witnesses of Gods speciall fauour towards his people. Both the places do vtterly ouerthrow <hi>Parsons</hi> his cause, that hath neither help of antiquity, nor testimony of the Fathers of the Church.</p>
               <p>In his Epistle he applieth these words <hi>Philip. 1. To you it is giuen, not only to beleeue in him, but also to suffer for him:</hi> to his complices the <hi>Papists.</hi> But he leaueth out these words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, for <hi>Christ.</hi> Percase his conscience told him, that in <hi>England</hi> none of his consorts suffer for <hi>Christ,</hi> but rather for <hi>Antichrist.</hi> Further, most of them are so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that they neither know what <hi>Christ</hi> is, nor what it is to beléeue in <hi>Christ,</hi> holding it sufficient to beléeue as the Pope doth, who for the most part beléeueth no more then the great <hi>Turke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where the Apostle <hi>Philip. 1.</hi> saith, <hi>Ut vincula mea manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta fierent in Christo in omni praetorio:</hi> he changeth his words, and maketh him to say, <hi>Vincula vestra manifesta siunt in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto in omni praetorio,</hi> making the Apostle to speake an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:21479:59"/>
and applying his words to the <hi>Papists,</hi> who neuer suffered for <hi>Christ,</hi> nor were euer called before any barre for his sake, but rather for treason and rebellion, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining the faction of Antichrist, to whose seruice they haue consecrated themselues. He doth also mistake the Apostles meaning vtterly, where he saith, <hi>The Apostle gloried of himselfe and his fellowes.</hi> For he doth not once mention his fellowes, nor glory of himselfe or his bonds, as this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fellow surmiseth.</p>
               <p>The Apostle <hi>1. Thess. 1.</hi> commendeth them, <hi>for that they became followers of Christ, and of the Apostles, and receiued the word of God with ioy in the holy Ghost, in great tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But <hi>Parsons</hi> applieth these words to the Papists. Let indifferent men therefore iudge how madly he applieth, and biole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly wresteth holy Scriptures to serue his leud purpose. For <hi>Papists</hi> follow not <hi>Christ,</hi> nor his Apostles, but <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi> &amp; his false apostles the Masse-priests and Iebusites. The word of God in vulgar tongues they receiue not to be read publikely: nor do they ioy so much in the holy Ghost, as in their owne diuelish practises, treacheries, and murthers. They suffer no tribulation, nor affliction of mind or body, but liue in all delights &amp; pleasures of the world, rather follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the sect of the <hi>Epicures,</hi> then the piety of <hi>Christians.</hi> Neither can it be shewed wherein y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Papists</hi> of <hi>England</hi> may be resembled in any thing to the Christians of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> vnlesse it be, in that they be <hi>enemies of the crosse of Christ, and make a god of their belly,</hi> as the Apostle saith, speaking of some Macedonians <hi>Philip. 3.</hi> Finally the place is not so euil applied, but it is worse translated: for to the text he addeth these words <hi>published euery where throughout the world,</hi> and leaueth out these, <hi>that we need not to speake any thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These words of God by his Prophet <hi>Isay, chap. 1. I will turne my hand vpon thee, and purge away thy drosse, till thou be made pure, and will take away thy tinne:</hi> are so absurdly applied to his consorts, that professe a religion full of drosse and superstition, a religion most impure and full of hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call corruption, a religion full of base mettall, and that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:21479:60"/>
her clients to worship Images of tinne &amp; lead, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> while he endeuoreth to praise the Papists, he doth vtter words that do vtterly confound both them &amp; their drossy Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Intus pugnae, foris timores,</hi> saith the Apostle <hi>1. Cor. 7.</hi> But <hi>Parsons</hi> to shew that he mainteineth a peruerse Rèligion, turneth his words contremont, making him to say <hi>Foris pug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae, intus timores.</hi> It may be, he was much ashamed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that there is such a faction &amp; diuision betwixt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Priests</hi> and the <hi>Iebusites</hi> throughout <hi>England.</hi> Further, if vnity be a marke of the Church, as his consorts pretend, then did he well perceiue, that such diuided companies as the <hi>Secular Priests</hi> &amp; <hi>Iebusites</hi> cannot belong to the Church, and therefore thought it best to corrupt the Apostles words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matth. 8.</hi> we reade, how <hi>Christ arose and rebuked the winds and sea, and how there followed a great calme.</hi> But <hi>Parsons</hi> wickedly applieth these words to the Pope, for <hi>Christ</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and giuing the power of God to a wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched man, who is so far from calming winds and seas, that he cannot appease the troubles of his owne house, nor stop the ouerflowing of <hi>Tiber.</hi> Nay albeit he endeuor to stop the breaths of true preachers, yet shall the sword of the word of God issuing out of their mouths lay his kingdome wast, and destroy the fortresses of his Antichristian state.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1. Reg. 3. Heli</hi> the priest submitteth himselfe to the will of God, foretelling the certaine destruction of his house, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>It is the Lord, let him do whatsoeuer seemeth good in his eyes.</hi> But <hi>Parsons</hi> doth impiously apply them to the Kings Maiesty, disloyally as it seemeth, wishing and prophecying of some such like destruction to the Kings house, and lignage, as hapned to <hi>Heli</hi> and his issue: and this the gunpouder and vndermining Papists haue of late attempted.</p>
               <p>In these words <hi>Hebrews 5. Didicit ex ijs, quae passus est, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientiam: Parsons</hi> leaueth out the word, <hi>obedientiam,</hi> and where the Apostle approprieth them to <hi>Christ,</hi> he detorteth them to the King.</p>
               <p>In his Preface alledging the words of <hi>Christ Matth. 24.</hi> he maketh himselfe to say, <hi>That such times of heresie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:21479:60"/>
should come, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one sect would say, here is Christ, and another, there is Christ.</hi> Where we may sée manifestly, that he neither speaketh of diuers sects, nor of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or heresies of diuers sects, but saith indefinitely, <hi>If any say here is Christ, or there is Christ, beleeue him not.</hi> And this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly maketh against euery seueral sect of Papists, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that <hi>Christes</hi> body is conteined in pixes, and lyeth lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vnder the accidents of consecrated hostes, and is offerd by polshorne prièsts in euery corner of their Churches.</p>
               <p>Citing the words of <hi>Peter, Act. 10.</hi> who saith, <hi>That Christ was not manifested to all the people, but to certaine witnesses before appointed by God,</hi> he beareth his reader in hand, <hi>that this was done to the end that their faith might be of more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> whereas we find not any mention made of merit in that place, nor any suspition of any such matter.</p>
               <p>Out of the words of <hi>Marke. c. 16.</hi> he concludeth, <hi>That we are to captiuate our vnderstanding not only to the obedience of Christ, but also to those that preach vnto vs.</hi> But there is great difference betwixt the incredulity of those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> would not beleeue the Apostles teaching <hi>Christes</hi> resurrection, of which <hi>Marke</hi> speaketh, and the piety of such, as beleeue not the Friers, Monks and Masse-priests, which are the false A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles sent out by Antichrist, teaching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes Decretals, and <hi>Romish</hi> forged traditions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 21.</hi> he endeuoreth to proue by <hi>S. Peters</hi> words <hi>Act. 15.</hi> that he was <hi>the Apostle of the Gentiles.</hi> But <hi>S. Paul Galat. 2.</hi> sheweth, that the Gospel <hi>ouer the circumcision was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Peter, and the Gospell ouer the vncircumcision</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. <hi>Act. 15.</hi> he saith nothing, but <hi>that God appointed that the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles should by his mouth heare the word of the Gospel.</hi> But that may be true in case any number of the Gentiles should heare him preach the Gospell. The words of <hi>Peter</hi> certes do not exclude others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 441.</hi> rehersing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of <hi>Daniel. c. 2.</hi> he applieth them to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church were <hi>that kingdome, that shal neuer be dissipated, and shall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sume &amp; weare out all other kingdoms:</hi> but by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sequel of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> text it appeareth, that they are
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21479:61"/>
to be vnderstood of the vniuersall Church and kingdome of <hi>Christ,</hi> and not of any one particular congregation, much lesse of the synagogue of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is now begun to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipated by the true preachers of Gods word on one side, and is greatly straited by the <hi>Turke</hi> on the other side. He doth also fraudulently leaue out these words in his quotation, <hi>Et regnum eius alteri populo non dabit,</hi> least he should thereby declare, that euery particular city and people is excluded from the claime of the right of the vniuersall kingdome of <hi>Christ.</hi> And with this faith he citeth other Scriptures.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IN ciuill causes to deale vntruly, it is but falsity. But in matters of faith, to vse false dealing, doth beside falsity imply impiety. He therefore that was not afraide to force Scriptures, will not spare to forge and falsifie the Fathers, and other Authors, as may appeare by the practise of <hi>Rob. Parsons.</hi> To proue that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> said, <hi>That Christians ought to trauaile by sea and land, countries and kingdomes to seeke out the truth and certeinty of Catholike Religion,</hi> he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in his Preface first <hi>Possidonius in vita Augustini,</hi> and next <hi>Augustine</hi> himselfe <hi>lib. 4. &amp; 5. Confess.</hi> But in the first place there is not one word for his purpose. In the second, there is not that which he surmiseth. Nay it is not like, that <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> would write as he affirmeth, seeing to find true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike religion, and the certeinty thereof, we néede neither to passe the Sea, nor to trauaile to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> but are rather to search the bookes of holy Scripture, which teach the same sufficiently.</p>
               <p>He saith, that <hi>S. Augustine lib. de morib. Eccles. c. 17.</hi> and <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in a certaine Homily <hi>reprehend greatly the sluggishnes of diuers men in their dayes, that seeing sects and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21479:61"/>
heresies to arise, and diuersities of religion in almost euery country, did not bestirre themselues to try out the truth.</hi> But he abuseth both these holy Fathers, whereof the first hath no such words or reprehension. The second talketh not of the diuersities of religions, but only exhorteth Christians to embrace the Christian faith earnestly. The which doth concerne Popery nothing, which hath béen sowne in Gods field long after the first planting of the Christian faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Augustine tractat. 73. in Ioan.</hi> hath these words, <hi>Haec est laus fidei, si quod creditur, non videtur.</hi> To these words <hi>Parsons</hi> addeth the word <hi>merit,</hi> and translateth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus, <hi>The praise or merit of faith stands in this, that the thing be not seene which is beleeued.</hi> He should haue said thus, <hi>Herein consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth the prayse of faith, if that be beleeued, that is not seene.</hi> And this ouerthroweth the doctrine of the Papists, that teach, that the Catholike Church which we beléeue in our Créede, is visible. He maketh <hi>Ambrose</hi> to say thus <hi>lib. 1. de Abraham. ca. 3. If a graue honorable person in this life, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he be of high authority and our superior, will take it in disdaine to be asked a proofe, for that he affirmeth, how much more ought God to be credited, when he proposeth vnto vs a matter aboue our reach or capacitie?</hi> But therein he sheweth himselfe neither graue nor honorable, to impute his owne sayings to so graue a Father. <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> sayth only, <hi>How vnworthy a matter were it, to beleeue the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of men concerning others, and not to beleeue Gods oracles concerning himselfe? Quam indignum, vt humanis te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonijs de alio credamus, dei oraculis de se non credamus?</hi> This also toucheth the Papists very néere, who will not beléeue holy Scriptures, which are Gods oracles, without the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of the Pope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 3.</hi> he saith, <hi>That Eleutherius conuerted King Lucius and his subiects by the preaching of Damianus and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes;</hi> and for proofe alledgeth <hi>Bede lib. 1. hist. Angl. ca. 17. &amp; 18.</hi> But <hi>Bede</hi> in these two Chapters doth not so much as once mention any such matter.

                  <hi>Pag. 26.</hi> where <hi>Tertullian li. de Praeser. aduers. Haeret.</hi> vseth the testimonie of diuers Churches, as well, as of that of <hi>Rome,</hi> he onely mentioneth <hi>Rome,</hi> and concealeth the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of other Churches.</p>
               <p>There also he saith, that <hi>S. Augustine in Psal. contr. part. Donati, had no better way to defend his Church of Hippo, and other of those countries to be truly Catholike then to say, they were daughters and children of the Church of Rome.</hi> But it séemeth he dreamed, when he wrote these things: if not, then he lyed of mere malice. For in that place neither these words, nor any such matter is to be found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 28.</hi> he saith, <hi>That Irenaeus, Tertullian, S. Cyprian, S. Augustine, and others are wont to vrge this consequent against Heretikes, to wit, that if our Church be the daughter and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the Church of Rome; then ought it to runne to her in all doubts &amp; difficulties of matters of faith.</hi> Thus doth he write, &amp; this he affirmeth, with one breath belying diuers Fathers. And that shall himselfe perceiue, if he list to alledge their words. We may easily imagine the same to be true, for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> consequent is so absurd. For if all Churches were to haue recourse to their mother Church for decision of controuersies concerning the faith: then were the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and all others to deriue their decisions concerning matters of faith from <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> But this, <hi>Parsons</hi> himselfe will not grant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 30.</hi> he telleth a tale of one <hi>Beatus</hi> a <hi>Briton, who being conuerted to the faith,</hi> as he saith, <hi>was sent by Ioseph to Rome to S. Peter the head of the Apostles, to be better instructed and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21479:63"/>
confirmed.</hi> And this he deliuereth to his reader, as testified by <hi>B. Rhenanus lib. 3. rerum Germa. sub Hello,</hi> and <hi>Pantaleon de viris German. part. 3.</hi> But he doth grossely abuse his reader in telling grosse vntruths vpon the credit of these witnesses, who onely mention this <hi>Beatus,</hi> but report no such matter of him. Further <hi>Rhenanus</hi> doth no otherwise accompt of this report, then as of a Monkish fable, and thereupon saith, <hi>That he findeth small helpe from the Chronicles of Monkes,</hi> to furnish his storie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 33.</hi> he telleth vs, that few of the <hi>Britains</hi> obserued Easter after the manner of the Easterne Church, and fathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth this fable vpon <hi>Bede</hi> in diuers places. But <hi>Bede</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <hi>lib. 2. hist. Anglor. cap. 2.</hi> refuteth his foolish tale, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>Austin</hi> obiected this obseruance to al the Bishops of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and how they refused to leaue the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 42.</hi> he vrgeth an Epistle set out vnder <hi>Innocents</hi> name, and saith, <hi>That the British Churches are put among the rest.</hi> But neither are they there once mentioned, nor is this Decretall Epistle to be estéemed, being plainely counterfeit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 43.</hi> he citeth <hi>Orosius hist. lib. 2.</hi> and saith, that he calleth <hi>Innocentius an holy Father.</hi> But there is neither holinesse, nor honestie in fathering lies vpon holy Fathers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 45.</hi> and in diuers places he citeth <hi>Eusebius</hi> his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, yet he is simple, that perceiueth not, that those Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles were neuer written by <hi>Eusebius:</hi> and shall be much intricated, if he confesse all therein written to be true and perfect. There it is said, <hi>That S. Peter sate 25. yeares at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> which <hi>Parsons</hi> will not confesse. In the margent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the yeare 146. it is said, <hi>Hîc omissa est linea de Pio.

                  <hi>Pag. 46.</hi> for proofe, that the kéeping of Easter contrarie to the <hi>Romane</hi> vse <hi>was condemned as an heresie, and so held in all ages after,</hi> he quoteth <hi>Bede hist.

By <hi>Eusebius</hi> in the place quoted, and <hi>Bede lib. 3. cap. 25.</hi> we may gather, that an order was appointed for
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:21479:63"/>
vniforme obseruation of Easter. But neither of them affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them to be heretikes, that did not obserue that order. Nor is it to be reputed heresie, not to obserue all Canons, that concerne such ceremonies. Nay it cannot be proued, that <hi>Vlfride</hi> saith, <hi>That this error might be tolerable in them, that liued so distant from the sea Apostolike, in a corner of the world,</hi> albeit this glozing parasite of the sea Apostatike of <hi>Rome,</hi> do affirme it, <hi>pag. 48.</hi>

Anglor. cap. 19.</hi> and other authors making them to say, <hi>That Celestine sent Patritius and Palladius to conuert the Irish and Scots.</hi> For neither do the authors mentioned speake of more, then one of these two, nor can he make his assertion good by the testimonie of other authors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 50.</hi> he saith, that <hi>Pelagius</hi> crept into many learned, and godly mens loue, and friendship, and aboue others with <hi>Paulinus</hi> and <hi>S. Augustine.</hi> And for proofe he quoteth <hi>S. Augustines Epistle 105.</hi> and <hi>lib. 2. de Bon. Perseueran. cap. 20.</hi> But in neither place is there any such matter to be found. In the second place, it is said, that <hi>Pelagius</hi> talked with a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Bishop of <hi>S.

               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 112.</hi> he maketh <hi>Ambrose</hi> to say, <hi>That the substance of one bodie is changed into another.</hi> But that holy Father hath no such words, as this falsarie hath reported out of his writings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 117.</hi> boldly he affirmeth, that in the writings of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius, Hilarie, Optatus, Basil, Nazianzen, Ambrose, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:21479:64"/>

he speaketh of the successions of diuers Bishops in the whole Christian Church, which ouerthroweth the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded prerogatiue of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church.</p>

                  <hi>Pag. 472.</hi> He maketh <hi>S. Augustine lib. 1. quaest. Euang. q. 38.</hi> and <hi>Tractat. 2. in Epist.

For in the first place he saith onely, <hi>That the Church is rightly called Lightning, because it breaketh out of the clouds:</hi> which sheweth, that the Church is sometime darkened with cloudes, and not séene. And in the second he hath nothing but these words of the <hi>Psalme, in Sole posuit ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernaculum suum.</hi> Which do plainely demonstrate, the Church being like to the Sunne, that the same may be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den or darkened, as the Sunne is hidden in the night, and

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Certaine examples of <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> his Thrasoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call bragges, and beggarly crauing of matters in question.</head>
               <p>COmmonly we find by experience, that the greatest braggers performe least. If no man else, yet <hi>Rob. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> doth verifie it by his example. For albeit he boasteth much, yet when it cometh to performance, he beggeth mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in question, rather then prooueth them. In his Epistle dedicatoris he braggeth of <hi>vndoubted Charters, Enrolments, Euidences, writings, and witnesses,</hi> which he saith he will bring foorth for proofe of the <hi>Romish</hi> religion, and giueth out great words of his future doughtie déedes. Yet when we come to the examination of his best proofes, we find that his witnesses depose either nothing for him, or much against him, that his euidences are euident demonstrations of his owne weaknesse &amp; vanitie, and that in his owne writings he hath enrolled himself a bragging foole in great letters.</p>
               <p>There also he telleth vs further, how <hi>he produceth the iudgements, censures, sentences, and arrests of all Christian Parliaments of the world,</hi> to wit, <hi>the determination of the highest Ecclesiasticall Tribunals in fauour</hi> of his consorts the Papists of <hi>England.</hi> But this shamelesse bragge is refuted by the whole course of his worthlesse worke. For neither doth he handle any one principall point of faith in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie, nor doth he produce the Canons of lawfull generall Councels, which haue soueraigne authoritie in externall gouernment, to proue the doctrine of the Papists, but onely prateth idlely of counterfeit Decretals, and mentioneth forged instruments, suborned witnesses, and most weake surmises not woorth one chip. Furthermore, where he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Councels the highest Tribunals of the Church, he doth as it were with his putatiue Fathers sledge batter the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:21479:66"/>
Popes chaire in péeces.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he vanteth <hi>of the honorable course of true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God in matters of the soule, and loyall behauiour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards temporall Princes in al worldly affaires held by Papists.</hi> And this he saith <hi>is glorious both before God and man.</hi> But the mans notorious vanitie deserueth to be hated both of God and man. For how can they be thought to hold a right course of obedience toward God, that prohibite the reading of Gods word in the Church in tongues vnderstood? And how may they seeme carefull in matters of the soule, that bring in new and strange worships of God, and for <hi>Christ</hi> serue <hi>Antichrist?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The disloyaltie of Papists is too too apparent not onely in the rebellions of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and their trecherous plots against his Maiestie and his predecessors, but also in their doctrine, teaching and professing, that Kings are the Popes vassals, and that he hath power to take away their Crownes, and to assoile subiects from their obedience. But if any doubted of their loyaltie before, now he may be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not onely by their trecherous plot to blow vp the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament house, but also by their open rebellion in <hi>Warwike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Speaking of the fact of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> commanding his vassals in <hi>England</hi> to kéepe silence, he boasteth of it, <hi>as of a miracle.</hi> But it is no maruell, to sée the slaues of <hi>Antichrist</hi> obedient to his command. It were rather miraculous, if they should follow the lawes of God, and submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to their lawfull Princes, and renounce the abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the latter end of his Epistle he braggeth, <hi>That suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Christ to be Christ and his promises true,</hi> he wil (forsooth) by his doughtie discourse of <hi>Three Conuersions</hi> decide all the controuersies betwixt vs and the Papists, and that, as he professeth, <hi>with certaine sequele of argument, and necessarie demonstration.</hi> But his blustring bragges are passed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect, and his clients rest more doubtfull then before. Nay his arguments are so ridiculous, that indifferent men
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21479:66"/>
do scorne them, and his demonstrations so lousie, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth plainely, that he is better affected to <hi>Antichrist,</hi> then to <hi>Christ,</hi> and groundeth his faith rather on the Popes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals, then holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 114.</hi> he beareth his reader in hand, that <hi>really and substantially</hi> he is able to proue our doctrine to be hèresie, and to shew the beginnings and authors thereof. But his shews are declared to be shadowes, and the substance of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is disproued, as a packe of reall and grosse fooleries. Sooner shall he transubstantiate himself into a messe of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard, then either maintaine the masse of Popish heresies, or disproue the substance of our doctrine.</p>
               <p>Neither doth he more insolently boast of his owne dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie déedes, then childishly beg, and take matters in question as granted. In the Epistle Dedicatory, and diuers other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Papists</hi> are still called <hi>Catholikes,</hi> and Popish superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> couered and dignified by the name of <hi>Catholike Religion.</hi> Matters by all true Christians vtterly denyed, and by infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite particulars disproued, and apparently false. For how can they be truly esteemed Catholikes, that embrace the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular faith of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> neither taught by the Prophets, nor Apostles of <hi>Christ,</hi> nor knowne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ancient Fathers of the Church? Or how can a particular, hereticall, superstitious &amp; idolatrous Religion be reputed Catholike?</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Arguments of <hi>Rob. Parsons</hi> his grosse ignorance and childish fooleries.</head>
               <p>AMong his followers <hi>Robert Parsons,</hi> they say, is holden a profound Doctor. But his pitifull failes and errors in mistaking both his authors, and their words and meaning declare the contrarie. In the addition following his Epistle he telleth vs, how <hi>Constantine</hi> the great entred into the Empire next after <hi>Dioclesian.</hi> But Ecclesiasticall histories shew, that <hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Galerius</hi> succéeded <hi>Diocletian,</hi> and that <hi>Constantine</hi> succéeded his father <hi>Constantius.</hi> And if he will not beléeue vs; yet let him see, what <hi>Baronius</hi> saith in his second and third Tome of Annales, who putteth thrée yeares betwéene <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and <hi>Constantine,</hi> and others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them two.</p>
               <p>There also he saith, that <hi>Constantine being of a different religion, when he entred, became a Christian by his pious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Helena.</hi> But the Legend of <hi>Siluester</hi> saith, that <hi>Helena</hi> was a <hi>Iew</hi> in Religion, and endeuoured to draw her sonne that way. And <hi>Eusebius lib. 8. Eccles. hist. cap. 26.</hi> sheweth, that from the beginning of his raigne <hi>he was a follower of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in pious affection towards our Religion.

coming toward Rome,</hi> whereas <hi>Eusebius lib. 8. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. hist. cap. 26.</hi> saith, he fained Christianitie in the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of his raigne. His words are, <hi>In ipso imperij ingressu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Speaking of <hi>S. Martin, S. Nectarius, S. Ambrose,</hi> and <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> he saith, <hi>It was presumed and foretold, that they would be such, before they were Christians indeed.</hi> But in the Legend of <hi>S. Martin</hi> it is said, he was a Christian at the age of twelue yeares, and nothing doth <hi>Parsons</hi> alledge, wherby we may vnderstand, that any prophesie was made by any of the future Christianitie of <hi>Nectarius, Ambrose, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his preface speaking of the Church, most ridiculously he compareth it to a mansion house, and the markes thereof to charters, ridiculously I say. For <hi>first</hi> there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwéene a mysticall body, and a naturall bodie, the Church being changed, albeit men continue, and a mansion house not being moued, although the right be translated to others. <hi>Next</hi> Charters do rather shew, which are the bounds and markes of lands, then may be called the marks of them, and are rather compared to Scriptures, then to the markes assigned by Papists.</p>
               <p>Lastly, this similitude of a mansion house doth ouerthrow the cause of the synagogue of <hi>Rome.</hi> For the mansion house of the Church is in no one particular place, and the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Church are rather holy Scriptures, then Popish Decretals.</p>
               <p>In the same place he alledgeth <hi>Alexander Halensis 3. part. q. 79.</hi> to proue, <hi>That a man hath two lights, whereby he may vnderstand matters of faith.</hi> But in that part he hath only 69. questions, and nothing of the two lights. <hi>Durandus</hi> also is there cited <hi>in nu. 39.</hi> but neither booke nor section noted. Doth it not séeme therefore, that <hi>Parsons,</hi> as he hath long since lost the light of faith, so is now become destitute of the light of humane reason?</p>

Forsooth, because the conuenticle of <hi>Trent,</hi> the Master of sentences, and <hi>Thomas of Aquine</hi> haue taught it. I would therefore pray all moderate men attentiuely to consider this fellowes either madnesse, or ignorance.

But if we looke into the whole course of his writing, we shall hardly find in so finall a volume more aguments of impietie and disloyaltie. In his Epistle Dedicatorie he applyeth these words of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelist, <hi>Exurgens, imperauit ventis &amp; mari,</hi> which belong properly to <hi>Christ,</hi> to the Pope, as if he were able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the winds and sea.</p>
               <p>In his Preface speaking of <hi>arguments of credibilitie</hi> for Christian Religion, and naming the sayings of Prophets, miracles, and testimonie of eye witnesses, he saith, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they, nor such like are so euident, as philosophicall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations. As if philosophicall arguments were more cleare and euident, then the lightsome word of God, or Gods miracles, or else, as if euery one were better able to vnderstand philosophicall arguments, knowne only by the light of naturall reason, then the truth of Scriptures and Religion proued by the light of Gods holy Spirit, most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine miracles, eye witnesses, and diuers other arguments.</p>
               <p>There also he affirmeth, that there are <hi>like arguments of credibilitie</hi> for the points of Popish Religion now in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie, as are for the Articles of Christian Religion. But this is sufficient to ouerthrow all pietie and Religion. For
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:21479:70"/>
what man can beléeue the articles of the faith, if we had no better ground for them, then for the Popish doctrine of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, Indulgences, the Popes Monarchie and infallible iudgement, the popish worship of Angels and Saints and Images, the eating of Christs bodie by brute beasts eating the Sacrament and other vnwritten Popish traditions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 102.</hi> he compareth the doctrine of the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> of <hi>Christs</hi> two natures and one Person, of the procéeding of the holy Ghost, and such like substantiall and necessarie points of the Christian faith, to the wicked and corrupt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Popes vniuersal authoritie of the popish Masse, of Transubstantiation, worship of Images and such like taught by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as if the one were as easily and directly to be proued, as the other. But what can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised more impious, then to match the hereticall doctrine of schoolemen, either deuised by Popes, or conceiued by philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophicall deductions, with the faith of <hi>Christ</hi> not onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by diuine Scriptures, but also testified by Fathers, and Catholike Christians of all times?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 111.</hi> he compareth the word <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> to the word <hi>Trinitie,</hi> and <hi>Consubstantiall.</hi> Which is as much, as if he should deny the holy <hi>Trinitie,</hi> and the Deitie of the Sonne of God, if he cannot proue his Transubstantiation: a matter that passeth his capacitie to proue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 104.</hi> he alloweth the donation of <hi>Ethelwolph,</hi> that gaue lands to <hi>God, the blessed Virgin, and all the Saints.</hi> But what is more impious, then to match creatures with the Creator, &amp; to honor Saints, &amp; the Mirgin <hi>Mary</hi> as Gods?</p>
               <p>Likewise doth he shew himselfe disloy all to his Prince. In his Epistle Dedicatorie speaking of obedience due to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he taketh from them all authoritie to command in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall causes esteeming that he doth them fauor in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them obedience in all worldly affaires. But if he were further examined, what obedience is due to Princes excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by the Pope, it is not to be questioned, but he would deny them obedience in temporall affaires also, and defend the rebellions of subiects against their Princes.</p>

                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:21479:70"/>
In an addition following his Epistle he insulteth ouer the late Queene hearing of her death, and rayleth at her, calling her an <hi>old persecutor.</hi> The which argueth not only a disloyall affection towards his Prince, but also an inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane malice against the dead. And this reward Princes reape, that shew fauour to these Scorpions.</p>
               <p>There also he prayseth the King for his <hi>learning, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and zeale.</hi> But if he were either good Christian, or true subiect, he should haue commended his piety, and not haue sought to make him subiect to the Pope.

               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 136.</hi> he imputeth the burning of <hi>Foster, Freese</hi> and <hi>Tewkesbury,</hi> thrée godly Martyrs in King <hi>Henry the 8.</hi> his dayes to the King, and yet were the Romish persecutors the causers of their death. Likewise he saith, that others were burned <hi>by the Kings authority.</hi> So all the fault is laid vpon the King, although the principall agents in these mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were <hi>Romish</hi> prelates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 252.</hi> he prooueth, that Kings are subiect to the Pope by the best reasons he could deuise. Can he be thought then loyall to his Prince, that extolleth strangers, and debaseth Kings?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 257.</hi> he laugheth at King <hi>Edward the sixth</hi> as <hi>a child King,</hi> as if the children of Kings were not to succéede their Fathers in their Kingdomes: and <hi>Pag. 260.</hi> he scorneth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations set forth in his name. Percase it would greatly please him, if all matters were ordred by the Decretals of the Pope. But what néede we other arguments, to conuince this fellow of disloyaltie, when his booke of titles is extant, wherein he doth not only oppugne the Kings title to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> but also giueth both the Pope and people authority ouer Kings?

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> A particular of <hi>Parsons</hi> his lyes, calumniations, and false allegations.</head>
               <p>NOw we enter into a large field. But it shall be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for vs, if of many impudent lyes, calumniations, and false allegations of authors, we reherse some part, and giue you a tast of his false dealing in the whole. For thereby you may coniecture, how this child of the father of lies hath dealt in the rest. In a certain addition following his Epistle he telleth, how <hi>it was foretold, that S. Martin, Nectarius, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose and Augustine should be conuerted to Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on long before it came to passe.</hi> But if he vouch not his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, we may boldly auouch, that he hath forged this lye on his owne head without truth or authority.</p>
               <p>In the same place he affirmeth, <hi>that he knoweth most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely how the Papists desired his Maiesties aduancement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all others.</hi> But he that readeth his booke of titles set out vnder the name of <hi>Dolman,</hi> and considereth not only the practises of <hi>Brooke, Watson,</hi> and <hi>Clerke</hi> against the King and the State, but also the matters obiected by the Secular priests against the Iebusites and their faction concerning this point, and especially the attempt of the gunpowder pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and vnderminers of the Parliament house, will say, that neither <hi>Parsons,</hi> nor the popish faction shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues very zealous of the Kings aduancement. And as for the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> pentioners, it were great simplicitie to thinke that taking his money they promised, or intended his Maiesties aduancement and honor.</p>
               <p>There also he telleth tales of <hi>the readinesse and forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Papists in aduancing his Maiesties present admission to the Crowne.</hi> The vntruth whereof is not only testified by their owne consciences, but also by secret conuenticles after the late Quéenes death, and by open practises to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. True it is, that when they saw their owne weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:21479:71"/>
then they came on forward, but with great sorrow and heauinesse of hart appearing in their countenances, and rather to saue themselues then to helpe the King.</p>
               <p>He addeth somewhat of his Maiesties Mother, and the loyaltie of <hi>Papists</hi> towards her. But his glauering leasing may be refuted, <hi>first</hi> by the history of <hi>Sammier</hi> a <hi>Iebusite,</hi> that was the principal motiue to bring her into trouble. Next by the practises of the Pope, <hi>Frenchmen</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed her name as a pretence for their owne ambition. And lastly, by the practises of the <hi>Spanish</hi> pentioners, and namely of <hi>Parsons</hi> for other titles.</p>
               <p>In his Preface he saith, <hi>that Master Foxe</hi> (in his booke of Acts and Monuments) <hi>treateth of the principall pillars of his religion, whereof he maketh some Martyrs, and some Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, and distributeth them in a certaine Ecclesiasticall Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, according to the dayes of euery moneth, wherein their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiuals are to be kept.</hi> But in these few lines he telleth many vntruths. For first <hi>Master Foxe</hi> neuer accounted these Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs the principall pillars of his religion, founding himselfe and his religion principally vpon the Prophets, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. <hi>Secondly,</hi> not <hi>Master Foxe,</hi> but their death and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings for <hi>Christes</hi> faith made these holy men and women Martyrs and Confessors. <hi>Thirdly</hi> not <hi>M. Foxe,</hi> but the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of the print distributed them in the Calendar accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his pleasure. <hi>Fourthly</hi> this Calendar was not made for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which abhorreth the abuses of popish Calendars, but for a direction to those that shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to know the order and times of their martyrdome and sufferings, that are named in the story. <hi>Lastly, M. Foxe</hi> neuer presumed to appoint festiuall dayes for the memorials of these holy men; nor had he presumed so farre, could he haue done it. But in this point both he and we condemne the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy &amp; presumption of the Pope, that challengeth this power to himselfe.</p>
               <p>In his argument before his first booke he giueth out, that the church of <hi>Rome</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the times of <hi>S. Peter</hi> vntill our dayes hath alwayes mainteined and taught one faith, <hi>without
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:21479:72"/>
change, or alteration of any one substantiall article, or point of beliefe.</hi> And this is the maine post whereon turneth his windmil-like discourse. Who then doth not sée, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his whole discourse is founded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vntruth? That this is a notorious vntruth, it appeareth by the great alterations of Religion made partly by the Schoolemen, and partly by the Popes Decretals, and not least by the decrees of the conuenticles of <hi>Rome, Lateran, Constance, Florence</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> wherein I hope <hi>Parsons</hi> will not deny, but that substantiall points of Religion haue béen discussed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 9.</hi> he maketh the <hi>Centuriasts, Centur. 2. 3. &amp; 4.</hi> to say, <hi>that Christian doctrine fell away in the time of the Doctors.</hi> But his report is false and slanderous. For they speake only of a decay or declination in some points of doctrine, and in some Doctors, and not of any falling away, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in all the Doctors, or in all points of their doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 23.</hi> he saith, <hi>that some hold, that Ioseph of Arimathaea was sent into Britaine by S. Peter.</hi> A matter of no moment, yet falsely affirmed by him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> careth not what vntruth he speake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 40.</hi> speaking of <hi>Ieffrey of Mommouth</hi> he affirmeth, that <hi>lib. 11. ca. 12. there is not one word of not acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Popes supremacy.</hi> And his reason is, for that <hi>Austin was not sent to the Britains, but to the Saxons, and for that they had their Archbishops iurisdiction reserued.</hi> But his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion conteineth a manifest vntruth. For <hi>Austin Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Legat</hi> required subiection of them, which they could not deny without impugning <hi>Gregories</hi> authoritie. He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them also most cruelly to be murthered, which he would not haue done, vnlesse he had thought his authority to be vniustly resisted. His reason is most ridiculous, and not only false. For neither is there any mention made of any reserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of iurisdiction in <hi>Austins</hi> story, nor do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes Legates spare to vsurp all iurisdiction where they can do it. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more it is a vaine thing to talke of <hi>Gregories</hi> reseruation of Archiepiscopall iurisdiction in <hi>Britaine,</hi> when before his time no Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was euer heard to appoint either Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, or Archbishop in <hi>Britaine.</hi>

                  <hi>Pag. 57.</hi> he saith <hi>the Lutherans reiect Hester, S. Iames his epistle, and the Apocalyps from the canon of Scriptures.</hi> But their bookes and acts declare the contrary. They only make a difference betwixt some Chapters of <hi>Hester, S. Iames</hi> his Epistle, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> and other canonicall Scriptures, which neuer haue been doubted of, or called in question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 58.</hi> he saith, <hi>that Luther lib. de Concil. did perswade the German Princes to obserue Easter day, as an immoueable feast.</hi> But either he wilfully forgetteth, or slothfully drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. For in his booke of Councels he saith only, <hi>that it had bin better to haue left the law of Moyses concerning Pase dead and buried. Quanto fecissent consultiùs,</hi> saith he, <hi>pag. 26. si le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem Moysis de Paschali festo reliquissent ibi iacêre mortuam &amp; sepultam?</hi> so farre was he from making it an immoueable feast.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 64.</hi> he telleth, how <hi>Vlfrides</hi> festiuall is kept <hi>by the vniuersall Church vpon the 12. day of October.</hi> But this lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing is plainely confuted by the Calendars of the Easterne, and <hi>African</hi> Churches, that neuer knew any such Saint, and <hi>Molanus</hi> signifieth, that this Saints feast was only kept in <hi>England. In Anglia,</hi> saith he, <hi>natalis Vlfridi.</hi> But now the reformed Church hath blowne away these superstitious festiuals, and condemneth the Popes claime in canonizing his disciples.</p>
               <p>Rehersing the report of <hi>Lucius</hi> his conuersion out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius, pag. 77.</hi> he addeth, lyeth and forgeth, like a forging falsary. That which he telleth <hi>of Lucius hating the Romans for their old religion,</hi> and <hi>how he knew, that the fountaine of religion was at Rome,</hi> is both added and false. That which he talketh of <hi>Pertinax</hi> and <hi>Tretellius</hi> his conuersion, and <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> his fauor, and of <hi>Fugatius</hi> and <hi>Damianus,</hi> who as he saith, were <hi>Romans,</hi> is false, and not to be iustified by any good author.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Wicleffe and Husse taught, that Kings are no Kings, longer then they rule well, as Parsons</hi> surmiseth <hi>Pag. 98.</hi> is a méere calumniation. Their bookes conteine contrary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:21479:73"/>
                  <hi>Pag. 103.</hi> he saith, <hi>The article of the Trinity, and Christes two natures were as little, or perhaps lesse specified in the first two hundred yeares after Christ,</hi> then the popish doctrine <hi>of the Popes authority, of the Masse, and of Images.</hi> Matters not only false, but blasphemous. The doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Christes</hi> two natures being directly deduced out of holy Scriptures, and the popish doctrine concerning the Pope, the Masse, and Images, being contrary to Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 147.</hi> speaking of the <hi>Magdeburgians,</hi> he saith, <hi>They accuse openly, and by name S. Athanasius, Basil, Gregory, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen, Ambrose, Prudentius, Epiphanius and Ephrem, for the error of praying to Saints.</hi> But he that shall reade the <hi>4. Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury cap. 4.</hi> shall find the contrary. The same is also to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by reason. For what néeded they to accuse the Fathers, when neither the writings mentioned are certainely theirs, nor any matter is in those writings contained, that cannot probably be defended, and be wrested out of the hands of our aduersaries, that by them would proue prayers to Saints?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 152.</hi> he beareth his reader in hand, <hi>that we cannot say, that the faith of Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the first, <hi>was any other, then that which is now in Rome.</hi> And for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe he referreth vs to <hi>Srapleton</hi> his translation of <hi>Bede,</hi> and his <hi>Fortresse of faith.</hi> But <hi>first</hi> the translation is wicked and corrupt, and his fortresse of perfidye and heresie is ouerthrowne by <hi>D. Fulke</hi> of worthy memory. <hi>Secondly</hi> that which he affirmeth, <hi>that we cannot say;</hi> that we both say, and prooue, and thereof haue giuen diuers particulars in our former answere. Finally the points which <hi>Stapleton</hi> toucheth in his weake fortresse, are neither the most mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall points in controuersie betwixt vs, nor any way proued by him substantially.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 153.</hi> he telleth, <hi>how, by all meanes we can deuise, we discredit Gregory and Austin.</hi> But he doth very much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit his cause by telling these great vntruths: for we do neither discredit them, nor wrong them, but only report, as we find. Nay we doubt not, but in diuers great points of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:21479:73"/>
controuersie to ouerthrow our aduersaries by the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of there two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 192.</hi> he sayth, <hi>that S. German prayed largely to S. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane.</hi> But <hi>Bede,</hi> vpon whose credit this report is made, saith not so, as we may reads <hi>hist. Anglor. lib. 1. c. 18.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 205.</hi> he affirmeth, <hi>that Dinothus was punished by the sword of Ethelfred after the death of S. Austin.</hi> Yet <hi>Bede lib. 2. hist. Anglor. c. 3.</hi> sheweth after this execution done vpon the innocent <hi>Britans,</hi> how <hi>Austin</hi> ordeined two Bishops, which he could not well do being dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 227.</hi> he telleth, how <hi>Archbishop Cranmer agreed to breake King Henry the 8. his last will,</hi> and that <hi>he conspired to put downe and destroy all the Kings children, and was put to death for heresie and treason.</hi> Matters certes most grossely deuised, and impudently affirmed by this wicked heretike and traytor. For first King <hi>Henries</hi> will, if any such were, was not cancelled by him, but by the popish prelates in Quéene <hi>Maryes</hi> time, and of that the lay Papists brag in their petition to the King <hi>an. 1064.</hi> Secondly, not Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> but the bloody Papists had determined not only to breake his will, that they might conuey the Crowne to strangers, but also to burne his body, if they had not béen preuented by Quéene <hi>Maryes</hi> death. <hi>Thirdly</hi> that graue Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and holy Martyr refused to subscribe against Quéene <hi>Mary,</hi> albeit many Papists did it, and she to requite his kind dealing, cruelly persecuted him to the death. <hi>Lastly</hi> he dyed for defence of true Religion, and not for heresie. And albeit matters of treason were obiected to him, yet neuer came he to his arraignement for them, as no question <hi>Rob. Parsons</hi> should, if he might be caught.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 239.</hi> he sayth, <hi>Latimer stirred a notorious tumult in Bristow,</hi> but this is not only false, but also improbable: for the good old man was most méeke and peaceable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 241.</hi> he writeth, that the Abbots of <hi>Glastenbury, Whalley,</hi> and <hi>Reading,</hi> and <hi>D. Forest,</hi> and <hi>Powell gaue their bloud for defence of Catholike vnitie.</hi> But the acts of their triall shew, that diuers of them were executed for plaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:21479:74"/>
and all for treason. And if any Abbots or <hi>Iebusites</hi> should make the like stirres abrode against the Pope, or the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> it would auaile them but little to pretend <hi>Catholike vnity. Forest</hi> and his fellowes vnder pretence of this Catholike vnity, sought to reuoke and call backe into <hi>England</hi> the Popes tyranny.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 243.</hi> he shameth not to say, <hi>that the King gaue Bishop Gardiner speciall commission to procure a reconciliation with the Pope.</hi> But his impudent lying may be refuted both by his commission and instructions yet extant, wherein no such matter is signified, but rather the contrary. <hi>Parsons</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may do well to shew, by what commission he lyeth thus shamefully.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 283.</hi> he sayth, <hi>that all the Archbishops of Canterbury were of one religion vntill Cranmers time.</hi> But hardly shall he prooue, that all of them had in them any religion at all. And by no meanes can he deny, but as the church of <hi>Rome</hi> changed her faith, so her louers likewise changed. The faith of the conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi> none of them euer knew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 287.</hi> he alledgeth these words, as out of <hi>Caluin lib. 4. Instit. c. 1. §. 3. We are forced to beleeue the Church to be inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and to be seene only by the eyes of God.</hi> But he that hath any eyes at all may sée this fellowes impudent lying. In that place he hath no such words, but rather teacheth contrary. Likewise doth he belye <hi>Luther,</hi> affirming, <hi>that he teacheth the Church to be inuisible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 296.</hi> and 297. he saith, <hi>that we doubt, that the Church is fayled,</hi> and that <hi>Master Foxe contradicteth former writers, and that we hold, that all is not true, which the Church held.</hi> But we make no doubt, but that <hi>Parsons</hi> doth grossely lye and faine. For neither do we say that the vniuersall Church faileth, or so erreth, that none holdeth the truth, nor doth <hi>Master Foxe</hi> either so teach, or contradict former authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call writers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 308.</hi> he telleth vs, how <hi>the Centuriasts Centur. 3. ca. 4. reprehend Cyprian sharply for speaking of offring sacrifice.</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:21479:74"/>
But he abuséth his reader, and mistaketh the whole matter. For they do not mislike him for speaking of offring sacrifice, but for attributing too much to the priest. In the same place, thinking that he hath found out a lease of priests, <hi>Lo heere,</hi> saith <hi>Parsons, three massing priests,</hi> and yet is there not one word in that place of the Masse. True it is, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> speaketh of a sacrifice, but his sacrifice was not the massing popish sacrifice, but a sacrifice of thankesgiuing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 310.</hi> he saith, <hi>that Constantine built 4. goodly Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches within the city of Rome, caried earth to their first founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and adorned them with Images:</hi> Thrée lyes no where found, but in the fabulous legends calculated by Friers and Masse-priests vnder the shadow of a glasse of wine. Nay the legends themselues are not so false, as <hi>Parsons</hi> his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of <hi>Three Conuersions.</hi> For they place <hi>S. Pauls</hi> Church without <hi>Rome,</hi> whereas he by his cunning masonry hath placed it in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 316.</hi> he chargeth vs with <hi>Symbolizing with the Manicheyes.</hi> But if to agrée with heretikes is to symbolize with them, then doth <hi>Parsons</hi> symbolize with heretikes. We do anathematize both the <hi>Manicheyes,</hi> and all other heretikes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 318.</hi> and 319. he telleth diuers lyes of the <hi>Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riasts,</hi> making them to condemne diuers Fathers <hi>for inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Angels:</hi> whereas it doth not appeare, that either those Fathers which are there mentioned prayed to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, or that the <hi>Centuriasts</hi> do simply condemne them for writing as they did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 354.</hi> he saith <hi>Charles the great was made Emperour of the West by Leo the third,</hi> which is a ridiculous and vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious lye. For next to God, his owne sword, and the consent of the people of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> made him Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of that countrey, the rest of his Empire he had by his owne right. As for <hi>Leo the third</hi> he had nothing to giue, but only by certaine ceremonyes was appointed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Emperours titles, and the peoples voluntary sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</p>

                  <hi>Pag. 373.</hi> he giueth out, that the sixth generall Councell was called by Pope <hi>Agatho.</hi> But vnlesse he bring proofe, it will appeare, that he is nothing scrupulous in giuing out lyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 378.</hi> he saith, the Councell of <hi>Laterane</hi> vnder <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent the third</hi> was holden <hi>an. 1115.</hi> But he miscounteth a hundred yeares, as his own Chroniclers may informe him. He saith also, <hi>that all Councels were holden by order of the Bishop of Rome, and confirmed by him, and none held for law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full without his confirmation.</hi> But these are matters méerely forged. For first, not the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours called the first generall Councels. <hi>Secondly,</hi> albeit the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> should haue withstood them, yet should their acts haue passed, neither néeded these Councels any confirmation from the Bishop of <hi>Rome. Thirdly,</hi> diuers things passed in the sixt Councell of <hi>Aphrike,</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and the <hi>sixt Synode</hi> maugre the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> albeit yet a Bishop, and not the head of Antichrists kingdome, as the Pope prooued afterward. To conclude, lyes are as rife with <hi>Parsons,</hi> as lice were in <hi>Aegypt, when they came vpon man and beast,</hi> as we reade <hi>Exod. 8.</hi>

               <p>HE is a simple Fencer, that hurteth himselfe with his owne weapons, and in the common opinion of men they are accounted vnwise, that bring forth furniture into the field, that doth better serue the enemy, then themselues. Yet this is the wisdome of <hi>Parsons</hi> throughout his discourse. The point of his allegations doth commonly serue to pierce himselfe, and no better allegations néede we then those, which he bringeth to ouerthrow that cause, which he defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. In his Epistle Dedicatory he alledgeth these words
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:21479:75"/>
out of the <hi>Psalme 118. Pax multa diligentibus legem tuam, &amp; non est illis scandalum.</hi> But what could be leuelled more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly against the cause of Papists? For <hi>first</hi> they regard not holy Scriptures, nor the law of God. <hi>Next</hi> their whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence is in the Pope, and in his dispensations and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences. <hi>Thirdly</hi> they séeke not for peace, but with warres and seditions trouble the Christian world. No maruell therefore, if the whole world be scandalized by the Popes, Cardinals, Monks, Friers, and their superstitions, idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, barbarous cruelties, perfidious dealing &amp; wickednes.</p>
               <p>In his Preface he citeth <hi>S. Augustine de morib. Eccles. Cath. c. 17.</hi> and <hi>Chrysostome homil. 14. inc. 24. Matth.</hi> but both make against him. <hi>Crassas omnino mentes, &amp; corporeorum simulachro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum pestifero pastu morbidas ad diuina iudicanda defertis,</hi> saith that holy Father, and so we may likewise say to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists. <hi>You bring with you grosse minds, and distempred with the pestilent norriture of materiall images to iudge of diuine matters.</hi> And this is the reason, why they worship Saints, and other creatures, and make grosse similitudes of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and diuine persons. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> speaketh of Christian Religion, and not of the Popes monarchy, or of the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous popish Masse, or of Purgatory, or Indulgences, or such popish trash.</p>

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>of Saint Matthew</hi> he citeth Christs words, foretelling, that false Prophets should arise and say, <hi>lo here is Christ, or there is Christ.</hi> But this text doth directly prooue the Masse-priests to be false Prophets and seducers. For one saith, <hi>lo here is Christ</hi> pointing to this Altar, or that Crucifixe; another pointing to another Pixe or Crucifixe saith, <hi>lo there is Christ. Chrysostome</hi> is alledged <hi>homil. 43. operis imperfect. in Matth.</hi> as speaking against men <hi>negligent in trying out the truth of doctrine.</hi> Yet will not popish pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates permit Christians to heare Scriptures publikely read in vulgar tongues, nor do they giue liberty to <hi>Christians</hi> to iudge of the false doctrine of Masse-priests and Friers. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally they do not like, that Christians should be too busy in trying out the truth, &amp; in disputing of matters of Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:21479:76"/>
He telleth vs further, <hi>that many of our country this day perswade themselues, that either matters of religion perteine not greatly vnto them, or that they go well as they are.</hi> But if this be a fault, then are the <hi>Papists</hi> herein most faulty. For in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spayne</hi> they are forbidden to talke of matters of Religion, as things perteining to Priests and Friers, and doubt not, but that the Pope and his Cardinals together with inferior Prelates haue ordred all this businesse excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well. And this is the error of all the Popes puppy followers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ambrose</hi> is there alledged to shew, <hi>that God will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued on his word. What indignity were it,</hi> saith he, <hi>lib. 1. de Abraham ca. 3. if beleeuing the testimonies of men concerning others, we shall not beleeue the oracles of God concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himselfe?</hi> Do not then Papists offer a great indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to God, that will not beléeue Scriptures to be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall, vnlesse the Pope and Romish Church do tell them so?</p>
               <p>These words <hi>Iohn 5. verse 44. How can ye beleeue, which receiue honor one of another, and seeke not the honor that commeth of God alone?</hi> And that which is said by <hi>Parsons</hi> concerning <hi>pious affection, required as a key to open the gate to true faith,</hi> most fitly may be applied against <hi>Parsons</hi> and his consorts, for they seeke for glory one of another, and all for preferment from the Pope and Cardinals. They séeke also the honor of Angels and Saints. But neither do they seeke for Gods glory alone, nor do they desire so much the prayse of God, as of men. Further how can they pretend pious affection, and the keyes to open the gate to true faith, when by fraud, treachery, violence and bloody massacres of Christians they séeke to mainteine not the faith, but heresie; not the truth of Christ, but the false and erroneous doctrine of Antichrist? Lastly, <hi>Parsons,</hi> where he maketh pious affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction a key to open the gate to true faith, sheweth himselfe either impious in placing piety before true faith, or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, that with <hi>Pelagius</hi> supposeth a man may be pious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith, by force of fréewill.</p>

                  <hi>Pag. 9.</hi> for proofe of the sacrifice of the Masse he bringeth a testimony out of <hi>Irenaeus, lib. 4. aduers. haeres. ca. 32.</hi> which quite ouerthroweth the popish sacrifice of the Masse. For there he speaketh of the sacrifice of Christians, and calleth it <hi>primitias creaturarum, the first fruites of Gods creatures.</hi> But the Papists in their Masse suppose, that the Priest offereth not the first fruites of Gods creatures, but the very body and blood of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 14.</hi> he standeth much vpon the testimonies of <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, Nicephorus, Theodoret,</hi> and <hi>Sophronius,</hi> which name di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers that preached the Gospell in <hi>Britaine.</hi> But all this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the ouerthrow of <hi>Parsons</hi> his discourse, who in that place vndertaketh to proue, that <hi>S. Peter</hi> and not other prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers did first conuert the <hi>Britans</hi> to the Christian faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 59.</hi> he sheweth how <hi>Wilfride</hi> conuerted the <hi>Southsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xons,</hi> which is as far from his purpose, as the North from the South. For in all this dispute he vndertaketh to prooue, that the <hi>Britans</hi> were first conuerted to the Christian faith by <hi>Romans,</hi> and not by Frenchmen or <hi>Britans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 67.</hi> out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> he goeth about to prooue, that <hi>Blastus</hi> was condemned as an heretike, for that priuily with his obseruance of Easter he sought to bring in <hi>ludaisine.</hi> And <hi>Pag. 73.</hi> he affirmeth, that <hi>Constantine</hi> did authorize and publish the decrées of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell. Both which points directly make against our aduersaries. For while they rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously stand vpon the obseruance of Easter, and offer paschal lambs, they do after a sort renew and call back into vse the ceremonies of the <hi>Iewes;</hi> and while they ascribe to the Pope all authority to confirme and publish the acts of Councels, they do abrogate the authority of Christian Princes in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of Antichrist.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 97.</hi> he alledgeth diuers texts and testimonies to proue that temporall Princes <hi>are Gods vicars and substitutes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their realmes.</hi> But if that be so, then the Pope is the diuels substitute, and vicar of hell, that oftentimes goeth about to remoue Gods substitutes from their gouernment, and to kill them.</p>

                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:21479:77"/>
                  <hi>Pag. 106. S. Augustine lib. 4. de Baptism. c. 24.</hi> is produced as a witnesse, to proue, that <hi>what the vniuersall Church doth hold, and euer hath held, and was not instituted by Councels, hath come from the Apostles.</hi> But this witnesse ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the whole cause of popery, if he may be credited. For neither the doctrine of the Popes vniuersall monarchy in the visible Church and in Purgatory, nor of the popish sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in honor of Saints and Angels, and for the benefit of quick and dead, nor of the worship of images, nor the rest of the vnwritten traditions of the Romish Church haue béen alwayes held by the vniuersall Church, nor are at this day held by the same. Further it is manifest, that the worship of images was first established in the second Councell of <hi>Nice;</hi> and the doctrine of transubstantiation and auricular confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> vnder <hi>Innocent</hi> the third; the carnall reall presence in a Councell at <hi>Rome</hi> vnder <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> the 2. and other popish heresies in the Councels of <hi>Constance, Florence,</hi> and <hi>Trent.</hi> Are they not then ashamed to call their traditions Apostolicall?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 145.</hi> he alledgeth an Epistle of <hi>Ignatius ad Heronem,</hi> where he saith, <hi>Virgines custodi tanquam sacramenta Christi.</hi> But this ouerthroweth the practise of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, which is nothing curious in kéeping of these Sacraments, nor so watchfull in looking to them, but that they are often gotten with child by the Masse-priests, Monks and Friers. Furthermore this sheweth, that there are more Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts then 7. which no Papist dare affirme, vnlesse he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the thundring curse of the connenticle of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 159.</hi> he reherseth an Epistle of <hi>Gregory</hi> condemning them that worship stocks or stones. Do we then thinke that either <hi>Gregory</hi> or <hi>Austin</hi> did conuert the <hi>English</hi> to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of these things? He doth also wickedly translate <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories</hi> Epistle, leauing out these words, <hi>à Germaniarum Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copis,</hi> which conteine a contradiction to the words of <hi>Bede,</hi> who saith, that <hi>Austin</hi> was ordred by a French Bishop, and not a German Bishop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 229.</hi> he alledgeth these words of <hi>Augustine epist. 165.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21479:77"/>
in illum ordinem Episcoporum &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>If any traytor should haue crept into that order of Roman Bishops, it should not haue preiudiced the Church of God, or innocent Christians.</hi> But he cutteth off the middest of the sentence, and some words in the latter end, least that holy Fathers opinion might appeare too cléerely. And yet it appeareth thereby suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, that <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops may be false traytors, and that the succession of the Popes is no marke of the Church, seeing <hi>Augustine</hi> doth say, the Church may stand, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their falshood and trecherie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 280.</hi> he citeth the words of <hi>Irenaeus lib. 4. aduers. hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. c. 4.</hi> commending <hi>Succession with the gift of truth.</hi> What is then the bare succession of Popes, or Turkes without truth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 295.</hi> he confesseth, <hi>That the truth of this question, whether this or that be the true Church, is a matter of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi> Out of this grant therefore we conclude, that we cannot discerne with our eyes, which is the true Church, nor know it by the succession of Popes, or such like sensible markes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 307.</hi> He produceth the example of <hi>S. Laurence dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing the cup of Christs bloud from the altar.</hi> Do not the Masse-priests therefore shame to drinke all alone, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to dispense the cup from the Lords table?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 360.</hi> He alledgeth diuers orders concerning doctrine, life, and the ceremonies of the Church. But all are repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the ceremonies of the <hi>Romish</hi> Synagogue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 372.</hi> He telleth vs, how the Gospell was laid in the midst of Bishops sitting in Councell. But this sheweth, that matters there ought to be decided by the word of God, and not by the Popes Decretals.</p>
               <p>Finally, he sheweth <hi>pag. 475.</hi> out of <hi>S. Augustines 48. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle ad Vincentium,</hi> that the Church is sometime <hi>shadowed and obscured:</hi> which plainely ouerthroweth the Popish do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning the illustrious and perpetuall visibilitie of the Church of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then any simple Papist heretofore haue bene seduced
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:21479:78"/>
by this fabulous discourse of <hi>Rob. Parsons,</hi> to beleeue, that the inhabitants of this land haue bene thrice conuerted to that faith, which now is professed at <hi>Rome,</hi> or to giue credit to the hereticall doctrine of the <hi>Romanists;</hi> let him reforme his opinion, and beware how he admit such trifling bookes, wherein Scriptures are so wickedly abused, and Fathers so corruptly alledged, and lyes so commonly interlaced. And if he loue <hi>Rob. Parsons;</hi> let him admonish him hereafter, to haue more care what he writeth, and to desist from wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting and abusing Scriptures, from falsisying and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the testimonie of Fathers, from <hi>Thrasonicall</hi> bragging, and yet beggarly crauing matters in controuersie, from his impious spéeches against God, and disloyall termes against his Prince, and finally from lying, slandering and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent babling. Otherwise as his faults and errors appeare many and grieuous: so it will manifestly appeare, that it is Gods iudgement, that so wicked a cause should be defended so weakly, leudly, and wickedly. God giue him grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent him of his inueterate malice against true Christians, and confirme all Christians in the truth, that they giue no eare to the fabulous tales, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of such leud, wicked, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious companions.</p>

            <p>The 2. Chapter sheweth, what we are to thinke of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Conuersion of <hi>Lucius</hi> King of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> to Christian Religion by <hi>Eleutherius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> and his Agents.</p>
            <p>The 3. Chapter resolueth vs of <hi>Austin</hi> the Monkes coming into <hi>England,</hi> and of his preaching and proceeding here.</p>
            <p>In the 4. Chapter is proued, that the moderne doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which the Church of <hi>England</hi> reiecteth, was either oppugned by <hi>S. Peter, Eleutherius, Gregory,</hi> and <hi>Austin,</hi> or at the least vnknowne vnto them.</p>
            <p>The 5. Chapter conteineth a briefe answer to <hi>Parsons</hi> his fond and friuolous discourse, wherein desperatly he vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to proue, that the faith now professed in <hi>Rome,</hi> is the same and no other, then was taught by <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> and <hi>Gregory,</hi> in time past.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The 7. Chapter bringeth euident demonstrations, that the late Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> haue deserued nothing of <hi>England,</hi> or the <hi>English</hi> nation, but hatred and detestation.</p>
            <p>The 8. Chapter containeth proofes concluding, that the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> of this time are not the successors of <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> but rather of Pope <hi>Ioane.</hi>

The 9. Chapter sheweth, that the succession of <hi>Romish</hi> Popes is neither marke of the Church, nor meane of triall of the truth.</p>
            <p>The 10. Chapter proueth the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be the true Church of God, and to hold the Apostolike and true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith.</p>
            <p>The 11. Chapter refuteth <hi>Parsons</hi> his idle discourse Part. 2. of his Treatise, wherein he pretendeth to seeke for the originall and descent of the Church of <hi>England</hi> from the Apostles times downward.</p>
            <p>The 12. Chapter sheweth, that the moderne Church of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists was not visible in the world for more then a thousand yeares after Christ, and neuer was fully setled, nor plainely vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chap. 13. therein is declared how litle conscience <hi>Parsons</hi> maketh, to wrest and corrupt holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>The 14. Chapter containeth a catalogue of diuers falsifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, false allegations, and corruptions of the Fathers of the Church, and other authors, committed by <hi>Parsons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 15. Chapter exhibiteth certaine examples of <hi>Parsons</hi> his <hi>Thrasonicall</hi> bragges, and beggarly crauing of matters in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
            <p>The 16. Chapter alledgeth arguments of <hi>Parsons</hi> his grosse ignorance, and childish fooleries.</p>
            <p>The 17. Chapter containeth a Table of certaine speeches of <hi>Parsons,</hi> in respect of God, blasphemous, in respect of his duty to his Prince, disloyall.</p>
