         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ENTLEMEN, there was neuer Author
nor practiſed Gunner euer able (as I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded)
to deſcribe at full, or could shew per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
the efficacie and force that Gunpowder
is able to accomplish, it being a mixture of
ſuch a wonderfull operation and effect, as by dayly experience
we find. And although diuerſe men in diuerſe ages, haue
inuented diuerſe engines and Ordinance for offenſiue and
defenſiue ſeruices by Gunpowder to be perfourmed, yet none
hath nor could euer attaine to that full perfection, to know
preciſely what ſtraunge effects the ſaid mixture is able to
worke. Alſo diuers learned men haue inuented many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
rules pertaining to the Art of Gunnerrie, and a great
many of them haue and do erre in the principals of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions:
and the cauſe is, for want of due practiſe therein.
For the Art of Gunnery doth require great practiſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
to declare the rare ſecrets thereof; which is not for
meane men to attaine to, for that the charges is great.</p>
            <p>And albeit, I am the leaſt able of a great many to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
matter in hand, pertaining to the ſame Art, being but a
ſworne ſcholler thereto, and my abilitie far vnable to put in
practiſe that I would: yet becauſe I haue ſerued a prentize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
twiſe told ſince I tooke my oth, and neuer hearing of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that hath compiled any Arithmeticall rules or ſecrets
(which is the fountaine head from whence all Arts or ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
do ſpring) into one volume, I thought it my part and duty
(according to my skill) to do the best I could therein, for the
<pb facs="tcp:16860:5"/>
benefit of others, and that in the plaineſt maner I could, that
ſuch as are not well ſeene in numbers Art, might the ſooner
vnderſtand the ſame. And albeit I haue herein shewed but a
few Arithmeticall concluſions belonging to the Art of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerie,
yet the experienced Gunner or skilfull Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
by theſe few may deuiſe a great many moe, for ſeruice
offenſiue and defenſiue, by Arithmeticke and Geometrie to
be performed. All which concluſions (gentle Readers) I haue
thought beſt to frame in eaſie queſtions, shewing the anſwers
or reſolutions thereof. And although they be but meanly fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
I hope you will accept the ſame in good part, the rather,
for that they are a yong Gunners practiſes. And if there be
ought herein that may profit you, yeeld me your friendly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
I craue no more: or if in any place I haue erred, either
gently correct it, or paſse it with ſilence, or in friendly ſort ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
me thereof, I deſerue no leſſe.</p>
            <p>There is a great many that can ſpie a mote in another mans
eye, that had neede to haue a beame pulled from their owne:
ſome wil ſcan verie curiouſly, and ſooner find two faults then
amend one. If you be of that mind (friendly readers) I mind
not to make you my iudges.</p>
            <p>The widowes mite was aſwell accepted as the gifts of the
wealthie. A ſouldier in Alexanders campe, in the dry deſert
preſented the king his helmet full of cold water, ſaying, if I
could haue gotten better drinke, your Grace should haue had
part: the which the king gently accepted and liberally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,
anſwering, I wey not thy gift, but thy willing mind.
But I ſeeke no reward for my trauell, but onely you will wey
my mind is willing to do my countrey good, and to profite the

proceedeth of Geometricall progreſſion. The pounds to
be weighed, are wayed with as many namelike weights,
to be done either double or three-fold, ſometime by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
one weight to another, and ſometimes by taking
away and adding to the contrary ballance. Example in a
double reſpect: All termes to 15 are weighed with 4
weights of pounds: as, 1. 2. 4. 8. ſo in a triple reſpect, all
pounds to 40 may be weighed with 4 weights, as 1. 3. 9.
27. All pounds from 1 to 364 are to be weighed with
theſe 6 weights, 1. 3. 9. 27. 81. 243. and ſo infinitely.</p>

            <head>How to finde the cubicall radix or

            <p>AS in my booke of the Art of warre, entituled Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticall
militarie concluſions, I began with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
of ſquare rootes, being a ſpeciall rule to worke
diuerſe feats belonging to the ſayd Art: So in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
I haue thought beſt to begin &amp; ſhew how to extract
Cubicke rootes, for that diuerſe concluſions are to be
done by the ſayd rule, in the worke following letting
paſſe all former rules, as leſſe neceſſarie, the which are
commonly knowne to euery child, that hath any ſight in
the Art of numbring.</p>
            <p>To finde the radix or roote cubicall of any number,
you muſt note how many figures or numbers be in the
totall ſumme thereof, and then as is ſhewed in the rule
how to extract the ſquare root of any number, you make
a pricke or point vnder euery other number, beginning
at the firſt number towards your right hand: euen ſo in
this rule, in ſearching for the cubicall roote of any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
you muſt put a prick vnder the firſt number towards
your right hand, and ſo increaſe your number of prickes,
vnder euery third number, towards your left hand, and
your quotient will containe ſo many figures as there be
prickes.</p>
            <p>If your number propounded be cubicall, multiplie
your quotient cubically, the product of that multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will be the number that was propounded.</p>
            <p>To multiply cubically, you muſt do as this example
ſheweth. 5 multiplied in himſelfe is 25, which 25 mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied
againe by 5, makes 125, and is a cubick number.</p>
            <p>A cubicall figure, is proportioned as theſe figures

ſheweth, for a cube is a ſolide body of ſixe equal ſquares

it is requiſite to make knowne to the Reader, how

the range or flight of the bullet out of any one peece
of Ordinance knowne, they will or can tell the vtmoſt
range of all other, thinking that the range of the bullet
out of any one peece, ſhould be proportionall to the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
and charge of powder out of any other peece. Alſo
ſome do affirme, that out of any one peece of Ordinance
diſcharged with ſundry quantities of powder, they can
tell the vtmoſt range of the bullets diſcharged; and
their reaſon is, that the range of thoſe bullets ſhall be
proportionall to the weight of powder wherewith they
were charged. And hereupon ſome haue giuen out rules
which are falſe and full of errors: for the diuerſity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
cannot by the plaine rule of proportion be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued,

one peece of Ordinance charged with one and the ſame

the neare difference or ranges of the bullets, the
peece being mounted or diſmounted at any degree of

other meaſure any peece will reach at point blanke, by
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:16860:30"/>
knowing the point blanke and vtmoſt range of another
peece of Ordinance, they may find the furtheſt range of
the firſt. Or contrariwiſe, by knowing the vtmoſt range

of another peece, they may find out the point blanke of
that other peece, as by the rules following ſhalbe proued.</p>
               <p>And it is to be noted that any peece of Ordinance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mounted to the beſt of the randon or higheſt degree
of the quadrant, the mouth and hollow cilinder of the

ſhoote as far at the 5 point, or at 41, 42, or 43 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
according as the winde is of calmeneſſe, for if any

            <head>How to make a table of randons, or go very neare to know the
true range of the bullet out of all ſorts of peeces, being
mounted from degree to degree.</head>
            <p>Many Authors haue taught how to make a table of
randons, whereas ſome of them neuer ſhot in any peece
of Ordinance in their liues. And for aſmuch as I find
their writing and reaſons differing, I thinke it will be
a very hard matter to make a perfect table of randons, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the ſame be tried and experimented with ſome
peece of Ordinance in ſome conuenient ground. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
heard nor reade of any that hath as yet fully put the
ſame in practiſe, the which would be much auailable to
euery Gunner, to know what euery peece would do at
the mount of euery degree or point in the quadrant, the
motion or range of the bullet being ſomething variable
at the mount of euery degree. You ſhall very neare find
out the true range or randon of the bullet ſhot out of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
peece of Ordinance, the peece mounted at any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of randon, as thus:</p>
            <p>Charge your peece with her due loading, in powder,
ſhot and wad, laying the peece at point blanke, which
you may eaſily try, by putting the rule of the quadra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into
the peece mouth, &amp; coyning the peece at the breech, ſo
as the plu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>met may cut the quadrant in the line of leuell,
as you ſee in the firſt figure hereafter drawne, that peece
lyeth point blanke: which done giue fire, &amp; marke where
the bullet firſt grazeth, after bring your peece to the
ſame platforme, ſo as the wheeles and cariage ſtand nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
higher nor lower then they did the firſt ſhoote: and
being charged with one &amp; the ſelfe like quantity in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
bullet &amp; wad as before, the peece being of like te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>per
raiſe her mouth one degree, as the ſecond figure ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16860:34"/>
diſcharge her, and marke where the pellet falleth or
grazeth firſt; then meaſure how farre the firſt graze of
the ſecond bullet is beyond the graze of the firſt bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
ſo much will the peece conuey the bullet further at
the mount of euery degree, or very neare thereto. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mounted aboue 20 degrees, ſhe will ſhoote ſhorter
&amp; ſhorter, a litle at the mount of euery degree to the beſt
of the randon, according to the height &amp; circular motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the bullet. If the peece be mounted to the beſt of the
randon, the plummet will cut the 45 degree of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant,
as the 3 figure ſheweth. Or you may make a table
of randons like the other, as thus: Meaſure the diſtance
the peece co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueyeth the bullet at the beſt of the rando<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
which abate the diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the peece co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueyeth her bullet at
point planke, deuide the remaine by 45, the quotient will
ſhew you how far the ſhoote is caried at the mount of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
degree: or deuiding the ſayd remaine by ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
as you would eleuate your peece at, the quotie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wil

in a more circular courſe. And it is to be noted, that any

bullet more ground mounted at 20 degrees, then from

               <p>And it is worthy the noting, that in planting of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to batter or beate downe any curtaine, wall, or
Cullion point, you muſt plant the ſame in 3 or 2 ſeuerall
places at the leaſt, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the thing to be beaten downe; ſo as
the ſaid Ordinance be a pretty diſtance from other, vpon
conuenient platformes, hauing Gabbions or Baskets,
about 8 foote high, ramd full of earth conueniently pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
betweene each peece, to ſaue the Gunners and Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
from the danger of the enemies ſhot: which Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
would be planted within 200 or 240 paces of the
obiect to be ouerthrowne, if it be poſſible to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
platformes and to bring them ſo nigh the ſaid
obiect. The which Ordinance (if ſo you haue made 3
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:16860:44"/>
mounts or platformes, the Ordinance from the 2 ſide
mountes doth coine or cut out that which the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:16860:44"/>
The beſt ſhooting to batter downe the broad ſide or
curtaine of any wall, is to leuell ſomething vnder the
midle part of the wall, and after to ſhoote 2 or 3 foote
higher: for the lower part being beaten downe, the
height or vpper part of the ſaid wall muſt fall of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
And a ſpeciall regard muſt be had to giue fire
from each platforme or mount at one inſtant, for
that the bullets beating all together, do more ſhake
and batter the ſaid wall, then lighting now one and then
another.</p>
               <p>In the figure or draught which I haue drawne
ſhewing how Ordinance may be planted to ding
downe or batter the broade ſide or curtaine of any wall,
Caſtell or Fort, the middle Ordinance placed on
the middle mount or platforme, directlie againſt the
obiect to be beaten downe, are called the peircers,
and are onely to ſhake and beate the wall, and the
Ordinance on the two other ſide mounts, or plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes
ſhooting ſomething ſlanting, are to coyne or
cut out that which the Ordinance from the middle plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
doth ſhake or looſe. The Baskets ramd full of
earth being placed betweene each peece of Ordinance
are to defend the Gunners and Laborers from hurt of
them that are beſieged, as afore I haue ſaid.</p>
               <p>And further it is to be noted, that to batter the
coyne or cullion point of any wall, two places is
ſufficient to plant your Ordinance in. Alſo you may
batter and beate downe the wall of a Towne or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell
as well by night as day, ſo as the enemie ſhall
haue no time to builde vp in the night that which

a perfect ſtreight line, except you ſhoote the ſame either
directly vpright towards the zeneth of the skie, or elſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
plumme downe towards the center of the earth.</p>
            <p>The right line of the vtmoſt randon in all peeces, is
more then the right line of the leuell range; and the right
line of the vtmoſt range, is not ſo much as the right line
of 90 degrees.</p>
            <p>The vtmoſt range in all ſorts of peeces, is not at iuſt
45 degrees of randon, as <hi>Tartallia</hi> and diuerſe others do
affirme, but ſhooting with the wind in a quiet or calme
day, is at or about 45 degrees, but the wind againſt, or
on any ſide, or rough, or the aire thicke, &amp;c. will range as
farre at or about 40 degrees.</p>
            <p>Two peeces in all reſpects equall ſaue onely in length,
diſcharged with a like quantity in powder, wad, &amp; bullet,
and ſhot at a marke within the reach of both peeces,
mounted at like degrees of randon with the quadrant, the
ſhorter peece ſhall outſhoote the longer.</p>
            <p>The right lines made by any 2 peeces at one degree of
randon diſcharged, are proportionall to the ranges of
their bullets at the ſame degrees of randon, and the right
lines made by any 2 peeces at any randon, are propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
to their vtmoſt ranges.</p>
            <p>Any peece of Ordinance firſt diſcharged with the
whole weight of the bullet in Serpentine powder, &amp; after

diſcharged with ½ the weight of her bullet, in ſuch corne
powder as ſhall cauſe the peece to range the ſame

of the peece be all alike.</p>
            <p>Three peeces in all reſpects equall, ſaue euery one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds

            <p>A peece twiſe charged, firſt with an yron bullet fit for

weight, but differing in height, and with one and the like
quantity in powder and wad, at either time the yron bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let

            <p>A peece diſcharged firſt with an yron bullet, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

diſcharged with the weight of the bullet in Serpentine

            <p>A peece twiſe diſcharged at like degree of randon,
firſt with an yron, and then with a leaden bullet, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
diſcharged with any other quantity of powder, the
ranges of the bullets ſhall not retaine the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
            <p>If 2 peeces of one length but differing in bore, the
one diſcharged with an yron, the other with a leaden bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
at one like randon, hauing the weight of either bullet
in courſe powder, do range both alike ground, and
the ſayd peeces after diſcharged with halfe the weight of
their bullets, of the ſame or any other powder, ſhall not
range one like diſtance of ground.</p>
            <p>Two peeces of one mettall and length, but of different
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:16860:61"/>
bullets equally mounted, diſcharged with any like quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of one powder, ſhall not range iuſtly one diſtance of
ground.</p>
            <p>The proportion of the different ranges, that yron and
leaden bullets make, being found by experience in any
one peece of Ordinance, the ſame proportion will not
hold in all other peeces of Ordinance of contrary length,
that ſhootes the ſame like bullet.</p>
            <p>Any peece of Ordinance being thicker of mettall on
the one ſide then on the other, diſcharged at a marke, will
caſt the bullet towards that ſide, that is thickeſt of mettall.</p>
            <p>Two peeces of contrary length, but of like diameter,
hauing both one like charge, being ſhot off at a marke
within the reach of both peeces giuing leuell with an inch
rule, at one like height of the rule, ſhall make ſeuerall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes,
the ſhorter peece ſhall outſhoote the longer.</p>
            <p>Any peece of Ordinance will conuey the bullet more
ground, her mouth eleuated at 18 or 20 degrees, then
from the ſayd grades to the beſt of the randon, although
there be 7 degrees vantage in the latter.</p>
            <p>Any peece of Ordinance hauing her due loading will
conuey the bullet more then fiue times the diſtance of her
